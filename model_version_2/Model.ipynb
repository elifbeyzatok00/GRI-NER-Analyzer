Certainly, 2021 did not draw us out of the COVID-19 pandemic as we had  hoped: our economy and communities unfortunately continue to struggle  with the outbreak’s lingering impacts. Our mission to tackle environmental,  social, and political challenges has therefore never been clearer.  I am proud to say that Henkel has taken further bold action in 2021, for  which we were once again recognized by key sustainability ratings.  Despite the challenging environment, we remained resilient and resolute  in our commitment to embed sustainability into the heart of our business.  We advanced commitments to becoming a climate-positive company  by converting the first of many sites to climate-neutral production. We  reduced waste by using more recycled packaging material with help from  partners like Plastic Bank, which turns plastic waste into Social Plastic®  for product packaging. And we elevated sustainable financing by  launching a “Sustainable Finance Framework,” tying company financing  to transparent ESG criteria.  Beyond this, we also reinvigorated our culture by defining a new com- pany purpose: Pioneers at heart for the good of generations. It is built  from our roots and carries our long-standing legacy of innovation,  responsibility, and sustainability into the future. This lies at the center  of Henkel’s strategic framework “Purposeful Growth,” our formula for  success in the current decade. With these achievements in mind, we also spent the last year developing  our sustainability strategy – how can we be faster, bolder, and go further?  We want to drive the sustainability transformation towards a regenerative  planet and thriving communities, acting as a trusted partner to our  stakeholders. We pushed ourselves to define our roadmap beyond our  2025 targets and shape new ambitions for 2030 and beyond.  Looking ahead, we are well prepared: sustainability is deeply anchored  in our business strategy and alive in our purpose. With that foundation,  our sustainable transformation continues – because a true pioneer is never  finished and continuously seeks out the next frontier! On behalf of everyone at Henkel, I would like to thank you for your interest  in our 2021 Sustainability Report.

We occupy globally leading market  positions in our consumer and industrial businesses.  Our Purpose defines the common ground that unites all of us at Henkel:  Pioneers at heart for the good of generations. This spirit is deeply  anchored in our DNA, and it drives our success story of innovation,  responsibility and sustainability into the future. Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA is operationally active as well as being the parent  company of the Henkel Group. In this capacity, it is responsible for  defining and pursuing the company’s goals. It is also responsible for the  management, governance and control systems, including risk manage- ment, as well as the allocation of resources. Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA   performs its responsibilities within the legal scope afforded to it as part  of the Henkel Group, with the affiliated companies otherwise operating  as legally independent entities. Operational management and control is  the responsibility of the Management Board of Henkel Management AG  in its function as sole Personally Liable Partner. The Management Board  is supported in this by the central corporate functions.  Henkel is organized into three operational business units: Adhesive  Technologies, Beauty Care, and Laundry &amp; Home Care.  Adhesive Technologies offers a broad and globally leading portfolio of  high-impact solutions in adhesives, sealants and functional coatings.  The business unit is composed of four business areas: Automotive &amp;  Metals, Packaging &amp; Consumer Goods, Electronics &amp; Industrials, and  Craftsmen, Construction &amp; Professional.  The Beauty Care business unit is globally active in the consumer goods  business area with hair cosmetics, body care, skin care and oral care  products. It is also active in the professional hair salon business world- wide. We hold leading positions in numerous markets and categories  in both business areas.  The Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit occupies leading market positions  in both its Laundry and Home Care business areas. Our product portfolio  ranges from heavy-duty and specialty detergents, laundry additives,  dishwashing products, hard surface and WC cleaners, to air fresheners  and insect control products.  The business activities of our three business units are supported by the  central functions of Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA, our Global Supply Chain  organization and our Global Business Solutions organization, with its  Shared Service Centers. This enables the optimum utilization of corporate  network synergies.  Implementation of the business activities at the country and regional  level is the responsibility of the national affiliated companies. Their  operations are supported and coordinated by regional centers. The   executive bodies of these national affiliates manage their businesses  in line with the relevant statutory regulations, supplemented by their  own articles of association, internal procedural rules and the principles  incorporated in our globally applicable management standards, codes  and guidelines. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  06 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE BUSINESS MODEL VALUE ADDED STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  VALUE ADDED Henkel’s innovative products and solutions create value in its business  units for its stakeholders – across the entire value chain. We operate  174 production sites in 56 countries worldwide, invest in research and  development, maintain close cooperation with our suppliers, and con- tribute to economic development in our target markets. As an employer,  we  create jobs in industrial countries, as well as in emerging and devel- oping economies, and we generate purchasing power through wages  and  salaries. The taxes and levies we pay help to finance communities  and support public infrastructure. Value added statement 2021  The value added statement shows that most of the generated sales flow  back into the global economy. The largest share of the value added –  60.2 percent – went to our employees in the form of salary and pension  benefits. Central and local governments received 9.8 percent in the  form of tax revenues; lenders received 1.6 percent in the form of interest  income. We distributed 13.9 percent of the value added as dividends to  our shareholders. The value added remaining in the company is available  for investments in future growth.

This makes us an important local employer and business partner.  The issue of the social added value of products is especially important in  emerging markets. Products that are geared to the needs of lower income  groups have more than just economic potential. They also make positive  contributions to social well-being, for example to hygiene and health in  the home. In order to meet needs that differ greatly around the world, we  pursue different strategies depending on the market situation.

STRATEGY  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  09  SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY  Responsibility for people, planet and society Our corporate purpose defines the common ground that unites all of us at  Henkel: Pioneers at heart for the good of generations. With our pioneering  spirit, our knowledge, our products and technologies, we want to enrich  and improve the lives of billions every day and shape a viable future for  the next generations. Sustainable business practices have been an integral  part of our    company culture for decades, and are also a central element  of our vision of the future.  Our sustainability strategy is inspired by our purpose. We will actively  drive the transformation to a sustainable economy and society, help to  protect and regenerate the natural environment, contribute to strong  communities and to strengthen trust with our stakeholders. Together with innovation and digitalization, sustainability is at the  heart of our corporate strategy (   “Purposeful Growth” agenda) to shape  competitive edge and enable us to grow our company and create value  for our customers, consumers and all of our stakeholders. Transformation towards sustainable development At Henkel, we see sustainability as a constant endeavor to make progress  on present topics and keep learning about new issues, based on scientific  knowledge. Global climate change is one of the greatest challenges  humanity is facing today, requiring urgent and ambitious action. It is  also critical to protect and regenerate life-support systems like forests,  water and  biodiversity, for present and future generations. At the same  time, we are seeing global poverty and social inequality increase, in part  because of the COVID-19 pandemic. And in the process, we acknowledge  that companies like Henkel play a role in meeting these challenges and  bringing about transformational change.  “ Our corporate purpose  describes our ambition to  act for the good of present  and future generations.   With the help of our new  sustainability strategy, we  will accelerate our trans­ formation and evolve our   portfolio and processes   even more strongly towards  sustainability.” CARSTEN KNOBEL Chair of the Management Board HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  10 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY MATERIAL ISSUES TARGETS AND AMBITIONS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  This is a collective undertaking. For several years now, our customers,  partners and consumers have expressed an increasing interest in   sustainability-oriented products and solutions. They are looking to  understand and track sustainability contributions along the value chain.  Investors are also placing increasing emphasis on the sustainability of  their investments. The issue of corporate responsibility is gaining further  importance in media reporting, as is the discussion of sustainability  issues on public platforms such as social networks. In addition, at the  political level, we have seen great progress toward a shared understanding  of global priorities over the past few years, most notably the global   climate agreement in Paris in 2015 and the climate summit in Glasgow in  2021, as well as the    17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Global  awareness of issues such as climate change, the circular economy,  human rights, and the management of water and biodiversity are on the  rise. This underscores the urgency of a comprehensive transformation  towards sustainable development.  We will build on our particular strengths, such as the innovation of our  business units, the outstanding knowledge of our employees, as well as  various contact points of our products and technologies with customers  and consumers. We see our company as an important player and partner  in society, and we intend to work with others to create fundamental change. Three dimensions of our strategy Building on our previous strategy, we developed our → 2030+ Sustain- ability Ambition Framework in 2021 encompassing three dimensions:   • Regenerative Planet: We want to enable a circular and net-zero carbon  future by transforming our business, products and raw materials  underpinned by science and innovation.  • Thriving Communities: We want to help people lead a better life  through the collective strength of our business and brands by   supporting equity, education and wellbeing.  • Trusted Partner: We want to drive performance and systems change  with integrity through our values-based culture, deep rooting in science  and our passion for technology.

We  create more value for our customers and consumers by constantly  innovating to offer  better performance with a reduced ecological foot- print.  • People are the focal point for our business and our sustainability-  related activities. This includes our employees, who contribute to   sustainable development – through their expertise in daily work and  in their private lives. It also includes the people in our supply chain,  our  customers and consumers, our neighbors, our shareholders and  the communities we operate in.  • Partnerships play a decisive role in driving sustainability in our value  chain and beyond. We help our customers and consumers to reduce  their ecological footprint and to use resources responsibly. We work  together with our suppliers to promote sustainable practice and  respect for human rights, and we cooperate with partners to share  knowledge and drive systemic solutions forward together. Our targets and ambitions Our new sustainability strategy revolves around implementing our   ambitions through concrete measures and projects to achieve practical  progress. We will build on the success of recent years and our medium-  term targets for 2025 and beyond, → for which we provide detailed  information in this Sustainability Report. With our → 2030+ Sustainability Ambition Framework, we have developed  new long-term ambitions in the three dimensions of → “Regenerative  Planet,” → “Thriving Communities” and → “Trusted Partner” to drive  further progress.  We have robust plans and investments in place to advance on our sustain- ability transformation. We expect to continue to develop our strategic  framework, responding with agility to stakeholder expectations, new  scientific insights and emerging issues.

HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  13 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY MATERIAL ISSUES TARGETS AND AMBITIONS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  MATERIAL ISSUES  Development of our strategy, targets and  roadmaps for implementation There are numerous challenges and new developments facing society,  and Henkel as a company. These include aspects such as the environment,  employee and social topics, respecting human rights, and combating  corruption and bribery. These topics and others are also reflected in the  international    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For the develop- ment of our sustainability strategy and the definition of the related targets  and ambitions, we engage in dialog with the Management Board and  form working groups that act under the guidance of the → Sustainability  Council. In these groups, we evaluate trends and developments, while  also reviewing the expectations of our stakeholders and analyzing our  environmental footprint along the value chain. Engaging in dialog with stakeholders to gain new perspectives → Dialog with our stakeholders helps us to obtain insights and per- spectives from inside and outside our company, and fosters a common  understanding of expectations and priorities. In 2021, we conducted a  comprehensive survey of our stakeholders. We have also engaged in dialog  with opinion leaders, the professional public, academia, international  rating agencies and analysts for many years. Sustainability analysts and  professional institutions regularly evaluate how companies manage the  economic, environmental and social aspects of their business activities. We  welcome these → external assessments of our sustainability performance,  as they lead to greater transparency in the market and show us how  our performance is assessed. We also consider the assessment criteria  of various financial and sustainability-oriented ratings and the guidelines  of the Global Reporting Initiative (→ GRI). Identifying relevant topics To determine and categorize relevant topics for our business activities  and reporting, we engage in a continuous process of recording and   evaluating the challenges and opportunities of sustainable development  using various tools. We assess the importance of the topics for the   company, environment and society, and also for our stakeholders. When  selecting the topics, we go beyond the definition of materiality included  within the CSR Directive Implementation Act (“CSR-RUG”) in conjunction  with Sections (§§) 289b to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB).  The results of this process can be broken down into the three dimensions  of Regenerative Planet, Thriving Communities and Trusted Partner, each  with three themes that we identified in a materiality analysis. In these  nine topic areas, we want to drive sustainable development around the  world and along the value chain with our business activities.

To assess  our footprint, we use representative → life cycle appraisals across all  product categories. We also assess data on the raw materials and packaging  materials we use, as well as the transport operations.  This enables us to identify hot spots as fields of action that are most   relevant to sustainability for the company as well as for every product  category and specific products on the basis of scientific measurement  methods. Viewed across our entire portfolio, improvements in input  materials and in the use phase are the decisive factors when it comes to  our water and → CO2 footprints. We systematically integrate the assessment tools and findings into our  → innovation process. By combining product performance and quality  with responsibility for people and the environment, we strive for all  of our new products to make a contribution to sustainable development. Definition of targets and roadmaps for implementation  Based on this assessment and our priorities, we have set specific targets  for 2025 and beyond as well as additional long-term ambitions that  will help transform the economy and society toward sustainability.  Engagement with our stakeholders and the broader framework of our  strategy, which was further developed in 2021, have also revealed new  areas of focus that we will work on together. Some of these ambitions,  such as those related to → water resources and → biodiversity, are still in  their early stages, and assessment methods are constantly evolving. We  will work with experts and partners to contribute our experience and  develop coordinated action plans. To implement our strategy, we have  also established → management systems, standards and guidelines, as  well as related processes and organizational structures that provide a  framework for measures to implement these concepts. We continuously  review our targets and roadmaps for implementation, and develop them  further when necessary.

HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  19 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY MATERIAL ISSUES TARGETS AND AMBITIONS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS Achieving the global Sustainable Development  Goals together Henkel supports the implementation of the    17 Sustainable Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) that were adopted by the 193 United Nations Member  States in September 2015. As a company, we are convinced that the goals  provide a shared focus that can empower collaborative action and will  accelerate progress toward sustainability. Sustainable consumption,  packaging and plastics, combating climate change, water, human rights,  equal opportunities and education are important topics for our work.  The following examples highlight our contribution to the implemen- tation of the global development goals and demonstrate the range of our  activities.  By continuously reviewing our companyʼs goals and initiatives, we  ensure that these are aligned with the    SDG priorities that are relevant  for us. Our activities support the SDGs because we have a long history  of working intensively on various aspects of sustainability, as well as  a broad product portfolio and a presence across diverse markets. In the  context of our social commitment, for example, we track the percentage  of projects we support that contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Committed to protecting the climate  In view of the urgent need to reduce CO2 emissions, it is our long-term  vision to become → climate-positive in production by 2030 and to make  progress in further relevant parts of our value chain. On the way, we plan  to achieve a 65-percent reduction in the carbon footprint of our production  by 2025. We also want to obtain 100 percent of our electricity from  renewable sources by 2030. In addition, we want to leverage our → brands  and technologies to help our customers, consumers and suppliers save  100 million metric tons of CO2 in the period from 2016 to 2025. Promoting sustainable   consumption We support the goal of promoting sustainable and resource-efficient   consumption. Our products and technologies are key to this because they  are used in millions of households and industrial processes every day. We  focus on developing products that lead to resource efficiency in everyday  use. We also strive to encourage responsible use of our products through  targeted communication. This is important because the environmental  footprint of many of our products is determined during the use phase.  The    Henkel footprint calculator helps individuals to calculate their  CO2 footprint.

Improving quality of life  With our social engagement activities, we aim to support people around  the globe and improve their quality of life. For example, the volunteer  efforts by our employees have provided support for social projects in   Guatemala, in cooperation with the organization    United Way Worldwide.  The focus is on education, financial stability and health. Our → corporate   citizenship has been an integral part of our corporate culture ever since  the  company was established by Fritz Henkel in 1876. Turning waste into opportunities  It is our continuous ambition to reduce the flow of plastic waste into  nature, especially into the oceans. In 2017, Henkel became the first major  global consumer goods company to work with the social enterprise  → Plastic Bank. In 2019, we extended this partnership for another five  years. The aim is to reduce plastic waste in nature, including the oceans,  while also providing new opportunities for people in poverty – especially  in countries with no or insufficient recycling infrastructure for waste   disposal. We plan to steadily expand this commitment in the coming years.  Promoting sustainable   palm oil As part of our responsibility, we aim to support sustainable practices in the  palm oil industry along the entire value chain. By supporting → sustainable  palm (kernel) oil, we contribute to sustainable forest management and  prevent deforestation. Collaboration with representatives from across the  industry is at the heart of our approach. We aim to increase the availability  of sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil on the market, for example,  through collaborative projects that enable → smallholder farmers to certify  their crops as sustainable, increase productivity and improve their livelihoods. Providing access to good education   We aim to promote access to high-quality education and increase the number  of young people and adults with relevant abilities and skills. → Schwarzkopfʼs  Million Chances initiative was launched in 2016 to support women and  girls in building a successful future for themselves. The long- running  project Shaping Futures gives young people the opportunity to gain   professional training in basic hairdressing techniques. Henkel is also the  main sponsor of the → Teach First Deutschland initiative. In this way, we   support the commitment of university graduates who, as additional teachers,  support children in schools in socially disadvantaged  communities.

Henkel systematically anchors → sustainability assessment criteria in  its innovation process to manage product development in line with  our sustainability strategy right from the start. In 2021, we employed  an average of around 2,600 people in research and development, and  invested 504 million euros in these activities.  Sustainability is a central pillar of the innovation strategies of the   Laundry &amp; Home Care and Beauty Care consumer goods businesses.  They place particular focus on developing their product portfolios using  resource-efficient technologies with sustainable packaging solutions  and optimized ingredients, and are driving the expansion of sustainable  brands such as Love Nature,    Pro Nature,    Nature Box or    N.A.E.  (Naturale Antica Erboristeria) with a holistic approach.  Our Adhesive Technologies business unit combines technical material  expertise and science-based innovation to support our industrial   customers and business partners in achieving their sustainability goals.  Customized solutions help to increase energy and material efficiency,  recycle valuable resources and improve safety during the manufacturing  and use phases, as well as for end users. Contribution of our product portfolio to  sustainability  Our business units – Laundry &amp; Home Care, Beauty Care and Adhesive  Technologies – are responsible for adapting our → sustainability strategy  to their operating needs. They align their brands and technologies to  sustainability in line with the specific challenges of their product portfolio.  They also work on sustainable products and tomorrow’s key technologies.  Achieving our ambitious new → targets means integrating sustainability  even more closely into our brand and business strategies in the future. Our goal is to transform our company and our product portfolio sustain- ably so that we can stand at the side of our stakeholders as a reliable  partner. We strive to ensure that each new product contributes to   sustainability. We also intend to provide our customers and consumers  with a comprehensive sustainability profile of our products by 2025.  Our aim is to offer increasingly better solutions, products and services  that also have a positive impact on the environment and society, and  therefore make a positive contribution to value.   504 million euros in  research and  development around 2,600 employees in research   and development HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  24 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Promoting sustainable consumption Our products are used millions of times a day in households and indus- trial processes. This is why we concentrate on developing products that  enable resources such as energy and water to be used efficiently during  everyday life. Our aim is to help our customers and consumers save → CO2  through our products and expertise. Through targeted communication,  we also strive to encourage responsible-minded behavior while using  our products. This is especially important because the use phase accounts  for up to 90 percent of the environmental footprint of many of our  products. The importance of the use phase is also shown in the    Henkel  footprint calculator. It shows that not only companies, but also each  individual can make a contribution to greater sustainability through  their behavior.  To promote sustainable consumption, Henkel partnered with cosmetics  companies Unilever, LVMH, L’Oréal and Natura to establish an    Eco  Beauty Score Consortium in September 2021. The goal is to develop an  industry- wide system for assessing the environmental impact of cosmetic  products to make it easier for consumers to make sustainable shopping  decisions. This approach, which is based on the latest research, is  designed to take into account the entire product life cycle. We also have  plans to create a database of standard cosmetic ingredients and their  environmental impact. up to 90 % of the environmental footprint of our   products is generated during their use Developments in Laundry &amp; Home Care Our clear vision in our Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit is: “Together  Creating a Cleaner World”. We believe that our team, our customers,  and our suppliers have to innovate together to provide better solutions,  products and services – and to create value for consumers and society.  We focus on resource-efficient technologies, innovative    products,  and optimized → packaging and ingredients to maximize cleaning   performance. In 2021, Laundry &amp; Home Care made significant progress in promoting a  circular economy. Our    partnership with Plastic Bank and the use of  Social Plastic® in much of our product packaging contributes to our  commitment to prevent plastic waste in nature while improving living  conditions for people in poverty. The bottle body of the limited edition  Pril dishwashing product is made from 100 percent Social Plastic® and  the bottle cap is now made from 84 percent recycled material. We also  promote the circular economy in the selection of our ingredients. In  partnership with BASF, we have succeeded in transforming vegan bio- mass from agricultural waste into active ingredients, which we use in  our Love Nature laundry and dishwashing detergents.  In addition to the ongoing portfolio transformation and innovation strat- egies in sustainability, Henkel acquired a leading provider of sustainable  homecare solutions,    Swania SAS, based in Nanterre, France, in July  2021. This acquisition expanded Laundry &amp; Home Care’s position in the  market for sustainable laundry and home care products. Our sustainable  brand portfolio now includes strong sustainable brands such as Maison  Verte (   EU Ecolabel certified) and the vegan brand You (   ECOCERT  labeled), which appeals to a young, tech-savvy target audience.

This includes the relaunch of our    Fa brand, with shower product   formulas that consist on average of 94 percent ingredients of natural  origin (including water; calculated according to the ISO standard). All of  the products for men and a large number of the Fa shower products for  women now also have transparent packaging. This optimizes recyclability  and supports the circular economy. The transparent bottle bodies are  made of 100 percent recycled PET (excluding the cap), 25 percent of  which is Social Plastic®. The caps have also been modified and use  10 percent less plastic than before.  While recycling remains an important consideration in terms of sustain- ability, refill solutions are also becoming more important. Refill packs  for products from our ECOCERT-certified natural cosmetics brands     N.A.E. and    Nature Box have been available in stores since 2021. We  also offer refill packs for some Fa shower gel and liquid soap products.  These refill packs hold the contents of two shower gel bottles. The refill  packs can, when disposed of correctly, be recycled. Their manufacture  requires around three-quarters less plastic than bottles of the same  capacity.  Refill packs are just one component of the sustainability commitment of  our hair and body care brand Nature Box. It is the first consumer goods  brand worldwide to use Social Plastic® as a packaging material for its  entire bottle portfolio. All bottle bodies are made of 100 percent recycled  plastic. These liquid products have been supplemented since 2021 by  solid conditioners in recyclable packaging made of FSC-certified paper,  in addition to solid shampoos and shower care products. Nature Box  combines high standards of production and quality with a long-term  sense of responsibility. For this reason, the brand’s team collaborates  with the international development organization    Solidaridad and the  specialty chemicals company Solvay. It supports smallholders in the   sustainable farming of guar and palm kernel oil, both feedstock materials  used to make ingredients found in this product range.  The    Syoss brand is another example of the sustainable transformation  of our product portfolio. Following the comprehensive relaunch of our  hair care lines in 2020, we launched a new generation of hair sprays in  2021. Syoss Compressed Micro Sprays in 200 ml format are only half  the size of conventional products that can be used the same number  of times. This means that less aluminum and propellant gas are used,  reducing the spray’s environmental footprint. The reduced weight and  volume during transport also results in lower CO2 emissions.

We develop customized technological solutions for  this. Even though our products typically make up only a small proportion  of the end product, they can be a relevant factor that help our  customers  achieve their sustainability goals. We analyze the sustainability contribution of our products during  product development and systematically evaluate the contribution  of our existing    portfolio. This transparency has allowed us to anchor   sustainability as an integral part of our strategic orientation while   forming the basis for aligning our business for the challenges of the  future and  identifying the most important levers we can use to con- tribute to solving global challenges.   • Our products conserve resources by promoting the efficient use of  energy and materials. They also help cut emissions in production and  application, for example, by using electrically conductive adhesives  from the    LOCTITE® ABLESTIK range to make solar panels more   productive. These technologies and others can also be found in our  CO2-saving portfolio.   • Our solutions ensure that valuable resources are kept in the cycle. We  do this by using renewable raw materials in production, and by   promoting the reuse and recycling of materials at the end of their life  cycle. For example, we use    LOCTITE® LIOFOL coatings for solutions  that can be fully recycled with paper without affecting the quality of  the recycled material.   • We are committed to continuously optimizing the safety of our  products  while going beyond legal requirements and working actively to  avoid substances of concern. Our    TECHNOMELT® PUR adhesives,  for example, have been developed to contain a particularly low   proportion of isocyanates.  We also strive to use our broad market access to put innovative approaches  into practice across industries: for example, the use of renewable carbon  sources through the mass balance principle. This is a transparent model  for tracking the amount of certified and non-certified material along  the entire production process.

Products that combine high performance with a reduced environ- mental footprint are key factors for successful future-oriented business  development.  Our goal for 2030 for our entire company is to triple the value we create  for the environmental footprint made by our operations, products and  services. We call this goal to become three times more efficient “Factor 3”.  The increase in efficiency results from the ratio of sales volume relative  to the environmental footprint per production volume. The three  dimensions of environmental footprint, CO2 emissions, waste and water,  are equally weighted. The increase in efficiency totaled 74 percent in 2021.

These apply to all employees  worldwide, in all of the business areas and cultural spheres in which  we operate.  The Code of Conduct contains the most important corporate principles  and behavioral rules. It is supplemented by guidelines for dealing with  potential conflicts of interest, which are designed to prevent corruption. The codes and corporate standards specifically address the issues of  compliance with competition and antitrust law, safety, health, environ- mental and social standards, human rights and public affairs. They also  provide the basis for implementing the    UN Global Compact. You can  find the following codes and standards on our    website:   • Purpose, Vision, Mission and Values,   • Code of Conduct,   • Code of Corporate Sustainability,   • Responsible Sourcing Policy,   • Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) Standards,   • Social Standards,   • Public Affairs Standard.  Steering sustainable economic activity The implementation of our sustainability strategy is based on globally  uniform codes and standards, integrated management systems, and an  organizational structure with clearly defined responsibilities. Within  Henkel, efficient processes also contribute to environmental protection  and occupational health and safety, while additionally reducing resource  consumption and costs. We use a variety of methods and tools to assess  and manage our corporate sustainability and to measure the progress  that we make toward our objectives across the entire company and our  value chain.  Risk management as a prevention tool Group-wide risk management also makes an indispensable contribution  to our strategic focus on sustainability and enables us to identify potential  risks and business opportunities at an early stage. As part of the non-  financial reporting process, a risk analysis has been conducted in line  with the concepts and processes for risk mitigation that are described  in this report. During this analysis of our own operations, our business  relationships, our products and our services, no material risks were  identified that meet, or will meet, the criteria of “having severe  negative  consequences” and “being very probable” according to the definition  set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of section 289c, as well as section 315c of the  German Commercial Code (HGB).

The Henkel   Management Board bears overall responsibility for our sustainability  strategy and for the compliance organization in order to ensure that   legislation and internal guidelines are observed.  Sustainability Council  Chaired by Sylvie Nicol, Chief Human Resources Officer, the Sustainability  Council is the central decision-making body for our global sustainability  activities. On behalf of senior management, the committee performs  coordination, initiative and control functions in relation to sustain- ability issues. These include strategic topics as well as issues that are  operationally relevant, such as climate change and its effects, human  rights,  sustainable products and technologies, packaging, product safety  and management systems. The Sustainability Council sets up project  groups to deal with sustainability topics, and monitors the results. It also  handles cross-departmental projects and regularly monitors the extent  to which sustainability targets are met. This includes the progress of  our climate- related corporate targets and initiatives, for example. The Sustainability Council is made up of top managers from all of the   business units and functions of the company. It normally meets six  times a year. In addition, the members take decisions on matters as  required during the year.  Management systems govern our structures and processes  Globally uniform standards for Safety, Health, and Environment (SHE),  together with integrated management systems, provide the basis for our  worldwide optimization programs. Our SHE Standards and our Social  Standards apply to all sites. Our management systems ensure that these  standards are implemented consistently across our global production  network and at all sites. This is based on the continuous training of our  employees.  We carry out → regular audits at our production and administration sites,  and at our subcontractors and logistics centers, to verify compliance  with our codes and standards. All audit results, including the monitoring  of our SHE and Social Standards, are included in the Internal Audit  department’s annual report to the Henkel Management Board.

For example, they develop appropriate supplier   manage ment tools or systems for measuring greenhouse gas emissions.  Key  sustainability topics for Henkel are coordinated by a specialist  unit that reports directly to the Management Board and which serves as  the  company-wide interface for sustainability. Ulrike Sapiro, Chief   Corporate Sustainability Officer, has been head of this specialist unit  since May 1, 2021.  Management conferences and specialist committees  In addition to the central role of the Sustainability Council and the  interaction between the various units and functions, international   management conferences and the sharing of information in specialist  committees form an important basis for the ongoing development of  Henkel’s  sustainability policy. These meetings deal with new scientific  findings, practical experience, changes in laws and regulations, and  other current topics. The objective is to initiate new projects within  Henkel, as well as to further develop approaches to solving problems  and to encourage employees to share their experiences with one another. Business units  The business units (Adhesive Technologies, Beauty Care and Laundry &amp;  Home Care) are also responsible for adapting our sustainability strategy  to their operating needs, as well as providing the resources needed for  its implementation. They align their brands and technologies, and  the sites involved, to sustainability in line with the specific challenges  and priorities of their product portfolio. The research and development  departments of our three business units work on key technologies and  supply the basis for tomorrow’s sustainable products. Regional and national companies  Managers in the regional and national companies steer the implemen- tation of Henkel standards and compliance with legal requirements in  their respective regions.

Footprint across the entire value chain We use representative life cycle appraisals for all product categories to  assess our footprint along the entire value chain. We also assess data  covering the raw ingredients and packaging materials we use, as well as  relevant transport operations. We have assessed more than 99 percent of  our annual sales through life cycle appraisals: more than 67 percent has  been evaluated through representative life cycle analyses and about  32 percent through simplified life cycle appraisals. In this way, we ensure  validated greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting along the value chain.   In preparing life cycle analyses, we use our own primary data as well  as data from our partners along the supply chain. If such data is not  available, we draw on secondary data from existing databases of life cycle  analyses, average values, and emission factors. To further develop metrics  and indicators, we collaborate with external partners on topics such  as product carbon footprints and water footprints. We also participate  in international initiatives such as the    Sustainability Consortium  and the    Consumer Goods Forum’s Measurement Group. We are also  over 99 % of annual sales is covered   through life cycle appraisals Measurement and evaluation over the entire   life cycle  We use a variety of methods and tools to assess our progress across the  entire company and our value chain. We are continuously developing  these methods and tools, which include trend and market analyses, as  well as the evaluation of ratings and life-cycle analyses. In addition to  the achievement of our → sustainability targets, we continuously review  our management processes and optimize them where needed. This  includes measures in the areas of environmental protection and occupa- tional safety, technical developments and process optimization to  reduce resource consumption and costs. These measures are supported  and implemented by our three business units, as well as our regional  and national companies and our corporate functions. Together, they  contribute to the achievement of our sustainability targets. Our innovation process employs a variety of tools to systematically analyze,  measure and evaluate our products. Hot spots can be identified as fields  of action that are most relevant to sustainability for every product category  on the basis of scientific measurement methods. Our researchers have  to identify the points in the value chain and the strategic areas in which  the product offers concrete advantages. Each product receives a separate  sustainability profile based on this data. To make it easier to optimize  our products while they are being developed, we integrate the environ- mental profiles of possible raw ingredients and packaging materials into  the information systems of our product and packaging development  teams. This allows the footprint of a new formulation to be calculated as  early as the development phase. Our three business units also collaborate  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  32 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  involved in standardizing the methodology for calculating footprints and  the associated data exchange for all participants in the automotive value  chain as part of the    “Catena-X Automotive Network”. In addition, we have further developed our “EasyLCA” software tool  for the fast calculation of CO2 footprints for product formulations. This  is a quick way to make the footprint of formulations transparent for  decision-making processes during the product development process.  In order to measure the contribution of individual products to climate  protection, experiments are being carried out worldwide to measure  product carbon footprints. Unlike complete life cycle analyses, this  involves determining only the climate-relevant greenhouse gas emissions  throughout the value chain of a product – from the purchase of the raw  materials through to production, use and disposal. However, until now  there has been no standardized method for determining the carbon foot- print of a product. For this reason, Henkel participates in pilot projects  in the USA and Europe with the aim of driving forward the development  of a reliable and internationally harmonized method of determining   carbon footprints. Sustainability assessment by our business units In collaboration with the European Commission and various stakeholders,  in 2014 the Europe-based International Association for Soaps, Detergents  and Maintenance Products (Wasch-, Pflege- und Reinigungsmittelverband     A.I.S.E.) launched a pilot project on the Product Environmental Footprint  (PEF) of heavy-duty liquid detergents for machine applications to reduce  the overall footprint of products. Henkel, represented by the Laundry &amp;  Home Care business unit, was joined in the project by other companies,  national industry associations, and the external organizations    CESIO,     Global Standards 1,    SGS, the    Sustainability Consortium, the     Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, and the    Technical  University of Berlin. The pilot project resulted in the publication of  rules based on product categories and life cycles. This is the first method  based on a harmonized and transparent life cycle assessment throughout  Europe. However, it is not yet sufficiently mature at the current stage of  development to allow accurate product comparisons, as LCA science  is still evolving. For example, some impact assessment methods are  not yet ready to be applied to comparative, detailed assessment at the  product level or to market communication. However, they are useful for  reviewing, prioritizing, and managing the eco-design of products within  the  company. We  support A.I.S.E.’s objective of integrating a harmonized  PEF method into the product assessment of the long-standing    “Charter  for Sustainable Cleaning”. This method had been in place since 2006  and is regularly updated.

As part  of this effort, in 2021, with the help of cross-departmental innovation  teams in Laundry &amp; Home Care, we laid the foundations for developing  a country-specific consumer app based on the latest scientific research.  This internal pilot project has made it possible for us to compare different  third-party assessments with our own data. This provides valuable  insights for our product development. We initially began with new  health criteria, but we are also taking into account criteria relating  to the environment and product performance. Our Beauty Care business unit has calculated the environmental foot- print of more than 200,000 product formulas over the past six years.  Each formula comes with a compact sustainability report that clearly  summarizes relevant categories, such as carbon footprint, biodegrad- ability, data on ingredients of natural origin (according to the ISO 16128  standard developed for cosmetic products), as well as their proportion  of the overall product formula. There is also a database that provides  sustainability data for all relevant raw materials. This makes it possible to  compare the sustainability profiles of specific raw materials. At all times,  the standardized methodology, the comparability of the reports and the  raw material properties provide our developers with easy access to infor- mation about how our formulas contribute to sustainability, as well as  full transparency about potential optimization approaches for a reduced  overall footprint. Our Adhesive Technologies business unit has introduced an internal  portfolio assessment process to analyze the sustainability contribution  of our portfolio. By integrating this assessment into our strategic  management and product development, we are able to sustainably align  our portfolio based on the latest scientific facts. The assessment criteria cover different dimensions of sustainability  and were determined on the basis of a customer-oriented approach.  They focus on CO2 reduction and energy efficiency, the circular economy,  health and safety, water conservation and quality across the value chain.  A systematic and fact-based approach means that appropriate supporting  documentation must be available for all products with a contribution  that is judged to be significant. We have trained more than 900 employees from our Adhesive Technologies  business unit in the implementation of this portfolio assessment process  since it was developed.

The survey confirmed that  our  target groups place great importance on our efforts to integrate sustain- ability into all of our activities and product life cycles, and that they also  have a strong focus on the environmental impacts that occur during the  individual phases of our products’ life cycles. The sustainability topics our  stakeholders particularly prioritize are → materials and waste, → energy  and climate, and → water and wastewater. A  special focus is also placed  on the → mental health and well-being of employees. Our stakeholders  consider Henkel to be well positioned in addressing these key issues.  Another result of the survey was that Henkel is perceived as a reliable  partner by 87 percent of the stakeholders. This is due to our commitment  to high industry standards, our clarity of direction, our reliability and  competence, and last but not least, our employees.  We are in close dialog with our stakeholders on a continuous basis. The  following overview shows a current selection of the main dialog formats  and activities, as well as the expectations placed on our company.  Additional information on collaboration and partnerships can be found  on our    website. 87 % of our stakeholders consider  us to be a reliable partner around 700 stakeholders  surveyed STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT Dialog with our stakeholders Understanding the social demands that stakeholders of all kinds place  on our company is a key component of our → sustainability management.  This includes our customers, consumers, suppliers, business partners,  employees, shareholders, investors, neighbors and  local communities,  associations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), academia,  as well as politicians and government authorities.  To better understand the expectations and perspectives of our stakeholders  and to engage in dialog that is more targeted and solution-oriented, we  make use of specific surveys and continuously monitor the opinions  at several levels: in direct dialog, in multi-stakeholder initiatives, and  through dialog platforms. Cooperation with NGOs and opinion leaders  gives us insights into global challenges and enables us to respond to issues  at an early stage. Stakeholder  dialog is a key element of our approaches to  innovation and risk management, and helps us to  continuously develop  our sustainability strategy and reporting.  Stakeholder survey confirms Henkel as a reliable partner In 2021, we once again conducted a comprehensive survey of our stake- holders to identify which topics have priority for them and to map the  current expectations of the various stakeholder groups as part of the  development of our → sustainability strategy. Another aim was to obtain  a clear picture of our international sustainability reputation. We followed  both a quantitative and a qualitative approach, with in-depth interviews  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  35 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Customers &amp;   consumers ... are increasingly interested  in sustainable products and are  looking to understand their  impact along the value chain.   • Calculating their CO2 footprint  with the    Henkel footprint   calculator  • Our    “Be smarter.”-initiative  encourages water-saving  behavior and responsible waste  management  • Our    “Fritz for Future” pod- cast provides information on  important sustainability topics Associations &amp; NGOs  ... expect us to actively promote  sustainable development.

Effectively addressing the expectations of our stakeholders HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  36 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Wide range of dialog All of our employees worldwide are encouraged to be engaged in their  working environment and to base their decisions on the principles of  sustainable development. For many of our employees, this includes   regular dialog with stakeholders – both on specific topics and on sustain- ability in general. Experts at our various company sites and in our  business units engage in discussion with relevant stakeholder groups  on specific local and regional challenges. This allows us to develop  customized concepts and solutions that can be implemented and  assessed effectively. In 2021, as in each year, Henkel employees met with  politicians, scientists and scholars, businesspeople and members of the  public. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many events were again held in  virtual formats to protect the participants.   • Sustainable packaging and the circular economy were key topics of  discussion at many stakeholder dialog events in 2021. In November  2021, Henkel invited key stakeholders from the packaging and consumer  goods industry to the    “Sustainability Days 2021”. By bringing  together the entire value chain in the field of packaging and consumer  goods, Henkel has established a strong platform for discussions and  solutions for current and upcoming topics – from circular economy  and energy saving to health and safety and many more. The business  fields this year will include end of line packaging and labeling, flexible  packaging, paper solutions, tapes and labels and – for the first time –  personal hygiene.   • Recyclable packaging and  sustainable product applications were also  addressed in April 2021 at the “Better Future Conference – Sustainability,”  an initiative of WELT AM SONNTAG. In an interview, Carsten Knobel,  Chair of the Management Board, highlighted how Henkel is embedding  sustainability in the company and among consumers.   • In May 2021, the    ChangeNOW Summit took place for the fourth time  in a row as an online format in which Henkel France was a partner.  ChangeNOW is one of the world’s most important innovation platforms  and brings together a large number of actors from various sectors,  all committed to promote sustainable development. At this event,   representatives from Henkel and the social enterprise    Plastic Bank  discussed the challenges of the circular economy.  • In the digital Futuretalk, hosted by the Futurewoman initiative, Henkel  representatives discussed with other experts the extent to which plastic  can be part of the solution for greater sustainability and where concrete  action is needed.   • Another focus was the discussion on diversity and inclusion. At a  panel discussion during the “Better Future Conference – Diversity” of  WELT AM SONNTAG in November 2021, Sylvie Nicol, Executive Vice  President Human Resources and Chair of the Sustainability Council,  discussed the relevance of an inclusive, strong leadership culture to  promote diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion in the company.

The involvement is an expression of a public commitment on the part  of the participants and their companies.  • In November 2021, the    Henkel Xathon, an ideation hackathon for  female founders, took place for the third time. The aim of the hybrid  event was to promote female entrepreneurs and talents in the technology  industry, strengthen their business innovation and support them in  building a relevant business network. It was hosted by Henkel dx  Ventures, Henkel’s platform for open innovation and collaboration,  together with the initiative Global Digital Women. A key focus this  year was the rapidly accelerating direct-to-consumer (D2C) sector,  influenced by changing consumer behaviors towards hyper-personal- ization across all channels.  • Henkel was again a partner of the    German Sustainability Award  in 2021 and took the opportunity to engage with stakeholders on  German Sustainability Day. Ulrike Sapiro, Chief Sustainability Officer  at Henkel, provided insights into how Henkel is actively driving the  transformation to a sustainable economy and society in a plenum on  the topic “Accelerating Transformation – Embracing Challenges as  Opportunities”. The German Sustainability Award is an initiative of  the Stiftung Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitspreis e. V. in cooperation with  the German Federal Government, the German Council for Sustainable  Development, economic associations, local government associations,  civil society organizations and research institutions.   • In November 2021, the annual partnership meeting between the develop- ment organization    Solidaridad and Henkel took place virtually. The  participants discussed cooperation to support → smallholders and  local initiatives to promote → sustainable palm (kernel) oil. In addition  to the milestones that have already been achieved, the development  of Henkel’s palm (kernel) oil strategy and future cooperation with  Solidaridad were also discussed. This collaboration will continue to  focus on improving livelihoods for  smallholders. To further scale  up our joint actions, we started developing our Partnership  Theory of  Change in 2021. This framework will help us to define our strategic  actions in the future as well as to define and achieve a concrete impact.

It is supported by integrated management systems  and an organizational structure with clearly defined responsibilities.  The General Counsel &amp; Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the  Chair of the Management Board. He is supported by the Corporate   Compliance Office, our interdisciplinary Compliance &amp; Risk Committee,  and 50 locally appointed compliance officers all over the world. Our   Corporate Data Protection Officer is also part of our Compliance orga- nization. Together, this organization coordinates the flow of information  and helps our employees to implement our requirements locally – for  example, through specially adapted training courses. The General  Counsel &amp; Chief Compliance Officer reports any infringements, as well  as the measures taken to deal with them, to the Management Board  and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on a regular basis.  Our internal reporting and complaints channels are supported by a   compliance hotline, which was set up to enable employees to report  infringements of our    Code of Conduct, internal standards, or applicable  laws anonymously. It is run by an independent external provider and is  available globally, allowing both open as well as anonymous reporting.  The hotline and alternative reporting channels are available to employees  and third parties. Focus on communication and training  Since we operate on a global scale, our employees find themselves   working within a variety of legal systems and value systems. Many of  our employees work in countries where, according to surveys by   organizations such as    Transparency International, there is a greater  risk of encountering corrupt practices. The same expectations apply to  all employees at all locations without exception: Henkel strictly opposes  the infringement of laws and standards, and rejects all dishonest business  practices. To impart clear rules of conduct to our employees, and   especially to avoid any conflicts of interest in everyday working situations,  we focus on regular training courses and communication measures. Our  managers play a key role with regard to compliance. Given their position  within the company, they bear a special responsibility to set an example  for their staff. For this reason, all of our managers across the globe must  participate in our mandatory Compliance eLearning program and  attend relevant training courses. The program addresses many different  compliance topics, such as data protection, competition law and anti-  corruption. In 2021, more participants took part in these compliance  training courses (52,471 registered participants) than in previous years.  Zero tolerance for violations of regulations  Improper conduct is never in Henkel’s interest. The Management Board  and senior management circles at Henkel all subscribe to this fundamental  principle. Improper conduct undermines fair competition and damages  our trustworthiness and reputation. Our employees attach great  importance to a correct and ethically impeccable business environment.

In the course of the  audits, a total of 852 corrective actions were agreed upon. The audits   covered all major units of the company: Sales, Marketing, Purchasing,  Finance, HR, IT, Supply Chain, Operations and SHE. Compliance with  our SHE Standards was audited at 25 sites, resulting in the initiation of  a total of 127 optimization measures. We examined compliance with our  Social Standards in three assessments.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of our 2021  audits was again conducted using a “remote audit” approach. This  requires powerful infrastructure, as well as the digitalization of pro- cesses and documents. Our overall assessment of our experience of  this remote audit approach remains positive, although the effectiveness  and efficiency of the approach is limited in certain audit areas and  when auditing across different time zones. In 2021, SHE audits were in  part supported by third-party vendors to enable on-site audits. All audit results are included in the Corporate Audit department’s annual  report to the Henkel Management Board and the Audit Committee of the  Supervisory Board. In addition to the regular audits, Corporate Audit also  conducted an assessment of internal control systems. In 2021, Corporate  Audit also trained 3,122 employees worldwide on compliance, risk   management and internal controls, in the course of seminars and  during audits. We react forcefully to violations of laws, codes and standards. Where  necessary, we initiate appropriate disciplinary measures. In 2021, four  employees received written warnings, and 27 contracts were terminated  as a result of conduct violating compliance rules.  Data protection and compliance management systems  Henkel’s compliance culture involves continuous    monitoring and  improvement of the compliance process. Against this background, our  data protection management system was reviewed and confirmed by  external auditors in 2019 in accordance with the IDW PS 980 auditing  standard – with regard to the appropriateness, implementation and  effectiveness of the data protection processes. Henkel has previously  had similar external audits related to competition law and anti-corruption  carried out on several occasions. Results of our audits  The Head of the Corporate Audit department reports directly to the Chair  of the Management Board. We carry out regular audits based on our risk- based audit planning at our production and administration sites, and at  our subcontractors and in logistics centers, to verify  compliance with  our codes and standards. The audits are a key instrument for identifying  risks and potential improvements.   70 audits conducted   around the world HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  40 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Since many of our products pass into wastewater after use, their com- position has been designed to minimize the impact on the environment.  Wastewater from chemical engineering applications is treated using  state-of-the-art technology to remove harmful substances and is then  disposed of properly.  In selecting and using ingredients, we also follow controversial   discussions about the safety of chemical ingredients in products. As a rule,  we respond by critically reviewing the scientific basis of our assessments  with particular care. If this gives rise to reservations about product safety,  and if the scientific data and findings cannot dispel these doubts, we  either avoid using a substance altogether or restrict its use so that it will  still meet our stringent safety criteria.  At the same time, it is becoming increasingly important to enable  consumers to learn about the ingredients contained in our products. In  line with this, we will enhance global transparency about the substances  used and their respective safety. Regular audits are carried out to verify compliance with corporate product  safety requirements and procedures. The business units are responsible  for the implementation of the respective measures.  PRODUCT SAFETY Product responsibility as an important lever   for sustainability Our customers and consumers should be able to rest assured that our  products are safe when used as intended. All raw materials and finished  products are subjected to numerous assessments and tests to ensure a  high level of safety during production, use and disposal. This is based on  ensuring compliance with statutory requirements and more extensive     Henkel standards.  Our product developers and    product safety experts assess ingredients  according to the latest scientific findings and safety data. They   continuously track Henkel products on the market and incorporate the  insights gained into the assessments. We follow a risk-based approach  in accordance with scientific standards when assessing the consumer  safety and environmental compatibility of materials and products. A  key step in this assessment process is that, in addition to the safe  concentration for using a substance, we also determine the extent to  which humans or the environment are exposed to it. Since exceeding  the safe concentration for use may result in a risk to humans and / or  the environment, we restrict the use of the substance in these cases to   relatively low concentrations and / or certain product categories. In   individual cases, this can also lead to a substance not being used at all. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  41 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Assessment of the products  Once they have evaluated all of the individual ingredients, our experts  perform a further safety assessment focusing on the overall formulation  of a product. This looks at the properties of the individual ingredients,  their concentrations in the product and the conditions under which the  product will be used. Products for use on the human body are additionally  evaluated dermatologically. The results of these evaluations and assess- ments then form the basis for defining the required precautionary and  protective measures for safe use of the product. These measures are   specifically adapted as appropriate, taking account of whether the product  is to be used by consumers or industrial professionals, and can range  from package design features, through to detailed instructions and  warnings, or restrictions regarding use.  Controversially discussed ingredients  Scientists and the general public often take different views regarding the  risks that chemical substances might pose. There are many reasons for  this. Particularly often, we see that a direct link is made between the  potential hazard a substance may have for humans or the environment  and the ensuing risk, without taking into account the extent to which  humans or the environment are actually exposed to that substance. It is  our view that a differentiation must be made between hazard and risk,  and that this is in fact essential to ensure that safety assessments of  ingredients reflect reality.  Identifying hazards – assessing risks  In assessing the safety of a product, the first step our experts take is to  determine whether its ingredients could pose a hazard to people or the  environment. An exposure analysis is carried out in a second step to  clarify the extent to which people or the environment could be exposed  to this substance. This analysis is important as, in most cases, a harmful  effect will only occur when the quantity and concentration of the   questionable substance reach a certain level. The results of these two  steps have to be combined to arrive at a comprehensive risk assessment.  It is only by considering this overall picture that our experts can make  reliable statements about whether a product will be safe when it is used.  A simple example is acetic acid, which represents a potential hazard  because it can cause serious harm in high concentrations due to its   caustic properties. When used as vinegar in diluted form in our food,  however, it does not pose a risk.  Evaluation of the substances used  Regarding substances with certain dangerous properties, we have  decided that these shall not be used at all for specific applications. For  other substances, we have introduced strict internal constraints and  restrictions and, by doing so, we often go beyond legal requirements.  In other cases, we work to further improve health compatibility by   developing alternative ingredients. One example of this is the switch  from solvent-based to water-based formulations for our consumer and  contact adhesives.

Furthermore, we believe being present in these  markets and supporting the non-animal testing agenda will ultimately  help to gain acceptance for alternatives to animal testing. We and other  manufacturers in our industry cannot rule out the possibility that an  ingredient was tested on animals at some point before it was introduced  to the market. In particular, this is because we mostly source our ingre- dients from suppliers, and manufacture very few ingredients ourselves.  In this context, it is also important to know that ingredients used in  products including detergents, cleaning products and adhesives are  chemical substances. This means they must be secured by the respective  manufacturer in line with the relevant legal requirements for chemicals,  such as the    REACH regulation in Europe. In some cases, animal testing  is still required by law to ensure safety and compatibility for humans and  the environment. This is because recognized alternative methods are  not yet available for all aspects of testing. We use recognized, alternative  testing methods or existing data to demonstrate the safety of our ingre- dients. For 40 years now, we have been intensively committed to  developing alternative testing methods ourselves. Henkel was one of the  companies that founded the    ‘European Partnership on Alternative  Approaches to Animal Testing’ (EPAA) in 2005, together with the Euro- pean Commission and several industry associations. Since then, this  partnership has advanced numerous projects that have successfully  promoted alternatives to animal testing and made them useable for  conducting safety assessments in line with the REACH regulation. Product recall process  Although our products undergo numerous tests and assessments to  ensure a high level of safety, unforeseen deviations from our high quality  standards may occur in very rare cases. In preparation for any such  cases and to ensure the best possible health and safety of customers and  consumers, in 2009 Henkel introduced a corporate standard for potential  product crises and product recalls that applies to all sites. This global  corporate standard defines binding procedures, clear responsibilities  and guidelines for an appropriate and rapid response if deviations and  unforeseen events were to occur in connection with our products, despite  all of the safety precautions we have taken. Following a fundamental  revision of this corporate standard, our internal target groups were  informed about new content in 2020 through training sessions and short  presentations. A digital training course has also been available since the  end of 2020. Innovations and alternative test methods  We have a clear    commitment: We do not test our cosmetic products,  our detergents and cleaning products, or our adhesives for industrial  customers, consumers and craftspeople on animals. Unfortunately, we  cannot claim that animal testing no longer plays any role at all. This is  because there are some countries where animal testing is still mandatory  to obtain market and/or regulatory approval for products such as   cosmetics, detergents and cleaning products, or adhesives. We are working  together with the relevant industry associations to convince the authorities  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  43 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Enhancing human health and safety We test and assess our raw materials and finished products throughout  the entire product lifecycle to make sure they meet the highest standards.  Of course, our customers share our commitment to health and safety –  and their focus is being sharpened by regulatory changes that aim to   protect consumers. A new chemical strategy for sustainability, for example,  is expected to be included within the Green Deal in the European Union.  Adapting our product formulas in Adhesive Technologies is just one  of the ways that we seek to enhance safety and help our customers to  exceed regulatory requirements. For example, our Loctite 2400 thread- locker is not required to display any hazard symbols, risk statements or  safety-related warnings on the packaging because it does not contain  any substances of concern.  Wherever possible, questions regarding the skin compatibility of  ingredients are now investigated with the help of in-vitro tests. In-vitro  tests have been developed over the past decades by Henkel in cooperation  with external partners. They have been proposed for international  recognition by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develop- ment (OECD) as a substitute method for animal testing.  For this purpose, Henkel uses    epiCS® skin models produced in its  own laboratories under the    Phenion® brand. The epiCS® technology  includes reconstructed human epidermal equivalents, which are   officially  recognized by the OECD for assessing skin-corrosive potential,  and, since April 2019, also assessing skin-irritant potential. Our scientists are currently working to ensure that the skin models,  which are the size of a one-cent coin, can also be used to research other  chemical safety issues. You can find more information on the website  of the European Commission’s    Scientific Committee on Consumer  Products.  Computer-aided analysis is also playing an increasingly important role  in our testing and assessment strategies.

We expect their business  business partners from 119 countries SOURCING  Responsible sourcing underpins holistic growth  Our responsible sourcing approach focuses on sustainability aspects  along our supply chains for the benefit of people and our planet. Inten- sive dialog and close cooperation with our suppliers are essential for  achieving sustainable business, process and production practices. Over  a decade ago, we established a framework for sustainable procurement  in the supply chains of the chemical industry based on cooperation,  trust and responsibility.   100 percent responsible sourcing strategy Our ambition is to commit to 100 percent responsible sourcing together  with our partners. The key element here is our    responsible-sourcing  strategy, which places a clear focus on a shared fundamental approach.  We are firmly convinced that we can only establish sustainable procure- ment practices if every single decision-maker in the global supply  chains acts in the spirit of sustainability. This requires a fundamental  recognition of this responsibility, as well as adopting the right attitude  and building skills and knowledge.  Our strategy is based on our comprehensive → risk management and   → compliance approach. The aim here is to gather and provide transparent  key figures on the sustainability performance and risks of our suppliers  as a basis for fact-based decision-making in sourcing processes and the  awarding of contracts. The transparency gained in this area also benefits  risk management and risk mitigation, as well as dialog and cooperation  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  45 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Cooperation with strategic suppliers and partners Our current cooperation with our suppliers centers on the definition and  implementation of a common plan for Henkel’s sustainability targets for  2025 and beyond. We use different platforms and forums to develop   pioneering innovations in the field of sustainable products and technol- ogies together with our suppliers. We use target agreements with our  strategic suppliers to manage transparency, sustainability performance  and innovation potential in the area of sustainable sourcing solutions.  As part of our risk management approach, we are working to improve the  transparency of our upstream supply chains with regard to sustainability  risks. To support climate action across the value chain, we also require  our suppliers in the raw materials and packaging sectors to be transparent  about the emissions levels of their product portfolios. We expect them  to make a contribution to reducing CO2  emissions along their supply  chains in line with our science-based target for Scope 3 greenhouse gas  emissions. This approach addresses about 50 percent of our indirect  emissions in the area of raw materials. In addition, we encourage sustain- able innovation by engaging in dialog with suppliers and setting individual  targets. This is how we ensure that focus topics such as biodegradability are  systematically integrated into Henkel’s holistic approach to sustainability.  conduct to be consistent with our sustainability requirements. In selecting  and working with our business partners, we also consider their perfor- mance with regard to safety, health, environment, social standards and  fair business practices. This is based on our corporate    Safety, Health  and Environment Standards. Our corporate purchasing standards  apply worldwide, and we have supplemented these with an updated     Responsible Sourcing  Policy in 2018. The Chief Procurement Officer  (CPO) is responsible for all procurement activities and responsible   supply chain management. He reports directly to the Chief Financial  Officer (CFO).  Binding supplier code Compliance with the cross-sector Code of Conduct of the German     Association of Materials Management, Purchasing, and Logistics  (BME) is mandatory for all of Henkel’s suppliers worldwide. The BME  Code of Conduct is based on the ten principles of the    UN Global  Compact. This Code of Conduct makes international application   possible and, in addition to the Responsible Sourcing Policy, also serves  as the basis for contractual relationships with our strategic suppliers.

We expect our suppliers to acknowledge  our supplier code of conduct as well as our Responsible Sourcing Policy.  Our onboarding process is anchored in a globally uniform registration  system and provides a standardized summary of our sustainability  requirements. Step 3: Initial assessment or audit  At the start of a new business relationship, suppliers are asked to either  disclose existing sustainability performance results, or to undergo a  self-assessment that provides transparency about their sustainability  performance. We do this for the majority of our external purchasing  volume using a methodology developed by EcoVadis, an independent  sustainability assessment specialist. These questionnaires cover  expectations in the areas of safety, health, environment, quality, human  rights, employee standards and anti-corruption.  We also piloted the    IntegrityNext software-as-a-service solution in  2021 for suppliers with lower purchasing volumes. A compact assessment  questionnaire is used to make the sustainability performance and risks  of suppliers in various purchasing segments transparent. Selected suppliers undergo initial audits as an alternative to the  assessment of the self-assessment questionnaires. Our supplier base  also includes contract manufacturers from which we source around  10 percent of our production tonnage each year. Our requirements  regarding quality, environmental, safety and social standards are an   integral part of all contractual relationships and order placements, and  are reviewed as necessary. Six-step process as an integral component   of our procurement activities Our six-step Responsible Sourcing Process, which generates indicators  on the sustainability performance of our suppliers, is a central element  of  our strategic risk management and compliance approach. We use the  resulting transparency to support our buyers in working with suppliers  to continuously improve sustainability performance in the value chain.  These continuous improvement processes are based primarily on  know ledge transfer and competence building with respect to process   optimization, resource efficiency, and environmental and social standards.  The Responsible Sourcing Process is an integral component of our  sourcing activities. This process is initiated before the start of any new  cooperation. It culminates in a recurring cycle of review, analysis and  continuous improvement with existing suppliers. Using this process  for the audit and assessment of the sustainability performance of our  suppliers, we cover about 93 percent of our purchasing volume in the  areas of packaging, raw materials, and contract manufacturing.  Step 1: Pre-check and risk assessment  Henkel uses an early warning system for sustainability risks in global  purchasing markets. We begin by evaluating the potential risks in a  region or country. In doing so, we concentrate on countries identified by  international institutions as being associated with heightened levels of  sustainability risks. The assessment includes the criteria “Human Rights,”  “Corruption” and “Legal Environment”. This also includes the assessment  of risk-value chains. Risk value chains are related to industries and  sectors that we consider to potentially represent a sustainability risk for  our company. This helps us to identify countries and purchasing   markets that may require special precautions.

Our audits consist of on-site inspections (e.g., at production sites of our  suppliers) and include both factory inspections and discussions with  employees at all levels of the hierarchy.  Step 4: Analysis of the performance assessment  External sustainability experts, as well as the supplier owners in our  Purchasing team, analyze the results of the audits or the results of the  self-assessment questionnaire to identify sustainability deficits and  improvement areas. At the same time, the suppliers are assigned to   different sustainability risk classes. A standardized process following  an assessment or audit ensures that our suppliers implement the  corrective actions that have been specified. Repeated serious non-  compliance leads to termination of the supplier relationship.  Step 5: Corrective actions and continuous improvement process  Independently of the results of an audit or assessment, we ask our  assessed suppliers to draw up a Corrective Action Plan and to work on  the defined areas of potential optimization. We monitor the progress  made in the implementation together with our suppliers in the course  of the period until the re-assessment or re-audit takes place. Step 6: Re-Assessment / Re-Audit  We use recurring re-assessments or re-audits to monitor the performance  progress of our suppliers and ensure a continuous improvement cycle  consisting of evaluation, analysis and corrective measures. Data on the  measured sustainability performance of our suppliers is made available  in real time via digital platforms.  Development or termination of the supplier relationship  As part of our supplier management activities, we work intensively with  our suppliers to improve sustainability performance. We strive to initiate  positive change throughout the value chain, through training programs  and joint projects. During 2021, we did not receive any notifications of an  infringement by any of our strategic business partners that would have  given cause for terminating our relationship with that supplier.

The TfS initia- tive today consists of 34 members representing total expenditures of more  than 267 billion euros. It aims to harmonize increasingly complex supply  chain management processes with regard to sustainability and to optimize  dialog among worldwide business partners. Above all, synergies are to be  created so that resources can be used more efficiently and with a minimum  of administrative effort, not only among the member companies but also  with all of our shared suppliers.  Together for a sustainable supply chain A strong partner in the “Together for Sustainability”   (TfS) initiative In 2011, Henkel and five other companies in the chemical industry  introduced the initiative    Together for Sustainability – Chemical Supply  Chains for a Better World (TfS). It is based on the principles of the     UN Global Compact and the Responsible Care Initiative of the  Responsible Sourcing Process Six-step supplier management process  • Implemented in all regions, in all business units and for all  material groups  • Managed by the Sustainability team within Purchasing and  executed by the global Purchasing team  • Complemented by supplier audits conducted by the Safety,  Health and Environment (SHE) team Sustainability as an   integral component of all  procurement activities HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  49 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  At the heart of the audits and online assessments of the TfS initiative is  the core idea: “An audit for one is an audit for all!”: Suppliers then only  have to undergo one assessment or one audit. The audits are carried out  by a number of selected, independent audit companies. For the online  assessments, TfS works with    EcoVadis, a sustainability performance  assessment specialist.  Around 18,000 assessments and audits have taken place since TfS was  founded. Performance is assessed in the areas of management, environ- ment, health and safety, labor and human rights, and issues of ethical  corporate governance. The measures then introduced are reviewed via  re-assessments or re-audits. Follow-up monitoring and subsequent  supplier management are the responsibility of the individual member  companies. An online platform is used to make the results available to  all members of the initiative.  The initiative not only expanded to include additional member   companies in 2021, it also established a regional working group in   Singapore, headed by a Henkel representative. Together with the   Chinese Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation, TfS is working  to raise awareness of the initiative in China.  18,000 TfS assessments and audits 34 member companies   of the TfS initiative Another working group was also launched in 2021 with the goal of  establishing a global program to collect and share information on Scope  3 greenhouse gas emissions. This includes developing a standardized  approach for measuring greenhouse gas emissions data in the chemical  industry. This also includes defining a data  collection and sharing   process using a scalable platform, designing a supplier engagement  program, and maintaining dialog with key stakeholders.  In 2021, the initiative also developed the    TfS Academy. After completion  of the pilot phase, the Academy will provide a learning environment for  both of the core target groups, buyers and suppliers, as well as other  key stakeholders within TfS member companies. The TfS Academy will  initially offer more than 200 learning contents in four languages. Training and development of suppliers and employees  During the year, Henkel continued to focus on building up and expanding  the expertise of its buyers and suppliers. Henkel experts trained both  purchasing experts and suppliers in focus areas like palm oil, greenhouse  gas emissions and conflict minerals. Experts at TfS, together with repre- sentatives of the strategic supplier evaluation partner EcoVadis, were  also trained in content related to the assessment process. In total, about  2,360 participants were trained in various webinars in four languages  (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese) in 2021. At the annual conference  of the Chinese Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation, personal  training was provided for about 370 suppliers on site in Ningbo for the  second year.

During the year, 970 employees completed  eLearning courses on sustainability topics in purchasing. We placed a  special focus on human rights due diligence training in purchasing.  About 370 employees in the Purchasing area underwent extensive  human rights training in 2021, focusing on human rights due diligence  in supply chains.  Honoring our suppliers  Henkel has regularly honored suppliers for special achievements for many  years. In 2021, the    Adhesive Technologies business unit presented  BASF with the Sustainability Award for its outstanding contributions to  achieving our sustainability targets and ambitions. BASF’s contributions  include joint development projects for improved health and safety  standards, for reducing the company’s carbon footprint by sourcing raw  materials based on the biomass balance process for new adhesive  products, and the partnership in the ReciChain initiative for tracking  plastics and plastic products.  The    Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit presented the 2021 Sustain- ability Award to Firmenich and Takasago in recognition of their achieve- ments in the development of new biodegradable capsules for fragrances.  We use this technological development for fabric softeners and laundry  detergents. It also fulfills the criteria of biodegradability and fragrance  performance and longevity.  The    Beauty Care business unit presented the Sustainability Award  for 2021 to Sasol, whose Parafol chemical line allows us to replace cyclic   silicones from antiperspirant sprays. This is an important step in adapting  our products to the current specifications and needs of consumers. Close collaboration with partners  In addition to our work in the Together for Sustainability initiative, Henkel  is a member of    AIM-PROGRESS, a forum of companies from the  consumer goods industry. The objective here is also to encourage member   companies to share experiences in the area of sustainable sourcing  and utilize synergies. The forum also focuses on holding regional supplier  events to improve sustainability performance within the value chain.  We are also a founding member of the    Action for Sustainable Deriva- tives (ASD) initiative. It brings together organizations from along the  palm oil derivative supply chain to support efforts to increase transpar- ency and promote compliance with NDPE (No Deforestation, No Peat,  No Exploitation) principles to positively transform the palm oil industry.

This topic is already highly relevant for investors and the  global financial markets today and is increasingly gaining in importance.  This means that the proportion of investors who use sustainability   criteria as a basis for both their strategic portfolio management and their  specific investment decisions is increasing. Institutional investors are  increasingly including sustainability in their risk and opportunity  management, as they are  convinced that sustainable companies are  more successful in the long term. This development is also being  actively promoted by political decision-makers at global level – with  concrete legal requirements and initiatives for greater climate and   environmental protection. For example, the European Commission’s     “Green Deal” includes measures for the financial market. In this  respect, sustainability is an increasingly critical success factor for  competitiveness as an issuer on the capital market. ESG (Environment,  Social, Governance) is therefore a key pillar of our financing strategy. Integrated dialog with our shareholders For many years now, we have been engaged in intensive dialog with  our shareholders on the topic of sustainability. As part of our capital  market communications, we regularly report on our strategy, goals, and  concrete initiatives and progress in this area. Sustainability has been an  integral part of our financial reporting in our Annual Report since 2001.  It is also a significant topic at our Annual Press Conference as well as  Annual General Meeting – not least because it is deeply anchored in  Henkel’s corporate strategy, culture and values. In addition, we engage  with investors both in one-on-one meetings as well as at conferences  and roadshows. In particular, events with a special focus on ESG offer an  important platform for these exchanges. We also provide transparent  information about our positions, activities and progress in the area of  sustainability by responding to in-depth questionnaires from investors.  This also provides us with detailed insights into the interests and  requirements of capital market players with regard to relevant ESG criteria. Sustainable financing Henkel implemented innovative solutions in the area of  sustainable  finance at an early stage. We introduced an ESG Framework for Pension  Asset Management in 2015 and updated it in 2020 by integrating  ESG  ratings for active fund managers and ESG index benchmarks for  passively managed investments. In 2018, Henkel was the first company in  Germany to conclude a syndicated    “Sustainability-Linked Loan,” a  “ Sustainability criteria  continue gaining importance  in investment decisions and  hence also in our Investor  Relations activities. We have  once again demonstrated  our commitment to sustain- able finance and integrated  ESG as a central pillar in our  financing strategy.” MARCO SWOBODA CFO and Executive Vice President Finance / Purchasing / Global Business  Solutions HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  52 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  credit facility linked to Henkel’s performance in the Sustainalytics,  EcoVadis and ISS-oekom sustainability ratings. In July 2020, we also  became the first company worldwide to issue a    “Plastic Waste Reduction  Bond”. The bond consists of two tranches of 70 million US dollars and  25 million euros and has a maturity of five years. The proceeds will be  exclusively invested in projects participating in Henkel’s activities to  reduce plastic waste. This bond underscores our commitment to pro- moting a circular economy and reducing plastic waste. We further expanded our commitment to sustainable finance in October  2021, by defining the    “Sustainable Finance Framework”. This     framework enables the issuance of two types of bonds: Sustainability-  Linked Bonds and Green Bonds. The financing costs for Sustainability-  Linked Bonds are linked to the achievement of sustainability targets,  while the proceeds from the issuance of Green Bonds are used exclusively  for sustainable investments. The framework was reviewed by the inde- pendent ESG rating agency ISS ESG, which confirmed the environmental  added value and the compliance of the framework with the Green  Bond and Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles of the International   Capital Market Association (ICMA). Henkel successfully issued two     Sustainability- Linked Bonds with a volume of 720 million euros  under the framework in November 2021.  With this “Sustainable Finance Framework,” we aim to align our business  as well as our financing with our commitments and values by creating a  direct link between our → sustainability strategy and our funding strategy.  This underscores our commitment to achieving our sustainability targets,  as well as our Henkel Finance team’s ongoing commitment to actively  supporting our sustainability agenda. EU taxonomy  In view of global warming, the European states have committed themselves  to more climate protection. In this regard, both the Paris Climate  Agreement and the European Green Deal view sustainable investments  as an important starting point. A key instrument in this context is the     EU taxonomy – an EU-wide classification system for sustainable  economic activities with the aim of promoting investment in them. According to the “Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to  facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU)  2019/2088,” an economic activity is considered environmentally   sustainable if it substantially contributes to achieving one or more of  the environmental objectives. At the same time, an economic activity  must not significantly harm the other environmental objectives. The  environmental objectives defined in terms of the Taxonomy Regulation  are: climate change  mitigation; climate change adaptation; the sustainable  use and protection of water and marine resources; the transition to a   circular economy;  pollution prevention and control; and the protection  and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. In addition, the economic  activity must be carried out in compliance with the minimum social  safeguards and comply with the technical screening criteria established  by the EU Commission by means of delegated acts. The technical screening  criteria specify the performance requirements for a specific economic  activity, determining under what conditions the activity makes a substan- tial contribution to achieving a particular environmental objective and  does not significantly harm the other objectives.

The Delegated Act covers economic activities of about 40 per- cent of listed companies in sectors that account for nearly 80 percent of  direct greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. These sectors include energy,  forestry, manufacturing, transport, and buildings. After a thorough examination involving all of our relevant business units  and functions, we came to the conclusion that our economic activities  are not covered under the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act and are  consequently not taxonomy-eligible. We therefore deduce that  Henkel, with its core business activities, is not identified as a relevant  source of emissions. Consequently, the share of taxonomy-eligible   economic activities accounts for 0 percent of our total sales and – as a  consequence – the related capital expenditures as well as operating  expenses also amount to 0 percent. The share of taxonomy non-eligible  economic activities in our total sales and capital expenditures and   operating expenses therefore amounts to 100 percent. In addition, the capital expenditures and operating expenses to be  reported include those related to the acquisition of production from  taxonomy-aligned economic activities and to individual measures that  reduce the carbon footprint or greenhouse gas emissions of the target  activities, as well as to individual building renovation measures. As the  reporting requirements for fiscal year 2021 relate exclusively to   taxonomy- eligible investments and expenditures and reliable statements  on taxonomy-alignment are not possible or such an assessment is not  required for this reporting period, we are unable to report any correspond- ing expenditures here either. We did not take into account the “Draft  Commission Notice” published on February 2, 2022, as the drafting  process was almost complete at that time. We will continue to intensively examine whether our economic activities  are covered by the delegated acts yet to be adopted on the remaining four  environmental objectives.

Turnover is determined  in accordance with IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.  For more information on revenue, please refer to the corresponding  item “Sales” in the consolidated income statement on page 180 of the     Annual Report 2021. For more information on the principles of revenue  recognition, please refer to section 24 (pages 273 and 274) of the Annual  Report 2021. The determination of capital expenditure (CapEx) follows  IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment” (IAS 16.73(e)(i) and (iii)), as well as  IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” (38.118(e)(i)) and IFRS 16 “Leases” (IFRS 16.53(h)).  Capital expenditures for 2021 are calculated based on the aggregate of  the corresponding lines “Acquisitions,” “Additions to existing operations,”  and “Additions of right-of-use assets” under property, plant and equipment  in the Annual Report 2021 on page 211, as well as “Acquisitions” and  “Additions” under intangible assets, page 205 in the Annual Report 2021.  Goodwill is not included in capital expenditures in the context of EU  taxonomy reporting. For more information on property, plant and  equipment, intangible assets and leases, please refer to pages 205 to 215  of the Annual Report 2021. For estimates, assumptions and judgments  in connection with the aforementioned key performance indicators,  please refer to page 197 of the Annual Report 2021.  Operating expenses (OpEx) include direct non-capitalized costs that  relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-  term leases, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures  relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equip- ment. This includes research and development expenses recognized as  an expense in our income statement during the reporting period in  accordance with IAS 38 (see page 275 of our Annual Report 2021). Lease  expenses were determined in accordance with IFRS 16 and include  expenses for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets (see page  214 of our Annual Report 2021). Maintenance and repair, and any other  direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of  property, plant and equipment as well as building renovation measures  are determined and allocated appropriately.  Direct costs for training and similar expenses are not included in the  numerator and denominator, as Annex I to Art. 8 of the Delegated Act  lists these costs only for the numerator, which does not allow for a  mathematically meaningful calculation of the OpEx KPI.

In parallel, we also want to continuously  improve our energy efficiency. In line with our vision, the sites will  become    climate-positive in terms of their carbon balance when surplus  CO2-free energy that Henkel does not need for its own purposes is supplied  to third parties. Along the journey toward this goal, we are still pursuing  our target of making a 65-percent reduction in the carbon footprint of  our production sites by 2025 compared to the base year 2010. In addition  to the major opportunities presented by the accelerated transition to  climate-neutral solutions, we also see a number of challenges, including  changing framework conditions and accounting methods that differ  around the world, as well as the local availability of climate-neutral  technologies. “ As market leader for adhe­ sives, sealants and functional  coatings, we are making  an important contribution  to climate protection by  becoming climate­positive  and leveraging our technolo­ gies and solutions to enable  CO2 savings along the value  chain.” JAN-DIRK AURIS Member of the Management Board Adhesive Technologies Our climate change mitigation activities Climate change is one of the major global challenges of our time.  We are committed to the 1.5 degree target of the Paris Climate Agreement.  We take → climate change and its impacts into account as part of our  sustainability and risk management approach, and across our entire  value chain. It is  relevant for us from two perspectives: One is the potential  impact of our business activities on the global greenhouse gas balance,  and the other is the potential impact of climate change on our business  activities. In the context of our → sustainability strategy, we consider  our direct and indirect CO2 emissions and their potential impact on the  climate. We are starting by focusing on our own sites, which we can  influence directly. We plan to achieve a reduction in the carbon footprint  of our production. We will achieve this by continuously → improving  our energy efficiency and by increasingly making use of power, especially  electricity, that is generated by → renewable sources.  We are always exploring ways to achieve climate neutrality faster for  selected sites. Based on our progress in these areas and the experience  we have gained, we have decided to bring forward our ambition for 2040  by ten years: By 2030, we intend to achieve a → climate-positive carbon  footprint for our production sites. To do this, we are planning to replace the fuels we need to generate thermal  energy at our sites with CO2-free alternatives such as biogas or biomass  by no later than 2030. We continue to strive towards our existing goal of  sourcing 100 percent of the electricity we purchase for production  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  60 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  In addition to our activities at our own sites, we want to leverage our  influence on areas of our value chain that are particularly relevant to  CO2 emissions. We determine this data using the recognized methods of  the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Analysis shows that the product  use phase has the greatest impact on our CO2 footprint. Our products  are used in millions of households and industrial processes every day.  Accordingly, our goal is to work with our customers, consumers and  suppliers to save 100 million metric tons of CO2 over the ten-year period  from 2016 to 2025. To achieve this, we have developed a CO2 savings  portfolio that can be used as a basis for quantifying the exact contributions  made by products to reducing emissions. We also want to reduce the  footprint of the raw materials and packaging that we use by 30 percent  by 2030 compared to a 2017 baseline. One component of this is our  packaging strategy, as CO2 emissions can be reduced by using recycled  material, for example.  In 2020, the    Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) confirmed that  our science-based emissions reduction targets, which we derived based  on our long-term goals, are consistent with the initiative’s criteria. Our  targets for Henkel’s greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) are in line  with the reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  We have committed to reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions per metric  ton of product by 67 percent by 2030 compared to 2017, and we have  converted our existing climate targets with the reference year 2010  accordingly to the more current reference year 2017. Our    target for  value chain emissions (Scope 3) also meets SBTi’s criteria for ambitious  value chain targets, which means it is in line with best practice. By  2030, we aim to reduce our emissions from raw materials and packaging  that meet Scope 3.1 “Goods and Services” of the GHG Protocol by 30 per- cent per  metric ton of product compared to 2017.  The effects of climate change on potential risks and   opportunities When assessing the potential impact of climate change on our business  activities, we consider the entire value chain – from the raw materials  we purchase through to the marketing of our products. We draw on the  findings of our comprehensive risk and opportunity assessment process.  We identify and assess climate-related risks based on the recommenda- tions of the    Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD). The recommendations made by the reporting department are  assigned to the core areas of governance, strategy and risk management  of a company. This framework addresses how an organization manages  climate- related risks and opportunities, how the actual and potential  impacts of climate- related risks and opportunities on the company’s  business are assessed, and how the organization identifies, assesses,  and manages climate- related risks if they are considered to be material. To this end, we identify relevant impacts in two major risk categories:  transition risks associated with the transition to a low-emission economy  and society; and physical risks, such as the increased probability of  extreme weather events in the future. In line with the timeframe of our  current sustainability strategy and our Group-wide risk management  approach, we are initially focusing on the period up to 2030. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  61 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  With respect to sourcing, the raw material palm (kernel) oil is particularly  interesting, as the yield of the plantations and consequently prices are  influenced by prevailing weather conditions. Our main focus is on   monitoring the El Niño weather phenomenon and managing its impacts.  Based on the scenarios issued by the IPCC and IEA that we have applied,  we do not expect any climate changes in the period up to 2030 that  would lead to a significant long-term increase in the prices of our palm  (kernel) oil-based raw materials. We primarily based our analysis of possible climate-related production  losses on the new    IPCC report published in 2021. Henkel will continue  to develop its assessment of these risks in the future, even though  we  currently assume that the risk to our sites from intensified climate  events is low, based on the current interpretation of the climate scenarios.  Where relevant, we have put in place a system for managing weather and  other geohazards.  The transition risks also present opportunities for Henkel: to position  itself as a company with a proactive climate protection strategy, to  improve its own competitiveness by optimizing its production and raw  material base, and to create added value for customers and consumers  with  innovative solutions and strong brands. Henkel’s CO2 savings  portfolio provides examples of this.    More information about our  TCFD reporting is available on our website. To explore the potential impacts of climate change, one of the sources  we use is data from transition scenarios developed by the    International  Energy Agency (IEA) and from climate scenarios conducted by the     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The scenarios  are based on different assumptions of potential climate warming. We  have considered the following risks: The main transition risks for Henkel include the potential financial  impact of a significant increase in the price of CO2. By analyzing the CO2  price developments based on different climate scenarios, we have  identified potential risks both for production and along the value chain.  We have assessed the potential direct and indirect effects on the costs of  energy, products and services purchased by Henkel if the widely intro- duced price of CO2 rises. We did this in the context of other price factors  and possible feedback effects. We expect to help reduce potential long- term risks by implementing our medium and long-term climate change  mitigation targets. We have also examined the physical risks for Henkel. Our focus was on  the risks associated with our raw material sourcing and on direct risks to  our production from potential climate-related changes in the frequency  and intensity of weather events such as heavy rain, droughts or floods. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  62 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  conditions in the countries in question. Accordingly, we are continuously  reviewing our timetable and strategy for decarbonizing our production  sites. Our considerations also take into account the results of the  negotiations at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in 2021.  Driving the conversion to renewable energy We are focusing on a combination of the following three models to   transition to 100 percent renewables by 2030: on-site production, direct  purchases and virtual coverage. By 2030, we aim to replace the last  remaining fossil fuels that we use in our production to generate process  energy by switching to carbon-neutral alternatives such as biogas or bio- mass. We also aim to supply surplus carbon- neutral energy that Henkel  does not need for its own purposes to third parties – thus becoming a  climate-positive company in our production. In doing so, we will avoid  emissions from our own activities, and also enable third parties to use  carbon-neutral energy. Since August 2021, the    Henkel Fragrance Center in Krefeld in the  Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit in Germany has been operating on a  CO2-neutral basis, making it the first Henkel site to switch its production  completely to CO2-neutral energy. We have been operating a 17,000 square  meter solar plant at our largest Beauty Care site in Wassertrüdingen,   Germany, since the beginning of 2021, generating 1,675 megawatt hours  (MWh) of green electricity per year. Combined with the conversion to  biogas, the  production facilities have been operated with 100 percent  renewable energy since August 2021. Significantly reducing the carbon footprint   in production Becoming climate-positive by 2030 In light of the need to reduce emissions and decarbonize the economy,  we pursue the ambition of converting our production sites to a    climate-  positive CO2 balance by 2030, which will make an active contribution  toward    climate protection.  The net carbon footprint of our production is around 475,000 metric  tons of CO2 and is attributable to the fuels we use ourselves (Scope 1) and  the energy purchased (Scope 2), in particular electricity. To date, we have  been able to achieve a reduction of 50 percent CO2 emissions per ton of  product (2021 vs. 2010). Our target is an overall reduction of 65 percent by  2025 (vs. 2010). We are continuously developing our climate strategy in the area of pro- duction, drawing on internal experts and our partner network. In 2021,  we hosted a number of strategic workshops in collaboration with external  partners to critically examine our ambitions, and to identify opportunities  and risks. The main factors to be taken into account in this context are the  continuously evolving energy markets, potential changes to the  legislative  framework, and technical innovations. For example, determining the  optimal supply strategy for each site requires intensive analysis of the  changing emissions trading systems and carbon markets. The  reason for  this is that we purchase electricity as well as thermal energy, and we  use energy sources that can be subject to rapidly changing framework  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  63 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Our production facility for detergents and cleaning products in Düssel- dorf, Germany, is aiming to meet the important milestone of becoming  carbon neutral by the beginning of 2022. To achieve this goal, the site is  accelerating its shift to renewable energy sources, including the use of  biogas for various processes. While we have already been using 100 percent  renewable electricity for our laundry detergent production in Düsseldorf-  Holthausen since 2020, we have now also been sourcing the thermal  energy required for liquid laundry detergent and dishwasher tab production  from renewable sources since July 2021. In our role as site operator at our  headquarters in Düsseldorf-Holthausen, we provide electricity and heat  to third parties. Our power station uses fossil energies (such as natural  gas) and renewable energies (such as biogas). We separate the CO2  emissions caused by generating energy for external third parties from  the energy that we use for our own production activities at this site. We  use the term “net emissions” when describing this situation. By the end of 2021, we had fully converted 21 countries to 100 percent  renewable electricity, and we managed to increase the proportion of our  electricity purchase that comes from renewable sources to 68 percent  during the entire year. We also have concrete plans to accelerate our  respective sourcing and continue to fully convert further countries to  green power in order to reduce the current use of fossil fuels.   Through a gradual conversion of the sites to renewable energy through  the use of the three models shown in the box on the right, we will be able  to meet the individual circumstances and the energy needs. 21 countries entirely transitioned   to 100 % renewable electricity Three models of conversion to renewable energy On-site production:   This model involves generating  green power at our sites through  wind turbines, solar cells or other  technologies. The infrastructure  is either funded by Henkel itself  or paid for by collaboration with  external partners.  Direct purchase: For this model, we purchase  green power straight from  the grid of a local energy   utility company, or as part of  a long-term Power Purchase  Agreement (PPA). Virtual coverage:   If the two options above cannot be  implemented at one of our sites,  green power requirements can be  covered virtually. For example, by  entering into long-term PPAs that  feed green power from sites into  the supply grid in an amount that   is equal to the amount consumed. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  64 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Climate change mitigation initiatives of the business units Digitalization is the key to making our production sites climate-positive,  because it serves as a driver for sustainability. We were once again   recognized as an “Advanced 4th Industrial Revolution Lighthouse” by the  World Economic Forum and McKinsey &amp; Company for our achievements  in this area. An independent panel of experts recognized Henkel’s     Laundry &amp; Home Care production facility in Toluca, Mexico, in Sep- tember 2021 and    Montornès del Vallès, Spain, in March 2020, as a  global “Lighthouse” project and pioneer for    Industry 4.0. The Mexican  plant is one of our five largest Laundry &amp; Home Care sites in the world.  This is our third such award. The other two were in 2020 for    Laundry &amp;  Home Care’s two Lighthouse factories in Düsseldorf, Germany, and –  as mentioned above – Montornès del Vallès, Spain. In addition, the Forum  named the Holthausen plant in Düsseldorf a    “Sustainability Lighthouse”  in 2021. We now operate one of the three most sustainable production  sites in the Global Lighthouse Network and three Industry 4.0 best  practice factories. This showcases our potential in using Fourth Industrial  Revolution (4IR) technologies in manufacturing for environmental  responsibility and sustainable business. This positions us as part of  a community of production sites that are leading the world in the   introduction and integration of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies  at the cutting edge.  One example of our achievements in this area is the decarbonization of  the energy-intensive spray drying of powder detergents. To this end, we  use our measured values to set up a “digital twin” – a cloud-based 3D  replica of the plant, where we simulated operations to arrive at optimal  process parameters for the facility. We are planning to scale up these  Industry 4.0 applications to further improve the sustainability perfor- mance of all of our spray tower sites.  Henkel uses smart factory tools to make greater use of methods for  improved planning, sourcing, manufacturing and logistics. Data-driven,  intelligent systems are used to control machines and optimize production  processes in real time – including energy consumption. Our    factory  in Kurkumbh, India, was designed as a smart factory of this kind and  engineered using lean manufacturing concepts. This helps to optimize  the organization of material flows to increase productivity, minimize  waste and reduce emissions. Highly efficient equipment and digital  technology are used to optimize processes, and the plant has smart  systems for  ventilation, air conditioning and lighting. Solar panels,  covering an area of 7,000 square meters of the roof, generate more than  1,000,000 kilowatt hours of energy and save about 800 metric tons of  CO2 annually.  Increased energy efficiency Our business units continuously strive to increase energy efficiency in  our existing sites and are stepping up the use of renewable energy   systems. This effort entails regular upgrades, such as converting to LEDs  and expanding solar installations. In Bogotá, Colombia, we installed a  closed-loop plumbing system to transport heated water for the production  of hair and body care products, reducing CO2 emissions by 33 metric tons  per year. Henkel Adhesive Technologies has also launched a multi-year  solar energy program. In China, for example, solar modules have been  installed at four production sites. The combined installed capacity totals  1.64 megawatts (MW). Together, the sites produce more than 1,700 MWh  of solar power.

Our approach to reducing our logistics footprint starts in the product  development stage. This is why we are optimizing our products and the  related packaging in terms of weight and volume, whenever it is  possible  to do so without compromising performance, convenience or stability.  More concentrated products and → lighter packaging reduce transport  weight, which decreases the amount of fuel required during transport  and reduces the related emissions. Improving our logistics structures  also helps to reduce transport emissions. Our approach takes the location  of our production sites into account. For bulkier products, we reduce  transport distances and environmental impact by operating regional  production sites. For compact products, we leverage efficiencies  in production by manufacturing these products centrally whenever   possible. For transportation and logistics for finished goods, we focus  our efforts on three major drivers:  Sustainability from the very beginning We plan to integrate innovative and environmentally compatible tech- nologies into our new production facilities, starting from the initial  design. Our new    production facility in Songdo, South Korea, has  paved the way for energy-efficient production. This site uses solar panels  and energy- efficient equipment, as well as rainwater for water supply.  Biodiversity is also ensured by maintaining grassland around the site (start  of construction 08/2019). This site will be the future global production  center for the electronics business of Henkel Adhesive Technologies. The  facility received LEED Gold certification from the    US Green Building  Council in 2021 in recognition of its energy-efficient design. Innovative approaches for the purchase of sustainable electricity We continue to assess    virtual power purchase agreements (“VPPAs”)  for sites at which the electricity needs cannot be met through on-site  generation or direct procurement from renewables. We achieved this in  the US in 2021, with a new wind power project in Texas that is being  developed by a utility company.  Low-emission logistics and mobility Optimizing transport and logistics processes Our responsibility along the entire value chain also includes optimizing  our    transport and logistics processes in terms of environmental  compatibility and resource efficiency. We set ourselves the overall aim to  reduce the emissions from transporting our products by around 15 percent  between 2015 and 2025. We also aim to use renewable electricity at  Product transports per transport mode in 2021 Airplane  1 % Truck  63 % Rail  10 % Ship  26 % HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  66 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  individual factories and warehouses. We also make use of the “mega  warehouse” concept, where a small group of main distribution centers  store products until the required quantities are due for on-time delivery  to regional warehouses and retailers.   • Optimizing transport: We continuously increase the capacity utili- zation of our cargo containers by expanding our pooling activities.  This includes the targeted consolidation of transport and storage of  similar product categories within Henkel, as well as combining  transport with other manufacturers. In addition, closely collaborating  with our customers further helps to optimize our processes. The  resulting  synergies in storage, consignment and transportation ensure  that more fully loaded trucks travel to our customers’ central warehouses.  We also rent pallets instead of buying them. This makes it more efficient  to collect them and improves the management of damaged pallets.  Where possible, we utilize reusable cardboard pallets instead of wooden  pallets. Due to their lighter weight, they are easier to handle and reduce  fuel consumption. We have recently continued to streamline our pallet  use, and we have implemented various solutions to reduce the overall  use of pallets and increase their reuse rate.  We leverage these three drivers through close collaboration with our   suppliers and customers to implement joint logistics projects. We also  use advanced digital solutions and alternative propulsion systems for  transport. When choosing our transport partners, we consider efficiency,  environmental compatibility and safety performance. Relevant criteria  are included in our tendering and decision-making processes for the  purchase of logistics services.  • Expanding intermodal transport: Intermodal transport involves  using more than one mode of transportation. At Henkel, this means  more of our transports are being switched from road to rail. This process  begins with a truck carrying the goods to the nearest rail loading  ter minal. From there, the goods cover longer distances by train, before  a second truck collects the goods at the destination terminal and delivers  them to the customer. This allows us to make use of the lower CO2  footprint of rail transport compared to road transport, since a train  emits about one-third of the CO2 of a truck when transporting the same  weight of goods. For this reason, intermodal transport has become a key  driver for CO2 reduction in logistics at Henkel. Through our dedicated  tendering processes, we are adding further train routes in Europe to  support our shift toward intermodal transport. We stepped up these  efforts further in 2021. Since May 2021, detergents and cleaning  products produced at our site in Kruševac, Serbia, have been trans- ported to Vienna by truck and from there to Düsseldorf by rail. This  approach saved about 280 tons of CO2 in 2021. This project is an  important step for Henkel in expanding intermodal transport, because  the route was previously served exclusively by trucks. We have also  increased the share of intermodal transports on the Hungary–  Düsseldorf route by 360 more transports per year.  • Improving our warehouse network: We select the location of our  warehouses and distribution centers to optimize the routes between  our production sites and our customers. A “wall-to-wall production”  approach, where the warehouse is directly connected to the production  facility, minimizes transport from production to storage. Where this is  not in place, we achieve synergies by consolidating transport between  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  67 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Future mobility  Beyond the use of advanced digital tools, alternative propulsion types  also form part of our approach to optimizing transport and logistics. We  are testing the operational capability of vehicles powered by alternative  propulsion systems at our sites. At our headquarters in Düsseldorf, we  have, for example, incorporated around 43 electric vehicles into the  internal fleet since 2012 to replace conventional vehicles with internal  combustion engines. In 2021, we also converted the first in-house vans  to purely electric vehicles. We have built a corresponding infrastructure  with over 120 charging stations in and around the industrial park, ten of  them in cooperation with the utility company Stadtwerke Düsseldorf.  Our vehicle policy for electric and hybrid cars also gives our employees  in Germany the option of driving an electric or hybrid vehicle as a  company car.  In 2019, the first hydrogen-powered vehicle was added to the internal  fleet at our Düsseldorf plant, and a hydrogen filling station was installed.  To promote hydrogen mobility, Henkel has been actively engaged over  the past few years in various initiatives and research projects, such as  “Modellregion Wasserstoffmobilität NRW Düssel.Rhein.Wupper.” How- ever, hydrogen mobility solutions suitable for our logistics operations  are not currently available for mass production. For this reason, we are  exploring several alternatives for sustainable logistics that are ready to  contribute today. The deployment of conventional combustion engines that run on   Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), which is mainly composed of methane,  is one of the technologies that we are implementing into our business  operations as part of our journey toward more sustainable mobility.  Digital tools for improved logistics  Our transport management system systematically captures the CO2   emissions of our logistics operations and makes our transport planning  and implementation even more efficient across all business units and  countries. Higher truck capacity utilization and optimized routes play a   particularly important role in reducing transport kilometers, cutting fuel  consumption and saving CO2.  Our progress is presented using a digital tool that calculates the environ- mental impact of transportation for all modes of transport based on  the DIN EN 16258 standard. Inputs include actual distances based on GPS  data, country-specific emission factors, and data from the respective  modes of transportation. The combined application of both IT solutions enables us to foster trans- parency and data comparability across the entire industry, and helps us  to track progress toward our emissions reduction target. By the end of  2021, Henkel had achieved a reduction in transport-related emissions  of about 14 percent compared to 2015. Our logistics emissions have been  calculated using a new methodology developed by our service  provider  ETW since 2021. By recalculating the values for the previous year, we  intend to have in place a method for reliably tracking progress made  towards the target. Progress in the previous target period from 2015 to  2020 is not affected. – 14 % lower transport-related CO2   emissions per ton of product* * Base year 2015 HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  68 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  CNG produces the least amount of CO2 of all types of fossil fuel combustion.  As a test, we have continuously operated CNG-powered trucks for delivery  runs on the route between Serbia and Austria since 2021. The use of a  CNG powered truck saves about 14 percent of CO2 emissions on this  route compared to a conventional diesel truck. Trucks powered by   liquefied natural gas (LNG) are another alternative mobility solution for  Henkel. Since 2020, two LNG-powered trucks have been traveling on our  supply routes from Düsseldorf to Bönen, Germany, and Barcelona, Spain.  The technology saves 20 percent of CO2 compared to conventional diesel  trucks. In 2021, the Düsseldorf site logistics operations commissioned  another LNG truck, which will also be used on the Düsseldorf–Bönen  supply route. Alongside transport to locations outside of our company’s premises, we  also make use of alternative transport modes for internal deliveries at  our sites. In the context of future mobility, we also seek to reduce trans- port-related emissions by generating a holistic, modern and sustainable  concept to foster our staff’s mobility. The contribution of our products and technologies  to climate change mitigation  Leverage along the value chain Together with our customers, consumers and suppliers, we aim to  achieve reductions in CO2 emissions. This includes emissions from the  raw materials we use. We also want to help customers and consumers  reduce CO2 emissions that are generated when they use our products  (called Scope 3 emissions). In addition, we want our products and  technologies to help to avoid CO2 emissions from being generated (called  Scope 4 emissions).  Through our brands and technologies, we make products that are used  and applied in ways that are directly linked to the use of energy, such as  detergents, shower gels, or hotmelt adhesives. We want to enable the  efficient use of energy with innovations that cut energy consumption and  the related CO2 footprint. On top of this, we use targeted communications  activities to encourage responsible-minded behavior when our products  are being used. The importance of the use phase is also shown in the     Henkel footprint calculator. It shows that not only companies, but  also each individual can make a contribution to greater sustainability  through their behavior. The calculator enables users to calculate their  personal carbon footprint in just a few minutes. By answering simple  questions, they can quickly estimate how much CO2 they generate  through their own lifestyle in the areas of housing, food, mobility or  vacations and leisure activities.  The initiative    “Be smarter. Save water.” from Beauty Care is one example.  Launched in 2016, this initiative involves our Schauma, Fa and Theramed  brands, and it aims to raise consumer awareness about the responsible  use of water as an important resource. Using less hot water also results  in less CO2 emissions. More than 190,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions  could be saved each year if consumers of our products shortened their  shower times by an average of 15 percent. The initiative includes  information provided on the product packaging and a related website.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  69 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Lower water temperatures when washing clothes also help to reduce  energy use and CO2 emissions. Through continuous research and develop- ment partnerships, as well as significant investments in new formulations,  we enable our consumers to achieve excellent washing results when  using increasingly concentrated dosages at lower temperatures – or even  when washing laundry in cold water. We raise awareness of the need to  save energy by placing the “be sustainable – wash cold” logo on our laundry  detergent packaging to draw consumers’ attention to this topic. The  potential for savings is enormous: if no water had to be heated for any  of the loads of laundry washed with our heavy-duty detergents, it would  be possible to avoid around 6.4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions  each year. Henkel’s CO2 savings portfolio In relation to the leverage points we have identified along our value  chain, we have set a target of saving 100 million metric tons of CO2  together with our customers, consumers and suppliers over the ten-year  period from 2016 to 2025. We have developed a CO2-savings portfolio 1 for  this purpose. The evaluation of the contributions in this portfolio is  based on a company-wide, standardized process that sets out the criteria  for the selection of the products and the calculation of CO2 emissions.  In the following pages, we have summarized some examples of our  products and technologies in the following six groups, which contribute  to → energy and material efficiency. With regard to the products sold  between 2016 and 2021, we enabled our customers and consumers to  reduce CO2 emissions by more than 68 million metric tons. In the future,  we plan to evaluate additional applications and further expand the  portfolio of products that contribute to CO2 savings in the use phase. New product developments One aspect of product optimization in our Adhesive Technologies business  unit is the switch from solvent-based adhesives to water-based solutions.  Water-based adhesives generate lower emissions of volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs) and also help to save CO2 emissions. We have developed  an innovative water-based adhesive technology for sports shoes that  enables to reduce CO2 emissions significantly during the bonding process. The    N.A.E. brand of solid shower care products gently cleanses and   supports the skin’s natural moisture balance. Due to its concentrated   formula, the solid shower care product is as economical as three liquid  shower gels (200 ml each), with lower weight and volume. This results in  lower CO2 emissions during transport. The packaging is also made from  FSC-certified paper and is fully recyclable.  Another innovation in the consumer goods business is the Love Nature  brand. This is the first brand of the recently established company, Love  Nature GmbH. It is a wholly-owned Henkel subsidiary and belongs to the  Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit. The new Love Nature detergents,  Universal Cactus Leaves and Color Cherry Blossom, are plant-based.  They have cleaning power at washing temperatures as low as 20 degrees  Celsius, which helps to save resources. As another product example, the  Love Nature bath cleaner can be applied either directly with a sponge or  with a spray attachment that is sold separately and can be reused. “Mein  Spülmittel” and “Mein Waschmittel” are also available for refilling at  Love Nature refill stations. 1 Further information can be found in the    methodology document for Scope 4.

In addition, our “cool  roof” coatings, which reflect 87 percent more sunlight than conventional  roof coatings, reduce the consumption of energy because fewer air condi- tioning units are needed. The products sold in 2021 enabled our customers  to save around 6 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.  Repair and renovation  Our industrial coating products enable our customers to protect machinery  like pumps against wear and tear, and extend their lifetime. Machinery of  this kind is often operated continuously, which can cause abrasion and  corrosion – leading to production downtime. With our coatings, customers  are able to increase operational efficiency by reducing energy consumption  or making it possible to use the machine for longer. The products sold in  2021 enabled our customers to save around 400,000 metric tons of CO2  emissions. Lightweight vehicle designs We support our industrial customers with solutions for lightweight auto- motive designs. This includes pretreatments for metal surfaces that make  it possible to combine steel and aluminum, as well as liquid soundproofing  and 3D reinforcement technologies. These solutions all contribute to  weight reduction in the chassis and increase fuel efficiency. The solutions  sold in 2021 saved around 3.4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions for our  customers. Intelligent material replacement  Our adhesive solutions make it easy to sustainably replace emission-  intensive materials. An example of this is our Loctite Threadlocker. Even a  small quantity of this product matches the performance of conventional  steel washers for securing screws. This saves a significant amount of steel,  which is an emission-intensive material. Another example is our Liofol  Purbond HB adhesives, which are used to manufacture wood composites  and replace CO2-intensive concrete construction. The products sold in  2021 enabled our customers to save around 620,000 metric tons of CO2  emissions.  More efficient renewable energy  Our electro-conductive adhesives enable manufacturers of photovoltaic  modules to increase the efficiency of solar panels. More solar cells can be  installed in each module, and the loss of conductivity within the module  can be reduced. This enables the modules to generate more renewable  energy. The products that we sold in 2021 helped our customers to save  around 1.7 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.  Consuming less hot water  We help consumers by providing products that can reduce energy con- sumption for warming up water, as well as the related CO2 emissions. With  our Laundry &amp; Home Care products Colour Catcher laundry sheets and  Somat dishwasher cleaner, customers can reduce the number of washing  cycles. In addition, leave-in conditioners and dry shampoos from Beauty  Care do not require warm water for rinsing. The products sold in 2021  enabled consumers to save around 200,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions. Contributions to energy efficiency Contributions to material efficiency HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  71 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  “ To continue promoting the  circular economy in our  business operations, we are  focusing on reducing pro­ duction waste and increasing  recycling at our sites, as well  as on innovative, intelligent  and sustainable packaging  concepts.” BRUNO PIACENZA Executive Vice President   Laundry &amp; Home Care CIRCULAR ECONOMY Closing material cycles and increasing resource  efficiency Decoupling  economic growth from the consumption of finite natural  resources and developing a    circular economy are key approaches to  sustainable value creation.  Reducing or completely eliminating packaging material, especially for  our consumer goods, is the best way to minimize waste and the related  negative environmental effects. Our goal is to reduce the amount of  packaging material we use to a minimum – without compromising the   quality, performance or safety of our products. All of our    packaging is  designed to provide the level of performance consumers expect while  using the minimum amount of packaging and the most sustainable  materials possible.  At the same time, resource consumption can be reduced if materials are  kept within the cycles of the economy for as long as possible. As a result,  our mission is to include materials from sustainable sources into smart  designs to close the loop. To achieve this goal, our packaging engineers  work closely with partners along the entire value chain in the areas of  design methods, modern production technologies and sustainable  materials. In our Adhesive Technologies business unit, we also pursue the approach  of using our high-quality, innovative packaging adhesives to support  other companies in their implementation of a circular economy, for  example, by facilitating recyclability. We have also set the goal of helping  our industrial customers to make their products even more suitable for a   circular economy. To accomplish this, we are focusing on innovative  solutions that facilitate recycling and on the separation of materials to  make it possible to repair, reuse and refurbish products and product parts.  Henkel is also pursuing a variety of approaches to implement closed-loop  recycling in its own production processes. In this area, we emphasize  efficient waste management at our sites.

The packaging  quantity shown does not include the packaging of products from contract manufacturers and trade  products. What we want to achieve with packaging Our goals for packaging by 2025 are:  • 100 percent of Henkel’s packaging will be designed for recyclability or  reusability. 1  • We aim to reduce the amount of virgin plastics from fossil sources in  our consumer products by 50 percent. We will achieve this by increasing  the proportion of recycled plastic to more than 30 percent, by reducing  the plastic volume, and by increasingly using bio-based plastics.  • We want to help prevent waste from entering the environment. In  order to achieve this, we are supporting waste collection and recycling  initiatives. We invest in innovative solutions and technologies to pro- mote closed-loop recycling, and we aim to enable contact 2 with more  than 2 billion consumers per year by providing targeted information  about recycling. Alongside this, we aim for 100 percent of the paper and cardboard we use  for packaging to be made of recycled material or, where virgin fiber is  required, to come from fresh fiber originating from sustainable forestry.  We also want to remove and avoid polyvinyl chlorides (PVC) and other  substances of potential concern.  Promoting the circular economy  Our strategy to promote the    circular economy for packaging is centered  around three pillars: 1. Intelligent packaging design and reduction of packaging  material Reducing packaging material by using smart solutions is the best way  to minimize waste and the related negative environmental effects. Inno- vative design is essential in replacing virgin materials with recycled or  renewable alternatives wherever possible, which makes it possible to use  more sustainable material in smaller quantities. We also continuously  test new product solutions that have an impact on packaging. This effort  involves, for example, offering concentrates or switching from a liquid  product to a compact powder format.  Our experts rethink packaging concepts and assess further ways of  developing reusable and refillable solutions that place a stronger focus  on durability. They are also optimizing transport packaging and related  logistics. Our aim is that 100 percent of Henkel’s packaging will be  recyclable or reusable by 2025. At the end of 2021, this share was around  86 percent.1 We base our understanding of the concept of recyclable or  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  73 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Our packaging targets for 2025 Our Strategy Our Ambition Our Objectives * Excluding products where ingredients or residue may affect recyclability or pollute recycling streams.

By consistently applying these types of design principles to support recy- cling, we aim to overcome the barriers to recycling that are specific to  each category of packaging – such as flexible packaging, shrink-wrapping  and black packaging. At the same time, it is important that appropriate  systems for recycling packaging materials are in place. In order to quickly and reliably determine the recyclability of new packag- ing, starting from the product development phase, Henkel has developed  the software tool EasyD4R®. This is based on public and recognized sets  of criteria, such as those from Plastics Recyclers Europe. It is used by  Henkel throughout the company. The tool’s effectiveness was confirmed  in an independent test conducted by the Fraunhofer Institute for Environ- mental, Safety and Energy Technology (UMSICHT). Henkel developed its  software tool    EasyD4R® further in 2020. Alongside quickly and reliably  1  The reported recyclability value reflects the properties of the packaging, but not the recyclability in specific markets with differing waste collection and recovery systems. Plastic recyclability is based on a detailed  assessment, while the assessment for glass, paper and metal is based on an expert evaluation. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  74 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  checking the recyclability of plastic packaging, it is now also possible to  check packaging made of paper, cardboard, glass, aluminum, or tinplate.  This involved integrating design guidelines created by the University of  Applied Sciences, FH Campus Vienna, along with the German minimum  standard for packaging.   2. Use of material from sustainable sources Henkel constantly works on increasing the share of recycled content in  its packaging. We set the ambitious goal of expanding the share of recycled  plastic to more than 30 percent for all plastic packaging materials used  for our consumer goods products worldwide by 2025. At the end of 2021,  this share was around 18 percent. In addition, we will increasingly use bio-based plastic because it enables  more sustainable solutions. Provided they can deliver the same technical  performance as conventional polymers, they could offer a good alternative  and provide long-term benefits. We explicitly exclude sources of raw  materials that might be in competition with food. For this reason, we are  testing the use of second-generation bio-based feedstock material.  The most widely used packaging materials made from renewable raw  materials are paper and cardboard. It is our goal to obtain 100 percent  of the paper and cardboard that we use in our packaging from recycled  material or, where virgin fiber is required, from sustainable forestry  sources. A 2020 survey showed that our suppliers used 69 percent recycled  material in 2020. 86 % recyclable or reusable  material 18 % share of recyclate for  packaging Today, we only use PVC in a few exceptional cases for which we have  not yet found a workable alternative. Overall, materials containing PVC  currently make up less than 0.1 percent of our total global expenditure  on packaging. We continue to work toward our goal of fully removing  PVC from our packaging materials. 3. Closing the loop together We partner with organizations from along the packaging value chain to  drive progress in the infrastructure for recycling. Working in cooperation  with our retail partners, our aim is to help consumers use and dispose of  our products correctly, for example by placing special recycling symbols  on packaging. This targeted information about recycling will enable   contact with more than two billion consumers per year. Another option  to close the loop is to reuse packaging. We also want to maximize the  reusability of secondary and tertiary packaging that is typically used for  shelf displays or for logistical purposes. Refill packaging and reusable systems are also gaining importance  alongside recycling. In addition to new product forms and the use of  recyclable and recycled plastics in our packaging, we also use refillable  packaging and refill stations where consumers can fill laundry and   dishwashing detergents or shampoo into special bottles. When the  contents are used up, the packaging can be refilled again. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  75 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  One example of refill stations is the laundry and dishwashing detergents  from the Laundry &amp; Home Care brand Love Nature. In stores of several  drugstore and supermarket chains, “Mein Spülmittel” and “Mein Wasch- mittel” can be filled and easily refilled again and again. In 2020, this made  Love Nature the first detergent and cleaning brand to offer this  service  across all retailers in Germany. In 2021, there were a total of 48 refill  stations all over Germany. In addition, the bottle bodies are made of  100 percent recycled plastic and can be fully recycled.  The Beauty Care business unit also uses refill stations. The Beauty Care  Professional brand    Authentic Beauty Concept offers refill stations in  49 selected hair salons in Europe, including Germany and Austria, as  well as in Central Asia. Consumers can also use these refill stations to  refill their favorite products again and again in a suitable bottle.  Henkel is developing and testing new logos for product packaging to  promote sustainable purchasing habits and communicate how to recycle  properly. The logos indicate the percentage of recycled material or the  recyclability of the packaging, and some also help to ensure that the  product is recycled properly. Henkel also states the proportion of  → Social Plastic® in its product packaging. In addition, Henkel is a part- ner of the    How2Recycle program in the United States to strengthen  consumer awareness about how packaging cycles can be closed. As part  of the  program, we create more transparency about different recycling  options using an explanatory logo on the product packaging. The program  is a project within the scope of the    Sustainable Packaging Coalition,  an association of industrial companies, research institutes and public  authorities that aims to increase the general understanding of sustain- ability related to packaging and smarter packaging solutions. Using the slogan    “Be smarter. Recycle.,” the Beauty Care business unit  provides information about the correct handling of waste and the   recyclability of various types of packaging. In this way, we want to raise  consumer awareness of the concept of a    circular economy. Our contribution to the circularity of industrial products  Our Adhesive Technologies business unit makes it possible to keep  high-quality materials in circulation and turn waste into valuable  resources. By combining our expertise in materials with our innovative  technologies, we provide solutions that play an important role in the  transition to a circular economy and are driving a rethink in industrial  design and production. Our approach to promoting a circular economy  is centered around the following factors.  • Recyclability: Our easily recyclable or reusable packaging design  solutions deliver recyclability at the end of the value chain. We are  developing adhesives for this purpose, for example, which are optimized  for recycling PET bottles and substantially improve the recycling rate  and quality by ensuring that the bottle label can be removed cleanly.  We also offer our customers solutions for the innovative redesign  of products and packaging. One example of this is our novel    EPIX  coatings for the development of sustainable and safe food packaging  based on paper. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  76 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS   • Debonding: A circular value chain depends on recognizing and con- serving the value of materials. Debonding makes it possible to repair,  reuse and recycle products and product parts, and to separate materials  that are not suitable for collective recycling. As such, this is an import- ant lever for extending the useful life of products and recovering the  value of materials at the end of a product’s life cycle. Our adhesive  solutions contribute to these efforts by facilitating product repair. Our     Teroson hotmelt solutions are one example. Using these solutions,  headlights can be opened up for lens component repair, such as for  replacing an LED module, without damaging the lens or housing.   At the end of the value chain, our technologies, such as adhesives that  enable material separation in multilayer flexible packaging, support  the separation of materials that cannot be recycled collectively.  • Renewable carbon: Henkel has been a founding member of the     Renewable Carbon Initiative since 2020. This aims to promote  acceleration of the transition from fossil-based to renewable carbon for  all organic chemicals and materials. Henkel Adhesive Technologies is  also carrying out pioneering work with new solutions for adhesives,  sealants and functional coatings that replace fossil carbon-based raw  materials with renewable materials. This reduces the carbon footprint  of our products and supports our customers in reducing their emissions  along the value chain. In addition, we contribute to a circular economy  by reducing the consumption of resources.  We are committed to using recycled materials as a renewable carbon  source, both for our product packaging and as part of our product   formulas. For example, the packaging material of one of our    Pattex  insulating foams is made from 25 percent recycled steel, and 98 percent  post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic in the cap. Additionally, 16 percent  of the ingredients are derived from recycled material.  • Bio-based adhesives: We have also developed a range of bio-based  adhesives. To this end, we are working with our suppliers to advance  the concept of mass balance. This is a transparent model for tracking  the amount of certified and non-certified material along the entire  production process. Because the principle of mass balance enables the  drop-in of renewable carbon-based raw materials into existing processes,  it is an important step for a gradual transition to the use of renewable  resources. In 2021, three production sites of our Adhesive Technologies  business unit were fully certified under    ISCC PLUS, a globally recog- nized certification system for mass balance.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  77 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Partnerships along the value chain A key partner on the journey toward better recycling of waste and estab- lishing a circular economy is the social enterprise    Plastic Bank, which  works to reduce plastic waste in nature, including in the world’s oceans,  while at the same time offering new opportunities to people who live in  poverty – especially in countries where recycling infrastructure for waste  disposal is non-existent or inadequate. In 2017, Henkel became the first  major global consumer goods company to partner with Plastic Bank. In  2021, Henkel and Plastic Bank started to expand the recycling infrastructure  in Egypt, opening ten collection centers in the Cairo area. This commitment  will be steadily expanded over the next few years. By 2023, the goal is for  the partners to achieve an annual capacity for 5,000 metric tons of plastic.  Plastic Bank is building recycling ecosystems in countries that lack   adequate waste management infrastructure. Collectors receive compen- sation for the materials they collect, which helps them meet the basic  needs of their families – including food, cooking fuel such as charcoal  for preparing daily meals, and paying for schooling or health insurance.  The plastic collected is reprocessed as Social Plastic®, which can be used  again in products and packaging as part of a closed-loop supply chain.  Henkel and Plastic Bank aim to create around 1,000 jobs in Egypt over a  period of two years by building a long-term recycling infrastructure. This  will have a direct positive impact on more than 4,000 Egyptian citizens. Henkel already uses Social Plastic® in a number of its packaging products.  Hair and body care brand Nature Box was the first cosmetics brand to use  Social Plastic® as a packaging material for its entire bottle portfolio. All  shampoo bottle bodies are made of 100 percent Social Plastic®. In our  Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit, the    Pro Nature product range has  switched to PET bottles made from 100 percent recycled plastic, up to  50 percent of which is Social Plastic®. The bottle body of limited edition  Pril dishwashing liquid, launched in 2021, is made from 100 percent  Social Plastic® and the bottle cap is now made from 84 percent recycled  material. In 2021, 723 metric tons of Social Plastic® were processed at  Henkel, making a total of more than 1,480 metric tons processed since the  partnership began in 2017. Henkel’s experts are engaged in several cross-industry initiatives to drive  innovation in packaging development and to find effective solutions that  can be developed on a large scale. Our membership in the    New Plastics  Economy (NPEC), an initiative of the    Ellen MacArthur Foundation  that brings together different stakeholders to shape the future of plastics  and create momentum for a circular economy, is an important example  of our engagement in this area. Other initiatives include the    Alliance  to End Plastic Waste (AEPW),    European Plastics Pact and    U.S. Plastics  Pact,    CEFLEX and the    Circular Economy Initiative Deutschland.  The    Plastic Waste Coalition of Action was formed from the    Consumer  Goods Forum (CGF) in 2020. In this coalition, Henkel is working with  35 other companies on the basis of Golden Design Rules to develop a  more circular approach to the design and processing of plastic packaging  in the consumer goods industry. In 2020, Henkel was also a founding  723 metric tons of Social Plastic®  processed at Henkel 10 collection centers  in Egypt HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  78 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  member of the    UN Treaty on plastic pollution. Together with 28 other  major global companies, Henkel will endorse a business manifesto  against plastic pollution. We have also teamed up with different organizations that are working  on improving recycling infrastructure to enable a circular economy.  Appropriate systems for recycling packaging materials are not in place in  many areas, especially in developing countries. For example, Henkel has  been working with    TerraCycle in a number of countries since 2016.  This organization offers recycling solutions for materials that are difficult  to recycle. It is also important to work hand-in-hand with our retail   partners to promote a functioning circular economy. This includes  member ship in the Recyclate Forum.  In 2021, the new    Cospatox Consortium evolved from the Recyclate  Forum. It includes distributors, manufacturers, recyclers, packaging   producers, and other members. The abbreviation is short for Cosmetic  Packaging Toxicology. In this project, industrial companies are working  together to develop a standard for high-quality plastic recyclates for   cosmetics packaging, and detergents and cleaning products.  Innovations for the future  • In 2019, Henkel and the packaging manufacturer Alpla jointly produced  bottle bodies based on chemically recycled plastic for the first time.  Plastic waste that is not recycled by mechanical recycling can be  returned to the cycle through chemical recycling. Chemical recycling  can complement mechanical recycling. By using chemical recycling,  material made from fossil resources can be replaced by recycled material  made from plastic waste. The pilot project using Perwoll bottles is part  of    BASF’s ChemCycling project.  • For many years, black plastic packaging posed a challenge to the   recycling value chain due to the colorant that was previously used to  make it black. Together with its supplier Ampacet, a global masterbatch   producer, Henkel began working on an innovative solution for black  plastic packaging that is fully recyclable in 2019. The new packaging  material uses an alternative black colorant that is carbon-free, so that  bottles can be returned to the value chain after use. The    Cyclos-HTP  Institute, which specializes in classifying, assessing and certifying the  recyclability of packaging and products, has confirmed that Henkel’s  bottles, in black color and carbon-free, are fully detectable and sortable.

The  KeelClip™ replaces the outer packaging for beverage cans made from   single-use plastic with solutions made from recycled cardboard. Persil Eco Power Bars These compact detergent bars help to reduce packaging waste. The product  contains 97 percent less plastic packaging per wash load than for conven- tional liquid detergents. In addition, the packaging is made of recycled and  recyclable cardboard. The film used for the tabs is biodegradable and  100 percent water-soluble.  Nature Box as recyclable refills Selected shampoos and shower gels from our natural cosmetics brand  Nature Box (like the nourishing repair shampoo Avocado or the revitalizing  shower gel Pomegranate) have been available in refill packs in stores since  2021. The refill packaging can be recycled. Manufacturing these packages  requires around 74 percent less plastic than bottles of the same capacity.  • One of the most pressing challenges on the journey to a circular economy  for packaging is the need to improve the sorting of consumer waste  through accurate identification. One particularly promising approach  here is to capture and decode digital watermarks using a high-resolution  camera mounted on the waste sorting system. Depending on the marking  that is picked up, the system can then sort the packaging waste into the  appropriate categories of material. This would lead to better and more  precisely sorted flows of waste, as well as higher quality recycled  material. Since September 2020, Henkel has been one of more than  85 companies and organizations in the new    HolyGrail 2.0 initiative,  which is a pioneering initiative for digital watermarks for better  recycling of packaging. Following the first HolyGrail project, which was  led by the    Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the next phase, HolyGrail  2.0, was implemented on a much larger scale and scope. This included  commissioning an industrial test facility to determine how effective  watermarking technology is in delivering more accurate  sorting of  packaging waste and higher quality recycling. It also involved conduct- ing a large-scale assessment of the business viability of this technology.  Henkel is cooperating in the tests with packaging for its Vernel and  Pattex products. The aim is to gain more insight into how digital  watermarking technology could improve the sorting of PET bottles  with perforated sleeves and PE cartridges for silicone sealant. Over  100,000 packaging samples and a total of 250 different packages were  successfully tested in 2021. The recognition rate was more than 97 per- cent. Henkel is using digital watermarking technology in a product  line for its fabric softener brand Vernel.

In January 2019, Henkel invested in  the    Circularity European Growth Fund I LP, an impact fund managed  by Circularity Capital. This investment of 5 million pounds sterling enables  Henkel to drive its venturing activities forward while also supporting the  development of a circular economy.  Henkel invested in the recycling start-up    Saperatec in 2019. The recycling  specialist has developed a new type of patented technology that can be  used, for example, to separate and recycle aluminum-containing flexible  composite packaging. In July 2020, Henkel became the first company in the world to issue a     “Plastic Waste Reduction Bond”. The bond is a private placement with  the Japanese insurance companies Dai-ichi Life and Dai-ichi Frontier Life  as anchor investors. The proceeds will be invested in projects participating  in Henkel’s activities to reduce plastic waste.  Reducing production waste We aim to reduce production waste and promote a circular economy in  our operations. We drive this process by systematically identifying  waste streams and creating closed-loop systems where possible. We are  focusing on increasing recycling at our sites and working closely with  our partners in the value chain – suppliers, customers, and recycling and  disposal companies. Our initiatives are centered around three key areas:   • Reducing material consumption and waste generation.  • Reusing materials.  • Recycling materials.  In line with our goal of reducing our environmental footprint, we intend  to reduce the total volume of waste* by 50 percent per metric ton of   product by 2025 compared to a 2010 baseline. We achieved a reduction  of 42 percent in 2021. We are also reaffirming our ambition to achieve  closed-loop management of waste materials in our production by 2030. A further goal is to stop disposing of production waste* in landfills at all  production sites, including for our industrial business, by 2030. Overall,  78 percent of our production sites had already achieved this target by  the end of 2021. These include the adhesives plants in Épernon, France;  North Kansas City, USA; Bangpoo, Thailand; Zuhai, China; Quilicura,  Chile; Elgin, Scotland, and Montornès del Vallès, Spain. This success is  based primarily on partnerships with local waste management service  providers.  78 % of sites with no   landfill waste – 42 % waste* HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  81 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Make waste streams transparent and share best practices We have been successfully implementing global waste mapping initiatives  for many years. A digital tool is used to document waste flows, types of  waste and disposal/recycling paths, which is also the basis for our other  measures. We record more than 600 waste streams worldwide in the  Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit alone, and we present this information  transparently to all relevant stakeholders. We integrate this data into our  “digital backbone” so that company managers can analyze and compare  data on locations and development over time.  We see this as an essential mechanism for facilitating the exchange of  best practices and as a milestone in creating transparency worldwide. This  transparency also includes a detailed overview of the entire waste life  cycle – from generation to disposal. The Adhesive Technologies business  unit also uses a system for the classification, compliance  testing,  reporting and control of waste streams for its production plants and  research centers. This makes it possible to identify differences between  sites that generate similar types of waste. We then develop  specific  improvement actions and share best practices throughout the company.  Raw material packaging accounts for a significant share of the total  amount of waste generated at our sites. For this reason, our Adhesive  Technologies business unit has launched an initiative to reuse materials.  In this way, we are striving to implement circular thinking and reduce  packaging waste in cooperation with our suppliers. In 2021, projects  under this initiative led to a reduction of – 4 percent compared to 2020.  The initiative will continue in 2022 and will be extended to all regions.  Raw material packaging frequently consists of drums and pallets, big  bags and other containers used to transport goods. We aim to actively  manage use cycles and reuse these materials. At our adhesives site in  Bogotá, Colombia, we implemented a reverse logistics program with our  raw material suppliers. This program reuses the metal drums that are  used for transporting chemicals, and avoids sending empty drums to be  disposed of as hazardous waste. In Chile and Brazil, we recycled more  than 7,000 additional pallets through an initiative in 2021.  The Beauty Care site in Geneva, New York, has undertaken another   collaborative project with a waste management company to reuse  wastewater as cooling water. This initiative reduced the amount of  wastewater disposal by 2,000 metric tons from January to September  2021, and our partner avoided the use of fresh water. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  82 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  NATURAL RESOURCES Biodiversity and responsible resource management Growing consumption and resource scarcity due to an increasing global  population and accelerated economic activity are putting more and  more pressure on ecosystems. The negative effects are already being felt:  according to a report published by    IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-  Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services), human activities  are threatening nearly 1 million species with extinction. Conserving species  diversity and biodiversity is important to Henkel, as intact ecosystems  and soil biodiversity are essential as a basis for sustainable agriculture and  the use of raw materials in production. Our 2021 stakeholder survey  results showed that biodiversity is also becoming an increasingly  important issue for our partners and other stakeholders.  We follow current efforts to protect biodiversity and deforestation very  closely, such as the EU’s Deforestation Regulation. We continue to  develop our approach in line with the resulting expectations. This also  includes dialog and collaboration with external stakeholders, as well as  industry initiatives such as the European brand association    AIM. In  September 2020, we signed up to the    Business for Nature’s Call to Action  to urge governments to incorporate nature in their policymaking. We  also participated in the    Consumer Goods Forum initiative against  worldwide deforestation and for the protection of biodiversity. And we  are working with the development organization    Solidaridad to   support smallholders in the palm oil and palm kernel oil sector in projects  that promote climate-smart agricultural practices.  Our → sustainability strategy aims to protect and restore biodiversity –  with a particular focus on forests, land and water. In addition to applying  these principles to the activities at our own sites, we also promote the  responsible management of raw materials and the use of renewable inputs.  In 2021, we started to identify the potential impacts on biodiversity of our  production sites by identifying and mapping their geographical location  and assessing their proximity to important biodiversity areas. This  will enable us to develop comprehensive measures and programs. We  are also participating in a research project by the international consultancy     Globe Scan, which is designed to better understand challenges in the  context of nature and biodiversity, and to identify solutions to protect and  restore nature. “ Protecting natural   resources and biodiversity  is important to us – as it  is to our customers and   consumers. Our sustainability  strategy picks up on this  ambition and is supported  by the contributions of our  brands, products and  services.” WOLFGANG KÖNIG Executive Vice President Beauty Care HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  83 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  aloe vera. We are also working to further increase the proportion of  ingredients based on renewable raw materials in our cosmetic products  and to use fewer fossil resources, wherever this is possible and appropriate.  As an example, we have been using potato starch in our new Taft mousse  since 2021. Another example of our responsible use of raw materials is  the use of guar and guar derivatives as a key source of plant-based raw  materials. Guar is a nourishing ingredient that is used, for example, in  hair care products from our natural cosmetics brand    Nature Box.  Henkel’s Nature Box brand supports guar farmers in the desert region  of Bikaner in Rajasthan, India. They learn sustainable guar farming  methods and receive assistance in planting their own vegetable gardens.  Nature Box also supports sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil   production together with Solidaridad. Renewable raw materials are historically one of the major sources of raw  materials for laundry detergents and household cleaners. For example,  soap – which has traditionally been used to wash laundry as well as for  personal hygiene – has been made from vegetable or animal oils and fats.  Today, most laundry detergents and household cleaners consist of a large  number of ingredients, each with its own special function. Most bulk  ingredients of detergents and household cleaners are inorganic and  therefore cannot be replaced by ingredients based on renewable raw  materials. Surfactants are an important exception. They consist of a lipo- philic (fat-loving) part, which is obtained from vegetable or mineral oils,  and a hydrophilic (water-loving) part, which is usually based on mineral  oil or is inorganic. Surfactants like alkyl polyglycosides that are produced  only from renewable raw materials are the exception. To achieve the best  washing performance, we use a mixture of different surfactants. In more  than half of them, the lipophilic part is based on renewable raw materials.  A responsible approach to raw materials Use of nature-based raw materials  Henkel is committed to responsible management of raw materials, and  especially the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity. We  use ingredients based on renewable raw materials to optimize the overall  characteristics of our products, wherever this is compatible with environ- mental, economic and social considerations. Renewable raw materials  are already key ingredients in many of our products, such as detergents,  soaps, shampoos, glue sticks and wallpaper adhesives. We are also   committed to environmental and social considerations when purchasing  renewable raw materials.  Many of our consumer and industrial adhesives are based on nature-based  raw materials, such as plant-based oils and their derivatives, as well as  tree resin and carbohydrates like starch, sugar and cellulose. Our    Pritt  glue stick, which was relaunched in 2021, is formulated with 97 percent  natural ingredients (including water). We also pioneer new solutions  for adhesives, sealants and coatings that replace fossil raw materials  with materials made from biomass. For example, we have developed a  high-performance hotmelt adhesive made of over 80 percent 1 bio-based  materials and with a significantly reduced carbon footprint. We work  with our suppliers to ensure sustainable sourcing of natural resources. Nature-based raw materials are used in all product groups in cosmetics –  not only in our soaps, shampoos and shower gels, but also in styling  products. We refer to the use of individual nature-based active ingredients  or fragrances if these are associated with specific properties – for example,  the care properties of shea butter and yogurt or the soothing effect of  1  Combination of direct bio-based and certified mass balance transfer raw materials based on internal analyses HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  84 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Responsible use of palm oil and palm kernel oil Palm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives are two of the most  important renewable raw materials we use to manufacture ingredients  for our laundry detergents, household cleaners and cosmetic products.  We use less than 0.2 percent of the palm oil and palm  kernel oil produced  worldwide. In particular, we use palm kernel oil as the basis for surfactants.  Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the world and comes  from a highly efficient crop: for the same yield, oil palm requires about  three times less land than rapeseed and as much as six times less than  soybeans. Unfortunately, palm oil cultivation, when done unsustainably,  is often associated with large-scale deforestation of rainforests.  For this reason, our goal is to ensure that the ingredients for our products  are made from    sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil. With this in  mind, we work with the companies from which we source our raw  materials and with other partners to exert influence on the palm oil supply  chain, from smallholders to consumers. With this approach, we seek to  further develop our supply chains to ensure full NDPE (No Deforestation,  No Peat, No Exploitation) compliance, and to ensure that the palm oils  and palm kernel oils that go into our products are not associated with  the deforestation of primary or secondary rainforests. Our palm oil  strategy through 2025 comprises three areas:  This is the result of Henkel’s many years of experience with ingredients  based on plant-based oils. 43 percent 1 of the surfactants for Henkel’s  laundry detergents and household cleaners are now based on renewable  raw materials. The remaining share is accounted for by inorganic and  mineral-oil-based ingredients. Zero net deforestation as a goal Forests function as carbon sinks and are key to protecting biodiversity.  They also provide us with wood and other raw materials. We are committed  to sourcing our raw materials sustainably and not through deforestation.  Our goal is to prevent the deforestation of primary and secondary forests  with significant ecological value. These include peat lands and other  high-carbon stock areas. This is why under our    Responsible Sourcing  Policy we are committed to zero net deforestation, and expect our  suppliers to support this aim.  We have been partnering with the international, non-profit organization     Rainforest Alliance since 2021 to minimize nature-related risks in  our value chain. The goal is to continue to develop our due diligence  approach to preventing deforestation, as well as to draft a comprehensive  policy in this area. We are also partners of the    Tropical Forest Alliance,  a multi-stakeholder partnership platform hosted by the    World Economic  Forum (WEF). Their primary goal is to promote deforestation- free supply  chains for the production of palm oil and palm kernel oil, beef, soy,  paper and pulp.  1 Calculation based on data of 2019.

Establish full traceability and transparency of the palm oil and  palm kernel oil used in our products: From our activities, we have  learned that there is a need for further optimization with regard to  transparency and traceability, especially for palm-kernel-oil-based  derivatives, and that cross-industry initiatives are necessary to make  the achievement of the “zero net deforestation” target verifiable. In  2021, we increased the traceability rate to the mill to 84 percent and  the traceability rate to the plantation to 42 percent by engaging with  our suppliers to map our joint palm-based supply chain.1 We did this  with the support of an external sustainability consultancy. As part of  our supplier management activities, we  collaborate intensively  with our strategic suppliers to ensure the procurement of sustain- able raw materials. We use the Sustainable Palm Index (SPI) to assess  the progress of our suppliers with respect to their level of supply chain  knowledge, sustainable sourcing practices and compliance with the  NDPE Principles. We once again used the SPI to create a compliance  profile of our major suppliers of palm-oil-based raw materials in 2021.  This tool helps us to identify potential improvements and define  action plans together with our suppliers.  42 % traceability of palm (kernel)  oil back to the plantation 84 % traceability of palm   (kernel) oil back to the mill 1.  Cover 100 percent of our demand with oils that are certified or  externally confirmed as responsibly sourced: We plan to continue  to expand the certification of our raw materials in accordance with     RSPO’s Mass Balance model. We are also aiming at certification  according to the RSPO’s Segregation model for the portion of palm oil  and palm kernel oil that is directly sourced. We have achieved con- siderable progress in this area in recent years with a wide range of  measures. In fiscal year 2021, we were able to source 93 percent of our  total demand for palm oil, palm kernel oil and its derivatives as certified  raw materials in line with the    RSPO’s Mass Balance supply chain  model. Derivatives account for the majority of the palm-based materials  used by Henkel. Despite this strong achievement, we still encounter a  lack of availability of RSPO-certified materials in some of the markets  where we operate and for a number of selected derivatives of palm-  kernel-oil-based raw materials used in small quantities. In these   circumstances, we maintain an intensive dialog with our suppliers to  look for solutions or we rely on the import of raw materials. These  challenges continued to be compounded in 2021 by shortages in RSPO  certification as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are   confident that we will make further progress in the years ahead, yet we  must acknowledge that full transition of our global supply chains to  sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil remains challenging. 1 The survey was conducted in 2021 based on the supplier data for 2020. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  86 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  friendly agriculture, along with exerting an influence on policy and  involving stakeholders. Many of our projects were successfully completed  in 2020 and 2021. Last year, we were engaged in projects in Colombia,  Nicaragua and Nigeria. Building on the very good collaboration with  Solidaridad, we have developed specific plans for the next few years to  expand the commitment further.  Our project in Nicaragua, which was successfully completed in 2021,  focused on creating a 100-percent-RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil  sector involving smallholders. The project has accompanied 173 farmers  on their journey to certification and led to the creation of the first associ- ation of palm oil producers in Nicaragua. This enables smallholder farm- ers to cooperate in the transition to the RSPO standard and generate RSPO  credits. There was also an average yield increase of at least 13 percent.     Solidaridad’s National Initiatives for Sustainable and Climate-Smart  Oil Palm Smallholders (NISCOPS) and the    IDH Sustainable Trade   Initiative contribute to the attainment of self-sufficiency in palm oil  production in Nigeria. This includes teaching climate-smart agricultural  practices as well as the sustainable intensification of farms. This improves  the productivity and livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Henkel’s com- mitment helped to increase the capacity of farmers in Akwa Ibom and  Cross River states. The initiative involves the technical upgrading of  two mills and the construction of tree nurseries to grow improved  varieties that will increase crop yields and prevent deforestation through  the planting of new trees. The nurseries will be accompanied by training  courses that teach sustainable land use practices and topics related to  forest conservation.  3.  Improve the livelihoods of smallholders and protection of nature:  We are building on the success of our collaborative projects with  smallholders and will continue strengthening our commitment to  integrate raw materials delivered by these smallholders into our  supply chain. Greater consideration is also given to ecological aspects  while supporting climate-friendly agriculture and a positive impact on  biodiversity. To date, around 36,400 smallholders have been reached  on some 340,000 hectares under cultivation.   Support for smallholder farmers Smallholders produce about 40 percent of the world’s palm oil, yet  their productivity and the quality of their products are much lower com- pared to large plantations. They often lack access to technical knowledge  and financial services that are crucial to improving their production.  Some farmers are also concerned that access to the palm oil market will  be limited if their harvests do not meet the criteria set out by the RSPO.  This is because many major buyers of palm oil have committed to buying  only oil products that are certified as sustainable. In collaboration with  the development organization    Solidaridad, Henkel is addressing these  challenges. We have partnered with Solidaridad on initiatives in Colombia, Ghana,  Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua and Nigeria since 2013. The  focus was on training in best practice approaches, including climate-  ~36,400 smallholders reached HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  87 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Reducing paper consumption, ending deforestation Demand for paper products is increasing worldwide. According to the     World Wildlife Fund (WWF), 13 to 15 percent of all wood consump- tion is used in the production of pulp, paper and packaging products. If  wood is sourced and produced in an unsustainable manner, it can lead  to deforestation in areas of high ecological value. We aim to source  100 percent of the paper and board material used in our packaging as  recycled material or – where the use of virgin fiber is required – from  sustainably managed forestries. All suppliers of paper-based packaging materials must confirm that  they are compliant with our procurement guidelines as part of our  onboarding process. We expect them to support our goal of net zero  deforestation. Creating more transparency in the supply chain is focus of  our cooperation with our suppliers of paper-based packaging. This  involves the traceability of the materials we buy, especially in the case  of suppliers that source virgin fibers from high-risk countries. In these  circumstances, we work together on measures to minimize risk.  We conducted a comprehensive survey of our main suppliers in the   corrugated board and printed paper sector in 2020. This approach pro- vided transparency on the business conduct of those tier one suppliers  which represent 93 percent of our spend in this area. The results showed  that 69 percent of our suppliers were using recycled material in 2020.  Around 86 percent of suppliers use at least one or more certification   systems.    FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification was most  commonly cited, followed by    PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement  of Forest Certification) and    SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative). Other initiatives for sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil  We support the physical transformation toward the use of certified  products in the industry and the shift in the market toward certified  sustainable palm oil products. A multi-stakeholder approach is at the  core of our initiative for sustainable management of palm oil and palm  kernel oil. Through partnerships, projects and dialog, we engage with  key players and are expanding our contribution to sustainable practices  in the palm oil industry.  Henkel is a committed founding member of the    Forum for Sustainable  Palm Oil (FONAP) in Germany and is a member of several of its working  groups. This collaboration between companies, NGOs, associations and  political bodies is pursuing the goal of significantly increasing the pro- portion of  sustainably produced palm oil, while also improving existing  standards and certifications. We are also actively involved in the Round- table on Sustainable Palm Oil (   RSPO). The RSPO standard increasingly  includes compliance with human rights along the entire supply chain, in  addition to environmental aspects. In April 2021, our Global Supply  Chain organization was again successfully certified in line with the  RSPO’s supply chain standard. Henkel, along with other leading consumer goods manufacturers and  companies in the oleochemical industry, is a member of the cross-industry     Action for Sustainable Derivatives (ASD) initiative. The primary  objective of the initiative is to generate more transparency in the complex  value chain for palm derivatives.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  88 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Careful use of water as an important resource The Earth’s water resources are unequally distributed and are threatened  by climate change as well as increasing pollution and overuse. We  recognize the importance of using this resource responsibly, particularly  as healthy water ecosystems are key to protecting biodiversity. Water  plays an important role along our value chain. We use water for our  production processes and as an ingredient for our products, and many  of our products also require water in the use phase.  For this reason, reducing water usage during the production and use of  our products is an important aim for us. In order to identify suitable  approaches for improvements in this area, we have worked with various  stakeholders in recent years. In 2021, for example, we reassessed our  impact on water along the value chain with the support of external part- ners as part of our sustainability strategy development. This included  examining the water footprint of raw materials, our production processes  and the consumption of water during the use of our products, as well as  the treatment of wastewater. Water risk analysis The global availability of water is affected by regional and seasonal  scarcities. There are also differences in the availability and performance  of wastewater treatment facilities, as well as differences in the specific  environmental characteristics of individual water bodies. To identify  production sites that are located in water-stressed regions, in 2021 we  conducted water scarcity research on a global scale using the    World  Resource Institute’s (WRI)    Aqueduct™ tool. We took into account  qualitative, quantitative and regulatory risks for all sites, as well as water  risk forecasts for the year 2030. Each production site was assessed, taking  into account its precise geo-coordinates and nearby water basins and  watersheds.  We have been reporting our water consumption in hydrologically  stressed areas since 2020 and have reaffirmed our ambition to focus on  saving water in regions where water is in short supply. We conducted  workshops with partners on the topic of water in 2021 to reflect this  ambition. For example, at the    Forum for the Future, we reflected on  risks, opportunities and future scenarios to help us further develop our  global strategy. One of the main results is that we aim to achieve circular  water use at key manufacturing sites by 2030. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  89 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Saving water during production We set the goal of using 35 percent less water per ton of product by 2025.  By the end of 2021, Henkel had saved 28 percent.   To achieve our goal, each production site carefully examines all options  for reducing water consumption and avoiding wastewater. Wastewater  from industrial applications is disposed of properly in accordance with  legal requirements. Where applicable, Henkel provides pretreatment with  state-of-the-art technologies for removing contaminants.  We source a significant proportion of our water from local supply  networks. We also use water from other sources, such as rainwater or  groundwater, to reflect local conditions. For example, to save water, our  Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit uses online metering systems and  our Digital Backbone to identify optimization potential and increased  water consumption. Additionally, we continuously review and optimize  the amount of water needed to clean production lines when changing  the product that is being manufactured on the line. In doing this, we take  into account specific characteristics of the product that is being manu- factured before and after the changeover.  – 28 % water use* At our site in Vienna, Austria, we began replacing the well water used  for cooling with a central, closed-loop cooling system, which saves us  up to 5,000 cubic meter of fresh water per month. This site is our show- case project for the use of recycled water in production plants. At the     Humen site in China, an additional filter system was installed for the  discharge of wastewater in 2021. This system allows the treated water to  be reused in cooling towers, saving around 4,000 cubic meter of fresh  water each year. Water treatment is an important process for us because we need a certain  quality of water for our production. At our sites in Ferentino, Italy, and in  6th of October, Egypt, we have invested in our existing water treatment  plants so that we can treat wastewater directly on site. This is the first  step to being able to use the purified water again in future phases of the  project. We also commissioned a new water treatment facility at our site  in Jundiaí, Brazil, which processes rainwater for reuse in applications such  as irrigation or for flushing toilets. This will reduce water consumption  and the amount of wastewater produced by 1,000 cubic meter annually.  At our site in Ankara, Turkey, we have similarly launched a pilot project  to collect rainwater with the aim of saving up to 1,700 cubic meter of  water per year.  * Base year 2010 HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  90 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Conserving resources together with our consumers We want to encourage the responsible use of our products to reduce water  consumption. Life cycle analyses have shown that more than 90 percent  of the water and energy consumption of our rinse-off products occurs  during use. That is why our Beauty Care business unit leverages its brands  to raise awareness among customers about sustainable product use. We  do this by providing information on the products and on a comprehen- sive website, and through supporting measures in sales outlets as part of  our    “Be smarter.” initiative to explain how consumers can help conserve  resources. The focus here is on the area of water and, in particular, the  energy- intensive provision of hot water. The “Be smarter.” initiative now  includes 28 brands and more than 100 countries. We are also developing  products that do not require the use of water. Our leave-in conditioners  and dry shampoos do not require water for rinsing, for example. Preventing water pollution from microplastics  We are committed to ensuring that our consumer products do not cause  any    microplastics to enter the environment. We understand micro- plastics to refer to solid, insoluble plastic particles that are five millimeters  or smaller and are not biodegradable. These can enter rivers and oceans  via wastewater and accumulate there permanently. Several years ago, we stopped using microbeads in cosmetics, detergents  and cleaning products, which were used as exfoliating or abrasive   particles in certain products. In addition, we have been dealing more  closely with solid synthetic plastics. These solid synthetic plastics are  used as opacifiers in consumer products to give them a creamy white  appearance. In our cosmetic products, the switch to opacifiers that have a natural  origin or are biodegradable was nearly completed in spring 2021. The  last remaining  cosmetic products will be switched by the end of the  first quarter of 2022. For our other consumer products we replaced  opacifiers with poor biodegradability with a newly developed opacifier  with improved biodegradability in the second quarter of 2021. We   continue to pursue the technical challenge of using only natural or   biodegradable opacifiers and eliminating solid synthetic plastics as  soon as a suitable alternative is available for this purpose. Certain types of perfume encapsulation are also under discussion because  they are considered as microplastics. These encapsulated perfume oils  are used in fabric softeners and certain detergents to create long-lasting  fragrances with significantly less perfume than would otherwise be  required. We are already working together with our technology partners  to replace all synthetic perfume encapsulations with biodegradable  materials by the end of 2022 at the latest. We have already achieved success in using soluble, biodegradable  materials for encapsulation in other areas; for example, in the shells of  our pre-dosed liquid detergent capsules and dishwasher detergent tabs,  which consist of soluble polyvinyl alcohol foil.  To prevent improper disposal of our plastic product packaging from  contributing to ocean pollution, we are striving for a    circular economy  for plastics that is similar to existing systems. We will continue to  increase the recyclability of our packaging, while also increasing the  percentage of recycled material in our packaging.

Our corporate culture is based on continuous open feedback and  on appreciation for outstanding performance – both through attractive  compensation and through individual and long-term development  opportunities. We strengthen our global team by valuing diversity and  cultural backgrounds, interacting openly and constructively with each  other, and looking after the health and safety of our people. The role of  our employees is anchored in a central position in our newly launched  → 2030+ Sustainability Ambition Framework and is closely linked to  the pillar “Thriving Communities”.   Commitment to sustainable development  Sustainability is one of our five    corporate values. It means that we strive  to create a balance between people, planet and profit. When it comes to  implementing our → sustainability strategy, it is our people who make  the difference – through their dedication, skills and knowledge. Because  of this, we want to foster our people’s commitment to sustainability.  And we have expanded our existing training offers to include a holistic  engagement program, which will be rolled out at the beginning of 2022.  52,450 employees HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  94 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  In addition, we want to enable our employees to engage in volunteer  projects and make their own contribution to the communities in which  we operate. For example, our → “MIT Volunteering” (Make an Impact on  Tomorrow) initiative is designed to support our employees and pensioners  around the world in their volunteer work for charitable organizations. Employee development We promote the skills and knowledge of our employees to help them  achieve their full potential. Regular and open feedback about performance  and potential serves as a foundation for their development. This makes  it easier to define individual development measures that address both  the company’s needs and each employee’s potential. We focus on  → digital learning opportunities and the development of digital skills  so that we can take full advantage of the opportunities offered by these  technologies.  Individual development planning through regular feedback To foster the targeted development of our employees, we make use  of regular development meetings and individual development plans.  This helps us to systematically identify and develop talents within the  company, and to plan internal succession.  With this knowledge, our employees can make an important contribution  to sustainability at our sites, and by engaging with our customers and  other partners within our business environment. Our “Say yes! to the future” initiative, for example, provides Henkel sales  representatives from all business units around the world with training in  sustainability topics that apply to sales, going beyond the content of the  Sustainability Ambassador program. They then apply this knowledge  in joint projects with our trade partners – in logistics, for example, or by  promoting sustainable purchasing decisions. The “(Y)our move toward sustainability” initiative at Henkel, by compar- ison, focuses on water and energy consumption and the amount of waste  generated at our sites. It encourages employees to make a contribution  to sustainability in these areas, for example by avoiding unnecessary  printing, switching off lights or eating healthily. As part of another project, we offer employees the opportunity to visit  schools and teach children about sustainable action in their everyday  lives. This helps the next generation to understand how to use resources  efficiently from an early age. At the same time, the children multiply the  impact by imparting their knowledge and enthusiasm to others around  them. School visits are an important element of our commitment to  reaching schoolchildren through educational initiatives.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  95 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS   • For our non-managerial employees, we use locally customized   evaluation and development systems. In many countries, supervisors  assess their employees on the basis of their achievements and hold  confidential feedback conversations with them. The meetings are  followed by specific development measures. These can include   training in the workplace, such as seminars and workshops, as well  as job enlargement, for example by taking on management tasks.   • Our managers and selected non-managerial employees are assessed  every year in the globally standardized Talent Management Cycle. This  includes a performance evaluation and potential assessment as two  separate steps. To evaluate performance, managers and employees  agree on an individual role ambition at the beginning of a year, which  contributes to the fulfillment of the company’s strategic objectives.  This is re-validated in the middle of the year and then evaluated at the  end of the year.  The potential assessment is based on a self-assessment by the employees  and an evaluation conducted by their supervisors. The evaluation is  made on the basis of uniform principles and clearly defined criteria such  as expected leadership behavior. Supervisors then discuss the assessment  results with their employees in personal feedback meetings and, together,  they agree on individual development measures. In 2021, more than  1,500 managers were promoted. Henkel has been using a    digital feedback tool to complement the  assessment interviews since 2021. Employees can use this tool to receive  recognition and direct feedback from colleagues and superiors alike –  at any time. The objective is to promote a day-to-day culture of dynamic  and open feedback at Henkel. Career launch and lifelong learning programs Henkel helps many young people embark on a successful career. The  company offers 25 vocational training and five dual-study programs in  Germany. In the 2021 training year, 138 new trainees and students started  pursuing a professional qualification at Henkel. A total of 498 people  are participating in our vocational training programs at nine German  locations.  Lifelong learning is a core element of continuous development at our  company. Learning as part of everyday work, as well as through handling  a varied range of tasks, is particularly important for us. Henkel encourages  this by offering opportunities to take advantage of new roles both locally  and in other countries. We learn from supervisors, team members, and  other colleagues on a daily basis. For some years now, Henkel has been  using virtual services to train its employees worldwide, in addition  to conventional attendance-based formats. To do this, we use a global  learning platform that includes virtual sharing formats along with  eLearning, podcasts and videos. As all services on the Henkel Learning  Hub are cloud-based, they can be accessed at any time – not only in the  office environment, but also on the road or at home.  In 2021, we continued to expand our training formats in line with our  Purposeful Growth agenda. We developed and digitalized new global and  regional learning programs. There was a particular focus on programs  relating to health and wellbeing. For the first time, we organized a global  25 vocational training and  five dual-study programs HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  96 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  developing our digital skills training portfolio and advancing the  training of our employees in skills that will be relevant in the future.   • Digital learning formats also play an important role for us in making  training opportunities available flexibly worldwide. Where possible,  general in-person training courses are complemented by digital and  virtual services. As part of a partnership between Henkel and LinkedIn  Learning, all employees with PC access are able to choose from more  than 15,000 online courses in seven languages.  • The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the digital trans- formation in the world of work, and has greatly expanded and rein- forced virtual collaboration. In this context, IT security has become  more important than ever. Therefore, Henkel has further expanded  its Group-wide cyber-awareness campaigns. To increase employee  awareness of cyber attacks, the company organized numerous events  virtual learning week in 2021 to further expand the learning culture at  Henkel and to offer employees a range of business insights in the areas  of sustainability, innovation, digitalization and culture. This event drew  more than 6,200 participants from all over the world together for four  days of learning. Through these and other digital formats, our employees  were able to learn together even during the time when attendance-based  training was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the average  training time of our employees was around 2.3 days.  Expansion of digital training opportunities  • We structure the learning content in a way that allows us to react more  quickly and individually to new requirements for knowledge within  the organization. The Henkel Learning Hub hosts all formal training  courses in one place. These include basic knowledge – such as man- agement, process, and software training – as well as content specific  to our business units and material related to improving soft skills.  Leadership skills represent a key element of the learning content.  The main aim is to train new competencies and skills that will provide  our managers with the best possible preparation for future challenges.  Based on our Leadership Commitments, we want to foster a global,  → value-oriented leadership standard that takes account of different  regional and cultural considerations.   In addition, digital transformation represents a key element of the  learning content. Our    “Digital Upskilling” initiative is designed to  provide targeted support for employees in expanding their digital  skills. It is based on two pillars and an in-depth analysis of the status  quo: Anonymous online surveys are used to assess employees’ digital  skills. This includes both a playful quiz about digital general knowledge  ( Digital BaseFit) and an analysis of experts’ professional and specialist  skills (Digital ExpertFit). Based on these efforts, we are continuously  1,178 (9.6 %) Digital Skills 1,837 (15.0 %) Personal Skills 480 (3.9 %) Other 479 (3.9 %) Corporate Compliance   and Sustainability 3,926 (32.1 %) Business unit specific 347 (2.8 %) Management 3,459 (28.3 %) Professional Skills Training categories in 2021 528 (4.3 %) Leadership HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  97 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Attractive compensation and benefits  The appreciation of the work of our global team is an important element  of our → corporate culture, and enables us to ensure our long-term and  sustainable business success. For this reason, it is important to recognize  our people’s performance through appropriate, competitive remuneration  in line with the market. We use performance-based components of  compensation in order to reward individual contributions. In contrast  to the globally standardized remuneration system for our managers, the  compensation systems for our non-managerial employees are based  on local requirements and existing collective agreements. There is no   systematic difference between the compensation received by male  and female employees. In addition to fixed and performance-based  components of pay, our remuneration system also includes benefits in  kind and social security components.  Individual performance as a compensation criterion Our remuneration system has as its foundation an appropriate and  competitive level of basic pay, which all employees receive, respectively, in  accordance with local market conditions and the collective agreements  in place. It takes into account the demands of the job and the employee’s  individual performance and development potential. In addition to the  basic pay, we strive to reward the individual performance of our employees  with attractive incentives:   • For our non-managerial employees, we use locally adapted compen- sation components to reward their performance and their contribution  to the company’s success. Depending on the nature of the job and  region, there are various bonus systems for employees, for example  in sales and production. These systems cover almost all of our non-  managerial employees worldwide.  and presentations on the subject of cyber security, specifically as part  of the worldwide Cyber Awareness Month in October 2021. Flexible working prioritized  At Henkel, we measure performance by results and not by presence.  This is why we have been promoting flexible working models for many  years. Based on a culture of trust, part-time work, flexible working hours,  new workplace concepts and mobile working are a natural part of our  work – and not just since the COVID-19 pandemic. By signing our global     Work-Life Flexibility Charter in 2012, the Management Board has  been emphasizing the importance of this topic at Henkel for many years.  Our managers are instructed to put opportunities for flexible working  into practice and to support them actively.  The pandemic has hastened a number of developments at Henkel. This  situation has again highlighted how well virtual collaboration and  mobile working work, as well as how important it is to pull together as  a team. We leverage these experiences and insights to actively shape  and develop our corporate culture and working environment. We want  to create the    workplace of the future for our company and our  employees. Our sites and offices will at all times serve as places to work  together and exchange ideas with colleagues. At the same time, a future-  oriented working environment also offers employees more flexibility  and freedom to find an optimal balance between their professional lives  and their private lives. Henkel developed its “Smart Work” program in  2021 to address this issue. This comprehensive concept provides a global  framework for mobile working and highlights the potential for improving  how our office landscapes support collabo ration among our employees,  the improvements that can be made through our health program, the  additional opportunities offered by digitalization, and how we at Henkel  can become even more sustainable.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  98 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  We always assess the performance of our employees in the context  of our vision and corporate values. We are committed to leadership in   sustainability – this is one of our five corporate values. Accordingly,   contributions to Henkel’s sustainability strategy and to its targets form  part of the annual → performance assessment, which influences variable  compensation. Where specific aspects of our sustainability performance,  such as the reduction of energy use and waste volumes, fall within the  sphere of influence of the employee concerned and have a clear bearing  on business performance (as in the case of site managers), these are  included in the individual performance assessment. In addition, almost  every manager has to confirm compliance with the    Henkel standards  in writing during their annual review. These include our Code of Corporate  Sustainability, the SHE Standards, and Social Standards. Our employee share plan We believe it is important for our employees to share in the success of  our business. This improves motivation, as well as the strength of   identification with the organization. Since 2001, Henkel has offered a  voluntary employee share plan. For each euro invested in 2021 by an  employee (limited to 4 percent of salary up to a maximum of 4,992 euros  per year), Henkel added 33 eurocents. Around 12,700 employees in  58 countries purchased Henkel preferred shares under this program in  2021. At year-end, around 18,400 employees held a total of around  2.8 million shares in the program’s securities accounts, representing  1.6 percent of total preferred shares outstanding. The lock-up period for  newly acquired shares is three years.  • For our managers, we use short-term variable remuneration compo- nents to reward individual contributions to the company’s success. The  Short Term Incentive (STI), which is paid out annually, takes into account  both our short-term financial targets and each person’s individual  performance. Some of our managers with direct responsibility for sales  are compensated through separate bonus arrangements that focus on  sales-related targets, instead of through the STI.   • For top management, the annual STI is complemented by a Long Term  Incentive (LTI) plan covering a period of four years. The objective of the  LTI plan is to motivate and retain our top managers, and to help them  view their tasks from the perspective of their shareholders.  • For Management Board members, we also use an annual bonus, as  well as a bonus related to the company’s long-term success as variable  compensation elements. For details, please refer to the description of  the compensation system and the 2021 remuneration report. Both  documents are available on our website at    www.henkel.com/ir.  The performance parameters of the annual variable remuneration  (STI) are the financial targets achieved in the relevant fiscal year, the  bonus, and the individual performance and targets of the Management  Board members, including individually agreed sustainability targets. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  99 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Corporate culture of open communication and  trust-based collaboration We are building an environment of trust in our company that is open to  ideas and innovations, and that enables decisions to be made. This is  only possible with a successful management culture. We are committed  to communicating openly with our employees and their representatives,  and to pursuing constructive dialog. Our goal is to inform them about  important issues early and to involve them in the process. As a result, we  are in a position to successfully face challenges and changes in society,  the economy and politics in a way that enables us to remain competitive  for the future. With our    Leadership Commitments we want to establish a    corporate  culture in which employees show entrepreneurial spirit and initiative,  think proactively, put team spirit into practice and take responsibility –  no matter whether they lead a team or not. Henkel’s dedicated Leadership  Commitments communication platform offers a range of workshop,  learning and reflection elements to promote sustainable cultural change  at Henkel and to help make the Leadership Commitments our cultural  norm.  To obtain a clear picture of the status quo of our corporate culture, and to  identify strengths and potential improvements, in 2020 we conducted a  comprehensive employee survey, the Organizational Health Index (OHI).  Around 10,000 employees worldwide were invited to take part in this  anonymous survey with the aim of providing open and honest feedback.  Based on the results, which indicate a good overall score for Henkel’s   corporate health, we have defined clear fields of action. A wide range of  Social security services and benefits  Our employees worldwide benefit from a high level of social insurance  provisions. In countries where no state social insurance system exists or  such a system covers only basic needs, we organize our own measures and  initiatives to supplement state health and pension insurance provisions.  In the USA, for example, we cover our employees almost completely with  private health insurance plans. In addition, in many countries where this  is usual market practice, Henkel provides company pension provision plans.  In cooperation with the Allianz Insurance Group, we have been offering  all of our employees in Germany the opportunity to have selected   preventive health check-ups as private patients, with a free choice of  doctor and without any contribution to the costs. We also offer “Henkel  CareFlex,” a supplementary company nursing care insurance policy  developed jointly with the Industrial Union for Mining, Chemicals and  Energy. In this way, approximately 9,000 employees and trainees in   Germany have a basic insurance for outpatient, inpatient and semi-  inpatient care. The insurance is available without a medical examination  and waiting period. In addition to the basic insurance, employees can  add the supplementary long-term care insurance and can also add family  members, such as partners, children, parents or parents-in-law. Where appropriate, we would like to give our employees the opportunity  to individually structure their fringe benefits to suit their personal life  situation. In some countries, for example, we offer flexible solutions that  allow employees to pick and choose their own fringe benefits and top them  up. Over the past year, our employees in China, for example, have received  a credit balance that they can spend flexibly on more than 30 different  benefits, including health, risk management and lifestyle options.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  100 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  In Germany, Henkel also involves employee representatives in many  decision-making processes beyond those for which worker participation  is a statutory requirement. The results of this decades-long, open and  constructive cooperation between employers and employee representa- tives include, for example, an improved → work-life balance, flexible  working hours, → accident prevention and health protection in the  workplace, → company pension plans and retirement schemes, and  preventive healthcare.  Dealing with structural changes  Preserving jobs and dealing with necessary structural changes responsibly  are important to us. In order to secure the company’s competitiveness,  we continually adapt our structures to market conditions. If jobs are  affected by this, we enter into a solution-oriented dialog with employee  representatives before actions are taken. In doing so, we follow all  applicable codetermination legislation and apply the required procedures  for each action. To date, we have been able to manage necessary restruc- turing measures through socially compatible solutions while reconciling  interests. The actions involved range from special semi-retirement  models and early retirement, through to support with professional  reskilling and refocus. measures were developed in 2021, some of which have already been  implemented, to further drive cultural change at Henkel. These include a  360° feedback tool, the simplification of internal processes to facilitate  faster decision-making and to increase the scope for creativity and  innovation, and the introduction of our “Smart Work” concept.  The important role of our employee representatives Our various employee representative bodies play a key role. An in-depth  exchange of views and consultations with our management takes place  at the operational level, for example with the local works councils, as  well as across companies with the trade union. We provide our employee  representatives with information regularly and on a timely basis, and  give them as much detail as possible about topics such as the corporate  strategy, for example. In countries where no employee representation is  planned or established, social dialog with the respective management  serves as a voluntary and informal instrument for close exchange. This  enables us to improve communication with our employees, include their  perspectives early on, and jointly shape future-oriented issues. It also  helps Henkel to avoid conflicts of interest and strengthens employee  identification with the company. Employee representation plays a partic- ularly important role in Europe. In 1995, Henkel was one of the first  German companies to voluntarily set up a European Works Council  (EWC) to continue the successful cooperation between management  and employee representatives at the European level. Through the EWC,  Henkel informs the representatives of its European companies about  matters such as the economic situation, transnational initiatives of the  company such as restructuring or reorganization programs, safety,  health and the environment, and training and development programs.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  101 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  As part of the    ERT initiative (European Round Table for Industry),  we signed a pledge to promote diversity and inclusion together with  53 business leaders. We also support the initiative    “Business for  Inclusive Growth” (B4IG), a global business coalition for inclusive  growth that is supported by the OECD and aims to pool and strengthen  the commitment of private companies to reduce inequality related to  opportunity, gender and region. Our commitment to diversity and  inclusion has been recognized several times in recent years, including  Henkel’s recognition as a    “Diversity Leader 2021” by Statista and the  Financial Times. As in previous years, global and regional campaigns related to diversity  and inclusion topics were held at our sites in various regions throughout  the year. Examples of this include the   #ChooseToChallenge initiative  for the International Women’s Day and the Diversity Talk Series in the  Asia-Pacific region. To foster our values-based culture, we also offered  interactive videos on the topic of Unconscious Bias, and eLearning  modules that were accessed more than 7,500 times in total. A new  anti-harassment compliance training was also introduced in 2021. Diversity &amp; Inclusion as factors for success   and innovation At Henkel,    diversity and inclusion are a business imperative and  form an integral part of our corporate culture. We are convinced that a  diversified workforce, as well as an open and appreciative corporate   culture, are important success factors in a globalized world. Different  perspectives, cultures and ways of thinking enable us to meet the needs  of our increasingly diverse markets and stakeholders with creative and  innovative products, services and solutions. Through a number of   programs and training courses, we strengthen the understanding and  appreciation of diversity while promoting an inclusive corporate culture.  Diversity at Henkel represents the variety of talents, attitudes, per- spectives, strengths, abilities and characteristics of our employees and  business partners that make us unique and contribute to creativity,  innovation and business success. It is the differences of individuals in  our company, such as experience, values, education, gender, sexual  orientation, origin or religious background, that make us strong and  successful. We want to create an inclusive working environment in  which every employee is valued and individual performance is recognized.  On principle, we also fill our job vacancies exclusively according to  ability, potential and performance. We do not tolerate discriminatory  behavior either when we hire new employees or in our daily interaction  with each other. With our Global Diversity &amp; Inclusion policy, we have  promised to further strengthen diversity and the related appreciative  behavior at Henkel.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  102 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  We also have a number of support programs for women in our business  units and functions around the world. In the Beauty Care business  unit, for example, a global, internal network called RISE was created  to promote gender balance in management positions, for example,  through the participation of women in a mentoring program. The aim  of the    Women into Science and Engineering program, run by the  Adhesive Technologies business unit, is to connect women at various  management levels with managers in the technology and engineering  sector worldwide to enable the sharing of skills and knowledge. Even  outside our own company, we are seeking to counteract the under- representation of women in technical professions and driving forward  gender diversity in the start-up and technology sector. Our digital unit  and platform for open innovation and collaboration, Henkel dx Ventures,  hosted the    Xathon for the third time in 2021, an ideation hackathon  for 100 female founders.   • Internationality and origin: With employees from a total of 124 coun- tries, cultural diversity is a part of everyday working life at our company.  An international workforce composed of people with  different cultural  backgrounds is important in a global company like Henkel, as it enables  us to develop an understanding of our markets. To address the challenges  of mixed teams, we offer intercultural training and workshops to raise  awareness of different value systems and their influence on daily actions.  Henkel also encourages international transfers within employees’  career paths. 38.1 % ratio of women in   management positions 124 nationalities Our diversity dimensions  At Henkel, we pursue a holistic Diversity &amp; Inclusion approach. The many  dimensions that define us as individuals include our education, family  and relationships, strengths and abilities, and personal experiences.  And while we recognize that all of these individual attributes contribute  to our diversity, our strategic initiatives focus on the following core  dimensions of diversity:  • Gender: Our goal is to continuously increase the ratio of women in  the company at all levels, and we have the ambition to achieve gender  parity across all management levels by 2025. The percentage of women  in management positions was around 38 percent in 2021, representing  a further increase on the previous year. To achieve these ambitious   targets, we strive to make it even easier for women to combine their  careers with their personal life plans. We support our employees by  offering them flexible working models. These models include mobile  working, part-time and → flexible working hours, job sharing and   tandem models, or sabbaticals. Another way we help families balance  work and family life is by offering childcare and → social services. At  the Düsseldorf site, there are 240 childcare places in three company  daycare centers. Henkel also offers care places for 75 children at the  company daycare center in Bratislava, Slovakia. In Germany, Henkel  is a partner in the initiative “Success Factor Family”. Through this  program, the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, together with the  central associations of German business and the German Trade Union  Federation (DGB), are committed to more family-friendliness in the  German economy.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  103 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  With three models for semi-retirement, we want to actively shape the  demographic change at Henkel. This enables our employees at all sites  in Germany to leave work up to six years early, depending on the semi-  retirement model. This provides particularly important support for  employees in demanding shift work. At the same time, we encourage the  targeted training of qualified young people by having their experienced  colleagues in semi-retirement coach them in direct preparation for  the tasks in a specific role.   • People with disabilities: At Henkel, we foster a culture of inclusion  that focuses on the skills and individual talents of people with   disabilities. In 2021, we marked the International Day of Persons with  Disabilities as an opportunity to raise awareness of the topic among  all employees. A specially developed toolkit provides important infor- mation on the topic of inclusion. Through targeted programs,  including in our emerging markets, we strive to offer everybody the  same opportunities while always focusing on a personʼs individual  strengths rather than their limitations. One representative example of  this approach is an integration program at our Global Business Solu- tions Center in Manila, Philippines, which takes a holistic approach to  integrating people with disabilities into the world of work.  • Sexual orientation: Henkel strives to create a working environment  that is open to all people regardless of their sexual orientation or identity.  We have LGBTQ+ networks in several countries and raise awareness of  the topic through a range of events and activities. During Pride Month  2021, we displayed the rainbow flag behind our corporate logo on our  global social media channels to express our solidarity with the LGBTQ+  community, as well as our support for the LGBTQ+ community through  internal and external outreach on Coming Out Day. Since 2021, Henkel  has also been a member of    Out Leadership, a global LGBTQ+ business  network that offers insights and information on LGBTQ+ topic and key  tools for companies and employees to promote equality.  • Generations: At Henkel, four generations – Baby Boomers, Gen X, Y  and Z – work together under the same roof. We encourage → life-long  learning across all generations through appropriate training measures.  Specifically, we use mentoring and employee networks in different  business units and countries to promote knowledge transfer and an  exchange of perspectives between experienced and less experienced  employees. We also offer employees of all generations a wide range of  programs for → maintaining physical and mental health. Our social  services also help to provide support to employees facing challenges at  different stages of their lives such as when they take on responsibility  for relatives in need of care.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  104 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Our approach to global health management In order to ensure holistic health care at all sites, we work continuously  to establish uniform principles. These now include the availability of  first responders, the offer of flu shots and participation in the global  health campaign, as well as conducting emergency medical drills and  occupational health screenings. To monitor these health protection  measures, we collect metrics worldwide, which are reported annually  by all Henkel sites. In addition, the sites report occupational diseases as  soon as they have been officially confirmed by the authorities.  The Henkel Health Procedure describes the minimum global standards  for protecting and promoting health. In the implementation of internal  guidelines, programs and legal requirements, regional managers for  health, workplace safety and security provide support for management  and employees. In several regions, locally employed physicians also  act as health managers to oversee the local implementation of health  programs in the local language, taking local requirements into account.  Each year, company physicians from all Henkel sites in Germany join  together to share experiences and exchange best practice. Several annual  exchange activities for our global occupational safety officers and our  regional health and safety managers also take place. The global Head  of Health Management in Düsseldorf maintains weekly contact with  colleagues in the different regions and makes important findings available  to all sites worldwide. An annual survey of all Henkel sites on local health  programs and fulfilling requirements provides us with an overview of our  global health management. This is the foundation for global and regional  coordination activities for the further expansion of our programs. Maintain and improve health  We promote the health and vitality of our employees to help create an  agile, high-performance organization. To do so, we rely on globally uni- form health and safety standards, and provide health and preventive  care programs to guard against workplace risks and general health risks  that could lead to illness. The broad range of health services offered at  our sites has two aims: promoting our employees’ physical health (via  seminars for giving up smoking, health check-ups, AIDS prevention,  etc.), and maintaining their mental vitality (through stress management  and similar measures). We pick up on important social trends, such as  the demographic change, with our program for maintaining working  capacity. In addition to a number of regional and local programs, we  have been carrying out a major joint health campaign with all sites every  year. The aim here is to reach more than 90 percent of employees globally,  which is a key target of our sustainability strategy. “Back-Up Your Life” is the most recent of five global health campaigns to  date. In 2021, the activities targeted the physical and mental strengthening  of employees through a number of initiatives. The focus was on ergo- nomics and fitness in the workplace. More than 800 employees worldwide  have been trained as ErgoScouts, who act as ambassadors for this topic  within the company. A fitness week themed “Smart Work – Smart Fitness”  rounded off the campaign with a diverse program for physical and mental  fitness and nutrition. Information about the campaign was shared on a  globally accessible platform and actively communicated to all channels.  With this approach, “Back-Up Your Life” was able to reach more than  90 percent of our employees.

In addition, there are tailored care packages for the early medical  treatment of health disorders. Our learning platform offers learning  paths on physical and mental health with short learning units. Also on  offer are online training courses, available globally, for managers to learn  how they can contribute to greater motivation and a better working  atmosphere combined with higher performance, while at the same time  reducing absences due to illness. We continued to expand our digital  formats for boosting mental health in 2021. Our initiatives to create  → flexible working hours also aim to improve work-life balance and  reduce stress factors. In addition to providing individual psychological and social counseling,  our social services at all our German sites also offer assistance with  workplace integration management and the → work-life balance, for  example in the search for childcare or in the case of relatives in need of  care. At all locations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, we also offer  preventive health training aimed at strengthening the individual’s own  personality, identifying existing resources and teaching helpful coping  strategies for dealing with daily challenges at work and in everyday life.  Continuous expansion of health programs New measures to address overall wellbeing and mental and physical  health were also identified in all regions in 2021. Our new digital MyCare  Hub, for example, raises awareness and increases uptake of all local and  global health and prevention services as a central platform for health  campaigns, ranging from vaccinations to our collaborations with sports  and fitness providers, which we have also expanded globally. We have  also further improved and expanded our Employee Assistance Program.  These services provide our employees with support in coping with pro- fessional and family problems, as well as help in the event of physical or  mental illness. Demography and Work 4.0 We launched a demography program at our headquarters in Düsseldorf  in 2013 to promote long-term employability against the backdrop of  demographic change. This holistic concept includes a combination of  preventive occupational healthcare with a general medical check-up,  workability index, and employee surveys. This program is complemented  by the “TOP Check 4 Health” assessment for mental stress. In this process,  supervisors and employees systematically analyze work flows, work  organization and environment, and teamwork and leadership. Where  improvement is needed, they also initiate measures to address the  problem. This also includes specific suggestions and offers for improving  and maintaining the health and performance capabilities of participating  employees. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  106 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Increased occupational safety The COVID-19 pandemic: Prevention and crisis management  We do everything we can to ensure the safety of our employees, whether  they are on site or working from home. We have implemented compre- hensive measures to protect our employees and prevent the further spread  of COVID-19. These included the possibility of mobile working, modified  workflows, social distancing regulations, personal protective equipment,  and the provision of tests and hand disinfectants. Full-coverage COVID- 19 vaccinations were also a key contributor to protecting our employees  in 2021. The Henkel Crisis Management Committee (CSC) was tasked with global  responsibility for crisis management within the company. With the aid  of a clearly defined process, decisions made at global level to protect our  employees are cascaded down and implemented at country and regional  level, while local crisis teams take additional measures in line with local  COVID-19 requirements. In addition to regular newsletters about new  requirements, our employees can find information about all issues related  to COVID-19 on an internal company website. This includes a wide range  of tips for how to ensure safety in the workplace and while on the road,  as well as contact partners who are available to provide assistance, best  practice examples from around the world, and responses to frequently  asked questions.  In 2021, we conducted a global employee survey on the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic on the general and health needs of employees.  90 percent of the participants were satisfied to very satisfied with our  crisis management, including the safety and health measures on site.  “Zero accidents” as a long-term goal Occupational safety within the company and along the value chain was a  top priority for us even before the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain focused  on our long-term objective of zero accidents and want to improve our  occupational safety by 60 percent by the end of 2025 compared to 2010.  We have anchored this overarching goal as a key performance indicator  in our new sustainability strategy. In 2021, we recorded 0.7 occupational  incidents per million hours worked by our employees. This is an improve- ment of 42 percent over the base year 2010. In 2021, there were no fatal  occupational accidents involving an employee of Henkel or an external  company working on behalf of a Henkel company at a Henkel site.  To achieve our goal, we invest in training to raise awareness and increase  technical safety standards. We regularly review whether our    Safety,  Health and Environment (SHE) standards are being strictly adhered to.  We are also committed to improving occupational safety at our subcon- tractors and that of other companies’ employees working at our sites.  Regular training courses are held at all sites to ensure that our employees  are able to identify and eliminate accident risks. We are increasingly  extending the programs already in place in certain areas to cover the entire  company. We also conduct global safety campaigns aimed at creating  even greater awareness of the most important safety issues among our  employees. 42 % safer per million hours worked* * Base year 2010 HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  107 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Measures for improved workplace protection and safety  In 2021, all three business units (Adhesive Technologies, Beauty Care and  Laundry &amp; Home Care) continued their efforts to increase the engagement  and participation of our employees in safety programs. One of the   measures implemented for this purpose was a Safety Day held across  the business units, during which the employees at each site were briefed  on the common goal of zero accidents. Despite the limitations imposed  by COVID-19, the program was scheduled to run over the course of an  entire week, with the option of virtual participation. This allowed us to  reach as many participants as possible. The activities focused on raising  awareness of health and safety topics in a fun way. We also expanded  our Cultural and Behavior-Based Safety programs, the core elements of  which are open dialog about safe and risky practices in the workplace.  More than 350,000 such dialogs were conducted at our production facilities  in 2021. In our Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit, we used a specially  developed app that enables employees to directly and easily report safety  concerns and analyze safety indicators. We also held a wide range of  training courses on health and occupational safety topics at our sites  over the course of the year. In addition to measures to foster a safety-oriented corporate culture, we  also rolled out a range of technical improvements at our sites in 2021. For  several years, Henkel has invested in technology pilot projects to increase  occupational safety related to the use of forklifts. Launched in 2021, the  Safety4DRIVE campaign focuses on reviewing traffic patterns and safety  equipment at both the Laundry &amp; Home Care and Beauty Care business  unit sites. We also modernized our forklift fleet and trained local teams  on implementing the forklift safety standard in the next few years. The  campaign will also be continued in our Adhesive Technologies business  unit in 2022. Another focus was on the prevention of trip, slip and fall accidents, which  are among the most frequent causes of accidents at Henkel. Beauty Care  worked out a systematic approach to root cause analysis for this purpose.  Laundry &amp; Home Care held training sessions on identifying trip hazards  at all of its manufacturing facilities. Adhesive Technologies conducted a  trip, slip and fall campaign in Europe, challenging its sites to conduct a  critical self-assessment of all areas on their premises. This also involved  a risk assessment of any shortcomings identified as well as the preparation  of an appropriate action plan to correct these deficiencies and prevent this  type of accident. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  108 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS In addition to auditing and compliance processes designed to ensure  compliance with our codes and standards, we also recognize our respon- sibility for respecting human rights along the value chain through our  supplier management system. This approach supports our commitment  to the Forced Labor Resolution of the    Consumer Goods Forum (CGF).  Our  membership of → Together for Sustainability – Chemical Supply  Chains for a Better World (TfS) is a strong example of this approach in  action.  We follow ongoing human-rights-related developments very closely at  both international and national level, including the National Action Plans  for Business and Human Rights, as well as the    UK’s Modern Slavery Act.  We continue to develop our approach in line with the resulting expec- tations. This includes the creation of an internal cross-functional task  force on human rights due diligence in 2021. In addition, we are in con- tinuous dialog with stakeholders outside the company and are actively  involved in industry initiatives. For example, in 2020 we participated in  a webinar as part of the German chemical and pharmaceutical industry’s  sustainability initiative Chemie³. This dealt with current developments  concerning human rights in the supply chain, as well as management  approaches for companies. Internally, we promote awareness of our  obligation to respect human rights by integrating relevant content into  eLearning courses and training sessions attended by our employees. In  2021, we placed a special focus on human rights due diligence training  in our purchasing activities. Applying due diligence at all levels  The way that companies act on their responsibility to    respect human  rights and exercise due diligence is the focus of increasing public dis- cussion and political debate.  Our commitment to respecting human rights  Henkel has a clear policy of doing business in an ethical and legal man- ner. This is inseparably linked with our commitment to respecting inter- nationally acknowledged human rights. As early as 1994, Henkel’s Mission  and Principles document emphasized that respecting social values and  standards is an integral part of our company policy. Since then, we have  developed and adapted a comprehensive set of    codes, standards and  processes to provide our employees, customers, suppliers, investors and  the communities we operate in with a clear definition of the ethical and  social values we uphold – including human rights expectations.  In 2000, we also introduced our Code of Conduct, including a clear and  proactive commitment to support human rights: We expect our employees  to respect local customs, traditions and social values, and to respect  human rights for a free and fulfilling life. In 2003, we underscored our  commitment to supporting and respecting human rights by joining the     United Nations Global Compact. We still refer to this commitment  today as a fundamental element in our Code of Conduct and provide  details of it in our Code of Corporate Sustainability, as well as in our Social  Standards and SHE Standards.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  109 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Principles and policies  Our codes and standards cover a wide range of topics including working  hours, occupational health and safety, data protection, non-discrimination,  fair remuneration, freedom of association and collective bargaining,  and zero tolerance of child and forced labor. We have formulated the     codes and standards in line with expectations that are relevant to our  specific business operations. We revise the documents on a regular  basis to ensure that we conduct our business in a way that reflects our  commitment to support and respect internationally proclaimed human  rights. Our most important documents include: Code of Conduct; Code  of Corporate Sustainability; Social Standards; Safety, Health and Environ- ment (SHE) Standards and the Responsible Sourcing Policy. An    over- view of human rights in the context of responsible business practices at  Henkel is available on our website.  Risk analysis  We have clear due diligence and compliance processes in place to iden- tify and assess social and human rights impacts, and ensure that – if   necessary – access to remedy is in place and available. These processes  include our Group-wide audit program, which assesses and improves  governance, processes and controls independently and objectively. It  also includes audits that form part of our supplier management system. Our approach to respecting human rights  Alongside legal requirements, our codes and standards provide a basis  for decision-making and engagement within our sphere of influence  worldwide. In this context, we adhere to international labor standards as  a minimum, and local statutes where these are more exacting. Our codes  and standards also reflect our commitment to the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on  Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact,  as well as the expectations set out in the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights.  The Guiding Principles were adopted in 2011 and, through their “Protect,  Respect, Remedy” framework, contribute to clarity regarding the different  roles that states and companies play in relation to human rights. Within  their own sovereign territory, states are responsible for protecting  against human rights violations and ensuring access to the full range of  human rights. Companies are expected to respect human rights, comply  with national legislation, and establish reporting channels and provide  access to remedy in the event of human rights violations. These guiding  principles include key elements such as principles and policies, risk  analysis, effective measures, and reporting and complaints mechanisms,  which we have incorporated into our approach to respecting human rights. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  110 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Effective measures  Based on our risk analysis, we have identified two significant human  rights risks in our supply chain at present: raw materials based on palm  oil and palm kernel oil, and raw materials from regions associated with  military conflicts. We are closely monitoring these two areas with regard  to their potential impact on human rights.  In order to reduce risks in the palm oil industry, we have made a com- mitment to procure our palm-oil-based raw materials in line with the  principles and criteria of the    Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil  (RSPO). We also work closely with stakeholders along the value chain,  from our suppliers to the RSPO, NGOs and smallholder farmers, to pro- mote sustainable practices and respect for human rights.  To mitigate the risk associated with raw materials from regions associated  with military conflicts, we require our direct metal suppliers to provide  recognized documentation each year to prove that they do not source or  process metals from these types of critical sources. As a matter of principle, we maintain intensive dialog with our suppliers  to promote sustainable practices and respect for human rights along the  value chain. For example, we also work with partners from the entire  chemical industry as part of the TfS initiative. More extensive information  about this is available on our    website.  Within the scope of the risk analysis, we identify relevant human rights  risks by assessing individual cases according to the following four criteria:   • Potentially significant negative impact on humans.   • Systemic lack of protection by the government.   • Conditions that potentially encourage repeated or systemic   non- compliance.   • And influence or potential influence by Henkel (positive or negative).  Henkel considers that a relevant human rights risk exists if all four are  met. This allows us to make a clear distinction between an individual  case of non-compliance due to a single incident, and a human rights risk  that is relevant to our business activities. To do so, we analyze human- rights-related risks in our company and along our value chains. In our  global supply chains, for example, we use an early-warning system for  sustainability risks. This includes defining the risk potential in our pro- curement markets and evaluating value chains on a cross-industry basis.  In doing so, we focus on countries that international institutions have  classified as risk countries. Based on this, we define the riskiest markets  by combining this analysis of risk countries with issues of particular rel- evance to our supply chains at that time, and take appropriate measures.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  111 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Reporting  We carry out regular audits at our production and administration sites,  and at our subcontractors and logistics centers, to verify compliance with  our codes and standards. This also includes relevant human rights issues.  All audit results, including the review of our SHE and Social Standards,  are reported directly to Henkel’s Management Board in the annual report  compiled by the Internal Audit team. In line with the criteria of our risk  analysis process, our comprehensive Group-wide audit program in 2021  did not reveal any indications of human rights violations related to  Henkel’s business operations. The identified risks related to raw materials  are addressed as part of our supply chain management approach.  Grievance mechanisms  Henkel employees, as well as workers at our suppliers or other people  affected, can report breaches of our codes and standards directly to the  responsible contact person within our company. Our compliance hotline  is operated by an independent external provider and is available globally.  In addition, an email can be sent anonymously to the Henkel Compliance  Office using a contact form. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  112 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Corporate citizenship firmly anchored in our  corporate culture    Corporate citizenship has been an integral part of our    corporate  culture ever since the company was established by Fritz Henkel in 1876  and is also clearly reflected in our corporate Purpose. Together with  our employees, pensioners, customers, consumers and charitable  organizations, we are committed to making a lasting contribution to  society worldwide, above and beyond our business activities.  Henkel’s commitment is based on three pillars: volunteer engagement by  our employees, partnerships with charitable organizations, and emergency  aid in the event of natural disasters. Our overarching goal was to reach  20 million people through our social engagement activities by 2025. We  exceeded this target in 2021, ahead of schedule. From 2010 through the  end of 2021, we reached more than 26 million people. This is particularly  attributable to our contribution to the fight against the global COVID-19  pandemic. In the past year, we supported a total of about 2,050 projects  and reached around 7.03 million people. Donations (of cash and products,  excluding additional time off work for employees) amounted to about  23.8 million euros during the reporting year.   7.03 m people reached 2,050 projects promoted We are committed to further expanding our community education pro- grams and volunteering. For 2030, we have set ourselves the new goal to  contribute to improving the lives of 30 million people (base year 2010)  worldwide.  Henkel’s social engagement is primarily intended to contribute to  securing the future viability of our society. We are facing enormous  challenges, but they are also creating a wide range of opportunities, for  example in the areas of sustainability, innovation and digitalization.  This is why the focus of our support is on education. This is reflected in  our own initiatives such as    Forscherwelt (Researchers’ World) and  our → Sustainability Ambassador Program, and also applies to our   partnerships with non-profit organizations and our offers of voluntary  work. For example, we are committed to the further education of  → smallholders as part of our commitment to sustainable palm oil, and to  maintaining long-standing cooperations with educational institutions.  Our Corporate Standard “Donations, Memberships and Sponsorships”  outlines how projects are selected. Corporate citizenship contributes  significantly to the “Education” component in the “Thriving Communities”  dimension of our new sustainability framework. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  113 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Example: Corporate volunteering In 2021, Henkel continued its commitment to achieving a viable circular  economy and preventing plastic waste from entering the environment.  As part of “Trashfighter,” our global employee initiative, we partnered  with the non-profit international environmental protection organization  “RhineCleanUp”. This organization conducts waste cleanup events,  especially on riverbanks, but also in other public areas. The aim is to  raise awareness of waste in the environment and of the value of recycling.  Example: Social partnerships  Since 2019, Henkel, in collaboration with the    Fritz Henkel Stiftung  foundation, has sponsored the non-profit programming school    “ReDI  School of Digital Integration”. Local people interested in technology and  immigrants who do not have access to digital education or a professional  network are taught digital skills in professional training courses. The  organization also offers participants the chance to work with a start-up  and with the digital industry more broadly. The objective is to help them  gain a position in German society and in the labor market. We have also  been cooperating with the charity organizations    IntoUniversity since  2021. We offer young people the support they need to realize their potential  for the future. This includes a “future internship” in partnership with  Our three pillars     Voluntary commitment of employees    Since the foundation of the initiative “MIT Volunteering”  (Make an Impact on Tomorrow) in 1998, we have supported the     voluntary activities of Henkel employees and pensioners in  over 16,800 projects and more than 100 countries around the  world. At the same time, more and more employees and pen- sioners are joining forces to implement larger social projects.    Social partnerships     As part of our corporate engagement, we enter into social   partnerships in the communities where Henkel operates, in an  effort to support social initiatives and public institutions. The  main goal is to promote education in the areas of digitalization,  sustainability and innovation.   Emergency aid     Henkel takes a fast and unbureaucratic approach to providing  emergency aid after natural disasters around the world through  the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation.

The non-profit educa- tional initiative Teach First Deutschland encourages and supports  young people to achieve more at school. At Teach First Deutschland,  university graduates help schools in disadvantaged communities. As  additional teachers, they help students to find their own path. Beyond  Germany, Henkel also supported the    Teach for All organization in  Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Kenya, Latvia, Ukraine and the  USA in 2021. In addition, our brands, together with the Fritz Henkel Stiftung founda- tion, are also involved in partnerships with social initiatives and public  institutions around the world in line with our sustainability strategy: Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative Since 2016, the Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative has been sup- porting girls and women in becoming more self-confident and building  a successful future for themselves. The initiative supports aid projects  worldwide, often in cooperation with independent organizations such as  Plan International Deutschland e.V. in Colombia, Egypt and China. In  2021, a total of 30 projects reached around 5,600 girls and women world- wide. Since the initiative was launched, we have been able to provide  assistance to a total of around 136,000 people. The fourth Schwarzkopf  Million Chances Award was also presented in 2021, sponsored by the  Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation. Four non-profit projects were awarded  prize money of 10,000 euros for their outstanding commitment. The umbrella of our Million Chances initiative also covers our long-term  initiative    Shaping Futures. Since 2010, Schwarzkopf Professional has  been working with non-profit organizations to offer young people the  opportunity to obtain training in basic hairdressing techniques and  establish livelihoods. The volunteer efforts of hairstylists and employees  have made it possible to train over 2,600 young people in more than  30 countries, including Cambodia, Colombia, India, Lebanon and South  Africa. #RethinkFashion initiative at Perwoll  #RethinkFashion is an initiative from our Perwoll brand. Since 2018, it  has encouraged a more conscious approach to clothing. This includes  proper care to prolong the life of textiles, as well as the upcycling of  clothing. Perwoll presented its own fashion collection at the Berlin  Fashion Week in 2021. All of the 20 or so exclusive fashion outfits were  designed and created in collaboration with students from the AMD  Academy of Fashion &amp; Design in Germany. The “NOT NEW” collection  was created exclusively from second-hand clothing. Perwoll is using  this as a way of making a clear statement: It doesn’t always have to be  new. The goal is to encourage consumers to rethink their attitudes and  to highlight the problem of disposable fashion.

With its global    “We Craft for Children” initiative, Henkel has  been involved for many years in a wide range of educational projects  worldwide in partnership with different non-profit organizations. In  2021, Pritt partnered with    Visions for Children e.V., a non-profit  organization that focuses on improving learning conditions and   educational quality in schools in crisis areas and war zones. A total  of 50,000 euros was donated to Visions for Children e.V. as part of a  fundraising craft campaign. Example: Emergency aid In 2021, forest fires destroyed entire towns in the USA. Hundreds of people  fled and were relocated as a result. We provided support through financial  donations to the American and Canadian Red Cross. To demonstrate  our solidarity and provide support for those affected by the catastrophic  flooding in Germany and Belgium in 2021, Henkel donated 1 million euros  in cash and product donations (hygiene, cleaning and personal care  products). Most of the funds were donated to Aktion Deutschland Hilft e.V.,  an alliance of respected German aid organizations that provides joint,  rapid and coordinated emergency aid to people affected by disasters.  The comprehensive    emergency aid package also included financial  assistance and paid time off for affected employees.

In line  with this, the published employee indicators also cover 99 percent of our  employees. The indicators we record throughout the company provide transparency  while helping us to identify potential improvements, manage  activities  and monitor achievements. We show the progress of each of our  indicators  over a five-year period. In this Sustainability Report, we focus on the  publication of our globally relevant core indicators. The figures in the  tables within this chapter have been rounded up or down. As a result,  the rounded figures in some of the rows in the tables may not add up to  the totals as indicated. Environmental indicators for our production operations  The production-related data for 2021 were determined at all 174 Henkel  sites in 56 countries. This means the data represent 100 percent of our   production volume. The data were validated centrally for year-end  reporting and verified at the sites within the framework of our internal  audit program. Any differences discovered or reported at a later date are  corrected retroactively in our reporting system. Since our production  structures are constantly changing – due to the start- up of new sites or  closure of  existing sites, for example – the number of sites contributing  data changes accordingly. To ensure the comparability of the annual  data, we also show their progress as an index relative to the volume  of production. Adjustment of reported indicators Acquisitions and divestments: Initial and historical data are only adjusted  in exceptional cases in which disruptive acquisitions or divestments do not  permit a meaningful comparison of timelines. Updates in methodology: Initial and historical data are corrected where  possible. The resulting changes are highlighted and commented on. Updates in data: Where target-relevant or necessary for clarity, changes  are highlighted and explained. Updates of individual or cumulative values  are made when greater than one percent of the value of the superordinate  indicator (for example, total energy consumption), including the subordinate  indicators (for example, bought-in energy consumption).

HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  127 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Operational incidents and environmental violations Henkel openly reports operational incidents when the consequences include at least one of the following:  • Endangerment of the neighborhood or the environment.  • Tangible losses of more than 500,000 euros.  • A high level of public reaction. Furthermore, Henkel transparently reports on environmental violations where the resulting fine exceeds 10,000 euros. The measures and corrective actions initiated as a result are also disclosed. Year Operational incidents Environmental violations 2021 There were no operational incidents in 2021. There were no environmental violations in 2021. 2020 A fire broke out in the shredder plant at the waste disposal center on the Düsseldorf, Germany, site in  May 2020. It occurred during the shredding of plastic containers that had been emptied of residual   material. The site fire service was alerted by the automatic fire alarm system and by an employee.  Together with Düsseldorf’s professional fire department, which was also alerted, it extinguished the  fire in a short period of time. No personal injuries were sustained. The firefighting water was properly  disposed of in consultation with the relevant authorities.  Measures initiated: The waste disposal process was examined and employees working in waste-generating  operations at the Düsseldorf site were trained in proper waste disposal. In addition, the shredding   process was assessed to see how safety could be improved. The resulting recommendation is that any  new shredder should be designed with an extinguishing system in mind and implemented as such. In July 2020, a fatal accident involving a temporary employee occurred at our detergent factory in  Ibadan, Nigeria. The employee was fatally injured inside a soap mixing machine when he attempted to  access it during normal operation. The machine was immediately stopped with the emergency shut-off  switch. Family and authorities were notified promptly. The causal analysis revealed a failure of the  machine  safeguard. Measures initiated: Henkel was in close contact with the family of the victim and cooperated with the  Nigerian government in the accident investigation. All machinery at the Nigerian site was checked for   safety before operations were resumed. A safety inspection was also conducted on all machines at our  sites with similar production areas. There were no environmental violations in 2020. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  128 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Year Operational incidents Environmental violations Air contamination occurred due to an overpressure incident at our Laundry &amp; Home Care production site  in St. Louis, USA, in May 2020. A raw material caused overpressure in the facility’s air duct system while  a truck was being unloaded. All the processes were shut down and repair work was started promptly. No  personal injuries occurred. Measures initiated: After the factory’s air ducts had been decontaminated and before operations were  resumed, all the containers at the sulfonation facility were inspected for possible damage. In addition,  Henkel took preventive measures at all sites worldwide with similar production processes, with the aim  of preventing similar incidents in the future. A fire occurred in March 2020 at our adhesives plant in Bopfingen, Germany, during production of a   hotmelt adhesive, causing extensive property damage. The building was evacuated once the fire alarm  had been set off and the facility had been shut down as an emergency measure. The fire service was able  to bring the fire under control after a short period of time. Further damage was prevented by the safety   equipment installed. The resulting extinguishing water was properly disposed of in coordination with the  responsible authorities. Measures initiated: An investigation team and a crisis management team were formed to establish the  cause of the fire, while coordinating the smooth resumption of production at a different site. The damaged  building is currently being rebuilt for another use. 2019 During the production of powder laundry detergent, a fire broke out inside the filtering system in the  spray-drying area in our laundry detergent factory in Ibadan, Nigeria, in August 2019. The installed  detectors instantly recognized the fire. Respective measures were immediately taken with internal and  external support, in accordance with the provisions of the local intervention plan. The fire was brought  under control within a short period of time. There was no damage to people or the environment. The  fire caused a brief interruption to operations. Measures initiated: After a comprehensive check of all safety-relevant systems at the entire site,   additional training and emergency exercises that involved the entire workforce at the plant were  carried  out. These will also be repeated regularly in the future. The comprehensiveness and suitability of the  safety concept was confirmed after an on-site audit by TÜV Nord. A deflagration occurred in our adhesives plant in Kurkumbh, India, in April 2019. Unfortunately, two  employees suffered burns as a result of the deflagration. They immediately received emergency medical  aid and were then transferred to a hospital where one employee died of his injuries during treatment. Measures initiated: Henkel started assisting the families and relations during the treatment of the  employees and continues to support the families. Immediately after the incident, safety reviews were  completed at each of our sites with similar production to ensure that operations could continue safely. There were no environmental violations in 2019.

There were no environmental violations in 2018. 2017 In January 2017, there was a product spillage on the site of our adhesives plant in Düsseldorf, Germany.  During the production of an adhesive, an aqueous solvent was unintentionally added, triggering the   curing process of the adhesive. The resulting adhesive foam activated the pressure relief system, overflowed  out of the containment chamber and spilled onto a street within the site. The hardened foam was  mechanically removed from the street surface. The incident did not cause any significant interruption  to operations and there were no personal injuries or damage to the environment. Measures initiated: The design of the pressure relief system was examined and the alarm function was  tested. A measuring device was installed that continuously monitors the solvent to make sure it is free  of water. There were no environmental violations in 2017. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  130 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  INDICES We prepared our Sustainability Report in alignment with the Global  Reporting Initiative’s (GRI)    “GRI Standards”*. The  following GRI index  indicates how our reporting meets GRI standards. The required information  is available on the indicated pages of the Sustainability Report and in the  audited parts of the Annual Report. Where a disclosure is not  completely  covered by the disclosures, we have included the relevant data directly in  the index or have labeled the gaps as “omissions”. Henkel transparently  reports all information and data that are ascertainable and relevant for the  Group from a management perspective.  At the same time, we present our progress regarding the principles  defined by the    United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) as part of our  annual Sustainability Report. Henkel has been a signatory to the Global  Compact since 2003. The UNGC is a strategic initiative for companies that  have aligned their strategies and operations with ten universally  recognized   principles related to human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption.  The UNGC index shows where to find information relating to the imple- mentation of the respective principles within the Henkel Sustainability  Report 2021. The GRI index and UNGC index are presented together below. The over- view lists information relating to the GRI standards and to topics that  are relevant for the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact  (UNGC Principles). The 2021 Sustainability Report is also the separate combined non-financial  report for the Henkel Group and Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA for fiscal year  2021 within the meaning of Sections 315b and 315c, in conjunction with  289b to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the Regulation  (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament, and of the Council of June 18,  2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable  investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (in the following  EU taxonomy regulation). Reporting that goes beyond GRI to meet  requirements of the HGB and of the EU taxonomy regulation is presented  in the index with the title “Information on the non-financial report (NFR).”  For the disclosures marked with a “ ,” PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH  WPG performed a limited assurance engagement. The → independent  assurance report by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH WPG can be found  in the scope and reference framework section (p. 154–157) of the Sustain- ability Report 2021. * 2016, unless stated otherwise HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  131 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  General Standard Disclosures Audited UNGC  Principles Organizational profile  \n",

These are mainly based on data from RAINS 7.52. No CO2 offsets were taken into account when determining  the Scope 1 carbon dioxide emissions. The net volume of GHG emissions (Scope 1) is shown. The gross volume includes  electricity additionally generated and  sold to third parties. For site-specific reasons, this occurs primarily at our site in Düsseldorf-Holthausen (Germany); gross  emissions at Henkel level total 597 thousand metric tons, and biogenic gross emissions at Henkel level total 25 thousand  metric tons. The published Scope 1 emissions include CO2 emissions from vehicles used at our production sites (e.g. forklifts) to a large  degree. CO2 emissions from vehicle fleets operated outside our sites are excluded. Direct GHG emissions resulting from   processes are currently not considered to be significant based on an analysis carried out in Germany.

We previously used the location-based method  (Scope 2).  Information on gross volume and CO2 equivalents has not yet been provided in  itemized form, as the data basis required for  the calculation still has to be expanded. The CO2 emissions relate to our production sites that are under our direct operational control. These sites represent our core  activities. In the location-based method, country-specific emission factors were used for  calculating  carbon dioxide emissions;  based on this method, a Scope 2 emissions value of 305 thousand metric tons would have been determined for 2021.  For the market-based method (Scope 2), we do not calculate emissions for the  purchase of electricity from renewable  sources that meets internal quality criteria. For the remaining electricity, we calculate contract, provider or region-specific   emission factors, depending on the sites for which we have access to the figures.  They are updated each year. In the remaining cases, we use country-specific factors. For European countries, we use residual  factors if available. For all other countries, we use the factors that are most recently published by the  International Energy  Agency (IEA). 72 percent of the entire electricity purchase comes from renewable sources or falls under  supplier- specific  emission factors.

Using representative life cycle assessments, we regularly evaluate the raw materials we use across all product categories. In  selecting and using ingredients, we also follow  controversial discussions in the general public about the safety of chemical  ingredients in consumer products. These provide us with opportunities to continually conduct a critical review of the scientific  basis of our assessments. Henkel has been carrying out successful research since the 1980s to develop new  methods for testing the safety and   compatibility of raw materials and products.

The following text is a translation of the independent practitioner’s report. To Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA, Düsseldorf We have performed a limited assurance engagement on   • the chapters on sustainability reporting denoted with “ ” in the  subsections “General Standard Disclosures” and “Topic-specific   Standards” of the section “Indices” in the sustainability report   (hereinafter the “Sustainability Disclosures”)   and  • the chapters of the non-financial report denoted with “ ” in the  subsections “General Standard Disclosures,” “Topic-specific Standards”  and “Information on the non-financial report (NFR)” of the section  “Indices” in the sustainability report (hereinafter the “Disclosures on  Non-financial Reporting”)  of the “Sustainability Report 2021,” which is also the combined separate  non-financial report pursuant to §§ 289b Abs. 3 and 315b Abs. 3 HGB, of  Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA, Düsseldorf, (hereinafter the “Company”) for the  period from 1 January to 31 December 2021 (hereinafter the “Sustainability  Report”). Our engagement in this context relates solely to the disclosures  denoted with the symbol “ ”. Not subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of doc- umentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Sustainability Report. Responsibilities of the Executive Directors  The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the selection  of the Sustainability Disclosures and Disclosures on Non-financial Report- ing to be evaluated as well as for the preparation of the Sustainability  Disclosures in accordance with the principles stated in the Sustainability  Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter the  “GRI-Criteria”) and the Non-financial Report in accordance with §§ 315c  in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: “German  Commercial Code”) and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18 June 2020  on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the “EU Taxonomy  Regulation”) and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for  making their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in  the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder,  as set out in section “Sustainable Finance,” subsection “EU taxonomy”  of the Sustainability Report. This responsibility of Company’s executive directors includes the selection  and application of appropriate methods of non-financial reporting and  sustainability reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates  related to individual sustainability disclosures and non-financial  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  154 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  disclosures of the Group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Fur- thermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control  as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a Sustain- ability Report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud  or error. The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder  contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable inter- pretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been  published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed  their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated  Acts adopted thereunder in section “Sustainable Finance,” subsection  “EU taxonomy” of the Sustainability Report. Company’s executive directors  have also stated in the section “Sustainable Finance,” subsection  “EU Taxonomy” of the Sustainability Report that the interpretations of  the EU Commission, which were published on February 2, 2022 as “Draft  Commission notice on the interpretation of certain legal provisions of  the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation  on the reporting of eligible economic activities and assets” and which  are not yet legally binding, were not taken into account due to their  publication shortly before the finalization of the Non-financial Report.  They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to  the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted  differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to  uncertainties. Independence and Quality Control of the Audit Firm We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding  independence as well as other ethical requirements. Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional  standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors  and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer  und vereidigte Buchprüfer”: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the Standard on  Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute  of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality control  for audit firms (IDW Qualitätssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an  die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis – IDW QS 1) –  and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control  including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance  with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal  and regulatory requirements. Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner  Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on  the Sustainability Disclosures denoted with “ ” in the subsections  “General Standard Disclosures” and “Topic-specific Standards” in the  section “Indices” in the Sustainability Report and the Disclosures on  Non-financial Reporting denoted with “ ” in the subsections “General  Standard Disclosures,” “Topic-specific Standards” and “Information on  the non-financial report (NFR)” in the section “Indices” in the Sustain- ability Report based on our assurance engagement. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  155 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International  Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance  Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Infor- mation, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and  perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about  whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe  that   • the Sustainability Disclosures denoted with “ ” in the subsections  “General Standard Disclosures” and “Topic-specific Standards” of  the section “Indices” in the Company’s Sustainability Report for the  period from 1 January to 31 December 2021 have are not prepared, in  all material respects, in accordance with the relevant GRI-Criteria,   or   • the Disclosures on Non-financial Reporting denoted with “ ” in the  subsections “General Standard Disclosures,” “Topic-specific Standards”  and “Information on the non-financial report (NFR)” of the section  “Indices” in the Company’s Sustainability Report for the period from  1 January to 31 December 2021 have are not prepared, in all material  respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e  HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued  thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors  disclosed in section “Sustainable Finance,” subsection “EU taxonomy”  of the Sustainability Report.  In a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are less  extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly  a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of  the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the  assurance practitioner. In the course of our assurance engagement, we have, amongst other things,  performed the following assurance procedures and further activities:  • Gain an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization  and of the stakeholder engagement  • Inquiries of executive directors and relevant employees involved in  the preparation of the Sustainability Report regarding the preparation  process, the internal control system relating to this process and  selected disclosures in the Sustainability Report  • Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement of the   Sustainability Report  • Analytical procedures on selected disclosures in the Sustainability  Report  • Reconciliation of selected disclosures with corresponding data in the  consolidated financial statements and in the combined management  report  • Evaluation of the presentation of the disclosures  • Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-eligible economic  activities and the corresponding disclosures in the Sustainability  Report  • Inquiries on the relevance of climate-risks In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the  EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret  undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal  terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their inter- pretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are  subject to uncertainties.

        "   - **Data Quantity:** Adding more training data can improve the overall performance of the model. Insufficient data can lead to overfitting or underfitting.\n",
        "   - **Data Diversity:** Diversify your training data. Adding more examples of the same entity types in different contexts and variations can enhance the model's general performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Reduce Dropout Rate:**\n",
        "   - The dropout rate (`drop=0.5`) is currently set at 50%. Reducing this rate may allow the model to retain more information. For example, you can change it to `drop=0.3`:\n",
        "     ```python\n",

        "\n",
        "### 4. **Adjust Optimizer Parameters:**\n",
        "   - You can fine-tune the optimizer initiated with `begin_training()`. For example, adjusting the learning rate could be beneficial. You can add a specific learning rate parameter to the `begin_training()` method:\n",
        "     ```python\n",

        "   - Minibatch sizes can be increased or kept constant (e.g., from 4.0 to 32.0). Smaller minibatch sizes may lead to more frequent updates in each iteration, which could improve the learning process:\n",

        "### 6. **Use Data Augmentation:**\n",
        "   - To diversify training data, you can use data augmentation techniques. For example, creating different variations by altering words or sentence structures in the training data can be effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Re-enable Other Pipelines:**\n",
        "   - If you believe other pipelines besides `ner` could be beneficial, you can re-enable them instead of disabling them. This might help the model learn in a broader context.\n",

        "After trying these steps, you can reassess your results and observe the progress. These types of fine-tuning are often necessary to improve the model's overall performance."
