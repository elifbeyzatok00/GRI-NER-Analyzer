 9 III. Analysis on primary influences, risks, opportunities and countermeasures of  sustainable development  COSCO Group has formulated the COSCO Group Development Planning in 11th Five-year Period  according to the planning of 11th Five-year Period of the State. It has insisted on using the scientific  development outlook in all kinds of work, systematically analyzed the primary influences, risks,  opportunities and countermeasures of sustainable development of COSCO Group with SWOT analytical  method of lean six-sigma, correctly identified advantages, disadvantages, opportunities and threats, and  made countermeasures corresponding based on possible combination of these advantages, disadvantages,  opportunities and threats, thus making correct decisions and planning for sustainable development of  COSCO Group.                   
 10 Analysis on primary influences of sustainable development  Influences on  the company  Influences on  the industry  Influences on  the brand  Influences on  the business  Influences on  investment  Influences on  the employees  Influences on  the society  Development  of COSCO  Group greatly  promotes the  development  of China's  national  economy and  foreign trade,  provides  guarantees for  transport of  important  materials such  as energies  and resources,  and ensures  the national  economic  safety.  COSCO  Group greatly  improves  China's ability  and position in  participating  international  maritime  affairs. China  has been rated  the A-category  member of  United  Nations'  International  Maritime  Organization  for 9 times in a  row,  participating  in the  formulation of  the world's  maritime rules  and the  decisions of  the  international  maritime  affairs.  Ships and  containers  with COSCO  log shuttle  between over  1,500 ports in  more than 160  countries and  regions,  bringing active  influences in  promoting  prosperity of  global trade  and economy. COSCO  Group is  focusing on  sharpening the  comprehensive  competitivenes s of several  vessel fleets  including  container  ships, dry bulk  carriers, oil  tankers and  specialized  cargo carriers  in a horizontal  perspective,  while  improving the  competitivenes s of the supply  chain from  shipping to  door-to-door  logistics,  terminals and  ship-building/s hip-repairing  sectors.  COSCO  Group's  development  has important  impacts on  promoting the  stable  development  of the global  logistics  supply chain  and industry  chain.  By constantly  improving the  competitivenes s of its  shipping  business,  COSCO  expands its  business  presence in  modern  logistics  industry, build  up the core  capability to  surpass its  competitors  and pursue the  goals of three  maximizations , namely the  maximization  of enterprise's  benefits, value  and return to  shareholders. COSCO has  committed  itself to  creating a  platform for  operators and  employees to  show off their  talents and  realize their  dreams, while  giving all  employees the  returns  matching their  contributions  to the  company.  As an  international  shipping  company,  COSCO  Group features  high safety  and  environmental  protection  risks as well as  heavy social  responsibilities . As a result,  COSCO  Group is  speeding up to  build a  resource-savin g and  environment-fr iendly  enterprise.  As a spearhead of China's shipping industry and a global shipping group, whether COSCO Group can achieve the  sustainable development is of great significance and has important impacts on the domestic and international economy and  trade development, its shareholders, employees, customers and partners, the industry, the society, the environment, etc.                              
 11 Analysis on primary risks and opportunities of sustainable development  External  perspective  In-depth  downturn  of  international  shipping market since second half of  2008; drastic fluctuation of global and  domestic capital and financial markets as  well as energy prices, in particular oils;  increased security and environmental  protection costs.  Challenges  Internal perspective  Establishment of a stable and sustainable  operation mode that will not substantially  fluctuate with the drastic fluctuation of the  market. COSCO Group should focus its  efforts to build such an operation mode,  with which, it can make higher profits  than its rivals under favorable market  situation, and can reduce the losses  compared with its rivals or be free from  the losses under unfavorable market  situation. When the market fluctuates  greatly, COSCO Group can maintain its  operation more efficient and make its  returns more stable.  COSCO Group should establish a stable and sustainable  operation mode, carry out the scientific development  outlook and fulfill the comprehensive, harmonious and  sustainable development of the enterprise. It has been  proved by the experience of the international shipping  development that it is hard to fulfill such a development  status under a market downturn. The unstable and  fluctuating development status or development pattern may  be transformed into a stable and coordinated development  pattern only by grasping the development opportunities and  carrying out comprehensive reform and adjustments.  Accelerate the establishment of strategic partnerships with  VIP customers to lay a solid foundation of cargo sources  for successful establishment of a stable and sustainable  operation model.  Speed up the paces to enter the international and domestic  capital markets to provide constant funds for the  enterprise's development and propel the enterprise's  "system transformation and establishment".  In recent few years  COSCO Group successfully grasps the  important opportunities of speeding up the  development  and  transforming  development or operation models.  Accelerate the adjustment and the optimization in such  aspects as industry structure, asset structure, fleet structure  and staff structure.  The world's economy and trade is expected to maintain  stable and continuous growth at least in the foreseeable  early 21st century, namely in the first 30 years. This will  provide stable and continuously growing market spaces for  the global shipping, logistics and related industries.  The objectives of building a well-off society in an all-round  way by 2020 decide the growth speed and size of China's  shipping, logistics and related businesses and will provide  the driving forces for continuous development of Chinas  shipping and logistics enterprises including COSCO Group  for a long period of time in the future.  Opportunities  In longer period of time  The approach of the corporate citizen era  will lay a long-term and solid foundation  on market and environment for COSCO  Group's successful establishment of a  stable and sustainable operation pattern,  and to fulfill the sustainable development.   The sustainability concept is being deepened. The  corporate social responsibility campaign is in the  ascendancy. Establish and implement the scientific  development outlook, establish a harmonious socialist  society and construct a harmonious enterprise.  Market risks. For a certain period of time at present and in  the future, supplies and demands of international shipping  market will change reversely. The situation that supply falls  short of demand will change into the situation that the  supply exceeds demands. The market entered into  low-valley and adjustment period rapidly from peak period. Operation risks. Based on operational situation of fleets of  COSCO Group, the operation risks mainly include  ship-leasing risk, FFA risk, ethnic risk, benefit risk, etc.  Management risks. Under the circumstance that the market  is in downturn and economic benefits decrease, risks on  security and stability will be exaggerated due to various  factors such as tight capital and unstable hearts.  Risks  Since the second half of 2008, the global financial  and economic crisis caused by sub-prime mortgage  crisis had resulted in downturn of international  shipping market, bringing impacts to operation of  shipping enterprises including COSCO Group.  Profitability of enterprises was reduced and risks  were increased.  Countermeasure risks. Under current market situation,  countermeasure risks of two extremities may appear. One  
 12 is lucky and blindly optimistic attitudes. The changes of  basic situation of supplies and demands of the market in  short and medium-term are not seen clearly. It is imagined  that the market is in recession temporarily and will reach  the peak season soon. Even more, it is taken as a good  opportunity to buy-in at the low season. Another is lack  of confident, panic-stricken with nothing attempted or  accomplished.  Financial risks. If key mistakes made due to inability to  cope with market risks, operation risks and management  risks, the financial risks may appear. Besides, fluctuation of  international financial market, adjustment of exchange rate,  interest rate, stock price and oil price may increase financial  risks.    Analysis on primary countermeasures for sustainable development  Currently, the biggest challenge for COSCO Group is the sharp down of market and operation  situation of dry and bulk fleet, which is major profit-making business, and container fleet, the  focus of assets of COSCO Group. Therefore, COSCO Group puts forward ten opinions for  risk control and profit-making of dry and bulk cargo vessel fleet and container fleet  respectively, namely the double-ten opinions.  Comprehensive inspection shall be conducted on vessel leasing and FFA agreements to reduce  the law-breaching and operational risks to the minimum extents. For vessel chartering  agreements signed, inspection shall be conducted again to see are there any incompliance  behaviors and preventive measures shall be taken ahead of time. For the vessel renting  agreement signed, rates shall be adjusted at appropriate time according to the traditions of  shipping market, so as to share risks with ship-owners and try to reduce losses. For FFA  agreements which may bring losses, hedging and other measures shall be taken.  Investment and operation strategies shall be adjusted to increase operational benefits to the  maximum extents. Evaluation and implementation of strategic partnership agreements signed  in the primary stage should be accelerated to bring into full play the supporting functions of  strategic partners in difficult time. Responses shall be made to appeals of SASAC under the  State Council, cooperation between central enterprises in difficult time shall be enhanced, and  try to cope with the difficulties together. Efforts shall be made to stabilize the customer  sources and use joint forces of the entire fleet in negotiation of new agreements.  Under the circumstance that the income may drop sharply, it is the urgent task to enhance the  management, reduce expenditures and strictly control costs.  From short-term prospective COSCO Group  has taken  effective  measures to cope  with the  difficulties and  risks caused by  low valley of  international  shipping market,  and tried to  fulfill the targets  of seeking for  development,  controlling risks,  grasping the  opportunities and  competing for  benefits  Great attentions shall be paid to safety and stabilization work in difficult time. When the  market was in downturn and the operation meets difficulties, the difficulties of safety and  stabilization work will be increased. In this period, special attentions shall be paid to do a  better job in production safety and team stabilization.  The transformation from periodical development to sustainable development.  The transformation from combination of software and hardware with hardware as the  emphasis to the combination of software and hardware with software as the emphasis.  The transformation from possessing and controlling the resources to allocating social  resources.  From long-term prospective  COSCO Group  continues to  promote  following four  transformations.  The transformation from obtaining benefits mainly from production business to obtaining  benefits from both production business and capital operation.

It is hoped that various stakeholders will learn more about COSCO Group  through the press release for report and the communication conference, so that they will offer suggestions  for COSCO Groups further development.   COSCO Group believes that the sustainable development report is a true reflection of the enterprises  performance of the Global Compact and social responsibility during the process of production, operation,  management and decision-making, and is the result of the operation of sustainable development  management system and the reflection of actual performance. Enterprises, therefore, should prudently  release the report with a sense of responsibility for the society. The quality of the report determines the  reliability of the report, and is the key to the success of the report. Therefore the improvement of report  reliability is the eternal theme of improvement and innovation.

The COSCO Group studied the Guideline on Fulfilling Social Responsibility by Central Enterprise released  by the Sate-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), developed the  consciousness of corporate social responsibility, established and improved the sustainable management  system and set up a long-term mechanism of social responsibility and sustainable development. The Group  
 63 created a sustainable information platform by applying IT. Therefore the system has become more effective,  the staff has become more aware of the social responsibility and concrete actions have been taken to  achieve sustainable development. In addition, the Group analyzed the problems of the previous system. To  seek optimized solution and facilitate the management of the system and reporting, the Group set objectives  to improve the platform:   (1) establish an inclusive information system and develop clear workflow to achieve sustainable  development;  (2) establish an advanced information system of sustainable development, manage the workflow to improve  the management system, and monitor the system to strengthen the internal control;  (3) set phased objectives to follow up and examine the efforts of pursuing sustainable development;  (4) and compare with statistics of other enterprises in the same industry to guide the Group to make  strategies and guidelines for sustainable development.    On the basis of the extended and improved previous system, the new system has four new major functions:  separate management of objectives, engine of the workflow, sublicense of the system and multilingual  conversion. At the same time, some basic functions were added, such as information portal, customized  information service, inquiry management and indicator settlement. Safety test and stress test were made to  test the information platform.  The improved information platform has added new sources of indicator material, rationalized the reporting  process and introduced the objective-oriented management mechanism. As a result, the system of  sustainable development could be managed step by step according to plans and the indicator system  responsible for check-up of performance could be more rational.  The information platform will help to improve the management of core indicators of sustainable  development. The Group will have access to and manage the subsidiaries indicators related to sustainable  development through internet. Therefore, it can inquire, assess and analyze the overall operation of the  corporation from different aspects and levels. It can manage the process of making the sustainable  development report in a highly efficient and sound way. Practical technologies will be available for  presenting the whole society the corporate contributions to the UN Global Compact and social  responsibility in a timely and precise manner.

After 5 or 6 years successful internal  practice, the design of the system was expanded by taking into consideration the enterprises own  management system requirements, studying and comparing relevant characteristics of corporate social  responsibility management home and abroad, and referring to the third-party assessment and certification  of DNV, GRI and Global Compact. It can be said to have great commonality and market values.   The system can serve relevant enterprises and organizations performing the Global Compact and corporate  social responsibility. It is open and flexible enough to be applied by different enterprises in different  industries, therefore meets the urgent needs of relevant organizations of promoting corporate social  responsibility and enhancing the management of sustainable development. It can not only serve large  conglomerates well, but also provide helpful guidance for the construction of social responsibility  management system in small and medium-sized enterprises. It plays a prominent role of guidance and  support particularly in the steel, energy, logistics, and other labor-intensive industries. Therefore COSCO  Groups sustainable development information platform was recommended by the international organization  for standardization ISO as an accessory for ISO26000 (standards for social responsibility).  COSCO Network (Beijing) Company, as a R&D institute for COSCO Groups sustainable development  information management platform, signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Global Compact Chinese  Network Center Office. The Chinese Network Center, as a sustainable development research organization  authorized by the United Nations Global Compact Office, actively promoted sustainable development  activities focusing on corporate social responsibility, environmental protection and clean production.  COSCO Network (Beijing) Company, as a subordinate body of COSCO Group, made use of its powerful  technological advantages to promote sustainable development activities and to meet market needs. The  company independently developed the sustainable development information management system in order  to comprehensively promote and coordinate sustainable development, establish win-win cooperation  relations, join hands with other companies to fulfill social responsibilities, establish a resource-conserving  society, and make active contribution to the realization of corporate sustainable development.

 86 2. Operational costs  Effective cost control is the basic element for success. Shipping industry has obvious market periodicity  and the market is in depression at present, the meaning of cost reduction is far more important, closely  related to existence and sustainable development of enterprises.   COSCO Group has attached great importance to cost control. In 2008, it continued to promote the Lean  Management campaign focusing on cost reduction within the whole group, and enhanced the controlling  strengths on key cost points and administrative expenditure in business. Measures taken by shipping,  logistics, shipbuilding and ship-repairing enterprises are as follows: Firstly, establish cost control  mechanism, decompose cost indicators, detail control measures, improve cost evaluation system and  control operation costs; Secondly, enhance education on sense of cost and elevate the cost-saving  consciousness of employees; Thirdly, carry out many forms of activities and mobilize the cost control  initiative of employees; Fourthly, explore the potentials and manage the key costs; Fifthly, solve the  cost-saving difficulties by using tools such as lean management and QC team, and try to reduce costs.   (1) Lean management and lubrication saving. The Moon Bay from COSCO Guangzhou, through lean  management, has implemented three-step lubrication saving process in the energy-saving and  emission-reduction activity. Firstly, it was to strengthen its equipment maintenance so as to avoid the  running, dripping and draining phenomenon of fuel; secondly, it was to take collection measure on the  temporary dripping, leaking phenomenon which could not be resolved currently due to the lack of  equipment, or to recycle and reuse the equipment; thirdly, it was to change the former regular oil replacing  method, guiding ship lubrication use in accordance with lubrication experience report. In adoption of new  lubrication saving process, The Moon Bay has reduced 4.5 tons lubrication per year, saved lubrication  cost 70,800 yuan.   (2) Speed reduction navigation, fuel consumption reduction. Under the circumstances of ensuring operation  security and precise arrival of passengers and cargo, Shanghai International Ferry Co., Ltds The  Suzhouis adopted economic speed route navigation on its round back from Osaka Japan to Shanghai so as  to reduce the fuel consumption. With the implementation of speed reduction navigation, The Suzhou  reduced 2-3 tons fuel each voyage, which was approximately 100, 000 yuan in fuel consumption at the  current fuel price.  (3) Lightweight, feul cost reduction. The Lianyou 7 from China Marine Bunker (PetroChina) Co., Ltd  Dalian Branch is a second-hand purchased from Japan in the late 1980s, light fuel was in adoption. In  2008,through site visit and technical analysis, the companys fuel technicians and The Lianyou  7management staffs made corresponding modification on fuel pipelines and heating equipment and  achieved the lightweight of fuel through crews scientific operation. Annual fuel cost reduced 190, 000  yuan.   (4) Recommended route, fuel cost in control. VLCC fleet was the main fleet served COSCO Dalian Branch.  While at the meantime, it was with the largest fuel consumption. Through the recommended route ruled by  VLCC, navigation mileage reduction, fuel consumption control, energy-saving, emission reduction, cost  reduction and efficiency enhancement have been achieved. During 2008, the companys 12 VLCC saved  ship schedule for 19 days, reduced fuel savings for 1600 tons, achieved fuel reduction for 1600 tons, cost  savings and efficiency enhancement reached a total of 15.38 million yuan.   (5) Weld increase, steel utilization rate improvement. Steel utilization was one of the major costs of  shipbuilding enterprises thus the increase of steel utilization rate and the reduction of steel utilization  became the most direct and effective measures. The Biotechnology Nesting Hull QC Group of COSCO  Shipbuilding Technology Division Department, through comprehensive consideration and analysis,  adopted weld increase and original shape changing method thus largely increased the steel utilization rate  for 17.5% while reduced steel utilization for 117 tons. Shipbuilding cost has been effectively reduced.  (6) The launch of QC activity, ship communication cost reduction. For the development of ship-shore  communication technology and communication technology, COSCO Xiamen Branch achieved a monthly  reduction of 4361 yuan for each vessel through the launch of QC group activity.   (7) Management strengthening, fuel losses reduction. COSCO Hong Kong especially emphasized on fuel  and lubrication reduction. It has adopted following measures: made rational route design on the premise of  safety; kept the host running at economic speed; while under the promise of safety, reduced the use of  
 87 sub-machine in accordance with loading situation; properly used and managed lubrication, kept the  tightness of lubrication system so as to avoid pollution and deterioration; put an end to the fuel  consumption that caused by the running, dripping and leaking of fuel. COSCO Hong Kong was to  effectively reduce fuel consumption and operation cost by implementation of appropriate measures.   (8) The importance of accumulation. Paying special attention to the details, COSCO Xiamen Branch put an  end to waste and made effort to improve the utilization of blank document. Through the collection of blank  document and remaining documents of high-speed printer, in adoption of stylus printer, those blank  documents would be used for printing single-vote ticket, the less regional ship ticket and temporary  document that submitted to the Customs. This method not only improved the utilization rate of each  document, but also shortened the queue line on high-speed printers and the operation time during peak  time.    (9) Attention to detail, photocopying cost reduction. From 2008, COSCO Hong Kong began to use Konica  Minolta Copier (multifunctional printer). It would be charged by the photocopying or printing number that  showed on the meter. According to the service contract between the company and supplier, the price of the  colorful was 15 times of that of the black and white. Under normal circumstances, as long as there was one  character of colorful in email or text file, the whole would be charged at the colorful price. Through  controlling the number of photocopies, while setting the computers photocopy mode as gray-scale printing  and controlling color printing, the company has made 50% decrease in color photocopying charge and 17%  in black and white photocopying.   (10) Fine management, cost reduction. COSCO Shipbuilding has continuously constructed 10000 TEU  container ships since 2008. Through improving installation process and residential wiring method, each  vessel has been reduced by 2000 working hours, annual cost reduced by 540, 000 yuan; through the  production of adsorption magnet, the position problem of small-bore tube has been resolved, and thus the  annual cost has been reduced by 90, 000 yuan.   3. Salaries and welfares of employees  All companies of COSCO Group have established different forms of salary and welfare systems in  accordance with the national laws, regulations and related polices and in combination with practices of the  industry and enterprises, protecting basic rights and interests of employees.   While gaining economic growth, all units of COSCO Group have increased the salaries and welfares of  employees stably, improving employees recognition on the enterprise and enhancing the cohesion.   COSCO Group bought various social insurances for its employees in accordance with the laws, covering  items such as endowment, medical, work injury, maternity, employment issuances and housing funds,  ensuring legal rights and interests of employees.  In 2008, basic endowment insurance fees paid for COSCO Groups employees reached RMB 94.3254  million, up 16% year-on-year. Among the basic endowment insurance fees paid in 2008, 20% were paid by  COSCO Group, while 8% were paid by employees.   So far, all companies affiliated to COSCO Group had attended the basic endowment insurance plan  according to the regulations.   Besides aforesaid social insurances, COSCO Group also established supplementary medical insurance and  work injury insurance for all its employees, and continued to promote enterprise annuity work. So far, the  detailed implementation plans for annuity had been approved by the State-owned Assets Supervision and  Administration Commission and was reported to the Department of Human Resources and Social Security  to keep a record. Currently, the plan was in implementation stage.   4. Payment to capital providers   In 2008, profits   generated by China COSCO ranked top among the central enterprises which under the  jurisdiction of the Sate Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. After being awarded the  A-class evaluation by the SASAC in its three-year term in 2007, in 2008, China COSCO once again  became the A-class enterprise awarded by SASAC, which is the five consecutive A-class rating of China  COSCO.   Since 2004, COSCO Groups profits had exceeded 10 billion yuan for five years in a row. In 2008, the  
 88 shipping industry encountered global financial crisis and shipping market was in sharp downturn in second  half of 2008.

(II) Financial inputs for climate changes  The global environment issue caused by climate changes has gradually raised concerns of all circles of the  world and directly affected the risk and financial inputs of COSCO Group. Its main influences are as  follows:   (1) Risks caused by climate changes  Climate changes affected the typhoon occurrence period, moving path and intensity changes, these, in  addition with increase of weathers with poor visibility, threaten shipping safety of COSCO Group's ships in  
 95 various sea areas.  Increase of typhoons and bad weathers need more labors and materials from the bank to guide safe shipping  of vessels. In the meantime, as anti-typhoons and bad visibility affect the arrangements in and out the port,  increase shipping time of vessels and non-productive berthing time at port  The international community and port countries had formulated new conventions, rules and regulations to  tackle with the influences of climate changes, which bring new risks to COSCO Group.  (2) Financial influences of climate changes on COSCO Group  In order to prevent and fight against the possible damage caused by typhoons, COSCO Group input more  human resources and materials into the organization establishment, shore-based shifts, command and  coordination. Typhoons also led to the increase in the sailing time and distance as well as the delay in the  schedules. 99 tropical cyclones (including TD) have been generated in the worldwide scale in 2008. 490  ships of China COSCO have been affected, increased by 24% from 395 in 2007, loss of shipping schedule  amounted to 1310.4 hours; 61 ships of COSCO Dalian have been affected, loss of shipping schedule  amounted to 981.12 hours.  Restricted by poor visibility, many ports have taken entry and departure prohibition measures in order to  protect ship security during port time therefore the non-productive time of COSCO fleet in Hong Kong port  got increased.   To relieve common global environmental pressure, reduce emission and save energy, in advocacy of  Chinese governments call for energy-saving emission reduction, China COSCO increased material and  financial resources into energy-saving and emission reduction research and relevant equipment  improvement, so as to save energy and reduce emission; China COSCO also invested funds in operating  quality, environment and occupational health safety management network, laid security environment  network and occupational health security network; established effective training mechanism and launched  relevant knowledge popularization and operation skills training; enhanced employees environmental  awareness and management capabilities, thus additional cost has been increased.   From 2005 to the end of 2008, China COSCO has invested 56.28 million yuan using for improvement of  ship master cylinder oil supply system, installation of electronic control device cylinder petrol supply  system; invested 9.55 million yuan for installation of homogeneous fuel equipment; in addition, in order to  enhance fuel combustion efficiency and reduce emissions, China COSCO invested funds to purchase fuel  additives and grinding machine, oil heaters, navigation controller and improve hull drag reduction  technology, additional capital investment has been increased.   In order to deal with climate changes, the international community had revised the international  conventions, resulting in increase of management costs and equipment expenses of COSCO Group. In 2008,  COSCO Group adopted 107,592 tons of low-Sulphur fuel with the sulphur content of 1.5%m/m in a bid to  satisfy the requirements of MARPOL Appendix VI and reduce emission of ships, resulting in increase of  costs by RMB 11.82 million.  COSCO Group had responded to preventative measures taken by port countries and coastal countries to  deal with climate changes. For instance, COSCO Group had actively responded to the "Green Ship Flag"  advocated by California in US, requiring ships to reduce the speed in advance before sailing into or  departing from the ports. COSCO Group's ships sail into and depart from ports at a speed lower than 12  nautical miles per hour and use the light oil-based fuels with less sulfur content instead of heavy oil in a bid  to alleviate air pollution. As the price of the light oil is 1.8 times of that of heavy oil, COSCO Group  needed to pay more when buying light oil-based fuels for ships.  To meet the air emission standards of shipyard area and community, reduce emissions so as to reduce the  impact on local community, China COSCO Shipbuilding Industry invested funds in technology and  equipment update. Welding Machine Technology Improvement and Fan Technology Improvement of  COSCO Shanghai Shipyard, electricity system improvement project are the two examples among them.   (III) Fixed welfare plan  Retirement life guarantee is a main factor considered by all employees when selecting their jobs. Proper  arrangement of retirement pension can solve the worries of employees and is favorable for attracting and  
 96 keeping stable employees' team.  (1) COSCO Group has attached great importance to fixed welfare plan for employees and paid endowment  insurances for every employee according to policies of the State and local employees. COSCO Group  calculated the budget for endowment insurances by 20% of total salaries of employees and paid the  endowment insurances monthly to the social insurance institutes of the State.  (2) According to related policies of the State and local governments, employees can enjoy endowment  insurances and medical insurance treatments when they reach legal retirement age. COSCO Group  calculated and paid pensions for retired employees according to policies of the State and local governments,  and paid the pensions to retired employees in full amount on time, ensuring the legal rights and interests of  retired employees.  At the end of 2008, total number of retired employees of COSCO Group reached 26,356 (please refer to  table below).  COSCO Group has set up a special institute, dispatched special personnel and allocated special expenditure  to provide services for retired employees, ensuring that all retired employees can enjoy pensions when they  are old and can have medical treatment when they are ill.  COSCO Group offered related treatment to retired employees according to the State's policies on  retirement.  On important holidays, holiday subsidy to retired employees will be issued, allowing them to enjoy the  humanistic cares of COSCO Group.

The two projects were given financial support of 8  million yuan and 7.7 million yuan respectively.   (V) Minimum salary and comparison with the standards  COSCO Group strictly implemented the salary system of the State and local governments to ensure that  salaries of employees are higher than the minimum salary level released by the Government. Minimum  salaries of shore-based employees of all companies of COSCO Group are higher than the minimum salary  levels regulated by local governments.  In March 2007, COSCO Group adjusted the salaries of crews based on the principles of internationalization,  marketization, transparency and simplification, greatly improving the salaries and treatments of crews.  Under the circumstances that shipping market has seriously affected by the financial crisis in the second  half of 2008, China COSCO maintained and even increased the crews wages regardless the deterioration  of shipping market.         
 97 (VI) Procurement and supplier  1. COSCO Group has been insisting on establishing mutual-beneficiary relationships with suppliers. By  establishing the mutual-beneficiary relationships with suppliers, it has enhanced the value creation ability  of all companies and reduced operational risk. COSCO Group evaluated key suppliers each year to select  qualified suppliers based on comprehensive evaluation in terms of quality guarantee, service, price and  reputation. Shipping, logistics, ship-building/ship-repairing companies had established supplier control  procedures in the management system documents, evaluated and selected suppliers from qualified suppliers  of COSCO Group headquarters and keep the group well informed of performances of suppliers. The  evaluation, selection and management of suppliers bring positive influences in ensuring the quality,  controlling the prices and optimizing the services. These also allowed COSCO Group to establish  mutual-beneficiary supplying relationships with suppliers, so as to effectively reduce the costs and  operational risks.  2. COSCO Group adopted centralized procurement system on ship fuels. In 2008, the centralized  procurement volume of fuels reached 3.89 million tons, the total fuel costs reached 2.01 billion dollars, and  the average unit price reached USD 518.19 dollars per ton.

(VII) COSCO Group's procedures of employing local employees in important operation regions and  the proportion of local senior executives  The recruitment of local residents as members of its top management and accommodation of local people  can increase human capitals of COSCO Group, bring economic benefits to local society and improve the  group's ability to understand local demands.  COSCO Group implements the jurisdictional management mode for its overseas companies, and employs  local people according to laws and regulations of the places where overseas companies are located. Except  for a few of top executives dispatched by COSCO, most members of intermediate and top management  teams are employed locally. In 2008, China COSCO has employed 4188 foreign employees, accounting  for6.19% of the total.

 104 II. Performance indicators  1. Raw materials   In order to protect the global resources, COSCO Group has actively reduced the consumption of raw  materials and implemented lean management to maximize the utilization of materials and save resources.  (1) Indirect material usage mainly   due to nature of the business we have engaged, the raw material consumption of COSCO Group is  centralized on ship-building and ship-repairing industries. In 2008, total consumption volume of raw  materials of COSCO Group reached 559,538 tons.  China COSCO has taken measures to promote raw materials conservation: firstly, shipbuilding enterprises  strictly followed design specifications, production order, construction techniques and other technical  standards as well as material consumption calculation system in order to reduce losses and waste, improve  raw material utilization. Shipbuilding steel utilization rate remained 92% in 2008; secondly, extended the  liner material and banding material service period, reduced the use of wood and raised substitution rate;  thirdly, set standard for ship spare parts consumption, made regular assessment and linked the assessment  results with performance so as to achieve the purpose of raw materials saving.   In order to enhance hull steel utilization, when in construction of its 20,000 tons lifting force floating dock,  in comparison of the hull steel utilization of the previous constructed 120, 000 tons lifting force floating  dock, in order to reduce losses and waste, COSCO Shipyard Dalian adhered to the goal of optimize design  qualify, rationally using materials; using raw materials to the maximum scale, reducing waste so as to  improve steel utilization of its 20, 000 tons lifting force floating dock. Through finding the reasons for the  impact on steel utilization, COSCO Shipyard Dalian has focused on the too many detailed design versions  and the unreasonable design. Under the promise of reasonable design, COSCO Shipyard Dalian made  precise layout for panel, reasonably adopted panel, ordered panels in accordance with the location of panel  gap, panel sickness and structural characteristics. Under the circumstances of insufficient panel utilization,  human labor and machine operation was combined. Finally the steal utilization of the 20, 000 tons lifting  force floating dock has been increased by 1% from the previous one, met the requirements.   The table below shows COSCO Groups raw material consumption in the past six years:  (2) Green passport. The world shipbuilding industry is accelerating its ship product structure adjustment  and optimization so as to promote the entire life-cycle green environmental protection from the  construction, operation to dismantling. China COSCO is actively in pursuit of the latest movement and  development of the world shipbuilding industry, devoting to the standards and requirements of green  passport, linear optimization of ship construction, selection of propulsion, power management, conversion  from heavy oil to light oil, host burning efficiency improvement, energy substitution, energy-saving  concern in gas recycling and reusing and the promotion of new energy-saving emission reduction measure.   (3) Spare parts and materials renovation and reusing. Under the premise of ship operation security and  spare parts quality, it was required to renovate the used spare parts and damaged parts as far as possible.  Employees of COSCO Shipyard Lianyungang have all been devoting to the renovation work in accordance  with specific business characteristics. Because of the exceeding number of steel scrap production, COSCO  Shipyard Lianyungang has strengthened its internal management, particularly made comprehensive  inspection and registration to steel scrap. It also inspired and encouraged its employees to make span, tool  cabinet, hanging ears, guard-rails with steel scrap, which greatly developed the utilization of scrap  materials. This work has saved over 600 tons of steel in 2008. In order to enhance supercharger bearing and  oil pump refurbished item utilization, according to the statistics, COSCO Shanghai has ordered 78 sets of  Indicator/Year  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  Used steel in ship-repairing steel  structure engineering (ton)  57,458 75,639.06 100,926 163,496 192,698  303,238 Applied steel in ship-building  (ton)  85,771 86,331.3 101,395.5 179,800 151,728  256,300 Utilization of steel in  ship-building  92% 92% 92% 92% 92%  92% 
 105 host supercharger bearings (including 22 sets of refurbished items) and 53 sets of oil pump (including 22  sets of refurbished items), utilization rate of refurbished items respectively reached 28.2% and 29.3%. In  order to conserve resources and improve the utilization of spare parts, in accordance with the ships actual  situation, the seniors of the company have improved spare parts utilization through management tools, as  well as set the goal of achieving the utilization rate to at least 60% of refurbished supercharger bearing and  oil pump items. The company has analyzed the reasons for low utilization of spare parts from the aspects of  staff, management, materials and environment while formulated improvement measures for the main  reason. After the implementation of corresponding improvement measures, utilization rate of bearing and  oil pump respectively reached 77.27% and 80.95% in 2008, which has respectively increased by 49.07%  and 51.65% over 2007, far exceeded the previous goal of 60.0%.  (4) Reducing burden of office environment.COSCO Group has been adhering to the office modernization  process and used digital management platform for files and information delivery to fulfill paper-free office  work and reduce paper consumption to the maximum extent. In 2008, the paper saving rate of COSCO  Group reached 20%, an increase of 3.2% year-on-year.   2. Energy   COSCO Group actively carried out and implemented the Energy Conservation Laws of the Peoples  Republic of China, the Decision on Enhancing Energy Conservation Work of the State Council, the  Detailed Rules for Traffic Industry to Implement Energy conservation Laws, the Notice on Implementation  Plans and Methods on Statistics, Supervision and Evaluation on Energy Conservation and Emission  Reduction approved and circulated by the State Council, the Notice on Environmental Protection of the  State during 11th Five-year Period issued and printed by the State Council, the Working Opinions on  Enhancing Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction of Central Enterprises and the Notice on Energy  Conservation and Emission Reduction Management Objectives of Central Enterprises during the Tenure  issued by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Management Commission, and fulfilled the concretion  and feasibility of energy conservation and emission reduction work. In the second half of 2008, COSCO  Group continued the investigation projects on energy conservation and emission reduction to carry out  comprehensive investigation on energy consumption, equipment and environmental pollution risks of  enterprises. Guided by the lean management ideology, COSCO Group determined the key industries  (shipping, ship-building/ship-repairing and logistics), key ships (container ship, asphalt carrier, bulk  chemical carrier and LPG ship), key equipment (ship main engine, ship auxiliary engine and boiler) and  key enterprises (shipping companies whose energy consumption accounts for more than 98% of the total  energy consumption of the group) for its energy conservation and emission reduction work. The container  ship of COSCO Container Lines whose energy consumption accounts for 65% of the total energy  consumption of COSCO Group was selected as the most important part for its energy conservation and  emission reduction work.   Total energy consumption:  Indicator/Year  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  Total energy  consumption   (ton of SCE)  3,191,337.75  3,508,609.53 5,195,554.66 5,966,153.84 6,349,471.01  8,570,109 Remarks: including fuel and electricity consumption, and excluding gas and other energy consumption.                             
 106 (1) In advocacy of energy-saving and emission reduction. In order to  practice COSCOs social commitment in Global Compact, and  enhance social responsibility and implement enterprise sustainable  development, China COSCO has devoted itself in becoming an  environmental-friendly enterprises focusing on environmental protection,  ocean-protection and resource-saving. In 2008, China COSCO initiated  its energy-saving advocacy to all units and members to start full  participation in fuel consumption reduction, emission reduction and  responsibility implementation.   (2) Energy Saving. COSCO Group closely focused on international ship energy-saving and  environmental-protection technology development trend with human resource, materials and financial  support, COSCO Group digested and absorbed international leading management methods and  energy-saving and environmental-protection technology; promoted advanced and mature energy-saving and  environmental-protection technology; meanwhile, the Group continuously developed energy-saving and  environmental-protection application technology for its system with energy-saving techniques and  energy-saving management as the methods, the group implemented various energy conservations. In 2008,  COSCO Group owned and controlled over 800 vessels, fuel and oil annual consumption respectively  reached 4.62 million tons and 44,600 tons. Total energy savings reached 6.6365 million tons of standard  coals in 2008.   Energy consumptions of COSCO Group in recent few years:                  Fuel consumption indicators of main fleets of COSCO Group in recent few years   (unit: kg/kilotonsea mile)                Energy-saving required full participation and consensus   Through various forms of promotion of the importance and significance of energy-saving, China COSOC  has greatly strengthened the energy-saving awareness of all its employees thus the whole industry ranked  into the line of energy-saving.  Jinsha Water Gas Station of China Marine Bunker Supply (Guangzhou) Co. was founded in May 2008.The  station was rum by power generator and waster transport. In advocacy of COSCOs energy-saving proposal,  staffs suggested to solve and water power and transport problem of the water gas station so as to reduce  fuel consumption. Staffs of the water gas station proposed corresponding measures regarding high  installation costs and high technical difficulty and completed shore and offshore water and power  connection by November. Thereby annual operation cost was reduced by 380,000 yuan hence high  reduction of fuel consumption.  Energy-conservation by technologies   In accordance with international and national energy-saving and emission-reduction technology  development, COSCO Group absorbed leading energy-saving and environmental-protection technology  and actively put it into implementation.     
 107 Ship host cylinder supply system reconstruction. From 2005 to the end of 2008, COSCO Group invested  56.28 million yuan installing 24 ships new Electronic Control oil cylinder petrol supply system and  gained good energy-saving results in return. Take Tianfuhai of COSCO Bulk for example, it saved 130  liters of oil each day, annual savings reached about 40,000 liters.   Ship installed homogenous fuel device. From 2005 to the end of 2008, COSCO Group invested 9.5 million  yuan installing fuel devices on 21 ships. As a result, diesel oil separation amount has been significantly  reduced, particle size has been reduced, combustion performance and thermal efficiency has been improved  thus the status of the host machine was greatly improved.   Installation of diversion hood and propeller cutting edge. COSCO Group has installed 32 ships of the Les  and the Shans diversion hoods so as to reduce flow resistance while sailing. In addition, COSCO Group  has made propeller cutting edge processing to Development Roadand other 8 ships, resulting in the  change of fuel combustion status of host machine hence the improvement of thermal efficiency.   Installation of Propeller Boss Cap Fins (OBCF). Through inspection and research, and taking the  opportunities of ship repairing, the installation work of propeller boss cap fins of The Tianronghai and  The Tianshunhai has been finished and put into operation. Judging from the voyage completion of the  ship, under the circumstances that average speed has been increased, fuel consumption has been  significantly decreased.   New technology application: electronic timing control and swirl spray cylinder oil. Chin COSCO set  electronic timing control and swirl spray cylinder oil as its projects in 2003. By 2005, COSCO Group  launched the promotion of the projects. The use of electronic timing control and swirl spray cylinder oil has  met the fuel saving requirement, improved the working conditions of diesel engine cylinder, enhanced the  reliability of marine diesel host machine and reduced waste oil emission by at least 30%. Statistics showed  that fuel-saving rate reached between 20% and 40%. Single ship annual fuel savings reached 40 to 180 tons,  annual cost saving between 50,000 to over 200,000 dollar. By 2008, 45 ships of COSCO Group had been  installed electronic timing control and swirl spray cylinder oil, the use of cylinder oil had been reduced.   COSCO Shipyard Shanghai, a subsidiary of COSCO Shipyard, launched its electric welding technology  improvement and fan technology improvement projects, which saved 1300 tons of standard coal energy  annually.   COSCO Shipyard Dalian actively promoted electric power system reform project. The implementation of  the project was expected to replace the oil use of 80% of mobile power generator sets and 40% mobile air  compressor with 25 million degree of electricity utility. The replacement was expected to save various fees  of28.74 million yuan. For example, in 2008, 4012 tons of standard coal had been reduced as annual energy  consumption, thus COSCO Shipyard Dalian overall energy consumption reduced by 9.35% per 10,000  yuan output value, COSCO Shipyard energy consumption reduced by 2.64% per 10,000 yuan output value.  Annual emission exhaust gas has been reduced by 58.34 million cubic meters; carbon dioxide has been  reduced by 155.10 tons, sulfur dioxide has been reduced by 194 tons, dust and smoke has been reduced by  5.8 tons.   Optimized transformation of ship host machine supercharger at  low speed. Based on business needs, COSCO has adjusted its  3800 TEU ships originally sailed in China-US route to domestic  trading route. Taking into account the fuel saving factors, most of  the time, domestic trading route is running at lower speed. But in  the long run at a relatively low speed, diesel engine is with high  heat load and thus cylinder spare parts are easily to get damaged.  In order to keep reliability and economics of diesel engine at  relatively low speed, COSCO conducted to do pilot study.   In adoption of ship-to-shore gap to adjust the nozzle ring specification so as to increase turbine efficiency;  adjust diffuser specifications so as to increase compressor efficiency. After the modification, ship fuel  consumption reached 55 tons per days, reduced by nearly 20 tons. Thus in 2008, fuel savings for one ship  reached 2300 tons. COSCO would further carry out the promotion of such projects in the future.    (supercharger parts replacement scenery)      
 108 Energy-conservation management   COSCO Group has always been adhered to reducing cost and increasing efficiency, making every effort to  reduce energy consumption. COSCO Group has established its Energy-saving and Emission-reduction  Leading Group. Staffs including Wei Jiafu as the director, vice-president Zhang Liang as the vice-director,  COSCO Group general managers and other general managers from subsidiary companies. COSCO  Energy-saving and Emission-reduction Leading Group has overall responsibility for the leadership work of  energy-saving and emission-reduction. COSCO Group has set up its Energy-saving and Emission-reduction  Officer, in charge of supervising the launch and target setting of energy-saving and emission-reduction  work of all COSCO member units. COSCO subsidiary units have also established their own Energy-saving  and Emission-reduction Work Group. Main charge person of subsidiary companies have been appointed as  directors, vice presidents in charge of production safety have been appointed as vice director. In accordance  with shipping management and land industry characteristics, COSCO Group has established its  Environmental-protection and Energy-saving Department, Energy-saving Office and other relevant  agencies in charge of relevant works to implement responsibility system and set cross-department  communication system.   Ship fuel consumption is the main energy consumption of COSCO Group hence the continuous insistence  in process management of ship fuel consumption, timely statistics of fuel consumption and ship fuel  consumption reduction guidance. Clarified charge person for oil saving and lined fuel consumption into  performance indicator. Set more comprehensive management measures and developed ship fuel  consumption information management platform. Through analysis of fuel consumption during ship  operation process via information system, tracked and compared the fuel and lubricating oil consumption  among various ships, scientifically and reasonably set ship fuel and lubrication consumption standard,  which effectively made ship fuel consumption under control. Through various management ways and  methods such as source control, refining indicator, strengthening maintenance, dynamic tracking, process  supervision and focus concentration, took all aspects of fuel use in control and played an significant effect  on energy management.   COSCO Guangzhou has set scientific management scheduling as another focal point of fuel saving.  Operation staffs are required to have a good understanding of ship performance and fuel consumption  situation. According to practical needs of operation, in scheduling aspect, it was to strengthen  communication between ocean services, machine maintenance and ship captain while took advantage of  wind and flow favorable weather conditions, optimized routes and paid attention to the use of ships  maximum speed, service speed and economic speed , offered instruction and guidance on the use of  economic speed. Gave guidance on ships reasonable load, ensured appropriate draft of ships thus the  longitudinal leans coefficient is in favor of the speed of ships so as to achieve fuel and oil reduction which  has obtained good results in return.   Energy-saving through management methods. Started from ship speed slowing down in 2008, through  strengthening lean management and setting energy-saving goals, COSCO proposed its requirements of  Ship speed reduces by 10%, annual energy-savings reached 350, 000 tons. COSCO has researched and  drawn up COSCO Container Company Energy-saving and Emission-reduction Implementation Proposal,  covered target responsibility, supervision statistics, assessment indicators and responsibilities division. The  proposal made energy-saving and emission-reduction work more feasible. Included energy-saving and  emission-reduction work into responsibility and target management, in order to meet the annual  requirement of 350, 000 tons fuel reduction, COSCO has set fuel consumption for every single week and  set specific fuel saving amount for particular department. Also, corresponding staffs were appointed to  supervise fuel consumption and guide ship speed slowing down measures. As to ship operation  management, COSCO has specially planned speed slowing down product and implemented it step by step,  which has further reduced the original planned 3.216 million tons fuel consumption to the current 2.688  tons, with a total amount of 468, 000 tons in fuel savings, overfulfilled the 350,000 tons of fuel saving  target set before this year.   Multiple methods for fuel and lubrication saving. COSCO Hong Kong focused on fuel and lubrication  savings. Under the premise of security, reasonable route design helped reduce fuel consumption and  maintain host machine to run at economic speed hence saving fuel and lubrication and reducing operation  cost. It was required by the company that all types of pipelines and pipeline joints should be checked  frequently, repairing action should be taken immediately once oil spill phenomenon existed. In accordance  
 109 with load condition, under the circumstance that security has been affected, the use of vice machine should  be reduced so as to avoid unnecessary energy waste. To reduce lubrication consumption under the premise  of safe operation of host and vice machines, it was recommended to use and manage lubrication properly,  keep the tightness of lubrication system, avoid pollution and deterioration. It was required to operate  oil-division machine properly, frequently clean the filter, solve abnormalities once oil consumption is not  normal as usual. Oil running, dropping, dripping and leaking phenomenon would be solved immediately so  as to avoid oil waste.  Energy conservation in office  COSCO Group headquarters enhanced other energy conservation work while implementing the office  building air-conditioner temperature control measures continuously. It required its employees to turn off  computers, monitors, air conditions, printers, copiers and other equipment, cultivating good consciousness  of energy conservation.   In cooperation of the National Energy Saving Publicity Week from June 15 to June 21, COSFRE,  subsidiary of COSCON, launched a series of energy-saving and emission-reduction works, advocated its  staff to respond to the activity and contributed to green environmental-protection with their full  participations. The company initiated implementation of working in casual clothes from May to October  and adjusted the air-conditioning temperature to 25.5 degree so as to reduce air-conditioning power  consumption. Energy-saving reminder was posted at the switch of air-conditioner. At the mean time, the  company also encouraged its employees to explore their every-saving and emission-reduction potentials in  every work and welcomed them to propose corresponding ideas. For those employees who actively  participated in the activity, the company would give a timely praise. In addition to this, the company issued  articles to remind its employees saving awareness in power consumption, working equipment and vehicles  use. This was aiming at reminding its employees to reduce waste in work and foster saving awareness,  while formed a good atmosphere of resource saving, pollution avoidance and environmental protection.   Total electricity consumption of COSCO Group in 2003-2008:          Competing to become national model for energy-saving in transportation industry. In 2008, COSCO Group  continuously participated in the competition for national transportation industry energy-saving sample. Oil  Tanker Heating Automatic Monitoring Technology Application and Application of Yapu Gas in Ship  Building and Repairing Industry that researched and developed by COSCO Group was continuously  awarded the second batch of national water transportation industry energy-saving typical sample.   In 2008, in the National Transportation Systems My Contribution to Energy-saving and  Emission-reduction launched by China Seafarer Construction Union, and the follow-up activity Pioneer  Workers, COSCO Asia from COSCON and New Shenghai from COSCO Bulk were awarded  Pioneer Worker of National Transportation Construction System by Chinas Seamens Union.   3. Water resources  Water conservation of COSCO Group was comprised of ship water conservation and land water  conservation. In terms of ship water conservation, all ships of COSCO Group were equipped with seawater  desalination devices to de-salt the seawater with waste heat energies of main engines for daily water use of  crews and equipment cooling water of equipment, so as to reduce fresh water supply of ships and save fresh  water consumption. In terms of land water conservation, ship-building and ship-repairing enterprises set the  objectives of production water conservation, strictly prohibited leakage and conducted the work to protect  ocean environment to reduce the pollution on water resources.   Waste heating energy was adopted by ships in water re-production. Dapeng Bay from COSCO  Guangzhou is an asphalt ship weighing 5900 tonnage. Taking the advantage of route characteristics and the  50 days of waiting for discharge time in Luanda, Lobito Port, Dapeng Bay continuously increased fuel  consumption, using the heat of asphalt heating oil, host and sub machine fuel burning and division heat, it  has successfully produced 307 tons of fresh watch, saving land fresh water supplies. Lily Sea from  COSCO Bulk, through technology innovation and making full use of existing pile, in adoption certain pine  
 110 connection, collected and used condensed water from air-conditioner. Daily water production increased  from the previous 10.4 tons to the current 14.7 tons. Water production monthly increased 129 tons. Water  production capacity has been increased by nearly 50%.   Water consumption of COSCO Group from 2004 to 2008              Remarks: recycling seawater consumption used in cooling of ship power devices is not included in above table.     Reduction of water consumption compared with that of the previous year  Indicator/Year  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  Reduction of water consumption (ton)  50,737  45,415  52,669  58,134  120924    4. Bio-diversity   Paying attention to worldwide natural resources and ecological environment is the responsibility that all  multinational companies including COSCO Group should undertake.  (1) The use of non-toxic paint, marine life protection. COSCO Group started its silicone paint pilot  experience in 2005, tracking and researching the protection circumstances of different silicone paints to  marine life. COSCO Qingdao has conducted research on Intersleek 900 Energy-saving and  Environmental-protection paint which was awarded 2008 Yacht and Ship Environmental Technology  Award. Silicone paint was tested on Tianshun Sea during ship repairing period. Energy-saving and  Environmental-protection silicone paint Intersleek 900 was able to extend ship repairing cycle from 30  months to 60 months and therefore reduced the amount of silicone paint use and protected marine life.   (2) Ship ballast water management. COSCO Group strictly enforced conventions and relevant port  requirement worldwide. COSCO Group has developed Ship Ballast Water Management Plan which  clearly defined responsibilities. Ballast water replacement requirement was established while records and  monitor for the whole ballast process were recorded, so as to fully protect marine environment and keep  biological diversity development. Based on the research and development of COSCO Group Ship Ballast  Waster Physical Purification Treatment Technology, COSCO Group actively minimized the negative  impact of ship ballast water to marine biological diversity and promoted marine environment and marine  biological diversity protection.   COSCO Bulk Fast Sea was a steel structure Handymax bulk carrier built in 1984. Due to its old age, ship  structure was aging and pipeline leakage phenomena were frequently seen, ship ballast water residues  became more and more serious which brought big troubles to ballast water management. Corresponding  staff members were appointed to study ship ballast water residues reasons. Through targeted improvements  and maintenances, ballast water drainage time was significantly reduced and there was a significant drop in  water volume. Residual ballast water issue has been resolved and thus the ships ballast water management  requirements were met.   (3) COSCO Group Boao eco-garden construction. With the concept  of harmonious unity of nature, society and human, COSCO Group  adhered to regional ecological environmental protection, recycling  economy development, water pollution concentrated solution, air  pollution, forest coverage, waste pollution and other protection  measures to eco-areas. Environmental protection and biodiversity  conservation was taken into account of the architectural design,  environmental design, water use, original forestry conservation and  animal species protection of Boao eco-garden.( Boao eco-garden)       
 111 5. Exhaust gas, sewage and waste  With the expansion of production scale and increase of ship number, the total volume of exhaust gas,  sewage and waste of COSCO Group was increasing. However, the discharging volume of freight turnover  per unit was kept at a low level in 2008.   (1) Exhaust gas emission (direct emissions)   Total emissions  Statistics scope has been enlarged in 2008 which leads to great change of 2008 data compared with 2007  data:  A. CO2: According to IMO MEPC/29/18/DEC.1989 of IMO Marine Environment Union, one kilogram  fuel produces 3110 grams CO2.   B. NOx: According to Clean Cargo Working Group Environmental Performance Survey Appendix II, one  kilogram fuel of two-stroke diesel machine produces 87 grams NOx; one kilogram fuel of four-stroke  diesel machine produces 57 grams NOx  C. Sox: According to Clean Cargo Working Group Environmental Performance Survey Appendix II, under  the premise that sulfur content is 3%, on kilogram fuel produces 60 grams SOx  Emissions for unit turnover volume          (2) Use of low-sulfur fuel to reduce emissions of sulfur oxides. Ships of COSCO Group further enhanced  the convention compliance strengths. They increase use of low-sulfur fuels in specific sea area according to  the requirements of MARPOL Convention Appendix VI, to reduce the emissions. In 2008, they used  107,592 tons of low-sulfur fuels and increased 11.82 million yuan of fuel costs.   (3) Use of desulfurization and dedusting equipment. Starting from emission reduction, COSCO Qingdao  has invested 290, 000 yuan for the installation of desulfurization and dedusting equipment. This equipment  was to achieve full cleaning of gas through atomized alkali solution thus SO2 from the gas would be  absorbed by the alkali solution hence achieved the purpose of desulfurization. Desulfurization efficiency  would reach about 60%-70%.   (4) Replace acetylene gas with high efficiency and clean natural gas, reduce emission. COSCO Shipyard  Zhoushan actively promoted energy-saving and emission-reduction technology innovation, eliminated  outdated materials and processes, replaced the traditional acetylene products with high energy-consuming,  high pollution and big security risk with clean gas. According to statistics, the application of this scientific  and technological achievement has annually reduced 5.2 tons of hydrogen sulfide gas and 80.7 tons of  phosphine for COSCO Zhoushan, which contributed to the enterprises energy-saving and  emission-reduction in addition to profit earning.   (5) Pollution accidents prevention, drainage system function recovery. The original design of  CHIMBUSCO Lianyungang Kangyun Oil Tanker Area was with drainage system, rainwater will be  discharged directly into sea. In August 2008, the company carefully checked sewage and drainage facilities,  made on-site assessment of drainage system situation. The original valve had been remained closed for  many years so it might not be close tightly once opened. Once oil spill incident occurs, spill oil might be  discharged directly into the sea with rainwater which caused pollution incident. In accordance with actual  Indicator/Year  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  Carbon dioxide(ton)  6,852,708  7,408,051 11,071,600 12,688,800 13,716,510  16094701 Nitrogen oxides (ton)  192,318  207,903 301,176 345,168 373,131  325,483 Sulfur oxides (ton)  123,791  133,823 213,600 244,800 263,039  274,564 
 112 situation, the company drew the map of drainage system in the reservoir area, organized demolition and  maintenance work for all valves and cleaned up drainage lines and sewage pipelines so that the rainwater  could be discharged into the sea. This efficiently improved the pollution incident prevention level of the  depot.   (6) All ships of COSCO Group own the International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) Certificates. As  required by the international convention, all newly built ships of the group hold the Environmental  Protection Emission Certificate.  (7) The Green Flag program. The Green Flag program is an environmental protection program initiated  by the Port of Long Beach of the U.S., requiring all ships in and out the Long Beach Port to keep the  shipping speed under 12 knots within 35 sea miles to the pilot station to reduce the exhaust gas emissions  caused by fuel combustion. Since the implementation of the plan, all ships of COSCO Group had followed  the requirements of the port carefully when arriving at the Port of Long Beach Port and their shipping  speeds were strictly controlled with an achievement rate of 100%. The Long Beach Port gave high praise to  COSCO Group. On April 9, COSCO was appraised as one of 14 winners of environmental protection flags  in 2008 of the Port of Long Beach. It was the fourth time for COSCO Group to win such honor.

Inputs for reduction of exhaust gas emissions          (13) Ship decommissioning policies and ship decommission information of COSCO Group. In 2008,  COSCO Group continued to carry out the No. 8 Decree of the Ministry of Communications issued on July  5, 2006 to put the ships reaching the decommissioning age out of commission. In the meantime, ships not  reaching the decommissioning age, but were in a poor state and were considered as not suitable to ocean  shipping were also put out of commission. The decommissioned ships of COSCO Group were sold in two  ways, i.e. operational ships and waste steel ships, which were sold to shipping companies with operational  qualifications and to qualified ship scrapping companies respectively, so as to avoid the environmental  influences. For ships sold to qualified ship scrapping companies, COSCO Group required the scrapping  companies to made commitment on the contract in terms of qualifications, establishment and operation of  
 114 environment management systems and main purposes after scrapping, ensuring the scrapping of ships the  premise of environmental protection and thus reducing the impacts to the environment to minimum extents.   Statistics of decommissioned ships of COSCO Group in recent five years           (14) Enhance resource recycling and comprehensive utilization. COSCO Group has attached great  importance to resource recycling and comprehensive utilization. It encourages all production units to  enhance resource-saving and waste reutilization work. The ship-building and ship-repairing enterprises of  COSCO Group enhanced the comprehensive use of wastes based on features of enterprises, reduced the  wastes, and did a good wok in recycling and utilization of renewable energies. It takes renewable metals,  waste tyres and waste electronic products as the focuses for recycling and reutilization work and promoted  the recycling and reutilization work of renewable energies.   COSCO Xiamen implemented reorganization of fuel recycling and reutilization process based on  mechanism features of different ships. Two vessels can use mixed oil in standby engine after refitting.  Heavy oil and light oil are mixed at the proportion of 1:1. After the refitting, the ship greatly increases the  recycling of fuel leakage and improves the fuel recycling and reutilization rate.   6. Products and services  Over the years, COSCO Group has been actively fulfilling its behavior standards in environmental  protection, endeavoring to become a green service provider. In order to improve oil quality and the  burning efficiency thus reducing the environmental influences of emissions of ships propulsion, COSCO  Group actively used the additives that have combustion-support, stabilization and energy-conservation  functions on fuels. As ship is a major service tool for ocean shipping, COSCO Group has attached great  importance to the disposal procedures of ship after decommission. In the past, decommissioned ships were  disposed in form of sale and buyers often used the ships for transport of near-ocean shipping lines.  Logistics companies did better jobs in survey, investigation, design and preparation during transportation  processes and sought for best opportunities in terms of time, equipment and operation to reduce the  influence on neighboring residents as much as possible. In terms of ship-building and ship-repairing,  related companies actively controlled the environment-influencing factors such as emission, dust and noise,  building a harmonious production and living environment as well as a harmonious community  environment.  7. Regulations  COSCO Group Strictly enforced the Energy Conservation Law of the Peoples Republic of China, the  Maritime Environment Protection Law of the Peoples Republic of China, the China Ocean Law, the  Environment Protection Law of the Peoples Republic of China and relevant international conventions and  decrees on international environmental protection.

DNV Assurance Statement    COSCO Sustainability Report 2008      Page 1 of 2                                                                                                                       DNV Assurance Statements – 2009609012  Det Norske Veritas (DNV) has been commissioned by the  management of China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company  (COSCO) to carry out an assurance engagement on  COSCOs Sustainability Report 2008 (the Report ) in its  printed format.  This is the forth time COSCO has published its Annual  Sustainability Report and invited a third-party agency to  conduct an independent assurance.  Scope of Assurance  The Scope of DNVs assurance is to assess whether the  disclosed critical information, data and management  support systems are in compliance with the relevant  reporting principles and criteria of reliability.  Limitation of Assurance  DNVs assurance team visited the head office of COSCO in  Beijing, but did not visit any site office or external  stakeholders.  DNV selected three second-tier subsidiaries for on-site  assurance at their locations in China:    COSCO Container Lines Company Ltd. (Shanghai)    Qingdao Ocean Shipping Company Ltd. (Qingdao)    COSCO Logistics Co., Ltd. (Beijing)  Assurance Approach  The assurance engagement was conducted from November  2008 to July 2009 and performed in accordance with the  requirements of the DNV Assurance Protocol for  Sustainability Reporting. The Report has been evaluated  against the following criteria:  Adherence to the principles of stakeholder inclusiveness,  materiality,  responsiveness,  completeness,  reliability,  neutrality, comparability and accuracy as set out in the  "AA1000 Assurance Standards 2008 and The Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2006 Sustainability Reporting  Guidelines Version 3.0.    The DNV assurance team has undertaken the following  work to reach conclusions regarding the Report:    Information search in public media to identify concerns  of COSCO stakeholders    Evaluation and ranking of the material CSR risks of  COSCO, based on the DNV Assurance Protocol for  Sustainability Reporting    Interviews with COSCOs senior management team to  understand the top level commitment and strategic  approach to sustainability    Interviews  with  departmental  representatives  to  understand the management procedures and their status  of implementation    Examination and tracking of reported data and  information, including a site-visit, to verify the  methodology of data compilation and aggregation    Comparison of COSCOs CSR reporting data over  several years to understand the progress and trends in  corporate social responsibility performance  Conclusions  In our opinion, the Report provides a fair representation of  the level to which COSCOs sustainability policies have  been implemented throughout its business units. No  material or systematic errors were observed in the reporting.  Compared with last years report COSCO has included  more details in the explanations of their mission, vision and  values, and has included a systematic SWOT analysis of the  main impacts, risks, opportunities and solutions which have  formed the basis of the companys strategy map.  In the process of the assurance engagement, DNV also  identified some opportunities for improvement which have  been included in the DNV Assurance Report.  Stakeholder Inclusiveness  The Report illustrates COSCOs commitment to be  accountable to stakeholders and ensure that stakeholders  participate in the identification of relevant issues and  solutions.  The formal engagement mechanisms for interaction with  stakeholders and the selection criteria of responding  indicators could be further improved to coordinate and  balance the expectations of stakeholders.  Materiality  The  Report  discloses  the  companys  sustainability  performance indicators and information regarding the main  stakeholders affected.  DNV recommends that further improvements focus on  developing policy and judgment criteria of material issues  based on industry best practices, and quantification of  material indicators.    
DNV Assurance Statement    COSCO Sustainability Report 2008      Page 2 of 2                                                                                                                       DNV Assurance Statements – 2009609012  Responsiveness  The Report illustrates COSCOs mission, strategy and  performance  indicators,  providing  objective  data  corresponding to the major concerns of the main  stakeholders.  To further improve the clarity of their communication to  stakeholders in the future, COSCO is recommended to  include information about their concrete commitments and  an action plan which reflects stakeholders concerns.   Completeness  The Report disclosed the key issues and performance  information of the 2008 reporting period which covered  COSCO head-office and all subsidiaries.  Regarding areas of improvement, it is recommended that  the Report increase the focus on social indicators (e.g.  related to labor relations such as statistics and analysis of  the rate of work-related injuries and loss of working time)  and environmental indicators (such as waste management  generated from ships).  Reliability  COSCO has established a dedicated Corporate Social  Responsibility management office and processes to collect,  compile and analyze data and information. These  procedures are found to be effective.  Accuracy  DNV has not found any material inaccuracies in the  reported data that may significantly affect the comparability  of selected key performance indicators. However, it is noted  that for the future the reporting boundaries and definition  for some performance indicators should be more clearly  defined.                        Neutrality  The DNV assurance team concluded that the information  contained in the report is unbiased and reflect a balanced  view  of  COSCOs  corporate  social  responsibility  performance.  Comparability  The information in the Report is presented in a format that  allows users to see positive and negative trends in  performance on a year-to-year basis. The company could  further improve comparability by reinforcing horizontal  comparisons with the industry.  DNV is confident that COSCO will improve their corporate  social responsibility management systems and the quality of  the report on a continuous basis.  DNVs Independence  The independence of DNVs assurance engagement team is  ensured by internal control procedures and the following  principles:    The total independence of assurance staff during  working period.    Keeping confidentiality of all the sensitive information  of COSCO;    No conflicts of interests between Assurance staff and  COSCO.   DNV expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility for  any decision a person or entity would make based on this  Assurance Statement.
