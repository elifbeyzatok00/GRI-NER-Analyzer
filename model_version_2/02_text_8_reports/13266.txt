Assessment and Prospects 2008-2012 M A I N  PA R T N E R Towards Sustainable Development  Report boundary   The Solvay group has 178 production sites, including 58 for the joint ventures PipeLife (plastics pipes and fittings) and Inergy Automotive Systems (vehicle fuel systems) joint ventures, in a total of 37countries (2007 figures).  This report includes companies of which the Solvay Group owns at least 50%. The quantitative data relate to activities managed by the Group.  The quantitative data for environmental parameters relate to the 112 production sites, including those operated by the joint ventures, where production involves significant releases into the environment (thus excluding PipeLife activities). The internal reporting and consolidation system for environmental data has been verified when it has been set up.   The quantitative data relating to safety refer to all the operations for which Solvay is in charge of technical management, amounting to 154 sites.   Human resources management and policies in this field relate to all of the management units including (except in respect of staff training policies) the joint ventures where Solvay has a majority shareholding. Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) The consistency with GRI (**) of the sustainable development themes dealt with in this report are based on the identification of the materiality of the major issues specifically relating to our three activity sectors:  Pharmaceuticals, Chemicals, Plastics.  Other reports The previous Towards Sustainable Development report was published in 2004. The next will be published early in 2012.  Annually updated versions of the quantitative data can be found on the website www.solvaysustainable.com, which also includes other environmental data supplementing the information appearing in this paper report.

The prototype is now under construction.  Since the Group was established, many initiatives have shown a commitment to innovation and calculated risk-taking helping to create conditions for a more sustainable future : from the creation of scientific institutes, through support over more than a century of scientific expeditions – whether to the South Pole or the contribution of the SolVin Bretzel to investigations of biodiversity – to current involvement in the Solar Impulse project.  Solvay is, in fact, the first main partner and a technological partner associated with the Solar Impulse project. The venture was started by Bertrand Piccard, and is a perfect symbol of the major efforts and technological and mental leaps needed to enter new territories implied by sustainable development: excellence, an  entrepreneurial mindset, control over energy, and innovative materials.  For the Solvay group, this project embodies fundamental values:  Conceptual values of openness to world issues, encouraging dialogue and reflecting the Groups cul- ture and willingness to engage in collaborative efforts.   Ethical values including a sensitivity to ecological challenges,  with positive and practical awareness of sustainable development, leading the search for alternatives to non-renewable resources, particularly of energy, an issue facing all technology-based firms.  Business-oriented values, allowing sustainable growth to be achieved through innovation, and promoting a positive and credible image for the Group and its entrepreneurial spirit.  SOLARIMPULSE  Publication of this third Solvay Group Towards Sustainable Development report, providing an assessment of the current situation and of prospects, coincides with a time of change, for both the world around us and for the Group. At the start of the third millennium, sustainable  development has, indeed, become a major challenge for society: one that cannot be avoided and with which the Group is engaging fully. Far-reaching changes are needed in the way we act when faced with rapid change: change which everyone can feel. Our history and our industrial tradition cannot conceal the reality which is all around us. We now look at things globally, preparing ourselves for profound and fast-moving change, over which we have very little control. We want to analyze the limitations imposed by sustainability issues but, even more, we want to identify the opportunities they present.  In March 2007, Solvays Executive Committee wished to express more formally its policy and strategic commitment towards sustainable development and the way the Groups societal responsibility would be exercised. This commitment is included in Solvays Mission and Vision statement, the aim being to respond consistently to various complex but fundamental issues. These issues relate to our role as a large consumer and converter of natural resources (fossil fuels, limestone, salt, water, etc.), to the direction being taken by our portfolio of products and services, and to our geographical expansion and the associated socio-economic implications. We requested all the Business Units to carry out analyses which, when put together, would allow us to take the right decisions. It is a difficult undertaking, as we are having to learn to look differently at various situations, seeing them from the perspective of a leap into the future.  The Chairmans message  Far-reaching changes are  needed in the way we act  when faced with rapid change 2  Change is possible. The impetus for this will come from involving everyone and from each persons will to adopt and see his or her targets and initiatives within the reference frame to which I have just referred. It is against this background that, more than ever, we are asking each employee to identify with the commitments into which we have entered, and to seize every relevant opportunity. Our renewed adherence to the Global Responsible Care Charter and the many initiatives already taken with regard to sustainability show that the Groups  commitment in this area is nothing new.  Going beyond these developments, I would like to sketch out here five aims that must guide the action we take for the coming years:  developing, in partnership, essential products that are more sustainable and are consistent with social and regulatory changes;  having the Group recognized as a reference standard for sustainability and innovation in industrial investment;  achieving success in the program for changing human resource management,  and improving all aspects of working conditions: safety, health, well-being and skills development, in strict conformity with our Values;  applying a rigorous policy for risk management, with programs to reduce risks and environmental impact, together with structured dialogue with communities living  adjacent to our manufacturing sites;  minimizing our consumption of energy and of natural resources. We are also calling on all our stakeholders to help us appraise the expectations and constraints in this actively changing world. We have created a variety of opportunities for dialogue, in order to perceive more readily these stakeholders expectations. You can judge what progress we have made from the following pages.  Our message is therefore one of optimism. Science, partnerships and openness to dialogue are among our Groups strengths. They will enable us to design a greener chemistry for  tomorrow and to establish ourselves as suppliers of solutions for the future, all the while  helping solve the problems of today. It is for industry, and for us at Solvay, to meet the expec- tations in this area that I can detect. It is for us to show we are capable and responsible,  making a significant contribution to solving the problems now facing society, in a word, proud of being chemists.  Christian Jourquin, Chairman of the Executive Committee 3     The purpose of life is life itself. Well, I would  happily say the same thing about sustainable development. I would happily say the same about civilization. I would say that civilization is a collection of knowledge, expertise, rules and values that protect us against a barbaric existence.  From that perspective, sustainable development  is part of civilization.  This means that non-Sustainable Development - development that cannot last - i.e. the development we are experiencing today development we are experiencing today, is playing into the hands of a barbaric existence. Andr Comte-Sponville, philosopher at the Sustainable Development Seminar of Solvays European Works Council, La Roche-en-Ardenne, 2005(*)  (*) Further thoughts from Mr Comte-Sponville, expressed  after listening to other speakers, punctuate the chapters  of this report.  Photo Sylvie THYBERT  The sustainable  Development policy   of the Solvay group Including Sustainable Development  in the Groups Mission,  Vision and Values The general thrust of Solvays activities is expressed in the Groups Mission, Vision and Values.  By Including sustainable development in the Groups mission, vision and values, we are making a clear statement  for everyone working in the Group about the commitment to Sustainable Development. Building on our scientific, technical and commercial expertise, and aware of our societal responsibilities, we provide innovative products and services related to chemistry and human health to create sustainable and ever-increasing value to our customers, share- holders and employees. We firmly believe in:  Ethical behaviour  Respect for People   Customer Care   Empowerment   Teamwork Solvay is an independent, ethical and responsible global industrial group with a balanced portfolio of sustainable, profitable and growing businesses, managed in accordance with societal and environmental issues.  Amongst the world leaders in selected markets and products either alone or with sound complementary business partners.   Valued by its customers as a highly competent, reliable and competitive  solution provider.   With a clear, motivating organization, through dialogue, developing and  empowering people and teams through rewarding and challenging jobs.   Acting as good corporate citizens, caring for the environment, health and  safety of its employees and of the community at large.   Open to the expectations of the outside world, and contributing to economic, social and environmental progress. Mission Values Vision Sustainable Development poses a major challenge to society.  The Solvay Group fully recognizes and accepts this challenge. We commit ourselves to take into account, in a way that is comprehensive and integrated in all our activities,  the triple demand of economic, societal and environmental sustainability. This commitment of widened responsibility as a good citizen:  is applied to the entire lifecycle of our products. This encompasses their design, their manufacture, their  applications and also the consumption of resources that they entail, including the societal impact of their  manufacture or use;  resides in the desire to innovate and to make progress by conducting a permanent and in-depth dialogue on these challenges with all concerned stakeholders and all our specific partnerships. 5   In line with the Groups Mission and Values, Solvay is keen to create economic and social value in a responsible and ethical manner, for its customers, shareholders and employees, for the local communities in which we are established, and for society in general. We intend to do this by offering innovative products and sustainable solutions based on the Groups scientific, technical and commercial skills. Our industrial strategy involves producing sustainable profitable growth in selected areas within our three sectors of activity: pharmaceuticals, chemicals and plastics. Innovation and collaborative action form the key for this growth and for our improved competitiveness. By responding better to the expectations of all of our stakeholders, we will be able to develop a real atmosphere of trust with each of them. Trust is the key to development and success. This approach applies in particular to the major investments made to protect against risks and to promote safety and health at work: They protect the health of our employees, improve the performance of our work teams and reduce social costs. A sustainability strategy driving  innovatory growth  1. In order to succeed in this, each employee, whatever that persons function and activity, must therefore act fully in accordance with developments in expectations resulting from the economic, social and environmental challenges facing the Group. In practice, this means making the Groups development inseparable from sustainability, with the latter used as an effective means of achieving growth in business. By meeting our employees expectations, the commitment to sustainable development helps produce a consensus, consistency and motivation within the Group itself. Indeed, the social partners are as much concerned about the quality of working life as of their firms social responsibility and continued existence. Similarly, the commitment establishes and strengthens social links with the communities living in the vicinity of our production sites. Sustainable development and our concern to be socially responsible are thus becoming essential aspects for innovation and the Groups openness to new markets. This is of  fundamental importance for a Group that has set itself the target of achieving 30% of its sales value in 2009 from new products, new markets and new technology. Our approach to "Open Innovation" is encouraging -  if not obliging - us to look outwards and compare ourselves with those who perform best, both in our existing fields and in new activities.  This sustainable development initiative is also a major means of achieving improved business effectiveness,  and this helps establish the initiatives complete legitimacy within the Group. It is, indeed, this change in our processes for researching, designing, manufacturing and also managing our portfolio of products and services that will open up to us the new markets necessary for sustainable growth serving the community, while also providing new ways for protecting non-renewable resources.

Solvays present and future activities are therefore aimed at meeting the expectations of the various stakeholders of the Group. Taking account of those expectations regarding sustainable development is included in the Groups business model and its normal management processes.  Including the challenges  of Sustainable development in  the Groups management processes  3. Sustainable development has a profound influence on the directions taken by large industrial firms. A more explicit commitment in this area from Solvay implies a commitment to think and act differently, so as to respond to new challenges. It is not the Groups task to provide solutions to all the challenges facing the planet and its inhabitants, nor do we have the ability to do so. What Solvay can do and wants to do is to meet the expectations and respond to the constraints imposed by those challenges. In particular, those that are at stake for parties that interact with the Group: investors, customers and suppliers, the employees, and civil society as a whole. 7   Climate change and energy  Energy supply  Access to drinking water  Biodiversity   Management of natural resources  Demography  Health and education  Economic globalization  Global  sustainability  challenges   Priority to growth in selected areas of  Pharmaceuticals, Chemicals and Plastics; Innovation, the key to growth and to constantly  improving competitiveness; An expanded presence in Asia,  the Americas and Eastern Europe.

By cross-looking at the intersection of the expectations of the stakeholders of the Group and the five driving axes of its strategy, key fields are identified which, when combined, will be the sphere of operation for the action we take in relation to business,  the environment and our role in society. When combined with the fields of action in the Matrix 5x5, tools enable each of the Groups management units (Strategic Business Units, Competence Centres and Business Support Centers) to: 1 carry out, within its own area of responsibility, regular self-analysis of issues that pose a threat to sustainability; 2 decide its own priorities; 3 identify opportunities for action to be taken.

Each  rm  has to adopt a strategy that  allows it to be on board. The situation as seen by a risk-capital investor Our objective as a risk-capital fund is not to invest and then sit back,  waiting and hoping. We want to anticipate what will happen in the  technologies and markets where we are investing, and take action  when that is necessary. In order to do that, we have to know from  the inside the businesses in which are investing. And when it comes  to sustainable development, we have no choice: if your activity is not  sustainable, you risk disaster. Each  rm has to adopt a strategy that  allows it to be on board. The board of our fund, Conduit Ventures, is a real forum bringing  together entrepreneurs. We discuss things openly, talking about what  is good and what is bad. Our fellow members thus provide us with  a better idea of how sustainable the projects are in which we are  investing. And nobody around the table has any doubts about the  challenges presented by sustainable development.  Solvays general attitude towards Conduit Ventures has been that of a  committed  rm, yet not such as to be a threat to small organizations  collaborating with the Group. I have been happily surprised by this  openness of mind, which is being con rmed. There are not many   rms of comparable size and quality that behave like that. In emerging  technologies such as fuel cells, which bring together and in uence  many industries, the investing partners have to provide not only cash,  but also their skills. And, in fact, the Solvay group is providing us with  skills in material science, which it applies in many  elds, from heavy  industry to products aimed at the general public. Going further, what is essential to a young  rm is a market. There has  to be a need, customers, added value, and social utility. It is essential  to know the customers needs. I therefore recommend that Solvay,  even as an upstream producer, becomes – in one way or another – a  stakeholder in the downstream markets. Your product may be just one  of the components obtained by the end user, but you nevertheless  need to have a good understanding of how important your technology  is to him.  I see sustainable risk capital now being supplied by public-sector  institutions,  nancial organizations and very professional  rms. The  investment made is of high quality, drawing on enormous sums of  money, which is available for the asking.  To conclude, I think that the ecology lobby formed of ecological  groups has done a tremendous job putting environmental protection  on everybodys agenda.

This strategy results in an emphasis on developing the pharmaceutical  sector and high-performance specialty products, and in stronger expansion in the geographi- cal areas that constitute growing markets: Asia, Mercosur, NAFTA and Russia. This approach is based on innovation, vertical integration and control over energy costs.   Continuous review of our competitiveness and the sustainability of our activity portfolio  are also part of our strategy for creating sustainable value for our shareholders and customers,  whilst ensuring high-quality employment for our staff and contributing to local development  that will assist the continued functioning of our production sites.

The criteria used for assessment do, nevertheless, vary. Solvay answers requests  for such ratings, is included in the FT4Good indices, and intends to participate actively in the  development of these assessments through a dialogue with the analysts. In addition, Solvay is an active member of networks and associations of European  rms that  consider corporate social responsibility to be at the heart of their initiative. Examples are CSR  Europe and EABIS (European Academy of Business in Society), which is a unique alliance of  companies, business schools and academic institutions that includes corporate responsibility  in its research programs and training for potential managers.   Change is not an aim in itself, but a means to an end. The reason why change is now  necessary is that if we want development to last, we need to change our mode of  development.

Investors 17  Strategy   Implementing our general strategy in relation to  sustainability through a set of speci c policies and  management methods.   Selecting targets and indicators of progress that permit  objective monitoring of performance. The Group has a wide range of Policies, Systems and management tools relating to  sustainability (see page 88).  Systematic analysis of the sustainability of our product portfolio forms part of the strategic  commitment to sustainable development that received formal endorsement from the Executive  Committee in March 2007. The commitment brings together and supplements pre-existing policies  in a consistent analysis and action plan. It will be supported by new indicators that permit on  assessment of how these policies have been applied and enabling them to be included in our  communications with the societal and  nancial rating agencies questioning us on these matters.   The Group has signed the updated Responsible Care Global Charter of the International  Chamber of Chemical Associations (ICCA) and updated its own policy on health, safety and the  environment. Measurements and veri cation of performance are key elements here. Strict compliance with the Corporate Governance Rules and the Code of Conduct, as revised  in 2007 (see Employees page 64), provide further indications of the desire to be recognized as a  reliable and lasting partner.  Sustainability criteria are also taken into account in all our innovation programs. Evidence of  this is provided in particular by the Future Businesses activities and the prize-winning projects in the  Sustainable Development category of the Solvay Innovation Trophy.

In the pharmaceutical eld, we put the emphasis on therapeutic added value. This factor,  more than ever, will guide future commercial success in this area, under the combined effects of  the growth in medical costs, health economics in general and reimbursement rates for medicinal  products. There is also a shift in the choice of drugs towards patient inuence (particularly resulting  from the Internet) and away from that of practitioners.  Our recognized expertise in chemical engineering is enabling us to introduce technologies  that are better-performing and more economical in terms of raw materials, resulting in reduced  production of emissions and by-products, together with increasing environmental efciency and  safety  Targets for 2012  Applying our sustainability approach in new  developments, as an integral part of our leadership  strategy : vinyl products (in Russia, Thailand and  Brazil), hydrogen peroxide (in Belgium, and another  planned in Thailand for 2010), vehicle fuel systems  (Inergy Automotive Systems), and epichlorohydrin,  using the EPICEROL process (in France and  Thailand).

Developing skills and collaborative ventures so as to  investigate and exploit emerging opportunities.    Ensuring our Future Businesses Competence Centre  is focused on contributions to sustainable develop- ment. New sectors establish emerging opportunities for sustainable activities with high added value  (see also page 40).  Solvay has identi ed organic electronics and sustainable energy as potential growth areas,  based on disruptive innovation. Both areas can contribute to sustainable growth with high added  value.   The research program on materials for fuel cells is a mainstream component of the  sustainable development prospect. In particular, the investigations relate to increasing the  reliability and reducing the cost of the membrane-electrode assemblies at the heart of the fuel  cell. Radically new concepts for fuel cells are being explored in collaboration with partners in  France, the UK and Germany. In this connection, Solvicore (a 50/50 joint venture between Solvay  and Umicore) and Michelin have combined their efforts to develop a fuel-cell system for the  HyLight 2 concept vehicle designed by Michelin and presented at the Challenge Bibendum event  in Shanghai in November 2007 (see page 40). The developments in organic photovoltaic cells   complete the platform on sustainable energies.  The synthesis of organic materials and the formulation of ink intended for printed electronic  devices in replacement of silicium-based components, forms the second platform of our Future  Businesses Competence Centre. In this framework, Solvay, Solvay Solexis and Thin Film  Electronics ASA (of Norway) have pooled their efforts to optimize ferroelectric materials in order  to obtain higher performance from thin-layer printed electronic memories.   Solvay is involved, through research contracts with Georgia Institute of Technology (USA) and  a signi cant investment in the company Plextronics, with research aimed at greatly reducing  the cost of solar cells, by replacing systems based on crystalline silicon with organic cells. The  collaboration is also concerned with developing displays using organic light-emitting diodes  (OLEDs).  We are currently developing new applications for products from our Chemicals and Plastics  sectors: In health-related  elds, biomaterials and medical equipment, products for disinfection,  hygiene and cosmetic purposes, protective products for human and animal nutrition have been  assessed as part of the monitoring and risk management provisions speci c to these markets.  In the  eld of micro- and nano-particles, NANOVIN is a PVC specialty containing particles that  modify the products viscosity. Possible applications in the pre-marketing stage are motor vehicle  bodywork and arti cial leather.  Application of the NOVOSOL process to cleanse sediment contaminated by heavy metals  and/or organic compounds (oils, pesticides, etc.) that has been dredged from waterways  has now proceeded beyond the pilot stage. This is an outstanding example of an approach to  industrial ecology, with recycling and the production of secondary raw materials. Two industrial  projects are currently planned: one to treat sediments in Wallonia (southern Belgium) and the  other in the industrial harbour of Venice (Italy), each for about one million tonnes of contaminated  sediments (see page 55)  Technologically innovative  elds  with sustainable growth potential 3 With  exible screens and OLED lighting panels, etc., printed electronics is making dramatic  applications possible. Printed electronics is now advancing on all fronts, as it becomes  possible to produce electronic components on an ever-wider  variety of support materials. Such organic electronic systems  will soon be mass-produced, at lower cost, on rotary printing  presses; and the development of OLED lighting components is  opening the way to very bright prospects. They are cheap to run  and sparing in energy consumption, while providing gentle and  diffuse illumination. We can expect to see them very soon on the  ceilings of our homes. OLED technology is also making it possible to produce display  screens with higher light levels and greater contrast. Most  important, though, is that they will be much thinner than the  ones we are used to, with the promise of poster-size portable  televisions and mobile phone screens that can be rolled up. 20  Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  Innovation Trophy 2006,  an excellent vintage !

Targets for 2012  Two major challenges for the pharmaceutical industry: greater safety  and therapies that are more personalized   There is an ever-increasing demand for more data and a trend towards having to demonstrate  the safety and bene t of any new medicinal product when compared with an existing medication  rather than a placebo; such as the strengthened regulatory requirements for the safety of  pharmaceutical products.  The need for volunteers to participate in clinical trials will therefore increase. While the  pharmaceutical industrys R&D spending has tripled over the past 10 years, the number of marketing  authorizations for new compounds has fallen, obliging the industry to increase still further its efforts  in research and innovation. At the same time, the move towards treatments that are more  targeted, bringing together diagnosis and personalized therapy, is leading to the development  of niche drugs rather than blockbusters. Meanwhile, from a global perspective, there remains a  need to respond to many medical conditions that are still waiting for effective treatments, but where  development receives inadequate  nance.

Making risk assessment and risk management rou- tine in order to allow a controlled approach to taking  business risks.  Managing policy on the insurance of catastrophic  risk.   Managing crisis communication with adapted policies  and tools. Risk management is now an integral part of our policy, applied routinely when deciding  on strategy, on strategic business decisions and on activities of a more everyday nature. For this  purpose, Solvay makes use of a model comprising 10 categories of risks. The aim is to identify,  quantify, assess and manage risks related to existing activities, and to anticipate effects on our  portfolio of activities. Our Risk Management Competence Centre, attached to the Financial  Management, uses this to decide on strategies, develop appropriate tools and provide back-up for  a more systematic management of risks.   As part of this approach, each of the Strategic Business Units carried out a comprehensive  analysis of its own critical risks in 2007, looking especially at those that could be considered  strategic. This management of risks has facilitated the realization of major investment projects.  The process has also been used to assess critical risks associated with new applications of  chemical and plastics specialties, particularly in the eld of human health or for the micro- and  nano-materials previously described. The risks are covered by insurance arrangements where such a solution is the best from a  business perspective. This is, of course, the case where such cover is mandatory. New possibilities  for insurance cover are constantly being analyzed.  In the pharmaceutical area, insuring against public liability risks is difcult given the wide range of  possible outcomes. The answer is to insure those risks for which this is mandatory, and to identify  when insurance represents the best solution from an economic viewpoint. At the end of 2007, the Groups provisions for health, safety and the environment amounted  to 417 million EUR (422 million at end-2006). Provisions cover in particular the risks and charges  associated with mineral extraction to obtain our raw materials (limestone, salt, uorspar, barium- strontium, etc.), the growing restrictions relating to disposal or treatment of waste products and,  more generally, the risks resulting from the present – or past - management of our manufacturing  sites.   There is a specic policy, including appropriate resources, to anticipate and prepare for  crisis situations, and this includes provision for crisis-related communication  Control of critical and nancial risks,  anticipation of crisis situations 4 Nano-materials: new applications and control  of the associated risks There is a network enabling a cross-fertilization of ideas between  all of the Business Units and Competence Centres that are  involved in studying micro- and nano-materials.  Combining these areas of expertise opens up the possibility of new  applications that are sustainable for the company and for society. In the context of product assessment policy, the experts in health  and environmental questions are undertaking investigations to  anticipate possible adverse effects.  Solvay also participates in research and discussions relating  to nanotechnologies by being associated with studies on  determining parameters regarding health and environmental  impact. These investigations are taking place in various countries:  the Record study in France, Nanocare in Germany and Belspo  as the Belgian branch of the European S2Nano project ; also  in various workgroups within ECETOC(*) and CEFIC(**). This  includes the setting of guidelines for the assessment of the  potential impacts of nano-materials.

Ensuring that Solvay is a company recognized for its expertise in risk management.      Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  Effective anticipation and management of crisis situations  A crisis is dened as any unexpected and serious situation, either internal or external, directly or  indirectly involving the Group, and requiring immediate decisions and action.   The crisis management systems have four objectives:   emergence of crisis situations;  plan, methods and procedures that are clear and can be understood by everyone;  carrying out regular training and awareness-raising measures;  terms of both individuals and collectively. The requirement is for each management unit to be able to manage the situation at its own level  as autonomously as possible, right from the start; learn from the experience; and improve its  procedures and arrangements for the future. Each management unit and each site has its own  organizational arrangements depending on its own specic features and regulatory restrictions, and  will thus act in accordance with a subsidiarity principle. With regard to crisis communication, a Group policy applies to all the management units, requiring  that SECOM, an international alert procedure, be applied. This lays down general principles serving  to establish common methods of acting and requirements throughout the Group. The procedure  relates to management of communication for any type of crisis that could involve the Groups  activities, reputation, staff or customers. Reference tools on crisis management are at   the disposal of communicators to help them to   prepare for the management of a crisis situation:    Crisis communication process.   12 essential reex actions in the event of a crisis.  Crisis communication Toolkit.  Crisis SECOM alert process.  Crisis passport (manual for the rst moments   of management of the situation).  Intranet site for crisis management and communication.

Risk management in relation to a human pandemic of avian u Avian Inuenza Risk working groups have been established at various levels of the Group   (Regions and SBUs), coordinated by a central Solvay Global Pandemic Preparedness Project  Team. The coordinating body includes representatives from Solvays three Sectors and the relevant  Competence Centres. The World Health Organization considers that the risk of a worldwide pandemic of human u  originating from the H5N1 avian u cannot be discounted. The Project Teams task is to prepare  Solvay for this eventuality, anticipate the real consequences (in terms of illnesses, absenteeism,  site safety and security, supplies, production, repatriation of families, deliveries, logistical and  information support), and coordinate the action taken by each of the Groups management entity  in this area. A budget has been allocated to obtain the necessary means of protection, and ways  of proceeding have been suggested to each management unit, so that they can establish practical  health protection of an appropriate scale, together with a plan for business continuity.   Investors 23  Strategy   Analyzing from the perspective of social, economic  and environmental sustainability any strategic  decision for investment, for the direction to be  taken by the activity portfolio or for management of  the existing activities; ascertaining stakeholders  expectations.   Applying, for this analysis, an approach using the  Matrix 5x5 that has been adopted, together with  the associated tools such as lifecycle analysis and  Solvay Sustainability Screening.  The framework intended to guide the Sustainable development strategy for all the Groups  management units was decided in 2007. The Matrix 5x5 and the associated analysis tools should  progressively help provide a real vision of how sustainable the various business processes and  projects are.  For many years Solvay has carried out – or contributed to - lifecycle analyses of many of its  products, in collaboration with specialist bodies. These analyses make it possible to compare the  performance of different products and to assess what contribution they make to sustainability in  their applications. In late 2007, the Strategic Business Units and Competence Centres began a more thorough  and systematic analysis of the sustainability of all the Groups activities. The aim was to test  the methods and establish a baseline assessment of the long-term sustainability challenges specic  to each activity and the corresponding markets.  The management units should constantly look at the challenges of sustainability more deeply,  through dialogue within those units and in collaboration with their direct stakeholders, particularly  their customers and suppliers to anticipate their constraints and requirements. These discussions  could relate to changing restrictions or to developments in markets, including constraints in relation  to materials (natural resources, energy, transport, and operating permits etc.) or resulting from new  regulations. On this basis, objectives are chosen and associated to appropriate indicators. Strategic projects are and will continue to be screened, notably by using Solvay Sustainability  Screening (S3). This tool, developed internally and validated by TNO (Dutch Organization for  Applied Scientic Research), uses a very detailed questionnaire (180 questions) to draw up a semi- quantitative assessment of the sustainability of a specic application or product, by looking beyond  the environmental impact of the products lifecycle and taking social aspects into consideration.  This assessment, possibly completed with other analysis using further tools (ecobalance, for  example) are used to decide between alternative investments  Targets for 2012  Using the sustainability assessment tools (*) validated by the Group* for 100% of  signicant planned innovations or acquisitions, and carrying out the assessments  jointly in the cases of partnership projects.

Sustainability criteria  in strategic decision-making  5 A broader vision: managing the complexity  of the challenges of sustainability requires the  integration of a systemic dimension into the  analysis Looking at the choice of packaging for a product, or the  expenditure on fuel to transport it, has to take account of the full  picture of the products added value, including when the product  is consumed far away from where it was manufactured, and has  thus been transported over a long distance. Tools are there to  help to take into account the full picture.  Meanwhile, it is rather unrealistic to imagine a single medical  examination that would diagnose everything, and it is similarly  unrealistic to think that one single method, one single and  universal reference tool, could unequivocally assess all  the products and practices in respect of social, economic  and environmental sustainability. Lifecycle assessments,  ecobalances, carbon-footprint assessments are tools that can  answer specic questions: comparing glass and plastic for a  packaging application, ethanol and bio-diesel as a fuel, etc.  These analytical tools should be put into the perspective of  a more systemic approach: All elements are in irreductible  interactions. Specic tools are necessary to really put these  interactions in sustainability issues into their global perspective.   Furthermore, sustainability assessments necessitate taking  a long-term view. While some aspects of the future can be  foreseen, other aspects are not predictable and cannot be  expected to conform to business as usual. For example, when  investigating the future and the sustainability of a product or  an application, it is difcult to single out how the markets will  change, or what might be the evolution of road or intercontinental  transport as a result of energy costs and/or of the constraints  linked to climate change policies. It is therefore necessary to  consider a variety of scenarios involving very different possible  socio-economic developments.

Since it  announced that it was seeking strong growth in order  to rapidly increase its sales value, a lot of questions  have arisen: in particular, which continent should be  favored? And what about nancial practices which,  by concentrating the prots while diluting the risks  widely in society in general – neglecting the principle of  responsibility – are encouraging the development of a  crisis, which could amount to a worldwide pandemic? Giving complete power to an extreme free-market economic environment  where the only thing that counts is the nancial results demanded of  companies would have a devastating effect on many of Solvays existing  production sites.  From this perspective, we must protect employment in the old-industrialized  countries. It is essential to rapidly establish conditions that will limit  delocalization. The fact is that, with the rising prices of petroleum and  foodstuffs, the dramatic fall in the dollar and very probable nancial and  economic crisis in the United States, the clouds are piling up overhead – and  there will be a very real price to pay! We are therefore counting on the Group to nd a new tack in Europe,  through innovative technologies and products, making up for the job losses  that result from the existence of lower wages in other parts of the world.  We are also asking for a heartfelt attachment in all countries to common  values and an equally heartfelt attachment to a uniform policy of sustainable  development that really applies to all three pillars of the Groups economic,  social and environmental matters. There cannot be differences between  countries or between world regions in working conditions or in compliance  with environmental rules.   In addition, we must avoid making decisions that are insulated from the local  circumstances. It is important to take account of this in projects such as the  decentralization to Portugal of internal services for management activities  and widening the range of countries from which we purchase goods and  services. Initiatives that save trivial sums for the Group as a whole could  signicantly damage the economy of a community in the vicinity of one of  our production sites. Extreme delocalization policies would also go against  the social responsibility commitments proclaimed by the Group. There is  therefore a need to nd the right balance in each case.  Our European Works Council is at the centre of these interesting discussions;  and how the Sustainable Development concept can be incorporated into  plans for the future will provide evidence of success for the Group and its  employees. Nol Tritz  Secretary of Solvays European Works Council Geographical expansion and outsourcing of European employment A long history, from the initial international expansion in Syracuse and Berezniki in the XIXth century,  up to the recent acquisition of a plant in Panoli, where the high-performance polymer KETASPIRE  (polyetheretherketone), is being produced.  Syracuse - USA  Berezniki - Urals, Russia Panoli - Gujarat, India Investors 25  Searching for alternatives  to fossil fuels  Non-recyclable residues as fuel for a power station in Bernburg (Germany)   By building a power station fuelled by the non-recycled  high-energy part of waste materials, Solvay and its partner, Tnsmeier, are among the first to adopt the EUs new approach to managing waste products.  The power station, at the Bernburg plant in Germany, will produce both electricity and heat, in the form of steam, for the production of sodium carbonate. The waste materials, called Refuse-Derived Fuels, comprise a non-recyclable  mixture of plastics, wood waste from furniture and buildings, textiles, paper and cardboard. These fuels can replace and economize on fossil fuels, thus reducing CO2 emissions. In addition, if put into landfill, part of the mixture could undergo fermentation and release methane, which has a potential greenhouse effect  20 times that of CO2. Construction of the plant began in April 2008, and it is planned to enter service in the spring of 2010. A similar project for Solvays  Rheinberg (Germany) site has been decided. Use of biomass to fuel a power station at the Tavaux (France) plant Solvay and the energy engineering company Dalkia are  considering co-producing both electricity (20-30 MW) and heat (50 tonnes/h of steam) by burning biomass waste.  The project now adopted arose from a call for tenders by the French government. The energy in the form of steam will be used for our chemicals and plastics production, with surplus electricity fed into the public grid. The unit will consume 280 000 tonnes a year of biomass: 45% from agricultural and food processing waste, 4% from the growth of dedicated species and 51% from fallen branches. The biomass will be brought by train, or by lorry where distances of under 100 km are involved. The project will have a capital cost of 60 million EUR and create 50 jobs. It will result in the setting up a full regional supply chain for biomass. With regard to the environment, in addition to the CO2 emissions avoided, the project will help derive value from local energy resources and assist forest maintenance. The possibility of exploiting the combustion ash for soil enrichment is being studied. 26  Wind power, nuclear, hydroelectric, geothermal, solar, biofuels and recycling:  Alternatives to fossil fuels as energy sources have to be taken into account. PVC made from sugar and salt in Brazil Solvay Indupa in Brazil will soon have an integrated ethylene production plant that uses ethanol derived from sugar cane. Ethylene is one of the two main raw materials for PVC. Santo Andr will thus become the first site in Brazil producing PVC from  renewable resources: an innovation avoiding large quantities of CO2 emissions. Biodiesel by-product as a raw material for polyester resins The new EPICEROL technology produces epichlorohydrin,  a raw material for polyester resins, from glycerol,  a by-product from biodiesel production using rapeseed.  The technology improves the overall lifecycle balances both  of polyester resins and of biodiesel.  More efficient than the technology previously used to produce epichlorohydrin, the new process reduces chlorinated residues eightfold and water consumption tenfold. Solvay has applied for 22 patents for the new Epicerol new technology. The main uses of epichlorohydrin includes the production of epoxy resins used  in cars, boats and planes, wind power plants, water purification products, and paper strengthening.

Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  27  Taking more account  of societys expectations   Widened citizenship responsibilities   Global ecological footprint of our activities  Products protecting the environment and meeting essential needs New solutions to protect health and the environment      Education, training, employability of young people  It is important for   rms to take part in  public discussions on  sustainability, as it is  in everyones interest  for our mode of  development to become  more sustainable.  The situation as seen by an ecologist Industry wishes to operate in an environment where things are  reasonably predictable; that is understandable. I think it is wholly in  industrys interest to cooperate with the world of politics to establish the  ground rules. Living as part of society means accepting the restrictions  imposed by regulations and incentives. Without regulations, it is the  bad players and those who are slow to act who win! So,  nding new  ways for  rms and politicians to cooperate presupposes a long-term  view and a common interest.  The development model we need to  nd is no longer that of the 19th  and 20th centuries; we need to adopt a model that takes full account  of environmental and social effects. It is clear that, while industry is  undoubtedly an important factor posing a threat to the environment,  it is also a means to achieving a more sustainable development mode  for the present and future generations. Unfortunately, the technologies  for sustainable development remain, in Europe, a  eld that is still at a  rather embryonic stage. In order to seize the chance to gain a business  advantage from them, we need to move quickly; the rest of the world  will not wait for us. The problem is that many quoted companies have the sole objective  of pro t in the very short term, for the bene t of a single stakeholder,  the shareholders. Such a  rms rationale is then exclusively  nancial,  unconnected with the real economic situation. It is nonsense that  results in unacceptable inequalities being created, with a tiny minority  cornering a growing proportion of our planets wealth. If there is one thing I request of Solvay, it is to stand up and be counted.  It is important that  rms, which take account of the long term and the  variety of milieux in which they live, take part in public discussions on  sustainability, as it is in everyones interest for our mode of development  to become more sustainable.  However, we cannot limit ourselves to encouraging Corporate Social  Responsibility by  rms, which would amount to saying We trust their  altruism, as a response to the social and environmental challenges  we face, , in other words trusting something that is not one of a  companys objectives. Too often, that is a convenient excuse for  governmental authorities, who thus relieve themselves of their  responsibilities. Rather than an environment where freedom of choice  rules, I still prefer the rule of law, with its restrictions and its incentives.  It has the merit of putting  rms on an equal footing in managing their  social responsibilities. We, the Greens, intend to stand resolutely together with our fellow- citizens – and not just here and now: a democratic and sustainable  European society cannot develop at the expense of living conditions  for our fellow citizens in other parts of the world.

Mr Jourquin emphasized there the  importance of a dialogue with the whole of society to give direction to science, industrial  activity and innovation. With this in mind, Solvay regularly supports initiatives aimed at generating a better unders- tanding of science: educational projects, exhibitions, etc. The Chemistry Essential to Life  program supports players in the academic and scienti c world who provide the public, govern- mental authorities, NGOs and consumer associations with a better knowledge and understan- ding of chemistry, its products and the challenges it presents. Solvay, for example also sup- ported symposia about toxicological risk assessments organized in 2005 by Professors Giavini  and Galli from the Universit degli Studi di Milano and both in 2007 and 2008 by the Belgian  Society of Toxicology.  My driving within the 90 kilometres an hour speed limit is not the result of practising  philosophy for 30 years! Three penalty points on my driving licence have produced a  philosopher - who is not the worst - in obeying the law. This means that it depends on  you and me as citizens, and not as moral beings, for the greenhouse effect to diminish,  but this necessarily involves politics, the law and restrictions.  Andr Comte-Sponville, at the Sustainable Development  Seminar of Solvays European Works Council, 2005  Networking  with society Solvay is very proud that two of its employees are amongst the members of the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was collectively  awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, jointly to Al Gore. Frans Grunchard,  formerly employed in Solvays Chemicals Sector in Brussels, and Ewald  Preisegger, of Solvay Fluor in Hanover, contributed to the Panels work through  the European Fluorocarbons Technical Committee (EFCTC) and the award  recognized their work. This also presents an opportunity to stress the important scienti c  contribution made by James Franklin, another of the Groups former employees,  and a renowned international expert in the climate  eld. He has, in particular,  distinguished himself as part of the Alternative Fluorocarbons Environmental  Acceptability Study (AFEAS), an international project that was able to eliminate  speedily the use of CFCs, which were destroying the ozone layer.  it depends on you and me as citizens,  and not as moral beings, for the greenhouse  effect to diminish     Society  31  Strategy    Exploiting to the full our activities and skills in markets  that meet fundamental needs - health and hygiene,  mobility and transport, housing, etc. – or are related  to protecting natural resources and the environment.   Developing new applications serving health and the  environment, in collaboration with our customers,  where such applications are in line  with our business  strategy for the relevant  markets.  Specialty products - which is a developing area for Solvay - are helping to improve  sustainability in many sectors. They assist progress in the areas of safety, the environment and  energy savings, through their enhanced technical performance, such as resistance to temperature,  wear, pressure and corrosion. In the Plastics Sector, Inergy Automotive Systems fuel tanks are helping to reduce the  weight of vehicles and their emissions. PipeLifes systems for the supply of drinking water and  the removal of waste water are helping to manage water resources. Among recent developments  related to sustainability are SOLVIVAs biomaterials for implantable medical devices, new  TECHNOFLON-range polymers for the energy, semiconductor and motor vehicle sectors, and the  new HYFLON family of resins that increase the safety and water-tightness of equipments, notably  in the food processing industry. Essential chemicals are also playing a part in the move to technologies that are less  polluting: Hydrogen peroxide, for which Solvay is the worlds largest producer, is  nding increasing  applications as an oxidizing agent in the removal of pollution from ef uents in a number of industries,  and has to a great extent replaced gaseous chlorine as a bleaching agent (notably for textiles and  paper). In addition, a new hydrogen peroxide plant of very large capacity, (230 kilotonnes/year), is  under construction at Antwerp (Belgium), and one of 330 kilotonnes/year is planned for Thailand, in  partnership with Dow for  cleaner production of propylene oxide, an intermediate in the manufacture  of polyurethane insulating foams.  In  uorinated  uids, Solvays HFCs have helped to replace rapidly CFCs and H-CFCs, which  destroy the ozone layer whereas the HFCs have no effect on the ozone layer. Also, their climate- warming potential is generally lower than that of the CFCs they are replacing. HFCs are energy-  ef cient over the entire life cycle of their applications, and often perform better than the alternatives  in the areas of climate impact, safety and health  Targets for 2012    Targets are related to a variety of products serving environmental protection (see  page 30).

However, with the development of new markets involving distant locations with poor  transport facilities (e.g. Russia), the transport of products is increasing.   Solvay transports large quantities of  nished products – over 10 million tonnes a year in  Europe alone – of which about half are products classi ed as hazardous. A large proportion of our  raw materials (notably ethylene and brine) is supplied by pipeline networks.   Our transport policy aims to replace road transport by rail and waterways in Europe wherever  this is physically possible and cost-effective. In particular, this is the case for substances that are  panderous: soda ash, salt, PVC, caustic soda and peroxide products.  Alternatives to road have been adopted where feasible, classi ed into account constraints of  cost, deadlines and timing, particularly for substances classi ed as hazardous. Besides, starting  in 2001, 300 containers of SolVin PVC are sent by rail from France, Belgium or Germany to Italy,  amounting to 90,000 tonnes a year no longer crossing the Alps by road. There is a new Solvay port  on the Rhine River, serving the Rheinberg plant in Germany; this will be used primarily for transpor- ting caustic soda, thus reducing road transport  Strategy   Locating production plants for heavy chemicals close  to their raw materials, their markets or to waterways.    Seeking realistic alternatives to road transport; ma- king use of pipeline transport.  Ef cient transport  of our products 2 Up for discussion  Most of the transport is carried out by road, which has historically  been, and remains, the most  exible mode of transport and the  one that is most reliable for meeting our customers requirements.  Establishing local production facilities, such as our planned Rusvinyl  PVC plant in Russia, is one way to limit the growing volume of goods  transport. We are, however, seeking and using alternatives to road transport  wherever such possibilities are available and suitable, taking into  account requirements in terms of cost, deadlines and timing. Rail  and waterway transport, for example, are alternatives worth investigating for materials  regularly transported in large volumes: limestone, coal, caustic soda, sodium carbonate,  etc. Unfortunately, however, these modes of transport generally perform less well, are less   exible and cannot respond as readily to changes. One alternative to road transport that is  potentially very attractive is multimodal arrangements. There is certainly a bright future for  such transport arrangements but they require that customers do not demand just-in-time  deliveries, but choose to receive regular supplies. Even more important is that the rail and/ or waterway networks are suf ciently developed and perform to a satisfactory standard;  currently, this is far from being the case.    Alain Avau,  Logistics Manager for the Chemicals Sector Alternatives to road for transporting  our products?  Not always easy !  Targets for 2012-2020    Reducing by 20% (in tonnes-km) the share accounted  for by road among transport of our products in Europe  (= achieving 50% for non-road transport) between 2006  and 2020.

Diversifying  energy  sources  and  making  use  of alternatives to fossil fuels wherever they are  sustainable in ecological, economic, industrial and  social terms.   Helping develop arrangements for the recycling or  destruction at the end of their life, for those of our  products that have a potential greenhouse effect.  Our energy consumption is stable, whereas our production is growing. The energy  consumption – and content (polymers) - for some of our-large volume products is large by nature.  Developing long-lasting solutions regarding energy supply is a constant concern. This can be  in the form of heavy investments or as partnerships or contractual arrangements extending over a  long period.  Our production processes are improved by applying new technologies. As an example, the  progressive introduction of new electrolysis units using membrane technology to produce chlorine  and caustic soda allows electricity savings of up to 18%. This technology now accounts for 45%  of our installed capacity. A lot of very efcient steam-and-electricity cogeneration units have been established starting  in the 1990s, very often in partnership with power generation companies. So far, these partnerships  have enabled the electricity producers and  Solvay together to avoid about 20% of CO2 emissions.  Energy audits are in progress in those of our plants where consumption is greatest. While  there remains scope for further savings, primarily by further recycling, they are limited by the  thermodynamic constraints of chemical processes.  In terms of emissions of ozone-depleting substances, very large reductions have been  obtained in our plants, corresponding to the requirements of the Montreal Protocol, and will  ultimately lead to their total elimination.  We are also working in a number of countries to encourage the introduction of electricity production  based on wind or photovoltaic generation.  Production facilities that use non-oil raw materials are being established: There is a project  taking place in Brazil to use bioethanol, partially replacing ethylene as the starting material for  PVC production, without competing with the food supply chain. In addition, there are plans for the  construction of a second industrial unit using the new Epicerol process to produce epichlorohydrin,  using residues from the biodiesel industry as raw material. In order to treat and recycle uorinated by-products from the manufacture of uorocarbons  (HFCs), Solvay Fluor has developed a high-temperature technology which destroys them and  recycles the hydrouoric acid stemming from this process. The process treats the by-products  of our production units of Bad Wimpfen (in Germany) and Spinetta (in Italy). From 2000 onwards,  this has indeed enabled the various sites to reduce their emissions of HFCs, especially HFC 23  (-7000 kilotonnes CO2 equivalent).

Large reduction in emissions of greenhouse  gases from Solvay Indupas PVC plant at Santo  Andr (Brazil)  The Brazilian authorities have approved a change from fuel oil to natural  gas as the energy source when Solvay Indupas PVC production at  Santo Andr is increased.  This will make it possible to reduce dramatically not only the CO2  emissions, by nearly 44,000 tonnes a year, but also those of sulfur, by  99%, carbon monoxide by 90%, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.  Carbon credits equivalent to ve years emissions have been obtained in  connection with this project, in application of the Kyoto Protocol.  Up to discussion Moving to renewable resources is an  intention which it is currently difcult  for us to put into practice on a large  scale, given that we come up against  two major limitations.  The rst is that for our production to be  viable from a business perspective, we  must be able to see energy prices over  the long term, whereas there is current- ly still great uncertainty over the markets for renewable  materials.  The second limitation is that one of the conditions for this  to be acceptable industrially – and, if necessary, political- ly – is the availability of a regular, sufcient and assured  source of the renewables. The experience we have gained  shows that such a prospect is still difcult to establish, in  particular in contractual terms.  In addition, we must be certain that the alternative  resource (wood, bioethanol, glycerol from biodiesel,  waste products, etc.) is technologically compatible with  the characteristics of our production processes, and with  the traditional fuels.

Supporting educational initiatives about science.  Receiving young work-experience trainees and students is generally carried out in  accordance with national or regional provisions. The expertise which is characteristic of the  chemical and pharmaceutical industries means that these training periods provide trainees with  experience that is appreciated as especially valuable. The new Youth Employment Scheme  program, introduced by Solvay and its European Works  Council, is currently being established in Europe. It has the aim of encouraging the employability  of young unemployed people living in the vicinity of our production sites, by offering them work  experience in the Groups establishments.   With regard to educating people about science, Solvay contributes to a number of local  initiatives (see Local communities chapter). In particular, Solvay  nances a new Science Bus  project in collaboration with the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, and provides support  for a program of the Belgian Federation for Chemistry and Life Sciences Industries (Essenscia),  which provides lectures on science-related subjects for secondary schools  Targets for 2012   Implementing and assessing the Youth Employment Scheme.    Seeking a high quality of the  training offered to students and trainees.   Education, training  and employability of young people 4 The Youth Employment Scheme program as an example  of a local training initiative in Europe  The  Executive Committee wished to give substance to the invitation extended to the members of  the European Works Council in May 2006 to improving access for young people to employment in  general, and particularly young people in dif culties. The Youth Employment Scheme program of Solvay relates mainly to young people within the  areas near our production sites.  It also concerns the children and family of members of our staff,  whether they are students, apprentices or undertaking work experience. The initiatives are aimed  at compensating for the inadequate training the young people have received, or for their lack of  employment experience. The action is mainly in countries and regions where access to employment is particularly dif cult.  The projects are selected in agreement with the staff representatives, based on transparent and  non-discriminatory criteria.  The  rst initiatives have been undertaken in the Iberian countries, Austria and Bulgaria.  Scientists in numerous occupations Scientists come in a great variety of forms, as children  have clearly seen. Some resemble Merlin, the wizard  of Celtic and Arthurian legends; others are more like  Tintins inventor friend, Professor Calculus. Meanwhile,  Pasteur, with his vaccines, is an inspiration from  real-life. Alongside those engaged in research and  invention, however, there are dozens of other technical  occupations that help convert laboratory discoveries  into practical applications as goods and services  contributing to well-being: engineers, pharmacists,  technicians, plant operators and salespeople, etc. Such  people are working away every day in workshops, of ces  and factories, where they manufacture, monitor, test,  adjust and innovate. Their efforts provide the Earths  population with food, housing, clothes, personal care  products, educational facilities, means of transport and  entertainment, all of which enhance our lives. The simple  fact is that nature alone cannot meet the needs of all six  billion people who form the worlds population, and its  resources are not unlimited.  As chemists, we  nd our  science often faces criticism – sometimes rightly – and  we take pride in the fact that it is now providing, and will  continue tomorrow to provide, new solutions assisting  the worlds sustainable development.

Solvay is active within many scientic and technical associations, such as the European  Process Safety Centre, the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals  (ECETOC), the European CEFICs Long Range Research Initiative program, and the RECORD and  NICOLE European research networks, on waste products and contaminated soil respectively.  Many studies are  entrusted to research institutes of various countries and numerous dis- sertations and research papers are written in collaboration with institutes and universities. Through  its employees, the Group supports or participates in initiatives such as GreenFacts, Frances CNEEIC  (Collge National dExperts en Environnement de lIndustrie Chimique) and EUROTOX, the Federa- tion of European Toxicologists and several national Societies of toxicology.  The Group has always supported the most fundamental scientic activities, in particular  through the International Institutes of Physics and Chemistry founded by Ernest Solvay with, among  others, in 2008 the creation of the Solvay Chair for chemistry, the quinquenal scientic prize Ernest- John Solvay, the Technological Innovation Chair at INSEAD (in Fontainebleau, France), the Francqui  Chair at the Universit de Bruxelles, Belgium, or the Fluor Chair at the Politecnico in Milan, Italy.  Solvay Pharmaceuticals participates in a variety of collaborative programs aimed at  reducing the use of laboratory animals and, in 2007, Solvay adopted a general policy on the  use of animals in this way. In this connection, an ethics committee, the Solvay Animal Care and Use  Committee (SACUC), including outside members (notably university lecturers), was established to give  ethical opinions on animal experiments and other scientic activities that make use of animals  Strategy    Giving selective support to institutions and initiatives  related to scientic research, dissemination of  knowledge and to making young people aware of  science, technology and related occupations.

This has reduced this use of living animals by nearly 80%.  For more than a century Solvay has supported international  scientic projects for more than a century  These have included the study of biodiversity and rainforest canopy with the SolVin Bretzel (in  Madagascar in 2001 and Panama in 2003) and with the Arbodme (in the Santo 2006 expedition to  the Vanuatu archipelago.  Solvay has also provided support to Belgiums scientic expeditions to Antarctica since 1896. We  are now supporting the new Princess Elisabeth research station in Antarctica (see next page); this  will be autonomous with regard to energy, with no impact on the climate (carbon-neutral).

Promoting and protecting the Groups interests.   Taking fuller account of the expectations of civil so- ciety and of the people who represent it, whether in  politics or non-political groups. There are about 20 people in the Group responsible for dealings with governmental and  public affairs. Some are in corporate ofces and others in our regional outposts. Through their  interaction with these authorities, they promote and protect the Groups interests, and help the  Group understand what is expected by the regulatory bodies, governmental authorities and  civil society.  Solvay has not entrusted the management of its governmental-liaison matters to an  external consultancy. Such activities rely on an internal network of experts distributed  among the various activity Sectors, Competence Centres and countries. These people act  in accordance with their own areas of competence and knowledge; they provide information,  engage in discussions, and defend the Groups interests, in accordance with transparency and  compliance with regulations and ethical principles. The Group develops and maintains relationships with the relevant governmental  authorities through this network of experts and through trade federations (national, European  or worldwide), also participating in various fora such as the European Roundtable and Business  Europe. We assist in decision-making through the sharing of information, by making practical  proposals and by insisting on the need for a long-term view to be taken, this being essential for  a sustainable investment policy in heavy industry.  In addition, many of our staff take part in technical working groups, notably for commenting  on draft regulation, setting up environmental best technologies, dening REACH application  guidelines or safety standards for plastics materials. At the local level, Solvays collaborators  also ensure a constant dialogue with relevant public authorities.  The people responsible for governmental-liaison matters operate in accordance with the  following principles:  for the protection of human rights;     Targets for 2012    Establishing direct and continuing discussions amounting to long-term collabo- ration with governmental authorities and other representatives of civil society,  based on transparency, trust and mutual benet.   Identifying the most competent people within the Group, to ensure high-quality  dialogue with the governmental authorities.   Ensuring consistency, coordination and effectiveness of all action undertaken  by everyone in the Groups governmental-liaison network. Dialogue with governmental authorities  and contributing to regulatory developments   6 When a plant nds itself in the spotlight In December 2006, a press article mentioned deaths from cancer  that had occurred among retired staff who had previously worked  in the electrolysis unit at Jemeppe (in Belgium) when that unit  employed a process using mercury.  In particular, the article called into question exposure to that  material, despite the fact that no medical authority – nor the  European Union or the World Health Organization – recognizes  mercury as a cause of cancer. Solvay then held a number of meetings with employee  representatives and company doctors, with the former also  invited to visit another of the Groups plants, where the mercury  process is still used. In addition, a dialogue was established with  the health authorities.  Solvay applies a standard for exposure to mercury that is twice  as strict as required by the law, and employees are subject  to stringent health monitoring. As soon as a critical threshold  is exceeded, corrective measures are taken. These include  temporary removal of the worker(s) from that work location if  necessary. At Jemeppe, the installations using mercury were  replaced successively in 1992 and 2001 by equipment using a  membrane technology. Number of people assigned  to public affairs, and location Full-time equivalents Headquarters Elsewhere in Europe Outside  Europe 10 5 5 38  Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  Climate change This is a worldwide concern, and the priority must be the introduction of a new  framework for international cooperation, where all the main countries produ- cing greenhouse gases undertake a commitment to reduce these emissions  beyond 2012. In this connection, use of the Joint Implementation proce- dures and the Clean Development Mechanisms must be extended, while  ensuring that the projects selected and monitoring of their establishment are  robust.  The diversication of energy sources and of their transport are key elements. With regard to European Union policy on climate change, Solvay supports the  EU aim of taking the lead in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and hen- ce countering climate change. However, an  industrial policy ensuring a framework com- patible with a sustainable development of the  European industry is crucial for maintaining  its overall competitiveness. In this respect,  the European Union must avoid taking deci- sions in isolation, when those decisions could  rapidly and irreversibly threaten the very exis- tence of industrial sectors such as chemicals,  which have to be competitive worldwide. A  competitive European chemical industry is  an essential condition for achieving the EUs  aims of social, economic and environmental  progress decided in Lisbon. Energy provision in Europe  While awaiting the internal energy market in Europe, Solvay considers  it essential to introduce interim provisions to safeguard electricity- intensive industries that are competing in a world market, in order to avoid  compromising their future. Large consumers must be able to enter into long- term contracts with the producers, with prices close to basic production  costs, even if this means contributing to the capital cost of the power  stations. The EUs aim of energy efciency must serve to encourage industry  to adopt technology embodying the Best Available Techniques (BATs) while  also avoiding imposing an absolute limit on consumption and thus preventing  economic development.  Opinion: the Groups position on two important issues  Princess Elisabeth Polar Station: the rst polar research station that will be carbon-neutral Society  39  Products of the future  for innovative applications Fluorinated polymers for  high-performance lithium batteries The emergence of vehicles that are less polluting depends on better performance of batteries. By 2010, some 20% of hybrid vehicles, combining an internal-combustion engine and an  electric motor, will make use of lithium batteries.  The fluorinated polymers produced by Solvay Solexis are ideal compounds for some components of these new-generation batteries. They can be used to make highly adhesive binders for the electrodes, separators between the other  components - increasing safety - and even additives for the electrolytes. The development of hybrid vehicles could reduce CO2 emissions by around 30%. All-electric vehicles could even avoid all such emissions if the upstream  electricity generation also avoids them. In addition, Solvicore (a joint venture between Solvay and Umicore) and Michelin have teamed up to power the hydrogen-fuelled Hy-Light demonstration vehicle. Solvay Advanced Polymers products  at the heart of various  high-performance applications The manufacture of holofibres and tubular membranes used for water treatment (notably low-pressure filtration and seawater desalination) is based on high-performance polymers produced by Solvay Advanced Polymers.  UDEL polysulfones, because of their lifespan and their stability to light, tend similarly to be used for blood dialysis and for solar furnaces  and water heaters (illustration), or for dip tubes in self-cleaning  commercial water heaters. TORLON and RADEL products comply with all requirements for aircraft cabin interior components (illustration below) or for very large wind-driven applications. The barrier properties of products in the AMODEL and IXEF ranges  are now used for applications aimed at reducing gas releases from fuel tanks, and in hybrid vehicles. 40  Organic compounds to produce  printed electronics and revolutionary forms of lighting Solvay Solexis and Thin Film Electronics ASA (Norway) are collaborating to get the best out of ferroelectric polymer materials and obtain enhanced performance from electronic memory in the form of printed thin layers.  Solvays involvement in printed electronics and in research aimed at replacing solar cells based on crystalline silicon with organic cells, which would be cheaper, is also achieved by research contracts with Georgia Institute of Technology (USA) and by an investment in the company Plextronics. Possible applications of printed electronics include diffuse lighting panels using organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are very energy-efficient, and flexible screens, which produce greater contrast and are thinner, opening the way to portable televisions the size of a poster and mobile phones that could be rolled up. High-performance water-based  anti-corrosion paints releasing minimal amounts of volatile organic compounds Protecting steel structures against corrosion and thus ensuring them a long life requires coatings with very low permeability to water, that are highly resistant, and that adhere strongly.  The water-based paints used for this purpose have the advantage of better  protection for the environment and for health. This is the case with paints based on nanoparticles of DIOFAN, a polyvinylidene chloride latex developed  in collaboration with BASF. These paints have the polymers barrier properties and its great resistance while releasing only minute amounts of volatile organic compounds when the anti-corrosion paint is applied, ensuring it complies with the requirements of EU Directives. There are also aqueous dispersions of PVDC used in other applications, such as pharmaceutical packaging. Developing new activities aimed at creating new materials and innovative systems : going beyond our traditional activities Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  41  Partnerships to take care  of product sustainability  throughout their lifecycles Ethical business Long-term competitiveness and Product Stewardship Reliable products with documentation  New products and services providing sustainable solutions   Products at the end of their lives; replacements for non-sustainable products     Mon fournisseur  doit devenir un ple  dinteractivit  et de connectivit  dans mon mtier  The situation as seen by a customer As a European textile-manufacturing company specializing in tarpau- lins, Ferrari Textiles should have died long ago! The fact that we are still  alive today is because we were able to establish conditions that were  conducive to communication between all parties along the sequence  from raw material producers to end customers.  It is very clear that the move is towards a systemic supplier-customer  relationship embracing all players in the sequence including providers  of related components. The conventional linear view – I produce and  then I sell to consumers – is now out of date.  In the 1970s, we were the rst to get our customers to understand that  plastic tarpaulins were not to be bought by the kilo. That was hard! The  focus of our image had to move from the materials to the performance.  We explained that we were not there just to sell high-performing square  meters, but new ideas! We were moving from performance of the  material to its application. There is currently another change coming  about. People do not just ask for high-performing materials; they also  want ecoefciency, reduced material ows, and arrangements for the  materials to be reused, meeting the growing requirement for recycling  at the end of a products life. This is yet another eld where it is essential to see things as a whole.  Even if SolVin produces good PVC and the extruder making PVC  window frames also works well, if the window manufacturer does not  obtain good thermal insulation, the whole value of the PVC window  frame is lost. The next revolution will therefore be one of business rather than of  ideology. If you do not give your customers an opportunity to position  their own products in terms of those products values to the environment  and to society, you are lost. We must be able to say: By buying from  me, you acquire values that give you a position in the market, and  which you will be able to charge for. Why doesnt my customer buy  in China? Because, beyond what he buys from Ferrari Textiles, and  beyond what Ferrari Textiles buys from Solvay, there is not just the  product; there are values that the customer expects. The supplier must  therefore promote interaction and communication, both upstream  and downstream in the customers business. In terms of social and  environmental values, the supplier underwrites the customers values.   Let me make this clear: Ferrari Textiles has not adopted this policy  by considering itself as a social benefactor, or an NGO. We are a  business, and Solvay – together with its SolVin joint venture – has, by  developing the VINYLOOP and TEXYLOOP technologies, enabled  us to make progress, particularly in recycling.    Romain Ferrari,  Director of Ferrari Textiles (France )  and a customer of SolVin Customers and suppliers 43 A supplier to my  business has to be at  the heart of a network,  with connections both  upstream and  downstream   < Bags made from recycled tarpaulins  Partnerships to take care of product sustainability throughout their lifecycles Our key activities Our product portfolio is moving towards products that perform better and provide  higher added value. There is documentation on each, in the form of a dossier identifying  characteristics that are potentially hazardous for human health and the environment; these  describe risks associated with conditions in which the products may be used, in compliance  with legal requirements. All the relevant substances contained in Solvay products covered by the EUs REACH  Regulation will have been pre-registered by the end of 2008, in compliance with the  Regulation, which was adopted in 2006. In addition, assessments of the effects of REACH  on the future availability of substances bought by Solvay are continuing, bringing together the  suppliers in a large survey.  Started in 2004, our SACHEM (SAfety of CHEMicals) program ensures consistency  worldwide of the product information, in the framework of the new worldwide Globally  Harmonized System of classication and labeling of hazardous substances. With regard  to pharmaceutical products, Solvay Pharmaceuticals has planned an environmental risk  assessment for all its products, going beyond regulatory requirements. Our concern with safety throughout the lifecycle of a product has resulted in our extending  the safety audits for transport rms, applying to both road and water transport. With regard to recycling, various solutions have been developed in response to market  demand, particularly for plastics and uorinated products, and also for treating dredged slurry  (NOVOSOLprocess). There is compliance with the commitment undertaken by European PVC producers,  and known as Vinyl 2010, to improve the whole lifecycle for PVC. This operates through  annual programs, monitored by a committee that includes representatives of the European  Commission (www.vinyl2010.org).

Thus, increasing interaction with our customers and our markets  is a condition that is essential for  nding solutions that are more sustainable, within industrial  systems that are increasingly integrated upstream and downstream.  Our Innovation Trophy prizes provide a special opportunity to mark stages in such colla- boration on sustainable development challenges with our customers. SolVin, for example  organizes every three year an innovation award that rewards customers for innovative and  sustainable applications of vinyl products.  Your customers do not come to you out of generosity but because it is in their interest.  This means that if you count on their generosity, you are  nished. If, instead, you count  on peoples self-interest, you have a good chance of emerging successfully, so long  as you are able to create situations where the interests of the various stakeholders -  employees, shareholders and customers – coincide. This makes it a mutually bene cial  activity, a solidarity.

Customers and suppliers 45  Strategy    Assisting customers in our main markets where  there are rapidly changing requirements relating to  sustainability and energy efciency, particularly the  automotive and construction sectors. Our product mix has changed in recent years, enabling new requirements to be met in  relation to performance and sustainability. As an example, the products of Solvay Advanced  Polymers and Solvay Solexis meet stringent requirements relating to thermal, electrical and  mechanical resistance.   In more conventional plastics, the emphasis has mainly been on the additives used (with  some of the plasticizers and stabilizers in PVC applications being replaced) on developments in  production processes (e.g. reducing releases of PFOA, a detergent used in polytetrauoroethylene  manufacture), and on the expected lifetime of formulations for water-supply plastic pipes and  window frames. Other improvements have been obtained to prevent releases of gasoline vapor  from vehicle tanks, and to extend the lifetime of metallic components by polymer coating, such  as in boat paints containing PVDC.   In our Chemicals Sector, new uorinated gases have gone into industrial production.   A notable example is HFC 365mfc, used for high-performance thermal insulation foams.  In the Pharmaceutical Sector, methods of drug administration have been developed to  improve both the efcacy of medication and patient comfort, especially for drugs to treat  serious disorders. Notable among these developments are CREON microspheres of pancreatic  enzymes to treat cystic brosis, innovative systems to administer the anti-u vaccine INFLUVAC,  and DUODOPA to treat Parkinsons disease. Also, it has recently been possible to improve the  production processes. These developments have related to extraction of natural raw materials  (e.g. pancreatic enzymes), organic syntheses that are more eco-efcient, and production of anti- u vaccines on cell cultures that avoid using millions of eggs as a substrate.   Apart from the internal innovation programs (see Investors chapter), fora on sustainable  development have been started with some of our customers, notably plastics converters.  The idea is to assess together the desirability of pursuing certain potential developments. SolVin  holds a competition every three years to award Innovation prizes rewarding innovative and  sustainable applications for vinyl products. The 2007 prizes awarded by SolVin, a Solvay-BASF  joint venture producing vinyl products, provided special recognition of four advances: the new  extrusion technology of Technoplast Kunststofftechnik of Austria, resulting in energy savings of  up to 80%; the very large window frames offered by Inoutic of Germany, allowing integration  of complex insulation technologies; a system using PVC components, developed by Mario  Scheichenbauer, which, following installation on a construction site, enables the steel framework  to be put in place and then injected with concrete; and the special recycling prize, awarded to  Ceplastik of Spain, recognizing the use of PVC recycled through use of the Vinyloop process as  oor-covering products  Anti-u vaccines: innovative and sustainable packaging receives recognition  In 2007, Solvay Pharmaceuticals in Olst (Netherlands) was  awarded a silver medal for its new packaging for the anti-u  vaccine INFLUVAC. The jury rewarded a new syringe-packaging  technology that is quick and efcient.  The packaging is completely recyclable and its reduced size  saves space and energy, while reducing the CO2 emissions  associated with transport and with having to be kept in cold  storage. Opening the packaging is easy, and it is possible to  detect whether it has already been opened.  Targets for 2012   Organizing, with representatives from our markets, fora to share information on the  challenges presented by sustainability and, in the pharmaceutical eld, holding a  meeting each year that brings together stakeholders from both Europe and the United  States.   Developing partnerships with our customers and our markets, to anticipate  developments relating to sustainability. Improving products in collaboration with customers,  so as to meet new sustainability requirements 1 46  The pharmacovigilance program to ensure a swift reaction to help patients in the event of a pharmaceutical  safety problem  The USAs Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has awarded  Solvay Pharmaceuticals recognition for the companys  exceptional performance in implementing the portal for  electronic submission to FDA via the Internet of statutory  information. This provides conrmation of the progress that  Solvay Pharmaceuticals has made in submitting reports on the  adverse side-effects indicated by patients when they have taken  medicinal products.  The result is less paperwork, improvements in safety and security,  and improved compliance with procedures. Back in 2004, Solvay  Pharmaceuticals was one of the rst to move to electronic  reporting of pharmacovigilance information to the FDA in the  United States and to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). Pharmacovigilance is the monitoring of safety data to ensure ideal  use of medicinal products. It depends on recording, evaluating  and reporting on possible side-effects associated with taking  medicines. In order to meet the growing requirements in relation  to pharmacovigilance, Solvay Pharmaceuticals has entered into a  strategic partnership with an external organization.  The commitment to quality and high performance implied by the Solvay Performance  Model reference applies to all the Groups activities, apart from joint ventures, whether the  activities are carried out by Strategic Business Units, Competence Centres or production units. It  has been validated at the highest level of the Group and is characterized by a drive for continuous  improvement, based on self-assessment and sharing of good practice, meaning the comparison of  existing practices with the best (benchmarking). Our performance-analysis procedures are aimed at providing products and services that  meet our customers expectations, doing it efciently and by introducing improvements to our   management systems. This involves continuous improvement of our policies, targets, procedures  and organizational arrangements, from manufacture all the way to sale of the products. PipeLife  and Inergy Automotive Systems joint ventures have their own approaches for ensuring quality. All the products are manufactured in plants meeting relevant standards and the requirements  of regulations. They also comply with rules applying to the particular market: ISO 9001, Hazard  Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), and in the case of medicinal products Good  Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The great majority of our plants (> 95 %) have received certication or accreditation relating  to quality from independent and recognized bodies. When the latest acquired plants – those of  Solvay Advanced Polymers, Solexis and ex-Fournier – were integrated into the Group, they were  made the subject of action programs for quality. The Devnya (Bulgaria) soda ash production plant,  acquired in 1997, has now received ISO 9001 certication  Targets for 2012   Bringing operations acquired by the Group up to Solvay standards of excellence.

Obtaining supplementary knowledge of the conditions under which our products  are used, so as to assess any associated risks.   Assessing the environmental risks associated with their excretion by patients in  domestic wastewater, for all of our pharmaceutical products.  Nearly 600 chemicals, 4 000 polymers, and pharmaceutical products manufactured by the  Group are covered by Solvays policy on product knowledge and risk control in relation to their  applications. The policy takes account of the results from international risk-evaluation programs  and relevant legislation.  The High Product Volume (HPV) worldwide voluntary assessment program of the International  Chamber of Chemical Associations (ICCA) relates to 60 substances produced by Solvay. The  program covers some 1 000 substances in total, whose worldwide production exceeds 1 000  tonnes a year. Solvay is coordinating studies for 16 of them. There are also 19 substances produced by Solvay – either new or existing products, notably  biocides – that have been studied in relation to EU regulations. In addition, associations such  as AISE (for detergents in Europe), CEFIC (for the European chemical sector), PlasticEurope and  Euro Chlor (for chlorine and derivatives, and caustic soda) carry out assessments of risks associa- ted with the use of relevant products.  Over 300 pre-registration dossiers have been submitted for the Group, in connection with  the European Unions REACH Regulation. The REACH Regulation also covers articles (nished  products) when they contain hazardous substances above specic threshold concentrations. In that  case, notication to the European Agency of those substances is required.  Products manufactured  outside the EU exclusively for non EU markets are not covered by the REACH regulation.  The Group has established a worldwide organization in order to full each of the REACH  obligations for all the products and their applications, and for all the activities relating to  production, import, marketing and use. The arrangements will also check on the future availability  of products that are bought in. There is, indeed, the risk of a supplier choosing not to register a  substance that is essential to one of our production activities, for example, simply because of the  cost of the procedure relative to the income obtained from selling the substance  Products that are well documented  and that comply with regulations  3 (*) Ecoprole : inventory of emissions into the envirronment associated with raw materials and manufacturing 48  The EUs REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation  of Chemicals) Regulation The Regulation was adopted by the European Union in late 2006 and it introduced a new system for  managing chemicals. This will, by the end of a transitional period, supplement or replace the previous  40 or so directives and regulations that relate to chemicals. There are internal global organization to manage the Solvay program in this area, relating to both our  own products that need to be documented and registered, and bought-in materials for which future  availability depends on registration by their producers.  By the end of 2008, our products will have been pre-registered, in compliance with the new  requirements for all substances marketed within the EU before 1981 and of which over one tonne a year  is either manufactured or imported. A comprehensive registration dossier including an assessment of  risks to health or to the environment, together with production data and a list of the various conditions in  which the substance is used, will then be submitted to the European Chemicals Agency in accordance  with a timetable related to the substances intrinsic properties and the volumes marketed.  Some substances, because of their particularly hazardous intrinsic properties (carcinogens,  mutagens and substances that are toxic to reproduction), or because of major risks associated with  their use, may require authorization. In order to obtain an authorization, the applicant will have to  show that the substance has signicant social or economic advantages, or that its use is limited to  specic professional uses, and that the risks associated with the substances production and uses  are sufciently controlled. Replacements for these substances will progressively have to be found  wherever this is technically and economically possible.  Within Euro Chlor, the European association of chlorinated products pro- ducers, a program to assess risks to health and to the environment that  are associated with 29 chlorinated organic compounds is currently being  nalized. www.eurochlor.org   Environmental impact assessments now required for new  pharmaceutical products  Pharmaceutical products taken by patients tend to end up in domestic waste water. While urban  sewage works eliminate the largest part, very low concentrations of some drugs are found in  surface water, and they have been detected in drinking water in some regions. This question of  environmental impact is complex, and both the United States and the European Union now impose  obligations relating to the procedures for putting new medicinal products on the market. Guidance  documents have been published, and new recommendations are expected. Going beyond what is prescribed by the regulations, Solvay Pharmaceuticals is going to carry out  assessments of environmental impact for all the companys products, including those already on the  market, and has planned appropriate studies for the coming years.   Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  REACH and our customers in the plastics industry For Walter Claes,   Health and Safety Director  of EuPC*, the EUs REACH  Regulation for chemicals  needs to be demystied; this  is a perfectly manageable  challenge. The 50,000  plastics-converting  rms represented by his  organization, most of which  are SMEs, have up a list of substances they use at any stage  in the production sequence.  The spirit of REACH then requires that they communicate  effectively both within each rm and outside, including both  customers and suppliers. All the departments involved need  to be properly informed about what they have to do, and  they need to act in a coordinated manner, he says.   Walter Claes is convinced that ensuring better health  protection and limiting the environmental impact of the  substances and preparations manufactured or imported will,  in the long term, benet the whole European industry. (*) EuPC is the European association of plastics converters, bringing  together national and sectoral federations in that industry.

These documents are supplied automatically with the rst delivery and following an update. Solvay  also supplies a safety data sheet for many products that are not classied as hazardous, such as  our polymer resins. SACHEM (SAfety of ChEMicals) is an integrated information system project for our products.  It is based on a central database assisting compliance with the regulations. The system ensures  consistency worldwide of the information on our products, notably through the production of safety  data sheets according with legal requirements, bringing together systematically all the legally  required information on each products hazardous properties and the risks associated with its use. This covers the requirements as from 2007 for transport, then for installations involving major risks  (called Seveso in the EU), for worker protection, and for waste products. SACHEM will meet the  requirements of the Globally Harmonized System of classication and labeling of chemicals, which will progressively result worldwide in changes to all the relevant existing laws. Solvay has a program operating worldwide to provide support to our customers for hazar- dous products, aimed at achieving product safety at every stage, and going beyond the infor- mation strictly required by the regulations. Product Stewardship involves the players at all stages  along the sequence, including transport rms, distributors and users. For some products that are  particularly difcult to use, and for which risk control is essential to avoid a dangerous situation,  specic training or advice is provided. Such collaborative action between producers and users  gives concrete expression to the shared responsibility for complete safety. For pharmaceuticals, the information on products and their risks and how this is communicated is  covererd by specic regulation and is strictly controlled. Laws now increasingly require environmental impact statements for new medicinal products,  and this will inuence the risk/benet ratio attributed to them (see box). Compliance with  future regulations, and the transparency demanded of clinical trials, will necessitate increased  communication with patient groups, governmental authorities and the healthcare bodies  Strategy   Developing an integrated system to compile dossiers  on properties and risks and draw up comprehensive  and reliable safety data sheets.

The large-volume production of  essential  chemicals is usually located close to  the source of raw materials, apart from oil-derived raw materials. The largest industrial  complexes are also often highly integrated, which avoids the need for transport, with recycling  for materials such as water and by-products, and energy conservation measures, in a  perspective of industrial ecology.    In addition, a signi cant part of the raw materials that we use in large quantities – notably  ethylene, and salt in the form of brine – are supplied by pipelines. Our new integrated industrial complexes established close to locations where the   nished products are used by our customers are helping to further limit the transport  of hazardous materials: the new hydrogen peroxide plants in Antwerp (Belgium) – with a  capacity of 230kt/y - and in Thailand – 330kt/y, are both immediately adjacent to customers  installations, the future PVC plants in Russia – with a capacity of 330kt/y - will produce its own  vinyl chloride. Solvay transports large quantities of  nished products – over 10 million tonnes a year  in Europe – of which about half are classi ed by transport regulations as hazardous: mainly  hydrogen peroxide, caustic soda, sodium hypochlorite, peracetic acid, hydrogen  uoride,  chlorinated solvents, allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, etc. Following the signi cant reduction in the transport of chlorine and vinyl chloride in  recent years, new programs are under way to further improve the safety of hydrogen peroxide  transport, and to reduce the transport of anhydrous hydrogen  uoride by a further 30%. Most of the transport of raw materials and  nished products is subcontracted. SQAS  (Safety & Quality Assessment System) audits for logistics service providers and chemical  distributors are being developed rapidly in Europe for road transport, storage and  distribution suppliers. They are now being extended to China, through the Association of  International Chemical Manufacturers (AICM). There is an international service – Carechem24 – usable from any country for obtaining  telephone assistance in the event of an accident or other incident with our products. The  services experts can provide advice without delay in the appropriate language, saying  what action should be taken, based on Solvay documents. Our initial agreement with  Carechem 24 (2001) covered 34 countries, and recent developments including collaboration  with the United StatesChemtrec system have enabled the service to provide worldwide  coverage. In addition, our plants participate in the various countries plans for handling chemical  emergencies.  Such plans are operational in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy,  the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Great Britain and the United States  During the period 2004-2007, there were,  regrettably, nine signi cant transport accidents.   Four were classi edserious (having resulted in serious injuries,  closure of a major communication route, evacuation of premises, or  signi cant loss of the product transported):    (USA);  road accident (Spain);  (Italy).   Targets for 2012  Applying audit and selection systems to 100% of providers of logistical services for the  dangerous products to the Group.  Monitoring to ensure the application of the most rigorous standards and wherever  possible reducing the transport of very hazardous substances.  Providing to the Group the drivers with speci c training in the case of self-loading.  Generalizing the reporting of distribution accident and of corrective actions throughout  the Group, and introducing a Solvay indicator for transport accidents.

The Vinyl 2010 annual reports show  that the targets set for the year 2010 are being achieved:     and releases into the environment from PVC production;  achieved) or lead-based: by 15% in 2005 (achieved), 50%  in 2010 and 100% in 2015;  the PVC products life, independent of the recycling targets  imposed by other EU Directives (on electronic waste or  packaging): 149 000 tonnes recycled in 2007;  in less-developed countries form part of the voluntary  commitment; there is a monitoring committee to check  on progress. This committee includes representatives of  the European Parliament and the Commission, NGOs and  independent experts.   www.vinyl2010.org The Ferrara (Italy) industrial recycling unit for PVC, using the VINYLOOP process developed  by Solvay, has been operating since 2001, and has a capacity of 10,000 tonnes a year. It makes  use of PVC-based composites, and recycles the PVC by separating it from the other constituents  by a process of selective dissolution. There is a second unit under construction at the same site,  built with Ferrari Textiles, and intended for recycling of PVC-coated textiles, using the TEXYLOOP  process. Another unit with an annual capacity of 20,000 tonnes has recently been built at Kobe  (Japan).  At Frankfurt (Germany), Solvay has a unit for reprocessing CFCs and HCFCs, of which tens  of thousands of tonnes are still in use in the world, when they come to the end of their life. The  hydro uoric and hydrochloric acids recovered are recycled. Operating licences for the technology  to destroy HFCs (see page 34), which was developed with SGL Carbon, have been granted for sites  in India and Argentina. These two projects could reduce emissions by the equivalent of 5 million  tonnes of CO2 per year.     The SF6-ReUse recycling programme implemented in Europe in collaboration with the  companies Linde and Dilo has been extended to the United States. The high potential  greenhouse effect of sulphur hexa uoride (SF6), an insulating gas essential to the safety of high- and  medium-voltage electrical installations, make this another substance that must be recovered and  recycled at the end of its life, and it is sent to our recycling plant at Bad Wimpfen, in Germany. A  similar programme is under consideration for Asia. The SF6-ReUse concept forms part of a voluntary  programme enabling the industry concerned to reduce emissions to an absolute minimum.    A process for recycling polyethylene fuel tanks, which now account for over 50% of vehicle  tanks worldwide, has been developed by Inergy Automotive Systems, a joint venture between  Solvay and Plastic Omnium, supported by a vehicle manufacturer and the European Union.  Following recovery of the polymer, it can be used as the starting material for new fuel tanks.  However, the establishment of industrial arrangements to collect the old tanks faces competition  from other possible arrangements for the disposal of vehicle parts – land ll and incineration – which  are at present more cost-effective but less sustainable   Targets for 2012   Helping achieve the Vinyl 2010 target for PVC recycling  in Europe (200,000 tonnes a year).     Developing a partnership with a major customer for  recycling of the polymer PVDC, based on VINYLOOP  recycling technology.   Offering an SF6 recycling service also to our customers  in the Asian market.  Strategy   Developing recycling processes, particularly for plastic  products and  uorinated gases.  Encouraging the establishment of regional and national  arrangements for collection and recycling.  Recycling,  and management of product lifecycles  6 Via notably the www. garoo.org website, Solvay Fluor is tightly associated with the  initiatives aiming at helping the customers to respect the European Regulation  adopted in 2006 to minimize the emissions of HFC which behave as greenhouse  gases when they are emitted.  A refrigeration application among the others subjected to these constraints: the  wine industry which uses coolers to control the temperature of fermentation in wine  making vats. 52  Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  Up for discussion  Solvay has already contributed to numerous high- performing industrial recycling solutions, but it is never a  simple matter. In order for viable industrial schemes to be  established, a variety of interdependent conditions must  be ful lled, starting with the existence of a raw material  source formed by effective collection of material at the  end of its useful life.   Another essential condition is that holders of the now- useless material must be faced with high costs for its  disposal in land ll, or very simply a prohibition on such  disposal, as in Germany. Unfortunately, it is still possible  to dispose of materials in certain land lls in Europe at 50 euros a tonne! This  makes it dif cult to operate recycling arrangements worthy of the name.   We must add that large quantities of plastics waste are sent to countries  where the costs of labor – and of sorting – are low. This is the case in China  and the Philippines with, for instance, electrical cables being taken apart  by hand in China. From our perspective, these exports result in a dearth of  material to recycle.  When it comes to recycling, we could be faced with another problem. If  applied literally, the REACH Directive on chemicals requires each substance  in a mixture to be identi ed. When you are trying to recycle materials designed  and sold years ago, there is simply no cost-effective way of doing that.  In addition, each player in a recycling sequence entirely depends on  whomever is buying the recycled material. That is why our technology for  recycling vehicle fuel tanks has been on the back burner for  ve years. The  European motor-vehicle industry is for the moment in the reverse situation:  crushing whole cars and then sorting out what can be recycled, rather than  separating out each major component by dismantling. The industry has good  reasons, of course: nowadays, vehicles being disposed of were in many  cases built in the early 1990s, when people did not contemplate dismantling.  We will therefore have to wait. In 2015, the EU will require 85% recycling –  and including the recycling of plastics will be the only way to achieve that.  We should remember that a producer of tarpaulins, cables or other somewhat  technical equipment tends to require recycled resins to meet speci cations  as tight as for virgin resins. That is, inevitably, impossible. The necessary  adjustments and the changes in mindset are not things we can attack  alone.  Helmuth Leitner  Environment Manager for the Plastics Sector Recycling is no easy matter:  having sophisticated technology is not enough.

Wrapped with a polyethylene foil, made of recycled materials, the STORMBOX permits the storage and recycling of the collected water for other uses. Products to disinfect urban waste water without producing undesirable by-products The reuse of urban waste water often comes up against  the problem of bacteriological contamination, which either limits or completely prevents recycling of the water for agricultural  irrigation. The issue is all the more acute in that water shortages affect regions where the high temperatures in certain seasons encourage bacterial proliferation. For a number of years, treatment with peracetic acid OXYSTRONG has been carried out in the city of Milan, opening the way to effective disinfection. The process is based on a chemical treatment that does not leave any  residues, as the product rapidly decomposes. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently gave approval  for peracetic acid to be used for such purposes. This gentle disinfection  technique is already used widely in the agricultural and food processing  industries, in dairy and in fish farming, particularly in  the Scandinavian countries. 54  The products of Solvay are at the root of technological innovation and services  directly helping to reduce the ecological footprint of human activities.  A few examples are proposed.  Technical applications for a diesel  engine with no emissions of particulate matter or of nitrogen oxides (N0x)  Our Inergy Automotive Systems joint venture is working on technologies for a clean diesel engine that does not release  particulate matter, nor produce emissions of nitrogen oxides.  Compared with a gasoline engine, a diesel engine releases little CO2, but  produces fine particles and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are harmful to health and environment. Inergy Automotive Systems has developed the DINOX system, involving on-board storage and injection into the exhaust gases of a urea-based additive which ensures the selective reduction of NOx. Also, the particle filter that stops fine dust can be regenerated by combustion in the filter itself once an additive, produced by Rhodia, is added to the fuel. Inergy has developed a storage system, and a high-pressure pump able to automati- cally inject minute quantities of the concentrated additive each time the tank is filled with diesel fuel. A process for treating contaminated sediments, from the banks of the Meuse river  to the industrial port in Venices lagoon NOVOSOL, a process recently developed by Solvay for stabilizing contaminated sediments, provides a way of reusing the material, providing an incentive to dredge waterways that have been contaminated, and hence encouraging river transport.  When waterways and port areas silt up, this hinders river traffic and can increase the risk of flooding at times of high water, even endangering reserves of drinking water. Dredging the sediment is practical only if it can be reused or if it can be put into landfill. Often, however, the sediments load of pollutants - from industrial, urban and agricultural effluents - makes both those possibilities impractical. Treating the contamination requires appropriate techniques, which up to now have been too costly. The Venice Region and the Wallon (Belgium) waterways will be the first to take benefit from this technology. Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  55  Respecting our employees  and developing their skills  Common ethical commitment, based on shared values Safe and fair working conditions Multidisciplinarity, partnerships, skills relevant to Sustainable Development Creativity and innovation  Control of risks   It is important  for the same view  of Sustainable  Development to  be shared by the  European Works  Council, the  management  and employees  at all levels. The situation as seen by an employee Each staff member must have sustainable development in mind in his  daily life. My role as a union representative is to emphasise practical  means of ensuring sustainability for the workers: by giving contractual  recognition to the value of each employees occupational attainments,  ensuring working conditions free of health risks, etc. What I expect of Solvay is that its initiatives in this area are really  implemented. Everyone must be involved: management, employees,  Competence Centres, Business Support Centres, production sites,  etc. The long term must be at the heart of the employee  behavior in  everyday activities. The management, meanwhile, must adopt a new  attitude, not concentrating solely on costs and having a short-term  perspective. The workers and the employees have many skills, but not enough use  is made of them for the purposes of sustainable development. It is  therefore important for the same view to be shared by the European  Works Council, management and employees at all levels. People will act from personal conviction, thats certain, but a structure  is needed: it is important that we are given a structured framework,  and that the fear of contact with other people on these matters is  overcome. In the beginning, a sustainable development initiative  involves a domino effect. Thus, you can start with fora, that create  awareness, and then  progressively ensuring a wider attention and a  joint understanding. Communication is therefore absolutely essential.  Our European Works Council is an excellent means of getting to grips  with issues of sustainable development in various countries. As a  member of that council, I stand up for the idea that everyone should  be able to obtain a high-quality job with long-term occupational pros- pects. Up to now, there has not really been an integrated policy to  manage these issues, relating to each member of the employees,  their skills and their long-term employment. It would be useful for  sustainable development to become part of Human Resources acti- vities. Human resources development and sustainable development  should, for instance, be studied together, in a process where the staff  participate at each site.

We want them to reach a safety level comparable to that of Solvay  employees. The Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 18001 management system  has been established at 14 of our sites, and there are plans for it to become general. Health- protection action is being continued, with an intention to detect earlier any problems: before any  pathological signs manifest themselves. We are also taking action on the causes of the main  pathological conditions that still occur: musculo-skeletal disorders and hearing loss.   As part of the reorganization of the Human Resources management, the careers management  is aimed at providing each employee with development experiences aimed at maximizing  everyones productive potential, satisfaction and engagement. Employability is a fundamental  aim, and the establishment of the Solvay Corporate University is aimed at contributing to this  goal.  Solvay is pursuing the outsourcing of less strategic activities, as for example, clinical trials  in the Pharmaceuticals Sector. This implies new abilities internally in building the necessary  partnerships and co-development of projects.   There is an increasing number of initiatives encouraging creativity, innovation and the  involvement of employees in tackling the challenges presented by sustainable development:  fora with the personnel on such development, Science Innovation Days, idea boxes, and  Innovation Trophees events and annual staff appraisals.    58  Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  Each member of the company has his or her own vision regarding Sustainable Development.  These views will contribute to companys progress. Starting from a forum of Solvays  European Works Council held in 2005, a structured process has been launched to encourage  discussion, raise awareness and get the employee to participate in relation to Sustainable  Development. That participative approach is one element de ned in the strategy of the Solvay  Group adopted in this area in 2007. Internal fora with employees of all levels are now starting up.  The intention is to extend them to all countries. They have two purposes: to gradually establish  increased awareness of the challenges facing Solvay, and to encourage the emergence of  proposals for action, both locally and Group-wide, by associating people from all levels of  responsibility and representing the various functions.  Does our life have direction and purpose? It is not for Solvay to reply! Its  ne with  me if there are corporate values in Solvay, but I would not like to think that the walls of  the Groups premises state what the purpose of life is. That has nothing to do with the  company; it is the concern of each of you as individuals.

Employees and subcontractors   59  Strategy  Complying with laws and Solvay guideline values for  chemical, physical and ergonomic risks.   Protecting against risks at their source.  Assessing risks for each workstation, using a reliable  standardized method that allows comparisons between  workstations and between sites. For occupational hygiene, Solvay applies the internationally recognized Threshold Limit  Values (TLVs) devised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, for all  hazardous substances not covered by laws, or for which the legal limit is less stringent than the  reference TLV, or is outdated. In cases where these external reference values do not exist, Solvay  carries out studies in order to decide on a Solvay Acceptable Exposure Limit (SAEL). To ensure compliance with these standards, the emphasis is now put on general adoption in  all entities of a standardized method, the Exposure Assessment Tool (EA Tool), for assessing  all chemical risks at workstations. The EA Tool incorporates the latest international standards, the  chemicals characteristics, the quantities used in each workstation, the operating procedures and  the exposure levels. The information on occupational-hygiene conditions is progressively being  incorporated into the Hygiene module of the new Medexis global information system developed  by Solvay. Two new management indicators relating to compliance of workstations with occupational- hygiene limits have been introduced recently, making it possible to monitor compliance both  locally and worldwide, thus providing better management of worker protection   Targets for 2012   Applying the Hygiene module of Solvays Medexis information system to 80% of  the  workstations in the Group (not including joint-ventures), in view of a uniform  prevention of health risks.

The qualication as occupational disease refers to  medical and administrative criteria that vary from a country to the other one.  If the data relative to the recognized professional diseases indeed allow to  guide a health policy, they only reect partially and often retroactively, thus  late, a sanitary situation. Policies and management tools for health and industrial hygiene (see page 88) Medexis : the way to achieving better health protection    Medexis is a single computerized system that will bring together data on industrial hygiene and medical  monitoring in all of Solvays sites. It is currently at the pilot stage. When combining data, collected in each  individual site, it will become possible, while respecting the rules of protection of personal data to exploit this  information in order    In each country, implementation of the Medexis system will depend on receiving approval from the public  authorities, and on the way in which the national system for health at work is organized.  60  Targets for 2012     Applying the Health module of Solvays Medexis infor- mation system to 70% of the personnel (not including  the United States) with the aim of ensuring a uniform  prevention against  health risks and a uniform medi- cal monitoring throughout the Group.

In particular, this implies preventing stress and all forms of harassment at work.   The application of the rules and principles of occupational hygiene at the workplace form the  fundamentals of our action. Raising individual awareness and organizing training about health risks  are key elements of prevention.  Every member of staff exposed to risks has access to a medical monitoring by an occupational  physician. The Group tries permanently to unify the protocols of medical surveillance at the world  level to ensure an equivalent follow-up in all the entities and concerned countries.  In the event of a health problem being observed that could be of occupational origin, an  investigation is carried out, looking at both the working conditions and the characteristics of the  person affected, leading if necessary to corrective measures being taken. The protection against the chemical risk is ensured by the earliest  possible detection of any  clinical disturbance. Biological analyses are used so as to detect and measure either the possible  penetration of the substance in the body, or its possible biological effects, at a moment where they  are not yet pathological. The emphasis will be put on new ways of identifying health disturbances  even earlier, before there are any manifestations of disease and at the stage where the disturbances  are reversible. With regard to protection against risks, the emphasis is on the main occupational illnesses  still observed : musculo-skeletal disorders and hearing losses. The prevention of hearing disorders  is improving, thanks to action to raise awareness, to the more systematic bearing of the protection  equipments, and the search for comfortable and effective equipment. The campaigns of noise  measurement will be reinforced. Programmes dened to better prevent musculo-skeletal disorders  include technical and organizational improvements.  A Solvay policy to prevent stress and protect against drug addiction has been worked out, and pilot  application of the measures is being undertaken at certain sites. In some cases, the medical action taken can go further than what is strictly work-related  medicine applying to our employees. Such action also contributes to the general overall well- being at work, which the Group considers an important factor for the quality of its activities. Health- promotion campaigns relating to the environment outside work are carried out regularly. Recent  examples were in Spain, on protecting against cardiovascular risk, on vaccinating against inuenza  and viral hepatitis in Thailand and in Brazil, or on general medical check-ups, guarding against  consuming alcohol at work, or organizing a programme against AIDS in Namibia  Determination of risk proles  Medical surveillance throughout the working lives and afterwards   is important from epidemiological and legal standpoints.   We therefore consider it vital to ensure tracing of data related to  health at work for each employee. We aim to introduce, for each employee, a personal logbook  recording exposure to occupational risks, to be included in his/her  health at work le. Traceability of exposure to risk situations will be  constructed on the basis of homogeneous groups exposed to the  same work situations, and will be managed using our EA-Tool. It is  based on a collective approach constructed on job types (Work area). On this basis, company doctors, by combining this information  with other data, will get a better view of the diverse situations  encountered by different workers.  Strategy   Ensuring a uniform level of health protection by  applying a consistent system of medical monitoring  for employees throughout the Group.  Protecting against occupational diseases that are still  observed: primarily musculo-skeletal and auditory  disorders. Prevent stress.  Ensuring medical monitoring of employees adapted  to the individual risk prole of each workstation.  Health protection  2 Employees and subcontractors   61  In 2007, the overall accident frequency rate involving stopping work is 2.4 per million hours  worked (2.1 for the Groups employees). Performance in regard to workers safety is generally  high at the Groups sites, as compared to the sector average.  Measures taken to prevent accidents currently concentrate on risky behavior. From 2003  onwards, action relating to behavioral safety has been taken at a large number of sites.  Each year, additional plants adopt this approach, recent examples being Tavaux (France), Martorell  (Spain), Santo Andr (Brazil) and Povoa (Portugal). The aim is to achieve continuous reductions in  the personal accident frequency rate (TF1) and in the gravity rate, towards zero-accident. Every  month, the Executive Committee ascertains the number of personal accidents for all of the sites.   The information on accidents is now held centrally, facilitating analysis and monitoring, and  making it easier to introduce corrective measures. This system allows for a more formalized  and explicit use of the returns recording experience, recommendations to the plant and business  managers, and regular information through bulletins and the Groups Intranet. The recommendations  take also the form of presentations aimed at particular employee groups, of plant inspection  checklists and of guides of good practice. The recommendations are to be applied at each site,  with the support of the supervisory management of the relevant Strategic Business Units. Group auditors carry out speci c internal audits of health and safety, supplementing the risk  engineering audits, and they result in recommendations for improvement. The sites having these  speci c audits in 2007 were Tver (Russia), Juarez (Mexico), Chevigny, Daix, Fontaine and Giraud  (France), Knsebeck (Germany) and Torrelavega (Spain).  A signi cant improvement has been obtained for the safety of subcontracting  rms  employees working on our sites, with the accident frequency rate having been reduced from  6.0 per million hours worked in 2005 to 3.4 per million hours in 2007. This followed Group  recommendations covering selection, analysis of tasks and of how they are carried out, contracts,  assessments and reporting back to the service-providers.  Strategy   Implementing a culture of safety and pursuing on  objective of zero working accidents.

All new contracts entered into by the  International Purchasing Network include requirements in this area. Compliance with Solvay rules  and instructions is demanded, and is checked on. Already, 80% of the contracts require such  compliance and include a clause relating to the subcontractors suitability for carrying out the tasks.  Also, 45% of our production sites have a program aimed at ensuring that the subcontracting rms  have a policy on health, safety and the environment that is comparable to Solvays.  The Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series OHSAS 18001 management system  has now been established at 19 of the production sites. Various other management systems  are being used in the area of safety: Responsible Care, International Safety Rating System, etc. There is also a new information system allowing centralized monitoring and sharing of  accident follow-up for the whole Group, with descriptions of the accidents and of corrective  measures taken, with a cross-fertilization of actions between sites  Employees and subcontractors   63  Strategy    Ensuring that relationships between employees  are founded on trust, courtesy and mutual respect,  with application of the ve Solvay Group Values:  ethical behavior, empowerment, respect for people,  customer care and teamwork.   Shaping work relationships in accordance with the  new Code of Conduct.  The Groups ve Values underlie all of the processes for Human Resources management,  in recruitment and annual employee appraisals, for example. In late 2007, 80% of the employees  in Europe, NAFTA, Mercosur and Asia had taken part in the internal Living the Values seminar  aimed at encouraging application of the Values and ensuring they are completely adopted by each  person, with interactive workshops in each local language. The participants reacted positively, as is  evidenced by the responses to feedback requests. In the previous year, the internal Solvay People  Survey had shown 80% of the respondents saying they were familiar with the Groups ve Values,  and 56% considered that the Values really lived, 13% holding the opposite opinion.    The new Code of Conduct is being applied to relationships at work. It was updated in 2006  in close collaboration with the employees representatives, and is based on respect for the law,  humanity, loyalty, equity and responsibility. It draws on documents of international renown, such as  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and various  other agreements.  The new Code of Conduct lays down practical and precise rules, and applies to all aspects of  work relationships, including respect for private life, equal opportunities and non-discrimination.  It includes relationships with suppliers and customers, human rights, rights of children and  commercial ethics. Training is provided for each person, to encourage all employees to apply the  Code of Conduct, and violations of the Code can lead to the application of penalties  Targets for 2012     Completing (by 2008) the Living the Values training program.  Applying the Code of Conduct systematically.  Strengthening the legal training of all relevant employees. Practical application  of ethics and Values  4 Anti-competitive practices: learning from the past as a basis  for the future   Solvay activities must comply strictly with the laws in force regarding competition.   The Group expects its employees to scrupulously respect this policy and also the accompanying  recommendations. (excerpt from the Code of Conduct) The Solvay Group has been punished heavily a number of times for participating in the past in  agreements on prices. In 2006, the European Commission ordered seven European producers  of hydrogen peroxide, including Solvay, to pay nes with a total value of 388 million euros. Quite  separately, Solvay had to pay a ne of 35 million euros in the United States. Such situations are  unacceptable and must not, in any circumstances, be allowed to recur. A legal training program  (Online Competition Awareness Program) on the Intranet gives Group employees access to practical  lines of behavior in order to avoid engaging in illegal practices. The Legal Affairs Competence  Centres has designated Compliance Sponsors in each of the Regions. In 2007, the Executive Committee adopted a plan (One Group, One Code, One  Path) for all members of the personnel to be trained in the Code of Conduct.

Living Solvay Values I believe the Solvay Group values are Lived – Solvay People Survey, 2006 Over 20,000 employees answered the Solvay People Survey 2006,  representing 78% of the personnel    Yes         No opinion         No 13 56 31 64  Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  The Group applies its non-discrimination policy - covering race, sex, religious convic- tions, nationality and opinions - universally. Recruitment is on the basis of the candidates  skills and abilities. Each employee is remunerated according to that persons responsibilities and conditions  in the local market. For supervisory staff, there has been a comprehensive classication  into job families since 2004. Use of these families enables a more focused management  of human resources. This approach makes clear the functions involved in each occupation by  relating it to its key tasks and responsibilities, and also to the skills and abilities required. The  existence of career ladders linked to job families ensures transparency for all the supervisory  staff, and greater internal equity.  These career ladders are validated using the Hay method of job  evaluation, which makes possible comparisons with the market. These systems apply to all Sol- vay staff members, including those in joint ventures where Solvay owns the controlling majority. In addition, comparative studies (benchmarks) are carried out in the employment markets  to ensure that the Group is an attractive employer, while remaining competitive. The comparative  studies relate to both the levels of the jobs and the total remuneration associated with them. Female employees account for 10% of the total personnel in the Group. The proportion of  managerial posts (supervisory staff) held by women is also 10%. Solvay takes care to ensure that all employees have access to possibilities for lifelong  education and training, whatever their age  Targets for 2012    Providing each employee with information on his or her total remuneration pac- kage and on his or her position relative to the relevant market.  Increasing cultural diversity wherever possible in recruitment, and in the levels with  greatest responsibility.   Encouraging the employment of older employees, following a detailed study. Strategy   Throughout the Group, xing remuneration based  on objective and fair systems (such as the Hay sys- tem), thus ensuring the total payment is related to the  content of each job.    Ensuring equitable career development for each oc- cupational category, based on a skills dictionary and  clearly described families of jobs.   Applying rules set by the Code of Conduct for non-dis- crimination and equitable treatment.  Appraise how the employees perceive the policy of  non-discrimination and equitable treatment.  Equity, diversity  and non-discrimination 5 Career management Solvay undertakes to offer everyone a sequence of development  experiences that will maximize their potential in terms of  productivity, satisfaction and engagement. This approach applies  even when development does not necessarily mean promotion, to  ensure that each employee is motivated, encouraged and given  every opportunity to use his or her talents.   Career management includes consideration of the present and  future needs for Solvay activities, and also of the employees  aspirations. This is done through two distinct procedures:  succession planning and career development.   Career management is linked with workforce planning,  performance and development appraisal, training, development  of key competencies and adherence to the Group Values.   Employability is another fundamental objective in the policy for  training and development. This is aimed at facilitating internal or  external redeployment in the event of a business upheaval, and  avoiding the need for early retirement. Respect and Fairness I am treated with respect and fairness – % of the personnel   in Solvay People Survey, 2006 (covering 78% of the personnel)   Yes         No opinion         No 12 72 16 Employees and subcontractors   65  Strategy   Applying policies on Human Resources similar in all  our management units.  Applying the general policy of Growing our People to  Grow our Group, through six speci c policies. Human Resources management has embarked on an episode of major transformation gui- ded by the simple principle of Growing our People to Grow our Group. This perspective is unders- cored by formal policies in the areas of: - organizational performance management; - personnel and competence planning ; - recruitment; - training and development;  - career management;  The Renaissance plan aims at enabling this transformation to be carried out ef ciently and  cost-effectively, and the process will last until 2010. It will implement all the above mentioned  policies and ensure they are compatible, drawing on an integrated management system, and the  Connect IT system will be common to all. With regard to organizational performance management, the Group is making use of a  network of experts (Business Performance Improvement Managers) who provide their expertise  as facilitators. It is also supplying appropriate methods to help the managers improve management  processes at all levels (sites, Strategic Business Units, Sectors, Functional Directions, etc.)  Targets for 2012     Strengthening employee engagement to the company and the way it operates at its  current high level (  75%) as measured by Solvay People Surveys.  Carrying out the program to reorganize the main Human Resources management pro- cesses ( Renaissance ), and establishing an integrated data-management system  (2010).

Identifying Human Resources (HR) needs, in terms of  both quality and quantity.  3.  Providing all supervisory staff with training through the  Solvay Corporate University.  4.  Ensuring all the supervisory staff use the HR tools  and models.  5.  Managing HR processes and using a single informa- tion-management system.  6.

The child will learn something of  another culture and of a new language. YES ! is intended to  give practical effect to the Groups multicultural character in  an occupational and family setting.  66  Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  With respect to industrial and social relations, dialogue comes within the scope of the  collective employee representations, wherever such representation exists as a response to  national laws, and where our employees have designated their representatives. While such dialogue  is considered fundamental, particularly with regard to thoughts on the companys continued  existence and performance in the context of overall Sustainable Development, it is not Solvays role  to organize collective employee representation going beyond legal prescriptions. It should be noted  that, up to now, Solvay is not involved in any dispute relating to the right of association. Freedom of  association is intrinsic to the Groups Values. It may be mentioned that the employee turnover rate  in the Solvay Group is particularly low.  A very active European Works Council has been operating since 1996, in application of a  European Union Directive. In collaboration with the Groups Management, this drew up a rst  Charter relating to employee health and safety, a second Charter concerning guidelines on social  policy in joint ventures, and a third Charter dening rules of practice in relation to subcontracting.  The European Works Councils permanent working group on Sustainable Development  started operating in 2005. It enters into discussions with Group management on such matters.    At the request of customers, the pharmaceutical production sites at Weesp and Olst (in the  Netherlands) carried out their own assessments in 2004, using a social responsibility schedule  reecting guidelines (OECD, UNO and ILO) recommending how multinational companies should  conduct themselves.   Solvay devotes considerable resources to managing restructuring. There is nancial compensation,  accompanied by internal mobility programs, outplacement services and retraining courses.  In recent years, restructuring has mainly concerned the 2005 sale of our polyolens   activities in Europe and of the industrial (plastic) sheets business to Renolit, closure  and conversion of the production facilities at Ebensee (in Austria) and acquisition of the  pharmaceutical company Fournier in 2006. There has also been the recent restructuring of  our uorinated products activities, as a response to competition from emerging countries and  regulatory restrictions on these products. Everything possible is done to minimize adverse  social effects, including early retirements and reassignments of staff to different jobs or different  sites. Each situation is handled on an individual basis  Targets for 2012    Strengthening the quality of social dialogue with the employees and their repre- sentatives.  Monitoring the improvements decided on following the 2006 Solvay People Survey,  and carrying out another survey in 2008-2009. Strategy   Seeking dialogue with the employees, and being ho- nest and transparent in discussions with personnel  representatives.   When activities are being restructured, encouraging  internal reallocation; carrying out mass redundancies  only when accompanied by a compensation plan;  making use of early retirement as a last resort.   In our dealings with subcontractors, complying with  the Code of Conduct and the Charter in this area.    Industrial relations  and the management of restructuring 7 Solvay People Survey: a worldwide opinion survey carried out among  all the employees In November 2006, the third Solvay People Survey was carried out, assessing employees (all  personnel in consolidated Group companies) opinions on working conditions, to create the basis for  a continuous improvement process. Over 20,000 members of staff (nearly 78%) replied, which is six percentage points higher than  in 2003. The response rate exceeded 90% at over 40 sites, which constitutes much higher  participation than found in similar international surveys. All the management units communicated  the results to their own personnel and worked out their own improvement plans. The improvement  proposals were consolidated, and their implementation is being monitored.

Including sustainability criteria in innovation processes.  Encouraging the emergence, at each level of the  Group, of a view of Sustainable development deri- ved from discussions with the various stakeholders,  and encouraging a creative approach through fora to  share views.   The program to make aware of the growing requirements in relation to products and practi- ces that are more sustainable will shape the innovation programs. The Groups managers and  employees, together with external stakeholders, are those who drive innovation. Line managers,  are responsible for ensuring that the challenges of sustainable development are taken into account,  and that attitudes and behavior develop accordingly.  There is a Sustainable Development Steering Committee to support this process, suggesting  methods and encouraging implementation. The rst internal fora to raise awareness of sustainable  development were convened in 2007, following the rst seminar on this subject organized in 2005  by the European Works Council (see page 59). They aimed at establishing a shared view that has  long-term validity in these areas.  Internal abilities relating to social, economic and environmental management will provide the  foundations for the new Sustainable Development strategy. There are 250 people coordinating  the management of health, safety and environment issues, liaising with the relevant Competence  Center on these questions. We rely also on the internal abilities in process engineering, to develop  safer and more (eco)efcient production processes. This has produced processes that are more  sustainable, with production accompanied by recycling (for PVC and uorinated products,  etc.), heat-and-electricity cogeneration units, the use of biomass, and environmentally friendly  technologies such as the NOVOSOL process for treating polluted sediments (see page 55).

Third Solvay Science for Innovation conference  One of the fundamental aims of Science for Innovation is to increase the number of contacts and  opportunities for synergy between Solvays internal and external scientists, and to develop networks  of InnoCentive-type involving all the Groups Sectors. The 2007 conference was devoted to Building  up complex materials: from nanoscale to end-use properties, with Professor Jean-Marie Lehn, Nobel  laureate in Chemistry 1987, and Robert B. Laughlin, Nobel laureate in Physics 1998. The conference  drew over 150 high-level experts and researchers working for the Group in Europe, the United States  and Asia, together with about 30 representatives of the international scientic community.  The Science for Innovation program stresses the interactive nature of science, using numerous  practical exercises linked to a specic problem or more general issue.  Involvement in Innovation I am encouraged to be innovative in my job.  % of the staff in Solvay People Survey, 2006  (covering 78% of the staff)   Yes        No opinion         No 13 67 20 Mean number of ideas per person introduced by the employees into the ideas boxes 2003 0,57 2004 0,56 2005 0,69 2006 0,73 Assessing innovative approaches: the Score Card  used in each entity This card brings together the key indicators that provide an  overview of achievements in meeting innovation objectives. In  particular, the Score Card takes account of the extent of employee  participation in innovation projects and the proportion of projects  carried out in collaboration with external partners, which is a key  component of the Sustainable Development strategy.     Innoplace, managing creativity through  a set of 127 interconnected ideas boxes Innoplace, Solvays tool for managing innovative ideas from all  over the world, won the best Intranet prize in 2006 in France,   in the e-Learning and Knowledge Management category, against  46 competing initiatives presented by large companies and  other organizations such as Airbus, EADS, BNP and Caisse des  Dpts. The October 2006 Prize ceremony was organized by  CEGOS, Entreprises & Carrires and Les Echos (France). Innoplace in the beginning of 2008 contained about 50 000 ideas. 68  Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  Up for discussion  Our markets will be different tomorrow. We will be familiar with sources  of motive power that are much more ef cient than the internal combustion  engine, and with revolutionary forms of lighting and printed display  screens. Technological  rms can no longer content themselves with just  being suppliers of materials. Solvay cannot restrict itself to the products  that made its fortune in the past and that are still doing so today. We  need to make some clean breaks, get out of our old habits, reorganize  our internal sources of expertise, and supplement them with contributions  from outside. We can therefore no longer just occupy our own niches in a  logistical sequence, however well it is performing.  All of this calls for a change of direction. It is for each employee to feed into the system  at that persons own level; to get involved by acquiring training and information. In other  words, each person needs to think, and to be prepared to act differently, changing habits,  becoming committed, and being prepared to take more risks – calculated ones! - in the  course of work.  This has already happened in the pharmaceutical sphere, being the price  to pay for added value. And it is a narrow road, where we need to turn more in the direction  of our customers, discover their unvarying needs over the long term, and provide usable  technological solutions. Agreeing to test 10 ideas and then, with no implication of failure, selecting just one,  constitutes another cultural revolution. This innovation culture demands more than a  abby  consensus based on habits. It requires that we are ready for a clean technological break, and  it requires leaders. In this sense, present circumstances are de nitely inviting us to be part of  a revolution. It is also a positive and fascinating challenge. Lopold Demiddeleer,  Manager of the Future Businesses Competence Centre.   Innovation as a break with the past  and a taste for risk! Solvay Corporate University Linking across the various organizational structures or regions, the  Solvay Corporate University is a new institution aimed at supervisory  staff training and development throughout the Group. The Solvay  Corporate University aims at reinforcing the key skills and abilities that  are necessary at a given stage of a career, reinforcing the competence  in strategic areas, and assisting a shared approach to the Groups  strategy, Vision and Values. Ultimately, there will be a new instrument to monitor and quantify the  effectiveness of this lifelong-learning initiative. The Corporate Universitys Leadership Pipeline is a fundamental  stimulant to Solvays corporate culture; it is based on the idea that  there are latent managerial capabilities within the Group that can  be exploited provided that the individuals are given appropriate  preparation to develop their skills. The Leadership Pipeline comprises   ve levels of training – Applying, Implementing, Developing,  Integrating and Changing – corresponding to the fundamental stages  in a managers career. Another important function of the Solvay  Corporate University will be to familiarize new recruits to the Group,  and executives in companies acquired, with Solvays managerial  practices and leadership style. It will be an important factor in  attracting and recruiting new employees, and retaining them over the  long term.  Employees and subcontractors   69  Achievements of social utility  Humanitarian shelters  for difficult climates PVC has undoubted physical and sanitary qualities. This pair of observations has produced shelters, called SheltEasy,  for crisis situations.  A team led by Philippe Bourgain of the Build Valley company, together with Solvay and SolVin, and the plastics processing company Maine Plastiques developed these lightweight emergency shelters for use in difficult climatic conditions. Their design means they can be used for longer, meeting needs for which tents, the usual shelters in emergencies, are not well suited, to house family groups of four to six people, and providing them with latrines and showers. They are lightweight, easy to erect and dismantle, come at an acceptable cost, and have the further advantage of being self-supporting. The SheltUP (19m2) and the sanitary cabin easyCAB (1m2), have been tested in real- world conditions, in the Sudan and Chad by renowned NGOs. The industrial production is in place, and marketing started in July 2008. www.easy-shelt.com A revolutionary treatment that  improves the quality of life  for Parkinsons patients DUODOPA is a levodopa-carbidopa combination making it possible to treat Parkinsons disease at a late stage A unique delivery system, with a programmable pump allows both the physician and the patient to individually fine-tune the delivery of active  ingredients, suspended in a stable gel, from a cassette worn outside the body. Parkinsons affects both men and women and, among the neurodegenerative  disorders, is second only to Alzheimers disease in the number of cases, with more than 1 million patients suffering from it in each of the most major countries. I was busy all day keeping track of which pill I had to take when. Some I had to take every four hours, others every two hours.  I am getting some freedom back into my life! Simon Hulzebos (aged 66)  from Sittard suffers from Parkinsons disease. 70  The Solvay groups activities present opportunities to improve living or working  conditions, to help people in difficulty or to contribute to initiatives that benefit  the environment. Here are some examples. A highly eco-friendly building for Solvay Italias head office With a floor area of 2,760 m2 on three floors, and including offices, meeting rooms and a roof garden, the new building makes use of a range of cutting-edge technologies.  The aesthetics mirrors its energy-conscious design.  The building has a steel-based construction using a "blue wall" system: double glazing combined with a vinyl skin positioned 80 cm from the outside wall;  this ensures the cooling by convection in the summer and the heating by a greenhouse effect in winter. Its compact size keeps heat losses to a minimum, while the central light-well stimulates natural internal ventilation. Photovoltaic cells in the roofing will produce 60% of the buildings electrical needs. Cristofani, the architect, paints the picture: By exploiting the quality of the glass, the whole suggests a giant crystal, set in  a mineral matrix. What I see there is material being transformed or reinvented by the magic of Solvays chemistry. The two parts are having a dialogue with each other, bringing the surprising building to life, as if springing up from making a discovery, like a mineral emerging when the earth is removed. Regeneration of corals in Thailand  by using PVC pipes Vinythai – the joint venture between Solvay and  Charoen Pokphand In Thailand – is supporting a project  to promote the regrowth of corals by using PVC pipes.  The first experiment with cultivating and regenerating coral fragments by means of a method respecting its natural growth process is meeting success. Damaged fragments of coral are placed in tubes made from PVC piping to form  a framework. Divers then lay these on the seabed, which is the corals natural environment, and the plastic has been found perfectly suitable for the marine  environment. The local Thai population, including the children, can themselves make the  plastic frameworks. Support from Vinythai relates to cultivation of the coral, and also to research activities. A youth camp, meanwhile, offers the young  people practical experience of marine sciences. Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  71  Living in harmony with the local  communities and respecting  their environment  Dialogue, with participation in the life of the community Continuous improvement of environmental performance Creation of local wealth  Development of the local economy Protecting local residents  A  rm of this size should  be able to manage a  sustainable and lasting  project at Rio Grande da  Serra, where most of the  residents are really very  poor. The situation as seen by a neighbor of one  of our plants For nearly 10 years now I have been observing the action taken  by Solvay Indupa in relation to social responsibilities. During the  past six years, we have seen action being taken on a more ad-hoc  basis. I have been particularly impressed by two projects: Curta  Qumica e Natureza and Fibras da Serra. Both are being carried out  in collaboration with the local community in the relevant district of  Rio Grande da Serra city, in the immediate neighborhood of Solvays  Santo Andr site.  Even though both of those initiatives are very good, they are  temporary projects. I would therefore like to suggest something  to Solvay Indupa. A  rm of this size should be able to establish a  sustainable and lasting project in Rio Grande da Serra, where most  of the residents are really very poor. The employment available in the town is insuf cient for the resident  population, and government statistics show that, over time, it is  falling. In addition, as our town is considered a nature protection  area, it can no longer accept any new industry, from any sector. Therefore, developing such long term projects are necessary to  provide stable incomes for families. This would very probably get  them to understand that a social project should not be confused with  social or welfare assistance. I wholly agree that a good social program  should teach people to  sh and not to spend their life waiting for  sh  to drop from the sky. Having said that, I would like to stress that we are all very grateful for  Solvays social initiatives and for the help they are providing to all the  charitable organizations in Rio Grande da Serra.

There are also about 40 sites with installations  classied as involving major risks; in all these cases, there are specic systems to protect  against the hazards. There are a great many initiatives being taken to reduce the environmental impact of our  activities. New investments in this area are planned for more than 80% of our sites, with the  emphasis on water economies at the sites where this resource is most scarce. In addition, there  are specic programs at 33 sites for management of historic pollution of the soil. Hand in hand  with these forms of action are the last stages in establishing an environmental management  system of ISO-type (or equivalent) for relevant sites throughout the Group.  Dialogue and trusting relationships – together with safety and the control of environmental  impact and other adverse effects from our activities – constitute the leitmotif of our local  initiatives. They determine what policy we adopt and the action we take to meet expectations,  while addressing the issues and meeting the specic needs of communities adjacent to our sites.  All the sites are keen to extend this dialogue.  We see our ability to monitor our environmental performance and communicate the results  as an important aspect of our Responsible Care commitment and policy.

This relates particularly to  environmental issues, accident prevention and means to reduce nuisances produced by our  activities.  Numerous forms of dialogue have been applied over many years: open days at the plants,  regular communication with the local authorities, information on major risks, and involvement in  social, business and educational projects, depending on speci c local factors. Another type of  interaction, contributing to a shared vision of the world in which we live, comes from providing  young people with occupational training, and additional  nancing will be allocated for this.  Networking  with the local  communities The truth behind the precautionary principle can, I think, be expressed simply: Do not  wait for a risk to materialize so that you can calculate its impact precisely and then take  action to reduce or eliminate it. The idea is not at all If in doubt, hands off but, on the  contrary, If in doubt, take action. If well understood, the precautionary principle is not a  principle to proscribe, it is a principle prescribing action. Andr Comte-Sponville, philosopher, at the Sustainable Development  Seminar of Solvays European Works Council, 2005 Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  The idea is not at all If in doubt,  hands off but, on the contrary If in doubt,  take action.     In 2008, His Majesty King Juan Carlos visited  the facilities of the plant of Torrelavega (Spain)  to commemorate its centenary.  Local communities 75  Preventing accidents and preparing  for emergency situations Strategy   Designing, building, operating and maintaining our  installations with a view to minimizing the risks and  aiming at zero accident.   Giving priority to intrinsic safety for substances, pro- cesses and equipment.   Using safety management systems reecting the  principle of continuous improvement, and periodically  having their performance assessed by auditors from  outside the site.   Deciding on local action plans that include the Groups  targets. 1 Adopting reference tools throughout the Group, together with appropriate management  systems and verication, is helping produce a common approach to protecting against  risks and harmonizing performance Group-wide (*). The tools used to identify and assess  the potential hazards include the Safety Integrity Level (SIL) method for the design of instrument- controlled safety arrangements and HAZOP (Hazard & Operability) studies for all proposed new  or modied installations. Risk-based Inspections are used as the basis for programs to inspect  physical integrity, and these are ne-tuned to suit the risk level of the installations and equipment  being considered.  There are ad hoc safety management systems in operation at all the major-risk sites (referred  to in Europe as Seveso sites), of which there are about 40. The verication of systems are  both internal and external. In these classied sites, specic safety management systems and risk  prevention systems are in place. Emergency preparedness and public information plans have  been developed in compliance with regulatory requirements. Exercises and simulations are held  periodically, to check on and improve the plans and their practical application.  All the industrial sites undergo periodic risk engineering audits, with input from external  experts. These audits are carried out at intervals of three to ve years; they monitor the physical  and functional integrity of installations, looking also at management systems designed to protect  against incidents and various forms of deterioration, damage and loss. The observations made  in the course of these audits serve as a basis for drawing up improvement plans. Such plans are  monitored using an information system covering all the Groups management units. Safety management is supervised by the Health, Safety and Environment Competence Centre  (*) See Systems and tools, page 88 An environmental incident that could have  had more serious consequences    One of the main environmental accidents to have occurred  recently was close to the Bernburg plant in Germany, which  produces sodium carbonate. One of the embankments enclosing  a sedimentation basin collapsed, over a length of 200 metres,  causing an outow of slurry onto a road adjacent to the site.   The sedimentation basin is used to separate suspended inorganic  matter from the aqueous efuent arising from the production of  soda ash.   The accident was linked to a change in the drainage conditions  from the sedimentation basin, leading to excessive pressure on  the containing walls. Using infra-red cameras, the police were  able to conrm very quickly that nobody had been caught up in  the collapse. We then recovered the residues and subsequently  installed additional equipment to detect any abnormal increase  in pressure on the embankments. The accident had no lasting  impact on the environment.

Stages in this process are:    emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide;  2 reduced by 50% through changes in the  type of coal used;  site received a new operating license, indicating compliance  with the EUs Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)  Directive. This license requires monitoring of emissions into the  air and releases into water, in compliance with the Directive, and  continued upgrading of environmental performance to reach a  level meeting the EUs Best Available Technique (BAT);   workstations, notably in respect of asbestos and Legionnaires  disease; x and CO2, through  installation of  uidized-bed combustion equipment;   local dump for power-station ash ceasing. The Groups safety standards have been implemented at the production facilities taken over  from the Fournier pharmaceutical company (in France and Ireland) following acquisition of that  company in 2005. This involved inclusion in the Groups programs, in the OHSAS 18001 audits, and  in initiatives in the areas of ergonomics and accident monitoring. These activities have led to a very  signi cant reduction in accidents (see  gures).   At the Panoli site (in India, devoted to the production of specialty polymers), which was  acquired in 2006, the action plan focussed on the health and safety of employees, and the  environment. From the time of acquisition, safety results were included in the Groups overall  reporting system, and a risk engineering audit, bringing together local managers and Group  representatives, was conducted. There was already a formal policy and a continuous-improvement  process operating on the site, and it merely had to give increased emphasis to the management  of chemical hazards and to safety during maintenance. An in-depth diagnosis of environmental  performance led to improvement of the biological treatment plant and addition of a very modern  unit that will make it possible to treat the water ef uents from production of polyether-ether-ketone  (now planned), and to comply with standards for the water receiving the ef uent. At Devnya (in Bulgaria), the production of soda ash has been brought up to standard, with  an IPPC operating licence obtained. The two units – for energy production and the soda ash  production unit – forming the industrial complex can expect, very soon, to reach the level of  environmental performance speci ed as European Best Available Technique (BAT)   Targets for 2012  Continuing to bring the acquired sites within the scope of Solvay standards.

Providing all relevant sites with improvement plans  reviewed by the site management, and the main  aspects of which have been discussed with the  Groups Health, Safety & Environment Competence  Centre. 3 There are plans in progress for improved environmental management at 80% of the  sites. At 28 of those sites, these plans will result in very specic, but signicant improvements  efuent quality and will be implemented rapidly.  This relates, in particular, to controlling the emissions of substances that are classed as priority  substances in relation to their potential environmental impact. The improvements for these  substances generally have only a small visibility in the Groups overall indicators. The objective  is to comply strictly with environmental quality standards for the receiving environment and, of  course, with the environmental permits.  Consumption of drinking-quality water and of underground water have fallen signicantly since  2003 (by 29% and 16% respectively). The quantities of waste products treated or put into  landll, whether or not classed as toxic, are unchanged from the 2003 level.  The performance improvements that are now in progress generally fall into one of the following  ve categories. 1.  Alignment of environmental performance with Best Available Techniques (BAT) :  these are set in accordance with the EUs IPPC framework Directive, and are the reference  standards for authorization to operate within the European Union, and in some cases outside  the EU. All the relevant Solvay plants worldwide are progressively aligning their performance  with these BATs.  2.  Compliance with European producers federations commitments, notably the Euro Chlor  charter (relating to chlorine and derivatives production) and the ECVM charter (for PVC  production), supplementing or going further than the BATs.   3.  Reducing the use of organic solvents in pharmaceutical production, and seeking  synthesis routes that are more direct, involving fewer stages. Our policy also involves  making use of raw materials in a preferred list, particularly for the synthesis of new  pharmaceutical compounds. However, regulatory requirements for registration sometimes  make it difcult to change manufacturing processes.

Best Available Techniques (BATs): European  industrial reference standards in relation to the  environmental performance Dealing together with all types of pollution – of air, water and waste  products – is replacing separate regulatory requirements for each  environmental compartment, which was the earlier approach.  The resulting BREFs (BAT reference documents) specify the Best  Available Techniques from a technological and environmental  perspective, and these now constitute the framework within which  operating permits are granted in the EU.  Solvay has helped set some of these reference standards, notably  for PVC and sodium carbonate production, two of the Groups  main products.  4.  Seeking enhanced performance in new production plants, particularly the new PVC  units planned for RusVinyl, which will be one of the best-performing in the world (see  box), and the hydrogen peroxide plant in Belgium, to be operated in partnership with  BASF and Dow. The latter will, for the rst time, make use of new pre-treatment processes  for efuents, allowing them subsequently to go to biological treatment plants shared by a  number of urban or industrial entities.   5.  Restoring sites where limestone quarries were operated and those with settling ponds  for mineral residues, following shut-down of those facilities: hundreds of hectares have  been reforested and, in some cases, converted into nature reserves (notably in Santa Lucia  in Italy, and Couillet in Belgium)  Outstanding performance by  Solvay Flor Mxico Solvay Flor Mxico performed  outstandingly in terms of environ-  able to complete an internal audit,  without any observation.

A unit is scheduled to treat all of the chlorinated organic by-product residues, recycling  them into hydrochloric acid. Performance will be particularly high in terms of recycling salts  (chlorides). Moreover, all the PVC production plants worldwide comply with the terms in the charter adopted  in 1995 by the European Council of Vinyl Manufacturers (ECVM), particularly the strict limits on  emissions into the atmosphere and releases into water from units producing either suspension PVC   OSPAR Convention on protection of the north-east Atlantic.

Verifying and ensuring compliance with the regula- tions and operating licenses. 4 Our production plants for plastics, chemicals and pharmaceutical products, and those  producing vehicle fuel systems (Inergy Automotive Systems), in view of their nature and the  production volumes, present potential risks of adverse environmental effects. At such sites,  environmental management systems (*) are used, generally of ISO 14000-type in Europe, with  similar systems elsewhere. In the United States and Argentina, for example, the management  systems generally stem from the national Responsible Care program, while in Australia and  the United Kingdom other systems, such as British Standard 7750, co-exist.  In 2007, these environmental management systems were in operation at 87 of the 97 relevant  sites (43 chemical, 4 mixed chemical and plastics, 24 plastics, 24 Inergy and 2 pharmaceutical).  and 63 had certication. Most sites involved in plastic processing that produce pipes and ttings  (those of our joint Venture PipeLife) or in pharmaceutical production do not require such complex  management systems.    These systems include verication of compliance with laws and performance documen- tation.

A hydro-geological containment has been installed, in  order to prevent the pollution from migrating elsewhere. In 2004,  an independent body carried out an in-depth analysis of the  health risks which, despite the containment measures, revealed a  need for the authorities to restrict certain uses of the groundwater  resources. It should be noted that the area within which use of  the groundwater was restricted had never been used to feed into  the public supply of drinking-quality water. In the area affected, the restriction relates to the use of individual  wells as a source of drinking water. Over a more limited area, the  restriction extends to bathing water (for private swimming pools).  Other uses, such as watering gardens and crops, or watering  livestock, do not present any particular risk, and are therefore not  subject to any restrictions.  Cooperation with the local authorities (town councils, and health  and environmental authorities) has been close, and characterized  by transparency.  The Group has developed skills and internal know-how relating to management of historic  soil contamination. To begin with, there is a hydro-geological diagnosis and characterization of the  contamination, making it possible to assess risks to the ground water and, if necessary, work out  plans for containment or remediation. These plans are discussed with the authorities.  After the soils and underground water resources had been characterized at 50 currently active  sites, programs for continuous monitoring of the underground water were established.   This action has been taken over the past 15 years, with measures to conne soil contamination at  23 sites where active protection of the ground water was needed. In addition, Solvay teams also  undertake monitoring at a other sites that have been sold, or where the Group no longer undertakes  industrial production.   The solutions vary greatly. At Onsan (South Korea) for example, when the production of  barium and strontium carbonates – used among others in cathodic television tubes - ceased  in 2005, and in addition to partial recycling of the efuents to produce a road-construction material,  140,000 tonnes of semi-liquid wastes were transferred to an approved disposal site. Soil remediation  and monitoring are expected to continue for a few more years. At Martorell (Spain), where solvents had penetrated to the water table below the Groups site,  a combination of measures has been applied, starting in the 1990s, to protect the groundwater  resources that extend outside our site: hydraulic connement of the water, biological remediation  and air cleansing of the water extracted from underground. These measures are backed up by a  network of 20 or so monitoring wells. The plants at Bussi sul Tirino and at Spinetta Marengo (Italy), taken over from Montedison in  2002, have since then been subjected to a thorough investigation and environmental  monitoring, beginning with a detailed characterization of the soil and underground water. This led  to a hydro-geological model being drawn up and technical intervention being implemented in close  collaboration with the relevant authorities, the aim being to conne and remediate the sites historic  contamination.  As knowledge-sharing is a key factor for managing soil contamination, Solvay participates in  the European NICOLE network, where the rapidly growing experience and knowledge in this area  of risk management is shared. Data from monitoring the groundwater at Solvay sites are steadily  being collected in a central Geographical Information System (GIS) database  Strategy   Protecting underground water resources and surface  water, and the health of local residents, through  a program, at all relevant sites and following in- depth diagnosis, for control of risks due to historic  contamination of the soil.

Applying securing containment measures for under- ground water when justied by new results from risk  assessments.  Testing new remediation techniques, such as in situ  heat treatment. Units to treat contaminated underground water at  Bussi sul Tirino (Italy) The technical solutions for protecting underground and surface water resources vary considerably. Dsseldorf (Germany) provides  a good example of a project that is soon to be completed. The site has been acquired in 1965 and has ceased activity in 1998.  Soil remediation began there in 1996. The good results obtained and precise monitoring of what was happening in the subsoil  made it possible to hand over the land with authorization for it to be built on.

Developing – for our main product ranges - the use  as management tools of speci c emission indica- tors – emissions per tonne of output manufactured  and environmental impact indicators. Monitoring of emissions into the air and of releases into water is handled locally, generally  looking at the concentration (in grams per liter of air and water) in the substances released into  the environment. The limits speci ed by operating licenses vary, depending on the medium into  which the release is made. The licenses also specify, for the relevant site, what analysis methods  are to be used for assessing the quality of aqueous ef uents or of emissions into the air, and the  locations where sampling is to take place. In order to ensure that uniform and valid measurement  methods are used, a major international comparative study is being undertaken in the Group, aimed  at establishing the quality of the methods and upgrading to the level of the best. This involves 112 sites, and their data on emissions into the environment are fed into the SERF  (Solvay Environmental Releases File) information system, where they are consolidated for  Group monitoring in terms of annual quantities (tonnes/year). This represents all the production  plants, including those of joint ventures where there are signi cant emissions into the environment  (the activities of PipeLife – the manufacture of pipes and  ttings – are thus not included in SERF).  SERF covers 250 parameters relating to emissions and releases, and to energy consumption. In accordance with their licenses, each plant also has to make public its emission data to the  relevant local authorities. In addition, the relevant sites in the United States and Europe (currently  over 30), submit reports to public-access systems: the European Pollutant Release and Transfer  Register (PRTR, ex EPER - data available on the site www.eper.cec.eu.int/ or visualized on www. cec.org/naatlas/prtr) in Europe, and the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI – www.epa.gov/triexplorer/ statefactsheet.htm ) in the USA.   Our environmental data are published in a variety of media, according with the spirit of the  Aarhus Convention on public access to information on the environment (see table). In particular,  detailed consolidated data for the 112 relevant sites, updated annually, can be accessed via the  Internet (solvaysustainable.com)  Strategy  Monitoring emissions at all the sites and ensuring the  accuracy of data reported to the authorities, in accor- dance with obligations to give public access to envi- ronmental data.

In the 19th century,  the company was already taking responsibility for local social and medical assistance and setting  up schools at a time when national governments had not yet fully taken charge of those functions.  From that time onwards, corporate social responsibility has evolved, and now requires increased  dialogue and networking with the local communities and responses to evolving concerns: local  economy, employment, education, training of young people received on work-experience schemes,  management of nuisances and risks, and work opportunities for disabled people, etc. Forms of action initiated by our production sites vary tremendously. In 2006 for example,  over 30,000 people living adjacent to our sites were welcomed at site open days.  These events provide special opportunities to establish links and identify new possibilities for  communication and collaboration.   Proper integration of local subcontractors, together with the provision of training for  them, assists the local economy, as does the inward movement of other rms, which  settle at our sites and benet from the use of shared infrastructure. There have recently been  examples of this at our sites at Tavaux (France), Rosignano (Italy), and Jemeppe and Neder- over-Heembeek (Belgium). In certain cases also, safety teams from our sites provide support  for local civil protection services.

It specializes in new components  for cell cultures, the focus being on  disposable solutions, with a higher  biological safety.   Local communities 83  Some illustrations of our  involvement in society  at the local level In Santo Andr (Brazil) 2006 was marked in particular by Solvay Indupas sponsorship of the Curta Qumica e Natureza project, in which students from Rio Grande da Serra produced short films on chemistry and nature, with practical assistance from Estdio Brasileiro. The project involved 11 schools, thus allowing a disadvantaged community to find a new means of expression, in the form of the cinema. The films have been screened at a number of film festivals. In Hanover (Germany) There is a Solvay day nursery offering chemical investigations for children aged five to seven. The emphasis is on experiments that the children can carry out and explain themselves, using domestic objects: yeast, vinegar, balloons and bottles. Such ingredients allow the SOLkids to explore the world of natural sciences. In Povoa (Portugal) The Solvay Chemicals plant at Povoa regularly welcomes young mentally disabled people, to give them an opportunity to develop their abilities and sense of responsibility, under the direction of a specialist occupational therapist. This involves accomplishing a variety of simple tasks, such as washing the company's vehicles. In the USA Solvay Pharmaceuticals is providing medicinal products to destitute patients, and helps students that have cystic fibrosis. The former initiative comes within the scope of of the Patient Assistance Program (PAP), which the United States introduced in 1993. Solvay is making medication available to impoverished patients who meet the criteria laid down for the USAs Medicare program. The telephone centre that deals with patient registrations started operating in April 2005, and by the end of 2006 had already been contacted by 4 million potential beneficiaries. During that period, the PAP accounted for a total of 20 million USD. In 2007, Solvay Pharmaceuticals also provided 100 two-year study grants for students living with cystic fibrosis. This is a life-long disease which is very disabling, involving heavy expenditure for the families of those affected. Since the arrangements began, about 15 years ago, some 400 grants have been provided, with a total value of more than one and a half million dollars. 84  In the Peoples Republic of China Solvay Employees from all over the world collected 1.4 million renminbi, or CNY, (equivalent to 130 000 EUR) to  provide assistance for victims of the earthquake that struck the Sichuan region in May 2008. The enormous demonstration of solidarity involved Solvay employees in China organizing a collection that amassed more than 110.000 CNY, with the Groups Chinese subsidiaries then tripling this value, to help finance the Red  Cross operations in the stricken territory. Then, early in June, Christian Jourquin, the Chairman of Solvays Executive Committee, was able, on behalf of the Group, to give Ms Qiyue Zhang, ambassador in Belgium for the Chinese  Peoples Republic, the sum of 100 000 EUR that had been collected from employees all over the world to help  finance the rescue efforts. In Thailand The Siam Solvay Foundation has given 2.8 million baht (62 000 euros) to a local association that looks after children orphaned by the tsunami. The Foundation established support structures to deal with the emergency immediately following the disaster. Then, on a more permanent basis, the local association embarked on a particularly innovative and effective venture, planned with support from  Solvay, to bolster the emotional stability of children harmed by the disaster. This is the Puppet Project for Hearts and Minds, built around the world of  puppets. About 100 teachers have been trained in storytelling, and mothers with their own families have received assistance to make the puppets. By the time it ends, a tour of 260 day-care centres and schools will have reached  30 000 children. Towards Sustainable Development 2008-2012  In the USA The employees at Solvays Houston sites are proud of taking part each year  in the national Bring Your Child to Work Day. Parents are invited to bring  one or more of their children into their workplace. In Sri Lanka A high-dependency unit specially designed to treat children has been built  at Galle, in the region hit by the tsunami. Half of the 40,000 euros donated came from Solvay in Germany, and the other half directly from the staff  of our production sites in that country. 85  RI Index Index according to the Global Reporting Initiatives G3 Guidelines www.globalreporting.org Basis GRI Location 1.
