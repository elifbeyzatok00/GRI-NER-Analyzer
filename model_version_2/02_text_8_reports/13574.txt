The full GRI  Index is included on page 80 and 81 of  this Report. Starting in 2008, we began  conducting materiality analysis, stakeholder  communications which include surveys to  identify key sustainability issues that affect  our stakeholders and the company, and have  concentrated on providing more detailed  information on identified issues in the Report. Data Collection Process Data on economic, environmental and social  performance that are displayed in the form  of tables and graphs are managed by HMC  staff members of the respective departments.  The data is collected via company intranet  at the beginning of each calendar year  by the Environmental Strategy Team for  review and analysis. The process for key  environmental performance data collection  and management is reviewed by outside  experts via annual ISO 14001 certification  procedures in order to assure reliability of  the data. Key environmental performance  data on greenhouse gas emissions, water  use, and wastes are collected from both  domestic and overseas sites. However, some  environmental performance data and much  of the social activity data is collected from  domestic operation sites only. Work is under  progress to improve the data collection  system to include overseas operation sites. Hyundai Motor Company (hereafter  HMC) has been publishing a corporate  Sustainability Report subtitled The Road to  Sustainability on annual basis since 2003.  Through publication of this Report, HMC  reaffirms its commitment to sustainability   management and shares the achievements  with our stakeholders.

In  2011, we renewed our management philosophy, the vision and core values of the company in  order to establish a new foundation on which to base our sustainable growth into the future.  I firmly believe that the new management philosophy and vision will guide us to stronger  sustainable management. As an automobile manufacturer, HMC is pursuing the development of a wide range of green  vehicles from hybrid electric vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles in order to realize  safer and greener mobility solutions. We have already successfully launched the Avante LPi  Hybrid in the Korean market and launched our second hybrid model, the Sonata Hybrid in both  the Korean and North American markets. HMC is also actively pursuing EV technology. In 2010,  we completed development of the BlueOn EV, which is operated in a demonstration program  in Korea. Our fuel cell electric vehicles are also being tested in demonstration programs in  both Korean and overseas locations strengthening the foundation for commercialization in the  future. In todays society, a company can only grow sustainably with mutual support from its  stakeholders. Likewise, the fruits of sustainable management can only be gathered when  companies are trusted by its stakeholders. All members of HMC recognize the importance of  stakeholders and, therefore, will continue to strengthen our activities for promoting stakeholder  value. We will strive to provide vehicles and services of the highest quality to our customers.  Moreover, we will create new value beyond customer expectations and deliver that value to  the customers. We will also strive to be a more responsible business partner and go beyond  our past goal of promoting mutual cooperation to realize shared growth in conjunction with  our suppliers. Our efforts in core CSR areas will also increase to ensure implementation of  programs in traffic safety, environmental protection, social welfare improvement, education  support and more in all local communities in which we operate. Overall, our goal is to become a  beloved member of the local community. HMC will continue its growth by creating new sustainable value from our business activities  and sharing them with our stakeholders. Its a pledge from all members of the HMC including  myself. Lastly, I would like to ask for your continued support and interest as both are essential  for guiding HMC to a sustainable future.

A total of 1,881,805 vehicles were produced in overseas manufacturing plants, which  was an increase of 25.9% from 2009. Exploring sustainable mobility solutions from hybrid  electric vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles HMC launched the Sonata Hybrid both in North America and Korea in early 2011. It is the second  hybrid-electric vehicle by HMC after the launch of the Avante LPi Hybrid in 2009. In 2010, HMC also  introduced BlueOn the first highway-capable electric vehicle developed in Korea, which is currently  being tested in a demonstration program in Korea. The Tucson ix FCEV, a third-generation fuel cell  electric vehicle with significantly improved fuel efficiency and performance was also completed  in 2010. The Tucson ix FCEV is operated in a demonstration program in both Korea and overseas  locations as a stepping stone to early commercialization of the technology. Shared growth beyond mutually-beneficial cooperation HMC has identified global competitiveness building, strengthening of a sustained growth  foundation, and the establishment of a shared growth system as three core strategies for  realizing shared growth with suppliers and launched programs for technical assistance for quality  improvement, as well as overseas business expansion support. Various programs were also  launched to foster corporate culture that embrace the concept of shared growth.  Management Philosophy  A company's management philosophy is the answer to why it exists and is a tenet that should be deeply  embedded in both the minds and actions of employees. Using Hyundais traditional values and spirit as a  basis, the essence of our management philosophy is summarized in three key ideas: unlimited sense of  responsibility, realization of possibilities, and respect for mankind.  The three keywords were used as the  basis for the new management philosophy, realize the dream of mankind by creating a new future through  ingenious thinking and continuously challenging new frontiers. The unlimited sense of responsibility signifies pursuit of sustainable growth through an unyielding  sense of responsibility for our stakeholders. The realization of possibilities signifies our pioneer spirit that  has driven HMC to new business frontiers. The respect for mankind represents our will to contribute to  improvement to the living conditions of humanity. Using the new management philosophy as guideline,  HMC will continue its growth as a respected company that is making a positive contribution to humanity. 10 Core ConCepts embedded in management philosophy PursuesustainedgrowthinordertoprovidefornotjustHMCemployeesandtheirfamily    members but those of our suppliers Pursuebestqualityinproductstoensuresafetyandsatisfactionofcustomersthatlastsa    lifetime Unlimited sense of   responsibility Realization of  possibilities Respect for  mankind FosterDNAthatstrivesfornever-endinggrowthandadvancement Nurtureanentrepreneurialspiritwhichenablesustobreakoutofourcomfortzoneand    takes risks in light of greater success Createauthenticvaluesbyturningsmallpossibilitiesintorealachievements Contributetoimprovinggeneralconditionsoflivingbyprovidingproductsandservicesof    the highest quality for the greatest number of people Proactivelytackleenvironmentalissuesandmakecontributionstolocalcommunities    worldwide The corporate philosophy of HMC was redefined in 2011.

Vision  2020 is designed to embrace the changing values and philosophy of what automobiles means to  society. By pursuing this vision, HMC is set out to become not just a car maker but a company that  creates new values, a company that is beloved by customers, and ultimately, a lifetime partner to  our customers. Core Values  We have selected five core values of customer, challenge, collaboration, people and globality  to help us implement a new management philosophy and realize vision 2020. The core values  were created using the following process. First, we identified unique characteristics embedded  in HMCs employees that have contributed to our success so far.

As a responsible corporate citizen, HMC strives to take action to make a tangible difference  in business performance, as well as environmental management and social responsibilities  associated with its operation. Recognizing importance of CSR management, HMC created a  CSR committee to strengthen implementation of its CSR activities. 12 sustainability  management CSR Management  With shared understanding of the need for strengthened CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)  management, we established a CSR Committee in 2008 for more effective promotion of CSR activities.  The CSR committee is responsible for activities in three core areas including environmental management,  trust-based management and social contribution. With guidance of CSR committee, HMC joined the UN  Global Compact and declared its commitment to fulfill its social responsibilities its business practices. The UN Global Compact is a voluntary initiative launched by the UN that seeks to align business  operations and strategies everywhere using ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human  rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. We renewed our CSR charter in collaboration with  the UN Global Compact in April 2009. A Hyundai Motor Group-wide CSR taskforce was established for  establishment of long-term CSR strategy for a period extending to 2020. Environmental Management HMC publicly declared its environmental management philosophy and its global environmental  management policy in 2003, and has since continued to strengthen its environmental management.  Rather than focusing on regulation compliance, we are focusing our efforts on more proactive  environmental management such as creating new market opportunities by improving energy efficiency  and reducing costs of operation. With such a goal in mind, we have established and implemented a  comprehensive environmental strategy throughout the entire lifecycle of our products, in addition to across  the entire value chain of the automotive industry. Reducing environmental impact during the automobile  use stage is a top priority goal. HMC has established Blue Drive, a strategy that focuses on fuel efficiency  Environmental Management Philosophy : For the harmony of humankind, the environment and  society, HMC respects human value and fulfills corporate social responsibility through environmental  preservation.  Global Environmental Management Policy : As a responsible corporate citizen that aims to create a  prosperous and sustainable society while respecting human values, we established the following global  environmental management policies to help preserve the environment. 1. Recognize the environment as a core element of business success and create corporate values through proactively    pursuing environmental management. 2. Uphold our social responsibilities by developing and supplying environmentally friendly vehicles. 3. Dedicate to reducing pollutants and to preserving resources and energy for sustainable use at all stages of our     products lifecycle, from development to production, sales, use and disposal. 4. Endeavor to provide all employees with environmental training programs and support suppliers in their      environmental management activities and contribute to public welfare. 5. Comply with all domestic and international environmental regulations and relevant agreements. Strive to improve    environmental management and communicate the results to internal and external stakeholders.  improvement of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines as a near-term solution, and seeks to supply  zero emission vehicles in the future. Aiming to strengthen its capacity to respond to global environmental issues  and regulations, HMC identified climate change, recycling, air quality and hazardous materials as core issues and  established an environmental management structure accordingly. Currently, climate change has been identified  as the top priority issue among the four, and therefore, we are concentrating our effort on reducing CO2  emissions of both automobiles and our operation sites. Trust-based Management Companies can grow only through the support of various stakeholders. HMC has been pursuing shared growth  by establishing trust-based relationships with stakeholders including customers, employees, investors, suppliers,  and local communities. Mutual respect, as well as transparent and ethical business operations are the key  principles in earning trust of stakeholders. HMC is communicating the value of trust-based management to  stakeholders including employees, suppliers and local communities while making continuous effort to further  improve transparency and ethical standards in our business conduct.  Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 13 Social Contribution  As a responsible corporate citizen, HMC is devoting significant resource to fulfill its social contribution. Our social  contribution activity slogan of Moving the World  Together is a statement of our commitment to create a better  society for all members of the global community in collaboration with our stakeholders. Moving the World  Together social contribution projects are our flagship social welfare programs tailored for  people in need. We are also conducting various social contribution activities that fall into categories including Easy  Move, Safe Move, Green Move and Happy Move depending on the nature of the project. We are also conducting social contribution activities in areas including social welfare, education and academics,  art and culture, and also sports. In 2003, we established a long term social contribution activity roadmap to ensure  that our activities are carried out in an efficient and structured manner that lead to tangible changes. Our sustained  effort in social contribution has led to the establishment of a global social contribution promotion structure with  effective programs and a large number of volunteer corps. We will continue to improve our implementation  structure to fulfill our rightful role as a respected corporate citizen of the global community. cUstomer employee Supplier shareholder /investor community HYUNDAI Sustainablemobility Greatproductquality Improvedvehiclesafety Increasedcustomersatisfaction Increasedemployeesatisfaction Humanresourcedevelopment Respectforhumanrights Increasedhealthandsafety Mutuallybeneficialcooperation Fairtrade Long-termrelationship Increasedcorporatevalue Protectionofshareholdersrights Stablegrowth Transparentbusinessmanagement Contributiontothelocaleconomy Jobcreation Socialcontributionactivities TRUST  We are promoting ethical management practices as an important means of enhancing  stakeholder value.

In 2008, we joined the UN Global Compact  which provides principles for all our employees to comply with all relevant laws, regulations and also to  respect accepted social norms in our business conduct. HMC is also conducting trainings on fair trade and  anti-corruption to foster a corporate culture where employees can make ethically correct decisions when  faced with difficult situations that may lead to ethical dilemmas. In order to improve transparency in the management decision making process, the company also  established an Ethics Committee in 2007, which is composed of external directors. We adopted International  Financial Reporting Standards in 2011 in order to increase transparency in accounting practices. We  have been making a considerable effort in supplier-relations. In 2002, we adopted a voluntary fair trade  compliance program. HMC also signed a formal fair trade agreement with a record number of suppliers in  2010, as a part of our on-going effort to become a fair and transparent business partner. Compliance Policy Complying with all laws and regulations, as well as respecting internationally accepted norms in business  conduct in all its business practices is a key business principle within HMC. With that principle as a basis,  HMC also strives to promote the voluntary compliance of all regulations, and has created a fair trade  compliance program for the prevention of unfair business conduct. We are also providing training on ethical  business conduct for employees to promote good business practices and have established a Cyber Audit  Office to monitor compliance status.  Fair Trade Agreement with Suppliers We made continued to efforts to uphold the fair trade agreement made between HMC and our suppliers  since we signed our first fair trade agreement with them in 2008. In 2009, we created the Mutually Beneficial  Cooperation Fund for supporting first and second-tier suppliers and executed loans of 130 billion KRW to  our suppliers. The Fair  Trade Commission awarded HMC with the Best rating, which is the highest rating a  company can receive, in Implementation of Fair Trade Agreements with Suppliers category in recognition  of our good work in fair trade compliance. In 2010, HMC signed fair trade contract with over 2,700 suppliers.

We are expecting strong sales in 2011 as the  economy of advanced nations continues  to improve and sales growth in emerging  economy is expected to continue to grow.  The U.S. economy is still suffering from  high unemployment rates and a slow  housing market, however, we are expecting  a recovery soon as the number of vehicles  that require replacement is increasing. The  European market began showing signs of  recovery during the second half of 2010  starting with Germany and the UK. We  are also expecting a significant increase  in vehicle demand in Eastern European  countries. The demand in BRIC countries is  expected to increase strongly in 2011. The  automobile demand in the so-called post- BRIC market such as the Middle East and  Africa markets is expected to show strong  growth as well. Global Management Business Performance New Brand Statement 20 01.1 economy Global Sales The 2010 automobile market in advanced  countries has not yet fully recovered from  the recent economic crisis. However, global  automobile sales increased to more than 70  million units for the first time, largely due  to fast-growing sales in emerging markets.  This is largely due to exceptionally quick  popularization of automobiles in emerging  markets. In fact, more than 80% of the  increase in sales came from emerging  markets including China. In 2010, the  proportion of vehicles sold in emerging  market accounts for more than 50% of the  global sales.  The sales of domestically produced HMC  vehicles have increased by 7.4% to 1,730,682  units in 2010 compared to the previous  year. Sales in the Korean market were  657,897, down by 6.2% but 1,072,785 units  were exported, which was a 17.8% increase  from a year ago. The increase in overseas  sales of domestically produced vehicles  largely came from advanced countries,  in the Middle East, as well as Central and  South American markets. The 2010 sales  of HMC vehicles in the Korean automobile  market suffered despite strong sales of  the new Sonata, the Tucson ix and the all- new Elantra. We believe the discontinuation  of the tax break for over-aged vehicle  owners and the release of new models by  competitors were the two main factors that  led to a decrease in sales. Sales of vehicles produced in overseas  plants increased to 1,881,805 units, a 25.9%  increase over the previous year.  The proportion of vehicles produced  overseas was 52.1%, making 2010 the first  year in which overseas production volume  surpassed domestic production volume.  Overall, we sold 3,612,487 vehicles in 2010. More than 700,000 vehicles were produced  and sold in China, while 600,000 vehicles  were produced in India and sold.

HMCs global sales target for 2011  is 3.9 million up by 8% from 2010, with 1.83  million produced domestically and 2.07  million produced in overseas plants. 2010 Sales by Market Domestic Market  Due to the launch of many new models  and sales promotions for existing models,  overall automobile sales in the Korean  market increased by 5.2%. Despite this fact,  HMC sold 657,897 vehicles, which was a  decrease of 6.2%. HMCs market share also  Total 3,612,487 units  Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 21 01.1 economy fell by 5.5% to 45%. Competitors released  a significant number of new models, which  increased market competition, and our  Grandeur (Azera) and SUVs were outdated  by comparison, leading to weak sales. The Sonata and Elantra led the market as  the most and second most sold vehicles  respectively. The sale of commercial vehicles  was increased in 2010 through high demand  for replacement of old vehicles. Specifically,  sales of the Porter and Starex increased by  19.3%. Sales of large trucks and buses also  increased by 11.4% versus a year ago. China Market In 2010, BHMC (Beijing Hyundai Motor  Company)s sales in the Chinese market  were 703,008, up by 23% from a year ago,  making 2010 the first year BHMC sold  more than 700,000 in a single overseas  market.

The successful launch of the new Tucson,  launched in China as the ix35 in April 2010,  and the new Verna launched in August 2010,  contributed to an increase in sales. Our  analysis indicates that sales of both old and  new models contributed to strong sales  as a wide range of customers exist in the  Chinese market. Analysis also indicated that the Chinese  government subsidy of 3,000 yuan for  fuel-efficient vehicles with engine capacity  of less than 1,600CC, also contributed to  strong sales as all of our compact models  were eligible for the subsidy. U.S. Market HMA (Hyundai Motor America)s full year  sales totaled 538,228 in 2010, surpassing the  half million mark for the first time since it  launched the Excel in 1986. Sales were up  23.7% from a year ago, which is the highest  among major automakers. Consequently  the market increased to 4.6% up by 0.4%  point. Strong sales of our all new Sonata, all  of which are produced at the Alabama plant,  contributed significantly to our strong 2010  sales in the U.S. market. We sold 196,623  Sonatas in 2010, which is an increase of  64% from a year ago. As a result, it ranked  in the top ten most-sold models in the U.S.,  making it the first Korean model to make  the list in history. The sales of the Genesis  increased by 33% to 29,122, strengthening  HMAs image as a premium brand. We  also sold 196 Equus despite its very late  2010 launch. Sales of the Equus will further  strengthen HMAs image as a premium  brand. European Market The European automotive market was  slower than year ago with the termination of  incentive policies for replacement of older  vehicles and due to the financial instability  of many nations. Despite this, HME (Hyundai  Motor Europe) sold 362,110 vehicles, up  7.3%. The popularity of the i-series (i10, i20,  i30) seems to have contributed considerably  to HMEs successful sales in the market. The  success of the i-series also contributed to  improving HMEs brand image. The i-series  are highly fuel efficient and have low CO2  emissions, appealing to customers with  their practicality and environment merits.  India Market HMI (Hyundai Motor India)s 2010 sales  were the highest ever, totalling 356,501,  up by 23.0% from 2009. Our strategic  models, i10 and i20 models are customized  for the Indian market, continue to enjoy  strong popularity, and our launch of more  premium models, such as the Santa Fe,  are contributing to improving HMIs brand  image and leading to continued increases  in sales. Sales of the i10 totaled 159,158,  making it the most-sold car in the market for  two consecutive years.

HMC is aiming to deliver new  value to customers, values that may already exist in the market, but value that customers  may have no firm grasp upon. We attempted to capture this unique value inherent in HMCs  product and culture, defined it as Modern Premium, and developed the new brand slogan  of New Thinking. New Possibilities. It is our bold attempt to identify authentic values  that customers desire and encapsulate them in our products and services. The new brand  slogan is designed to help us create and deliver new possibilities and values using our  understanding of what the automobile means to todays customers as a basis. HMC will  strive to become not just another company that makes cars but a company that creates new  possibilities. Our goal is not to become the biggest car company but to become the most- beloved car company and a trusted lifetime partner to our customers.  Using our new brand slogan as our guide, HMC will present a new mobility culture, which  offer experience of new space and time to our customers, as well as helping customers enjoy  a new set of values that they have not experienced yet. Starting in 2011, all HMC employees  will engage in new thinking and explore innovative ideas to create new values in the spirit of  the new brand statement. New thinking leads to creation of new values. Modern Premium While traditional premium is  usually linked with high prices for  the privileged few, HMCs Modern  Premium concept is based on the idea  that high quality does not necessarily  require a high price for a limited  class. Using Modern Premium as its  new brand concept, HMC will offer  high-end, high-quality values at a  surprisingly attainable price and values  that customers never experienced or  expected. 25 Peoples expectation toward  individual mobility is more than just  a means of transportation. The old  understanding of cars has become  outdated. A car has come to speak  for different lifestyles, being a living  space. At this opportunity to move  ahead, we have developed a new  brand slogan that encapsulates our  willingness to take the next big step  up.

New  technologies and cleaner energies must  be developed in order to tackle climate  change as the transition to a low carbon  consumption pattern has become an  imperative. Manufacture of automobiles inevitably  results in greenhouse gas emission (GHG).  Moreover, a significant amount of GHG  is emitted while the vehicles are driven,  making the automotive industry vulnerable  to evolving climate change policies. In fact,  the GHG emissions from the transport  sector which includes road transport,  railroad, and air flights accounts for 20%  of global GHG emissions. The pressure to  reduce GHG emissions associated with  transport is increasing, especially in China  and India. HMC is endeavoring to reduce GHG  emissions via development and  commercialization of fuel efficient vehicles,  maximum energy efficiency improvement  in all operation sites, and the expansion of  renewable energy use. HMCs effort in reducing GHG emissions  has accelerated since February 2005 with  the ratification of the Kyoto protocol. First,  we organized an internal Climate Change  Task Force and analyzed the impact of  climate change and relevant policies on  HMCs operation. Detailed regulation  compliance strategies and reduction plans  HMC is making a focused effort to develop green vehicles that emit less  greenhouse gases, which are the main cause of climate change. We have also  established low carbon business management policies to achieve greenhouse  gases reduction in all areas of operation. were established, which were then adopted  with the approval of the Environmental  Committee. In 2008, the Environmental Research  Institutes was expanded into the  Environmental Technology Center for  accelerated development of green vehicles.  We also established the Energy Technology  Center for improving energy efficiency at  production plants. We plan to continue to  strengthen R&D capacity for GHG emissions  reduction. We are also making progress in  establishing a Low Carbon Value Chains  in all areas of businesses including R&D,  purchasing, production, sales, marketing  and more.  Blue Drive Climate Change Recycling Hazardous Materials Air Quality 30 02.1 environment Blue Drive is the name for HMCs low  carbon green technology strategy designed  to reduce CO2 emissions by boosting fuel  efficiency. It is also a brand name for vehicles  equipped with fuel-saving technologies.  The strategy focuses on improving fuel  efficiency of internal combustion engine- based cars as a near-term strategy. It is also  pursuing the development of alternative fuel  vehicles including bio-fuel vehicles, hybrid- electric vehicles, electric vehicles and fuel- cell electric vehicles. Development of a zero  CO2-emission vehicle is the ultimate goal of  the Blue Drive strategy.  Improving Fuel Efficiency  Fuel efficiency is a top development priority  for all HMC vehicles in development.  Improvement in fuel efficiency of new  models creates both the environmental  benefits of CO2 emissions reduction and  the economic benefit of reduced operating  costs for the customers. Reduction in fuel  consumption also contributes to improved  energy security.  We are focusing on three technology areas  including improving the energy efficiency  of the powertrain, minimizing energy  loss, and use of renewable energies. For  powertrain energy efficiency improvement,  common rail technology and gasoline  direct injection (GDi) technology is used  for diesel and gasoline engines. Engine  downsizing and higher-speed transmissions  are also employed for increased powertrain  efficiency. The GDi engines and six-speed  transmissions were first employed in 2009  Sonata. We plan to introduce vehicles  equipped with turbo-charged GDi engines,  six-speed dual clutch transmissions, and  eight-speed transmission starting in 2011.  Improvement in aerodynamics, low rolling  resistance tires, and weight-reduction  technologies are employed in increasing  numbers of HMC vehicles. A number of  new energy recovery technologies, such  as regenerative brakes that recover energy  during deceleration of vehicles; technologies  that allow use of exhaust heat; and solar  cells that harness energy from sun for use  in vehicles; are now being developed for  use in HMC vehicles. Employment of fuel-efficiency technologies  led to fuel efficiency improvement of 8.6%  in the new Avante (Elantra) and a 10.6%  improvement in the Accent released in  2010. Likewise, fuel efficiency of the all-new  Grandeur (Azera) released in January 2011  was improved by 13.3%. Thanks to sales of more fuel efficient  vehicles, the average CO2 emissions per  kilometer have been reduced to 135g/km, a  27% decrease when compared to the 1995  level. In addition to improving the energy  efficiency of the vehicles, we are also  developing an eco-driving system that leads  to a reduction of fuel use on the road, as  well as an eco-telematics service that guides  drivers to travel using the most energy  efficient route. In 2010, we launched the eco-telematics  Eco-Route service as part of Mozen,  Low rolling  resistance tire 1.6 liter gasoline  direct injection engine Motor-driven power  steering Six-speed  transmission Weight  reduction Fuel eFFiciency improvement technologies  employed in all-new avante (elantra)  Fluidic  Sculpture A new kind of aerodynamic  design HMC is creating a new family look  with its new design philosophy of  fluidic sculpture in all of its vehicles,  starting with the new Sonata released  in 2009. As the word fluidic suggests  a voluminous and bendable quality  found in flowing water which provides  the basis of the design concept, leading  to a highly aerodynamic design for  improved fuel efficiency. New styling  is the most notable change in the new  Elantra. Based on HMCs signature  theme of Fluidic Sculpture, the new  Elantra captures an unseen shape  found in the dynamic air movement  of the wind and the spirit of artistic  craftsmanship, which are expressed in  its exterior body design. As a result, the  new Elantra boasts a low coefficient of  drag, significantly reducing energy loss  due to air resistance to a lowest level  possible.

The  Mozen fuel saving route service is an  advanced telematics service that goes  beyond identifying the shortest route or the  least time consuming route using traffic  data, and it identifies routes that require  the least amount of fuel by analyzing road  characteristics, traffic information and more. Bio Fuels and Other  Alternative Fuels A wide range of fuels have been developed  and used with vehicle fuels in different  regions of the world. HMC is developing  engines that run on the alternative fuels  employed in those different regions. HMC  has already developed models capable  of running on bio fuels. We are especially  focusing on flexible fuel vehicles (FFV)  capable of running on E85 (85% ethanol +  15% gasoline), as a response to increasing  use of ethanol in North America and Brazil.  In 2011, we plan to launch Tucson FFV in  Brazil.  The European market requires a different  response because of the high penetration  of diesel vehicles, as well as bio diesel,  which is made from rapeseed, palm or  soybean and are much more commonly  used in the region. We are working toward  standardization of BD5 fuel (95% diesel, 5%  bio diesel) and production of diesel vehicles  capable of running on BD5 fuel. All HMC  vehicles released since 2010 are capable of  running on BD5 as well as bio fuel with up  to 30% bio diesel content. Vehicles running on compressed natural  gas (CNG) are classified as green vehicles  because they emit 20 to 30% less CO2  emissions compared to gasoline models.  HMCs first CNG vehicles were 11.5 ton-class  waste transport trucks and buses launched  in 2000. HMC developed a CNG city bus  and a CNG highway bus in 2006 and 2008  respectively. In 2010, we developed a CNG  hybrid electric bus Blue City to further  reduce CO2 emissions. We have released a  natural gas version of our popular Santro in  India where CNG is more widely used. We  plan to release the i10 Bi-fuel, which runs on  both LPG and gasoline by the end of 2011.  Hybrid Electric Vehicle A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is powered  by both an internal combustion engine  and an electric motor, a combination which  leads to reduction in fuel consumption and  improved performance when compared to  conventional vehicles. HMC has developed  several HEVs starting with its first HEV  concept car, the FGV-1 Hybrid in 1995. In  2004, we developed the Click Hybrid and  produced the Verna Hybrid in 2005. In total,  1,400 Click Hybrids and Verna Hybrids were  produced and supplied to the public sector  for the HEV demonstration program. HMC mass produced the worlds first LPi  HEV, the Avante LPi Hybrid, for sales in the  Korean market. We released the Sonata  Hybrid with outstanding fuel efficiency and  performance characteristics in spring 2011  in the U.S. and Korea, expanding our hybrid  line-up to the midsize vehicle segment. BlueOn EV – The first EV  produced in Korea Sonata Hybrid The Sonata Hybrid is the first mass- produced gasoline hybrid model by HMC.  It is also the first hybrid model for overseas  sales. Equipped with a customized engine  and six-speed transmission optimized for  a hybrid system, it is the greenest midsize  sedan in our line-up targeted at mass  market. We developed a custom hard-type  hybrid system, the Direct Drive Hybrid (DDH)  system, which is a propriety parallel hybrid  drive system different from the power split  system employed in our competitors hybrid  models.  By employing the DDH system that  employs smaller electric motors and  simpler in structure than the competitor  system, the Sonata Hybrid boasts excellent  fuel efficiency at a lower price point. It also  has a more dynamic conventional-car-like  performance because the engine transmits  power directly to the wheels. Thanks to its  unique configuration, the Sonata Hybrid  has an excellent highway fuel efficiency  rating of 40 miles per gallon. It also has an  outstanding city fuel efficiency rating of 35  miles per gallon comparable to the most   Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 33 02.1 environment Blue-Will is powered by a 1.6 liter Gamma  engine with a maximum power output of  154 horsepower and electric motor with  100kW power output. Equipped with a high  capacity lithium-ion polymer battery, it can  travel up to 64 kilometers on single charge.  In hybrid mode, it has a high fuel-efficiency  rating in the range of 21.3km/L to 23.4km/L.  The solar panel embedded in the panoramic  glass roof that produces electricity for the air  conditioning system, minimizing power loss  due to the climate control system. Carbon- fiber reinforced plastic is employed in the  vehicle body to reduce vehicle weight for  maximum fuel efficiency.  Electric Vehicles Electric vehicles (EV) are powered by an  electric motor system which is connected  to a high capacity battery. Therefore, it  does not consume any fossil fuels directly.  However, production of clean electricity  must be realized in order to make electric  vehicles a real solution. Regardless, interest  in EV is rising as it is currently seen as one  of the more promising sustainable mobility  solutions for greenhouse gas reduction and  an increase in energy security.  HMC completed development of the  BlueOn EV in 2010 and supplied a small  number of the vehicles to government  agencies and regional government bodies  for demonstration. The demonstration  program will provide us with useful data on  customer requirements on performance as  well as technological improvements needed  prior to mass production. In addition to EV  development, we are also strengthening  partnership with relevant stakeholders for  commercialization of EVs. For instance,  we signed an MOU with the Korea Electric  Power Corporation for collaboration on the  development and standardization of EV  chargers. Sonata Hybrid – The first gasoline  hybrid model for mass production fuel efficient vehicles in its class. The Sonata Hybrid is also the worlds first  hard-type HEV equipped with lithium-ion  polymer (Li-ion) batteries. Compared to  nickel metal hydride batteries used in other  hybrid models, lithium-ion batteries are 25%  lighter and significantly smaller because  of their higher output and energy density.  The Li-ion battery pack is equipped with  four layers of safety features for maximum  safety. Plug-in Hybrid HMC is aiming to release a plug-in hybrid  model in 2014. Plug-in Hybrids are HEVs  with larger batteries which can be charged  using an external power source, which  allows it to be driven as an electric vehicle  using the electricity stored in the battery.  Once the battery is drained, it can be driven  as a HEV using both an internal combustion  engine and electric motor system. HMC  introduced its first plug-in hybrid concept  car Blue-Will at the 2009 at the Seoul  International Motor Show.   Climate Change Recycling Hazardous Materials Air Quality 34 02.1 environment BlueOn EV HMC has continued to strengthen its EV  development capacity since the early 1990s.  In 1991, HMC developed the Sonata EV, in  addition to developing several other models  including the Excel, Accent and Santa Fe  EVs. The BlueOn EV was developed using  such experience as a basis. The BlueOn-the first EV capable of  highway operation produced in Korea  in September 2010. The BlueOn EV is  equipped with a cutting-edge lithium- ion polymer battery and a range of new  electric drive components to ensure top  performance. It can be driven for 140km  on a single charge. Top speed for BlueOn  is 130km/h and acceleration performance  of zero to 100km/h in 15.7 seconds. High  voltage components were designed with  comprehensive safety features and have  been assessed for both high reliability  and safety. Many of the components were  developed domestically, strengthening the  foundation for continued improvement in  EV technologies. HMC has supplied thirty  BlueOn vehicles to government agencies  and regional government bodies for a  demonstration program. Two hundred and  fifty additional vehicles will be supplied for  the demonstration program starting January  2011. Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles Hydrogen is regarded as a promising  alternative fuel for the future because it can  be produced using electricity generated  using solar cells, wind mills, nuclear energy  and other alternative energies. Hydrogen  reacts with oxygen in the fuel cell to  generate electricity and fuel cell electric  vehicle (FCEV) are operated as an EV using  the electricity from the fuel cell. As a result, it  has zero direct emissions. Energy efficiency  and performance is also generally a notch- above that of an EV. In general, an FCEV  is also at least twice more energy efficient  compared to a conventional vehicle, making  FCEV the most energy efficient vehicle  technology.  HMCs most recently developed fuel cell  electric SUV model is up to 3.75 times  more energy efficient than comparable  gasoline-powered SUVs. HMC has  invested significant resources in fuel cell  development since 1998 in order to achieve  the twin goal of improved performance and  cost reduction. Recently, we successfully  developed metallic separator (bipolar  plates) technology, reducing the price of  the fuel cell stack by one sixth, dramatically  improving mass production potential. Blue Square,  Concept FCEV  Tucson ix FCEV Third-generation Tucson ix FCEV HMC completed development of the third- generation Tucson ix FCEV in 2010. The  Tucson ix FCEV is 15% more energy efficient  compared to the second generation Tucson  FCEV, with fuel efficiency equivalent to  31km/L. The 3G model has also increased  driving range to 650 kilometers, a 55%  increase, without refueling and a has  maximum speed of 160km/h. It has also  improved low temperature start-up ability  and can be started at minus 25(-13). Modularization of combining core FCEV  components including the fuel cell stack,  drive train components and inverter, led  to a reduction in size of FCEV system by  20% as well as creating a significant weight  reduction. Design changes have been  developed to make assembly and repair  easier, as well as to strengthen relevant  production technologies which will be  required in the mass production of FCEVs in  the future. HMC has been operating an FCEV  demonstration program in collaboration  with the Ministry of Knowledge Economy  since 2006. Between 2004 and 2009, HMC  also participated in the North America FCEV  demonstration program led by the U.S.  Department of Energy. We are currently  conducting an FCEV demonstration  program in Korea in the cities of Seoul and  Ulsan, Korea using 48 Tucson ix FCEVs.   interview Please tell us about the progress made in green vehicle development  since HMCs announcement of the Blue Drive strategy? Following the Blue Drive strategy, we have been focusing on improving energy efficiency  and performance of internal combustion engines as a near term solution. We are also  making significant investments in development of a wide range of green vehicles to create  sustainable mobility solutions. Successful launch of the Avante LPi hybrid was a result  of our concentrated effort on the Blue Drive strategy. In 2011, we began mass production  of our second hybrid model, the Sonata Hybrid for North American and Korean markets.  Using precision clutch control and a number of new technologies, the Sonata Hybrid can  be operated in EV mode and has excellent fuel efficiency and performance characteristics. We also developed our first EV capable of highway operational vehicle named BlueOn,  which is currently operated by participants of the EV demonstration program in Korea.  Significant progress was also made in development of fuel cell electric vehicles with  completion of the Tucson ix FCEV, a third generation FCEV. It will be supplied for FCEV  demonstration programs both domestically and in overseas locations, in order to  strengthen the basis for commercialization of FCEVs. Many governments including the Chinese, U.S. and Korean governments  are supporting electric vehicles as a next-generation green vehicle.  Please share you view on future of green vehicle market? The transition from an internal combustion engine to an electric powertrain is inevitable  faced with the unavoidable depletion of oil and the global environmental problem of  climate change. However, expansion of green vehicle market is highly dependent on  the change in oil price, improvement in battery technologies and the establishment of  necessary infrastructure for green vehicles. Japanese auto makers have already secured  the dominant position in the hybrid electric vehicle market, and U.S. and European  companies are entering the market. Most of the hybrid electric vehicles are midsized to  compact sized models now. But I expect to see increased competition of hybrid vehicles in  larger vehicle segments over time. The mass production of electric vehicles is on the rise  with the support of many governments notably the U.S. and Chinese governments. I think  a niche EV market can be established for urban commuter use. Despite increasing interest  in EV, I believe hybrid electric vehicles, which has been already mass produced for many  years and do not require supporting infrastructure, will lead the green vehicle market for a  significant period of time in the future. This is not to say there wont be other green cars in  the market. In fact, I believe there will be many green vehicles in the market with different  market share.   Please tell us about HMCs green vehicle development plan? We see competitive fuel efficiency, performance and price as key priorities for the  development of green vehicles. Development of green vehicles that meet the demand  of the local market is also very important. Therefore, we see development of advanced  motors, inverters and batteries to enable production at an affordable price as a key factor  to success as they are the core components required in all future green vehicles. We  plan to concentrate on improving fuel efficiency and performance of our hybrid drive  system and also develop a plug-in hybrid system for future models. We will produce  a small number of BlueOn EVs for a demonstration program in 2011. We will use the  demonstration program results for commercialization of EVs in the nearest possible future.  We will make a concentrated effort to develop the next-generation battery system since  battery performance is directly related to EV performance and cruise range per charge.  HMCs R&D on development of the FCEV will be increased as well to further improve  our ability to produce core FCEV components including fuel cell stacks and other core  components. We plan to produce a small number of FCEVs for demonstration in 2012 with  target of full commercialization in 2015. Much investment will be made to expand the R&D  team to accelerate the development and commercialization of green vehicles and relevant  technologies. Vice Chairman WOONg-CHUL  YANg Head of Environmental  Technology Center Hyundai motors 2011 Sustainability Report 35  36 Since 2009, HMC has been calculating  the carbon footprint of new models  over the complete product life  cycle including production, use and  disposal of vehicles. The calculation  results is expressed in amount of  CO2 in tons, and the data collected  for calculation is used as a basis  for reducing the carbon footprint of  vehicles. As of the end of 2010, we have  calculated the carbon footprint of  seven new models including the  Equus, Tucson and Sonata. The carbon  footprint of the three models was  certified for the standard developed  by the Ministry of Environment.  Significant carbon footprint  reduction has been achieved in  new generation models compared  to the old generation models. For  instance, the carbon footprint of new  generation Avante (Elantra) was 19.7  tons-CO2 which is 10.9% lower than  the previous generation. Carbon  footprint of the Verna (Accent) was  18.8 tons which is 14.2% lower than  the previous generation. greater  reductions were made in some  models. For example, the carbon  footprint of the Sonata Hybrid,  released in 2011, is 29% lower than its  gasoline engine-only counterpart and  32.8% lower compared to the previous  generation Sonata. We worked with  TUV Nord, an internationally recognized certification agency,  for carbon footprint assessment of  the Tucson ix, which was given the  Environmental Certification. The  Tucson ix also won the Design for  Environment certificate from TUV. 21km/L 111g/km 11.5km/L 204g/km Fifth  generation  Sonata  (2004) co2 carbon Footprint      Fuel efficiency carbon Footprint reduction oF sonata hybrid 5% reduction 29% reduction 26.2ton 17.6ton 24.9ton 13.6km/L 186g/km Sixth  generation  Sonata  (2009) Sonata  Hybrid  (2011) reducing carbon  Footprint  Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 37 02.1 environment A balanced growth of economic prosperity  and environmental protection are core  values HMC is striving to achieve as a  global company. We are making an effort to  reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  not just at production plants but at all  operating sites including sales offices,  service centers and research centers. Energy  efficiency improvement and use of GHG  free clean energies have been identified  as key measures to achieve emissions  reduction. A number of governments are  actively taking measures to foster green  technologies and green industries as a new  engine of economic growth. The Korean  government passed the Basic Law on Low  Carbon Green Growth on 14 April 2010. The  Korean government also set a national GHG  reduction target of 30% against business-as- usual by 2020 and introduced GHG-Energy  Target Management Scheme (TMS) to  control GHG emissions by large emitters. The TMS is a top-down emissions reduction  scheme which forces GHG reduction to  achieve the 2020 target. As a response, we  have established a long-term reduction  plan with an annual target for each year and  started to carry out reduction activities in  order to contribute to the achievement of  the Korea national target. The 2010 gHg Emissions  Status HMC has been managing its GHG emissions  sources and relevant processes using the  operation principles of the GHG-Energy  Target Management Scheme (TMS) as a  guide. The GHG emissions sources can be  reducing  Greenhouse Gas  classified into to two categories of direct  emissions and indirect emissions sources.  HMCs direct GHG emissions come from  the operation processes that involve use of  LNG, gasoline, diesel, kerosene and CNG.  Indirect emissions are associated with use  of electricity which is supplied by third-party  power companies. According to the calculation conducted  using governmental guidelines, the total  GHG emissions from HMC operation sites  was 1.492 million tons in 2007, 1.477 million  tons in 2008, 1.372 million tons in 2009  and 1.541 million tons in 2010. The number  of vehicles produced between 2007 and  2010 increased by 4.3% from 1.671 million  units to 1.743 million units. Therefore,  GHG emissions per vehicle produced has  decreased by 1.2% from 0.869 ton in 2007 to  0.859 ton in 2010. The GHG emissions from three production  plants, the Ulsan, Asan and Jeonju plants,  accounted for 85.4% of the total emissions.  The remaining 14.6% of GHG emissions  were from energy use at buildings including  at Operation Sites  Climate Change Recycling Hazardous Materials Air Quality 38 02.1 environment R&D facilities, service centers, headquarter  building, sales offices and others.  In 2010, the proportion of direct and indirect  GHG emissions was 35.2% and 64.8%  respectively. This is due to heavy reliance  on electricity in manufacturing process of  automobiles. According to our assessment of total GHG  emissions of overseas production plants  located in the U.S., China, India, Turkey  and the Czech Republic has increased by  three folds from 284,642 tons-CO2 in 2007  to 654,889 tons-CO2 in 2010. This is due to  increased production volume in overseas  including operations at new production  plants. gHg Emissions Reduction  Activities at Production  Plants HMC has established a five-year plan  between 2011 and 2015 to reduce GHG  emissions associated with production  plants. The plan sets out targets and  investment activities for emissions  reduction, which will be implemented over  five years. Our current target is 5% reduction  by 2015 compared to the 2005 level. We  plan to achieve 10% reduction by 2020. The  five year reduction plan is designed as a  rolling plan targeted for achieving annual  reduction goals set internally. The scope  of five-year reduction plan will be revised  in 2011 to include R&D facilities, service  centers, headquarter buildings and sales  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (in ton-CO2) 2007 2008 2009 1,541,424 2,196,313 total 1,926,439 1,927,257 1,777,044 654,889 1,372,228 554,211 1,476,706 450,551 1,492,402 284,642 2010 2,000,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 500,000 Domestic Overseas energy use   (in terrajoule) 2007 2008 2009 29,711 42,384 total 37,183 37,219 34,278 12,673 26,459 10,724 28,505 8,714 28,758 5,520 2010 35,000 15,000 25,000 5,000 Domestic Overseas offices under direct management of HMC.  We have identified three key emissions  reduction strategies including energy  efficiency improvement, introduction of CO2  emissions processing (capture and storage,  absorption) and increased use of renewable  energy. Ulsan Plant The Ulsan plant has volunteered to  participate in the trial GHG-Energy Target  Management Scheme since February 2010,  and strengthened internal capacity for  managing GHG emissions in support of the  national GHG reduction policy. HMC has  also developed a standard GHG emissions  assessment model on February 2010 in  order to contribute to sound implementation   of GHG-Energy Target Management Scheme  in 2011. Starting in 2011, we are focusing  on preparation and verification of GHG  emissions inventory report, reduction  target negotiation and submission of  emissions data as a participant of the Target  Management Scheme. We also plan to carry  out internal assessment of GHG emissions  status and emissions reduction potential for  implementation of the long term reduction  plan. In 2008 and 2009, we have installed  heat pumps for collection and reuse of  waste heat and utilized waste heat from  painting shops. We also invested more than  8.4 billion KRW for high-efficiency inverter  and a number of facilities to improve energy  efficiency minimizing energy consumption  increase due to plant expansion. Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 39 02.1 environment Asan Plant The recovery of the automotive market from  the 2008 financial crisis led to a significant  increase in production volume at the Asan  plant leading to significant increase in GHG  emissions. Despite this, reduction measures  were implemented to achieve reductions  in GHG emissions per vehicle produced.  The production volume has increased by  15.3% from 249,830 units in 2009 to 288,100  units in 2010, leading to an increase of  GHG emissions by 10.1% from 144,500  tons-CO2 to 159,140 tons-CO2. However,  GHG emissions per vehicle were reduced  by 4.5% from 0.578 tons-CO2 to 0.552 ton- CO2 as a result of improvements made in  facilities and production processes such as  installation of variably controlled pumps and  high efficiency inverters. The high efficiency  inverters were employed in washing  machines for the engine manufacturing  process, cooling water circulation pumps  of the vehicle body welding process, and  cooling pump for press machines used  for cutting and shaping of vehicle body  panels, which led to a reduction of more  than 2,000 tons-CO2 per year. We will  continue to improve production facilities  and processes at the Asan plant to continue  to improve energy efficiency and achieve  further reductions in energy use and GHG  emissions. Jeonju Plant An investment of 280 million KRW was  made between April and July 2010 to  replace metallic lights (430 watt per bulb) in  the truck assembly lines to high efficiency  fluorescent lights (162 watt per bulb). A  reduction of 485 tons-CO2 was made as a  result of the change. Real-time gHg Inventory  Management System  A standard GHG inventory was established  to monitor GHG emissions generated in  the vehicle manufacturing process. HMC  has developed an electronic inventory  management system that manage the list  of GHG emissions sources and assessment  methods which enable real-time monitoring  of energy consumption and GHG emissions  generated.  Development of the GHG inventory system,  named GHG-Energy Management System  (GEMS) began in October 2009 and was  completed in the fall of 2010. The GEMS  has improved data reliability compared  to the Total Energy Management System  (TEMS), because GEMS analyzes data from  the corporate ERP system, the purchasing  system and other corporate data systems to  calculate direct and indirect GHG emissions.  The GEMS also allow GHG management  in a more systematic manner as it allows  administrator to check GHG emissions in  real time. Reducing gHg Emissions  from Buildings The GHG emissions from buildings  including R&D facilities, service centers  and headquarter accounts for 14.6% of  total emissions from HMC operation sites.  We have included the buildings in the  management scope for corporate GHG  emissions reduction. Establishing gHg Emissions  Management Structure for R&D  Facilities In February 2010, the R&D GHG Emissions  Reduction Task Force was established. The  task force which consists of twenty two  experts has been working very actively,  holding two working group meetings each  month, conducting site assessments and  researching new reduction technologies.  The task force identified 195 improvement  ideas which have the potential to reduce  15,403 tons-CO2. Fifteen items have  been implemented achieving 3,991 tons- CO2 reduction so far. Development of a  new management system with energy  efficiency optimization functions to  change in direct/indirect  greenhouse gas emissions  (Domestic, in %) Plants 85.4% Buildings 14.6% indirect  emissions 64.8% Direct  emissions 35.2%  Climate Change Recycling Hazardous Materials Air Quality 40 02.1 environment existing facility management systems was  completed in June 2010. The new system  enabled comprehensive analysis of energy  consumption controlled via multiple  independent building control systems  and identification of devices which are  functioning with low efficiency. The analysis  result was used to optimize operation of  devices identified for low efficiency, leading  to a 2% reduction in energy costs. Replacement of Sign Lighting  LED lights are employed in an increasing  number of applications because of increased  visibility and higher energy efficiency  compared to conventional lights. We took  advantage of LED technology by replacing  fluorescent and neon lights of outdoor signs  with LED lights which consume significantly  less electricity. In 2010, we replaced sixteen  fluorescent lighting systems and twenty  one neon sign lighting systems in service  centers with LED lighting systems. Employment of New  Technologies for gHg  Reduction We signed an MOU with the Ulsan  Eco Business Corps for collaboration  on a project for channeling waste heat  generated at the incinerator operated by  Hyundai Heavy Industries. The discussion  began on February 2009 and an MOU  on collaboration and support for steam  supply was signed in October 2010. It was  established a 3.3 kilometer high pressure  steam transfer pipe by December 2010 to  deliver the steam generated using waste  heat from the incinerator. 17.5 tons of hot  steam per hour is  supplied to HMCs Ulsan  plant significantly reducing the amount of  LNG used for generating steam on-site.  The project was highly regarded as an ideal  project which effectively utilize waste energy  for achieve reduction in fossil fuel use and  GHG emissions. In July 2010, we installed a solar panel  Energy efficiency improvement and CO2 reduction has become a new  focus of production technologies. How is HMMR responding to this new  trend? Improving energy efficiency has become a matter of foremost importance with rise of  international oil prices and the increasing awareness of climate change. We were well  aware of such trends and therefore have employed a number of facilities designed for  maximum energy efficiency. Energy efficiency of heating facilities is especially important  because they consume large amounts of energy. At our Russia plant, all of our flow boilers  are equipped with condensing functions for a minimum energy efficiency of 95%. We are  also using direct heat ovens which can utilize 100% of heat generated from fuel and does  not produce any emissions. We also installed inverter type motors which run motors at variable speed depending on  the workload. Improvement in indoor heating of the plant is another area on which we  are focused. Our indoor temperature control system adjusts the amount of fuel burned  for heating by monitoring changes in indoor temperature, instead of burning set amount  of fuel. The electronic heating control system helps maintain the temperature within two  degrees of the target temperature and prevents overuse of fuel. Energy consumption at  the Russia plant is expected to increase significantly in 2011 as we enter full production.  We will make an increased effort to improve the energy efficiency of the plant. ANTONINA  MISCHENKINA  Environmental Affairs  Manager, Hyundai Motor  Manufacturing Russia A solar panel system on the rooftop of R&D  Museum at the Namyang R&D Center system on the rooftop of  R&D Museum  at our Namyang R&D Center which was  recently completed. The system is expected  to generate 82 MWh of electricity per year,  which is utilized for lighting and climate  control systems at the museum, reducing  annual CO2 emissions by 36 tons.  Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 41 02.2 environment Vehicle Recycling At HMC, we are striving to minimize vehicle  waste at the end of the vehicles life. By  2015, we aim to achieve a 95% vehicle  recycling rate by weight. We are also making  a significant investment in the development  of recyclable materials and recycling  technologies. Metals, which accounts for  more than 70% of the vehicles weight, are  already actively recycled. Therefore, we are  developing technologies to recycle plastic  parts which were traditionally incinerated  or landfilled. HMC is also actively applying  Design for Recycling principles, in order  to further increase recyclability of vehicles.  In addition, we have established the  Automobile Recycling Center to research  how to process end of life vehicles in a more  environmentally friendly manner. Recycling Vehicle Bumpers Bumpers are an important component of  automobile which absorb the impact from  a collision. Consisting of a bumper cover  and a back beam, it is also the largest plastic  automobile part.  HMC has developed a custom closed-loop  recycling system for automotive bumpers  which is designed to handle the complete  recycling process from collection of  bumpers to recycling. A new paint removal  technique has been developed to increase  the bumper recycling rate as well. Instead  of using methylene chloride, the new  technique involves the use of a water-based  alkaline solvent for more effective removal  of the paint. The bumper parts are then  further processed and supplied to vendors  as repair parts. We are also increasing our  design For recycling process  (DfR : Design for Recycling) Apply environmentally friendly design principles 	Apply	design	principles	to 	 parts	that	are	subjected	to 	 recycling design  preparation  stage Incorporate parts with improved environmental characteristics 	Incorporate	new	parts	with 	 improved	recyclability planning  stage Recyclability verification using test vehicles 		Assess	recyclability 	Improve	parts	that	decrease	 	 recyclability	of	the	vehicle 	Provision	of	dismantling		 	 information Simulated recyclability  verification 	Make	changes	to	product		 	 blueprints	to	further	improve		 	 recyclability design  stage mass  production The dwindling natural resource base presents a serious threat to our operations  and the sustainability of the human race. HMC is striving to increase resource  efficiency and realize a recycling-based society. environmental marketing efforts to increase  the use of recycled parts as green parts.  In addition, bumper covers are recycled  to produce Thermo-Plastic Olefin (TPO),  a type of Olefin material with 5 to 35%  rubber content and high impact absorption  characteristics. The TPO material is then  used as a base material for vehicle parts  including wheel guards, mud guards and air  flow ducts. We are in the process of testing  step garnishes, side cowl covers, seat shield  covers, air cleaner housings and several  other parts using the TPO material. We also developed high-efficiency closed  shredding system and re-compounding  technology for achieving desirable strength  and malleability of the material recycled  from scrapped bumper back beams. The  processed material is then used to produce  mass production  preparation stage  Climate Change Recycling Hazardous Materials Air Quality 42 02.2 environment engine under covers and radiator shrouds.  We are also developing materials from  battery trays, engine covers and side covers  for recycling. Recycling Poly-Amid (Nylon)  Materials Primarily used in the powertrain, nylon  materials are plastic-polymers used as  composite materials mixed with glass  and mineral fibers. In order to recycle  nylon materials, they have to be put  through multiple pretreatment stages as  follows: material separation, grinding,  washing, property refinement, and nylon  polymer strength reinforcements. HMC  has developed highly efficient, large- scale recycling processes needed for the  four stages including a friction turning  washer and technology to increase the  molecular weight of nylon polymers, which  are necessary for processing radiator fan  shroud, end tank and airbag bubble sheet  collected for recycling. We plan to use the  recycled materials for parts that require high  elasticity and high durability such as the  wheel covers and canisters.  Design for Recycling (DfR) HMC has made recycling a key guiding  principle in vehicle design in order  to produce vehicles with reduced  environmental impact. In the planning stage,  we are improving the ease of dismantling,  recyclability, and reparability of the  products. We also provide environmentally- friendly design guidelines for parts that are  targeted for recycling, in order to ensure  overall recyclability of the new vehicle  models before finalizing of the design. HMC conducts recyclability verification using  a computerized simulation for all models  produced since 2007 before confirmation  of the final blueprint. The recyclability of  vehicles is verified once again by actually  dismantling test vehicles identical to the  models that have been confirmed to for  mass production.  Improvements are then made for parts  and components that were identified with  problems to ensure greater recyclability in  next-generation models. Recycling of green Vehicle Parts HMC has published a manual for safe  removal of high-voltage lithium ion batteries  used in our hybrid electric vehicles. It was  distributed to all vehicle junkyard operators.  We plan to make a sustained effort to  develop technologies for safe recycling of  rare minerals used in HEV and EV parts. Minimizing Waste Waste streams from automobile  manufacturing consists mostly of waste  paint and thinners from paint shops, and  packaging materials used for shipping parts  including vinyl, paper, wood, and molding  sand used for the production of parts such  as engine cylinders.  All metal scraps are recycled by HMC  and outside recyclers for use in other  industries. In order to reduce waste and  improve recyclability, we have replaced  real-time waste collection methods with  waste recycled  amount  (Global,  in tons) 204,020 343,546 375,834 517,714 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 600,000 '07 '08 '09 '10 total waste  amount  (Global,  in tons) 337,224 438,540 490,630 612,001 100,000 200,000 300,000 0.2 400,000 0.4 500,000 0.6 600,000 0.8 700,000 1.0 0.83 0.96 1.01 0.97 '07 '08 '09 '10 waste generated  per sales (in tons/100 million KRW)  Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 43 02.2 environment largely due to increased construction waste  due to construction of new engine and  transmission production plants. Recycling Water Water is recognized as a resource of  increasing scarcity due to climate change,  population increases and desertification.  According to the UN, more than 1.2 billion  people are suffering from a lack of clean  water. Rainfall in Korea is increasingly  become concentrated in the summer  season, aggravating water shortage  in spring, fall and winter. Increasing  desertification in Africa and the Middle Asia  is also aggravating water supply shortages.  California, U.S., once considered a region of  abundant water resources, is experiencing a  water supply crunch with frequent droughts.  China and India are already suffering from  significant water resource shortages as well.  Water supplies are a particularly difficult  problem to solve because it spans large  geological areas. As a result, water shortages  are expected to worsen in the future.  HMC has been paying great attention to  the water shortage issue because vehicle  production requires a significant amount of  water. Recognizing the need for a reduction  of use as a solution, HMC has implemented  a zero-discharge water circulation system,  which reprocesses and reuses water used  within our plants in Asan, Korea and India,  the two countries which are known for  potential water supply shortages in the  future. The zero discharge system processes  all waste waters within the plant for reuse  and, therefore, does not emit any water  at all to local water bodies. The system is  contributing to increased self sufficiency  and reduction in overall water use.  We have also installed a water reuse system  that reprocesses and recycles vehicle  cleaning water used during the electro- coating process. In addition to water saving  devices implemented at production plants,  we have also installed water saving devices  for bathrooms and other water using  facilities in the HQ building and the R&D  centers to further reduce water use. In 2010, HMCs total global water use was  19.66 million tons, which is 16% up from a  year ago. However, per sale use of water  was 31 tons per 100 million KRW, which was  down 2%. The amount of water resource  recycled at HMC was increased to 1.92  million tons which accounts for 9.7% of  HMCs global water use. The increase was  due to increased water recycling at the  production plant in India. water  recycled   (Global,  in 1,000 tons) 855 1,201 1,219 1,915 500 750 1,000 1,250 1,500 1,750 2,000 '07 '08 '09 '10 sequenced collection methods to improve  the separation and collection efficiency of  different materials. We have also developed  and applied technology for water content  reduction of paint sludge down to 40% in  order to improve incineration efficiency  of the sludge. Installation of waste paint  compression equipment is also contributing  to a reduction in paint waste.  Despite HMCs effort in waste reduction,  the total amount of waste has increased to  612,001 tons, a 24% increase over a year  ago.

We are also collaborating  with suppliers to develop and use alternative materials that are safer for the  environment and people. As global use of chemicals increase,  we are witnessing signs of problems  associated with the use and disposal of  chemicals. As a result, advanced nations  including the European Union, the U.S.  and Canada are increasing efforts to study  issues associated with chemical use and  strengthening restrictions. In July 2003, the  EU passed legislation that limits the use  of four hazardous heavy metals including  lead, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, and  mercury. Then, in June 2007, the EU passed  new chemical management regulation,  named REACH, which requires registration,  evaluation and authorization of chemicals  that are used in the EU region in an amount  greater than one ton per year.   Strict regulations and ban on use of  hazardous materials is increasing. The  Korean government placed a ban on use  of four heavy metals. And the Canadian  government adopted a new policy that  requires companies to report the use of  certain chemicals. The U.S. government  has also placed a ban on the use of ozone  depleting chemicals and launched Green  Chemistry Initiatives. Finally, the Chinese  government has placed a ban on the use  of four heavy metals and bromine flame  retardant. global Ban on Use of Four  Heavy Metals HMC has placed a complete ban on the  use of four heavy metals (lead, mercury,  cadmium, and hexavalent chromium),  which are known to be hazardous to human  health and the environment. Our efforts to  find alternative materials for the four heavy  metals began in 2002. In 2006, we created  a voluntary ban on the use of four heavy  metals with the announcement of the HMC  Global Standard on four Heavy Metals, with  a strict timeline for a phase out of the four  heavy metals. Following the phase out plan,  we first banned use of the heavy metals in  all cars produced for sales in Europe since  July 2003. From January 2008, all HMC  vehicles sold in Korean market were made  free of the four heavy metals. Beginning  in 2009, we achieved a complete ban on  the use of the four heavy metals in all cars  produced in our overseas plants  Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 45 02.3 environment hazardous  chemicals used  (Domestic, in tons) 2,635 2,250 2,520 2,241 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 '07 '08 '09 '10 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.8 1.54 1.35 1.56 1.29 hazardous chemicals management system (e-CMS) Suppliers imDS e-CmS Data Input Download 	Materials	analysis 	Collect	materials	data 	Check	for	use	of	four	heavy	metals 	Establish	materials	data	database 	Analyze	chemical	use	and	conduct		 	 statistical	analysis 	Check	for	regulation	compliance	using		 	 filtering	methods environmental  regulation compliance development of  environmentally  Friendly vehicles Quick update on  current status Responding to EU REACH The EU REACH (Registration, Evaluation and  Authorization of Chemicals) policy became  effective in 2007. Commonly referred to as  the No Data, No Market policy, REACH  requires all companies manufacturing or  importing chemical substances into the EU,  in quantities of one ton or more per year, to  register these substances.  In response to implementation of this  directive, HMC created a chemical  substance management system and a  database containing materials information  in order to reduce not just chemicals  currently subjected to EU REACH but  substances which are likely to be subjected  to restrictions in the future. Prohibition on the Use of  Ozone Depleting Chemicals Ozone Depleting Chemicals (ODC) are  substances that destroy the stratospheric  ozone layer and increase penetration of  ultraviolet light. This, in turn, increases the  risk of skin cancer and causes a negative  impact on the ecosystem. HMC prohibits the  use of ODCs at all of its production facilities  in Korea. We are also monitoring the use of  ODCs by our suppliers. At the same time,  we are attempting to find substitutes for the  few ODCs that are still in use.  Establishment of a  Hazardous Chemicals  Management System A comprehensive electronic database that  tracks data including weight of parts and  materials information is necessary in order  to comply with various regulations on  hazardous chemicals.  In 2004, HMC joined the International  Material Data System (IMDS). The IMDS  system was implemented in domestic  production plants for monitoring new  vehicle models subjected to new regulations  on hazardous materials. We are managing  material information of parts and checking  regulation compliance from as early as the  vehicle development stage, using the IMDS  system. The management scope has been  expanded over time, and now, the system  is used for managing material information  of a greater number of parts including  powertrain components.  We also developed a propriety chemical  management system, e-Chemical  Management System (e-CMS), which  creates a customized database using the  information collected using the IMDS  system. The database is used to check  the use of hazardous substances in parts  and find substitutes for them. To ensure  compliance, a regular check-up system is  also in place at each manufacturing plant to  check for use of hazardous chemicals in the  vehicle manufacturing process. In 2010, use  of hazardous materials in domestic plants  has been reduced by 2,241 tons, down by  11% from a year ago. use oF hazardous  chemicals per vehicle            (kg/vehicle)  46 02.4 environment Vehicle Tailpipe Emission Tailpipe emissions have improved  dramatically, however the increase  in the number of automobiles and  the concentration of populations in  cities have made further improvement  necessary. Consequently, regulation  authorities, particularly those of advanced  economies such as the EU and the US, are  strengthening tailpipe emission standards.  The EU already adopted the Euro 5  standard, which requires new models to  HMC is developing new technologies with a goal of complete elimination of  emissions from both vehicle tailpipes and plants. Currently, we have established  and imposed internal air quality standards for our manufacturing plants that are  more stringent than air quality standards imposed by the regulation authorities.  In addition to strong management of emission sources, we are also concentrating  on the prevention of air pollution. meet more stringent standards for PM and  NOx emissions standard from September  2009 and requires all models to meet the  same standard starting January 2011. The  Euro 6 standard, which requires a 56% cut  in NOx emissions from vehicles compared  to Euro 5, will become effective in 2014.  In the U.S., California is requiring auto  makers to sell an increasing number of  vehicles that meets Zero Emission Vehicle  standards. HMC is making a sustained  investment in vehicle emission reduction  with development of zero emission vehicles  as an ultimate goal. We have developed  and commercially applied a number of  new technologies including optimized  combustion chamber design, high pressure  fuel injection (1,800~2,000 bar), high  efficiency turbocharger, low pressure  exhaust gas recirculation system, catalyzed  NOx reduction system, and achieved  significant emission reduction in our new  diesel vehicle models. In Europe, a number  of Euro 5 compliant diesel models equipped  with U2 and R engines were released  starting 2009. We will continue to develop  emissions reduction technologies and apply  these on our diesel vehicles to meet the  Euro 6 standard prior to its implementation  in 2014. Clean Diesel Engine Although diesel engines are more fuel  Climate Change Recycling Hazardous Materials Air Quality  Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 47 02.4 environment efficient than gasoline engines, diesel engine  exhaust contains higher concentrations of  NOx and PM. However, diesel emissions  can improve significantly using technologies  such as Common Rail Direct injection (CRDi)  system, Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), NOx  catalyst, combustion improvement. In fact, application of various emissions  improvement technologies has improved  our diesel engine fuel efficiency making  it 30% better than comparable gasoline  engines. As a result, our new diesel vehicles  emit up to 20% less CO2 emissions. We have developed Euro 5 compliant clean  diesel engines, the R and U2 engines, and  produced compact car and SUV models for  sales in Europe.  Technology for Reducing NOx  Emission Among the pollutants in diesel exhaust,  soluble organic fraction in CO, HC and PM  are cleaned by the oxidation catalyst. Most  of the PM in the exhaust is removed by  the diesel particulate filter. However, the  solution for achieving 56% reduction in  NOx emissions compared to Euro 5 level,  as required in the Euro 6 standard, is still  under development. HMC has strengthened  its NOx reduction technology research  including the development of the Lean NOx  Trap (LNT), as well as a Low Pressure EGR  System (LP EGR) for application in new  diesel models. The LNT reduces NOx by  absorbing it and gradually treating it when  exhaust has high concentration of fuels,  resulting in a more than 60% reduction. The  LP EGR system reduces emissions including  NOx through recirculation of low pressure  exhaust which has been released from  emissions treatment devices. Minimizing VOCS Release  from Manufacturing Plants Mainly used in paint and during the  painting process to improve quality and  for cleaning painting equipment, volatile  organic compounds (VOCs) are a necessity  in modern auto manufacturing. However,  VOCs are also known to have a negative  impact on the environment and human  health. Therefore, HMC has taken a number  measures to decrease the use of VOCs  and its release. The new paint shop for  manufacture of Genesis model at the Ulsan  plant is an eco-friendly facility designed  to minimize the use of paint and thinner.  A regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO) was  installed to process oven exhaust so that  VOC elements are completely incinerated. In  addition, conversion to water-based paints  has lowered the amount of organic solvents  used per painted area, while the installation  of improved paint booths further reduced  the amount of  VOCs discharged into the  atmosphere during the coating process.  Despite, VOCs released from our plants  in Korea was increased by 9.5% to 8,924  tons in 2010 compared to a year ago due to  increase in production volume. However,  VOCs released per vehicle production  remained at 5.1kg per vehicle.  The majority of recovered organic solvent is  thinner for washing. Since the recovery rate  increases in tandem with usage, the amount  of recovered organic solvents increased  by 10% to 2.51 million tons in 2010 and the  recovery rate was also increased by 1.3%  point to 37.7%. 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.6 6.0 5.8 vocs  emissions (Domestic, in tons) 10,019 9,489 8,148 8,924 3,000 6,000 9,000 12,000 15,000 18,000 '07 '08 '09 '10 air  pollutants  released  (Domestic, in tons) 639 654 599 608 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 '07 '08 '09 '10 5.9 5.7 5.1 5.1 vocs emissions per  vehicle produced (kg/vehicle)  Society We firmly believe that the sustainable growth of a corporate is only possible when  it provides good value to its stakeholders.

We have implemented  support measures for our employees to illuminate their full potential and also help each to live a life of good  health and happiness. Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 51 03.1 Society Employee Status  The total number of employees has  increased to 80,185 as of the end of 2010,  a 2% increase from 2010. More than 70%  of employees (56,461) are stationed in  Korea. The number of employees residing  in Korea has increased because HMC has  expanded its new recruitment program in  order to contribute to the alleviation of the  unemployment situation. The employees  stationed overseas have also increased to  23,724, up 5.4% compared to a year ago.  Increasing Local Hiring  We are steadily hiring an increasing  number of local staff as our operations  are becoming increasingly global. For  example, the number of people employed  in China and India increased slightly to  12,954 contributing to the overall increase.  By contrast, the number of employees  in North America and Europe actually  decreased slightly to 5,005 and 3,974,  respectively. We are expected to hire even  more local employees as our overseas  production and sales activities increase.  Our overseas operations are making a  positive contribution to local communities  by creating jobs and stimulating local  economies.

At the  same time, every region of this globalized  world has its own unique characteristics with  customers with different needs. As a result,  creative ideas and innovations are in greater  demand than ever to ensure satisfaction  over diverse customer groups. Creativity  is nurtured much better in an organization  which consists of members from diverse  backgrounds and life experiences than an  organization full of people with a uniform  culture and experiences. Therefore, we are  striving to nurture an organizational culture  that encourages diversity and creativity. We  will also endeavor to understand different  characteristics of our stakeholders and use  the knowledge in our product development  and corporate activities.   Equal Opportunity: Attracting  female Employees  Due to the auto industry's labor-intensive  job characteristics, the balance of male  and female employees is not very strong  at HMC. The number of domestically  employed female employees increased to  2,321 at the end of 2010, which is equivalent  to 4.1% of the domestic workforce. The  number of female employees increased by  2.6%. However, HMC has been maintaining  a much greater proportion of females, more  than 9%, in new recruits since 2006. In 2010,  female recruits accounted for 12.2% of all  new recruits. In order to improve working  conditions for our female workers, we offer  benefits including monthly days off and  a ninety-day maternity leave. Childcare  Centers have been built at a number of  operation sites for working mothers as well.  Human Resource  Management Strengthening the link between  performance and reward, integrated  human resource management for effective  management of an ever-diversifying global  workforce, and fostering global competency  are the three main goals for HMCs human  resource management. We are also making  a considerable effort to promote diversity  and supporting an aging workforce. HMC  strives to be an equal opportunity employer  and does not discriminate against personal  background factors including race, age,  gender or other factors, in all human  resource management activities including  recruiting. We are also actively protecting  employees from human rights violations.   Open Recruitment HMCs recruitment process follows the rules  and guidelines provided in the corporate  hiring manual and evaluation standards  to ensure fairness and openness. We have  diversified our recruiting venues including  overseas recruiting, internship programs,  and year-round hiring of experienced  workers in order to increase diversity in  workforce. For newly recruited university  graduates, team placement decisions are  made based on a mutual agreement basis  after a series of consultations. no. of fEmalE  EmployEES (Domestic, in persons) 2,270 2,284 2,261 2,321 1,000 1,500 2,000 03 2,500 06 3,000 09 3,500 12 4,000 15 12.2 9.8 9.4 13.0 '07 '08 '09 '10 Change in Proportion of  Females in New Recruit (%)  Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 53 03.1 Society We are also operating a mentoring program,  which assigns an experienced senior staff  member to each new recruit, to help each  get up to speed quickly in his/her new  position.  HMCs equal opportunity employee policies  are strictly observed in overseas business  sites and efforts are made to ensure that all  job candidates are evaluated fairly.  companys intranet. All employees are  evaluated both on their job performance  and their development potential. We also  conduct a 360 degree evaluation to increase  fairness and objectivity in the personal  evaluation. Capacity-building training by  an external training agency is provided for  employees who received unsatisfactory  performance ratings. We recently simplified a three-rank R&D  staff promotion system that consists of  researcher, senior researcher, and chief  researcher positions to a two-rank system  that consists of researcher and head  researcher positions. The new promotion  system reduced pressure of promotion and  allowed each to concentrate on long-term  R&D achievements. Also, the promotion  criteria were changed from the existing  seniority-based system, which favored  researchers with more experience, to an  achievement-based system that favors staff  with significant achievements. Improving Employee Satisfaction HMC has been assessing employee  satisfaction using a customized employment  satisfaction index, the ESI (Employee  Satisfaction Index)  developed in 2008. The  employee satisfaction assessment was  conducted on 25% of all employees with a  total of 82 questions in 13 areas including  job satisfaction, performance evaluation,  compensation, and work environment. The  response rate was 54%. The results indicated  a slight increase in overall job satisfaction  but employee satisfaction for employees  with less experience was lower than the  company average. The survey results are  used as a basis for improving personnel  affairs policy and work environments. Human Rights Protection   We publicly announced the Ethics Charter  which conveyed our commitment to  protecting human rights of all members of  HMC. We have reinforced our commitment  to protect human rights in all our business  Improving an Advanced  Performance Evaluation System  HMCs reward scheme has increased the  link between business performance and  rewards, ensuring that employees are  awarded in respect to their achievements.  For increased transparency and fairness,  we have established a job performance  evaluation system as a part of the   Employees Customers Suppliers Local Communities 54 03.1 Society conduct by selecting People as one of our  new five core values. We are also striving  to promote human rights. For example, all  HMC business units only hire workers who  are of the legal working age and all HMC  employees are working of their free will.  We provide fair compensation for all work  conducted at our business sites according  to work guidelines, compensation policies  and relevant laws instituted in the countries  of operation.  Training programs on human rights,  including mandatory sexual harassment  prevention education, are held annually.  We are also operating an Employee  Complaint Review Committee and an  Employee Complaint Counsel Office  to Ensure speedy resolution of issues.  All overseas operation sites also have  organizations that handle employee  complaints as well. Although legislation on  human rights differs between countries, we  are striving to ensure that all our overseas  sites are managed with the same level of  respect for human rights.    Labor Relations  HMC management fully recognizes freedom  of association, the right to organize, and  the right for collective bargaining. A large  number of HMC employees who work at  domestic sites are members of the HMC  Labor Union. Employee representative  bodies are also organized and function at  our overseas operation sites. The Labor- Management Consultation Committee  represents union members at Hyundai  Motor India (HMI), and the Public Assembly  of Beijing Hyundai Motor Company (BHMC)  represents BHMC employees.  The employees of Hyundai Motor  Manufacturing Czech Republic (HMMC)  have formed a union which has become a  member of the large Czech metal workers  union, OS KOVO. A management-labor  council is also in place where matters  including collective bargaining, settlement  of collective agreements, review of  employee suggestions, and other important  matters are discussed. Salary Negotiations Settled for  Two Consecutive Years without  Strike As Koreas single largest labor union, HMCs  Labor Union has been under pressure to  take action on a large number of social   Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 55 03.1 Society issues that are not always relevant to  HMC. However, labor and management  representatives are working together to  improve the situation and develop forward- looking mutually beneficial relationships.  Following our roadmap for improved  labor relations, we are pursuing a long- term relationship of mutual benefits for  both employees and management through  regular management briefs, special  employee events and earnest discussion  of labor issues. A dedicated Union- management Committee was also created  to ensure the establishment of constructive  employee-management relations. As a result, we were able to settle our 2009  and 2010 salary negotiations without strike,  which demonstrated our improving labor  relations and contributing to improved  brand image to external stakeholders. Supporting Aging Workforce An aging society is an issue that can lead to  complicated issues on many levels including  reduced income for retirees, devaluation  of property, and reduced taxable income  for governments. Similarly, aging in HMCs  workforce has the potential to lead to  lower quality of products and lower overall  competitiveness. In 2010, the average age  of HMC employees engaged in production  activities was 43, and the number of retirees  was 250. We expect the number of retirees  to rise to more than 1,000 per year by 2016.  This mass retirement is expected to have  a significant impact on the companys  operations unless managed carefully.  As a response, we have created the Aging  Workforce Research Collaboration Team  with members of both management and the  labor union. HMC was the first company to  launch such an initiative in Korea. The team  will look into the situation and develop a  response plan to minimize negative impacts  associated with the aging workforce. Human Resource  Development Traditionally, education has been referred  to as a hundred-year issue, emphasizing  the importance of long-term vision and  sustainability.  HMC is striving to support development  of our employees with a well-structured  training program full of specialized training  courses to foster a workforce with strong  understanding in HMCs core values. We are  especially focusing on fostering a workforce  with a global mindset. Our training  programs are designed to focus on four  basic principles including strengthening  integrity, ensuring achievement, nurturing  creativity, and increasing expertise. As  our operation has increasingly become  globalized, we are working hard to provide  education programs designed to nurture  regional experts who understand not only  the local language but the culture, customs  and other factors unique to the local sites  of operation. We are also endeavoring to  help the resident Korean staff at each local  site work as one team with locally hired  workers.   Training Programs The Hyundai/Kia Human Resource Training  Center was created in 2003 by integrating  the independently-operated training units  of HMC and KMC. There are four domestic  training centers in Paju, Osan, Cheonan, and  in the Nambu region. In 2005, an Internet- based e-learning center was established. In  addition to the existing training programs  which focus on capacity building, we  developed a range of training programs in  2010 with a focus on the five core values of  customer, challenge, collaboration, people  and globality. The main courses in the training program  are five core values of education, special  training for high performers, executive  training courses, core capacity training for  job positions, leadership courses, and job  training for experts.  We are strengthening overseas resident  employee training programs to better  support HMCs growing global operations.  For employees sent to overseas offices, we  are providing various courses designed to  better prepare them for different phases  of overseas working from pre-dispatch to  return from overseas service. Moreover,  we are focusing on nurturing regional  experts by strengthening relevant training  programs in order to increase the number  of employees with strong local knowledge  and global competency.  In 2010, the average training hours per  employee was 49, which was identical  to 2009. Training hours for employees  in administrative areas, R&D, sales  and production have increased most  significantly. Global Competency Building The Global Human Resource Development  Standard (GHRDS) was established in  2007, for more structured training and  professional development of our overseas- stationed employees including employees  dispatched to overseas sites as well as  locally-hired personnel. In 2009, an on- line based Global Learning Center was  established, as a part of the strategic  global workforce cultivation program, that  offers courses designed to build common  understanding of HMCs history, vision,  management policies and core values.  The Global Learning Center was also  established for supporting creation of  locally-managed training programs  that meet the status and needs of each  subsidiary. The Global Learning Center  will be further expanded in the future as a  central training resource that contributes  to improved business performance. In  addition, we are operating inward visit  programs for locally hired employees  stationed in overseas regions. Participants  visit domestic business sites including the  R&D center, while experiencing Korean  culture in order to boost understanding of   Employees Customers Suppliers Local Communities 56 03.1 Society Korean culture, foster a one-team spirit, and  strengthen their sense of belonging within  the organization. Foreign language education has been  expanded to further build the global  competency of our domestic workforce. We  extended learning support by offering more  online foreign language courses including  Chinese and English courses. We also  operate offline intensive English courses  and videoconferencing-based foreign  language courses.  Establishment of Global HR  Community Global competency has become an  important development goal for HMC  employees, as HMCs operations are  becoming increasingly globalized. In 2010,  we created the Global HR Community  within the company intranet to help  development of global competency of HMC  employees.  The Global HR Community is full  of information on useful tips based  on experiences of overseas resident  employees, as well as guidelines for  adapting to local communities in overseas  operation sites. The site also offers  administrative support for preparation for  dispatch and return from overseas. Much  of the content is full of lively details on  successes and mishaps because they are  uploaded by HMC employees with relevant  experience. We expect the community  to contribute to increasing the global  competency of HMC employees.  fringe Benefits for Employees  While it is important to be recognized  professionally as a competent worker, it  is equally important to maintain a good  work and life balance. Good work and life  balance can lead to improved quality of life  as well as increased productivity, efficiency  and creativity. HMC is investing significant  resources to provide comprehensive  benefits to help the employees and their  family members enjoy a high quality of life  in good health. HMC provides statutory welfare benefits  such as national health insurance, industrial  accident compensation insurance, national  pension, health care benefits, and  employment insurance. There are also  special employee benefits program. For  example, HMC provides opportunities to  spend quality time with family and friends  by providing paid long-service leave, family- love leave, and a variety of other vacation  programs. Housing and Other Benefits HMC provides employee housing and  dormitories for employees without  house ownership, who are working at  manufacturing plants. Long-term and low  interest housing loans are part of the HMC  benefits package. Such benefits are created  to help our employees fulfill their dream of  owning their own house and living a stable  life. The Saemaul Treasury Fund, which is a  cooperative fund created through employee  savings, is available to employees for  loans and profits are distributed among  employees as dividends.  HMC also operates Employee Assistance  Centers that provides free legal services  and other administrative support such as  issuance of various official documents.

Since 1988, HMC has operated  pension benefits as a measure to provide  social insurance for retirement. Pension  plans consist of both national and personal  pension plans. HMC contributes 20,000  KRW to personal pension for all employees  per month. As for the national pension plan,  each employee pays 9% of their average  salary into the program, HMC pays half  of the pension installment. In 2010, a total  of 219.8 billion KRW was paid to support  employee pension plans. Expense on  pension support is increasing every year.  A new defined-benefit corporate pension  scheme was introduced in 2011, as a  measure for strengthening pensionable  rights. In 2013, employees will be provided  with a defined contribution pension scheme  as an option.  Supporting Leisure Activities HMC strongly supports diverse cultural and  club activities for employees. Such activities  are known to help employees re-energize  themselves and nurture a corporate culture  filled with positive energy and creativity.  Every year, Happy Engine Concerts are  held at local HMC offices around the country  to provide employees opportunities to enjoy  music. HMC also offers an online literature  provision service for employees. Employee family Benefits We believe that family is the core building  block of the society and the foundation of  personal happiness. Therefore, we also  believe that satisfaction of employees  and their family members, who are HMCs  internal customers, are an important source  of our competitiveness. Our employee  benefits package is designed to provide  practical support in areas including education  and cultural experiences. Educational support  is a high priority in our benefit packages, and  we are subsidizing educational expenses  for up to three children per employee from  kindergarten to university.  We are also operating a Hyundai Family  Community program which provides  various educational and cultural programs  for employee families. In addition, we host  The Parents Fair, Summer Camps, and  Childrens Day Fair for participation of all  employees. We are also operating Summer  English Camps for children of HMC  employees to help them learn English for  free.  Employees Customers Suppliers Local Communities 58 03.1 Society Safety & Health Assuring employee health and safety is an essential  part of corporate social responsibility and a source of  competitiveness. HMC has been making a sustained  effort to provide a safe and healthy working environment  since its incorporation. Since assuring employee safety  is our highest priority, we are taking various measures  including industrial safety pre-assessment, accident  prevention activities, and increased investment in safety  improvement facilities and safety training. In addition,  we are also operating an Industrial Health and Safety  Center, a Health Fitness Center, and free health check- ups for better health of our employees.   Safety Due to the industrial characteristics of the auto  manufacturing business, HMC employees face a higher  risk of industrial accidents compared to other industries.  Therefore, the company is strengthening safety training  to lower employee exposure to risk. In addition to  safety training, we are continuously improving facility  safety, as well as changing physically demanding  processes in order to create a pleasant and safe  working environment. In 2010, the accident rate slightly  increased to 1.60% from the previous years rate of 1.45%.  Sustained efforts will be made to further improve safety  to bring it down to the average industrial accident rate  of 1.23% in Korean manufacturing industry. Establishment of Occupational Safety and  Health Management System HMC has established a KOSHA 18001 (18001 OSHAS  in overseas) certified Occupational Health and Safety  Management System in domestic production plants. The  system is operated in conjunction with the i-ESH (http:// iesh.hmc.co.kr) to maximize synergy effect in integrated  safety, health and environmental management.

In addition, we are conducting a detailed  risk assessment on works and production  processes every three years. The risk  assessment procedure is updated every  three years to reflect the changes made in  work environment including work methods  and technology advancement. Safety Management System Each business unit at HMC operates a  separate ESH  Team for rigorous safety  management. We also have a Safety Health  Team staffed with qualified professionals  including a professional physician who  offers health consultation services to  employees as well. Furthermore, the  Industrial Safety and Health Committee,  which is comprised of equal numbers of  labor and management representatives, is  in operation for handling decisions on the  company's ESH polices and other key issues  to better prevent safety-related accidents  and improve overall workplace safety. Managing Employee Health The good health of employees is essential  for strong productivity and performance.  HMC provides regular health check-ups  for all employees, in addition to collecting  health data to control and better prevent  illness in advance. HMC currently operates  an Industrial Health and Safety Center  which provides a comprehensive range of  medical services. We are also operating a  Health Fitness Center to help our employees  maintain a healthier life. free Health Check-ups Free health check-ups are provided  biennially to administrative workers and  annually to plant and R&D workers. HMC  is the first company in Korea to provide  a Chinese medicine check-up program as  an option to its regular medical check-up  program. For employees over the age of 35,  as well as their families, full health check- up programs are provided. Through our  on-line medical service site, Online Med,  our employees can conveniently make  arrangements for full health checks at their  hospital of choice at a time of their own  convenience. Prevention of  Work Place  Accidents and Provision of  Advanced Medical Support HMC operates an Industrial Medical Center  and Medical Clinic in every domestic  manufacturing plant and at the Namyang  R&D Center as a part of the industrial  accident prevention program. Each site also  has a 24-hour emergency clinic in operation.  Our Industrial Medical Centers have a  comprehensive set of facilities including a  physical therapy room, a clinical laboratory,  and a radiation room. Employees working  at HMC and its suppliers can receive a full  range of medical services in preventive  medicine and diagnosis, in addition to  treatment of various diseases.  The center also conducts annual regular and  special check-ups for employees working  in hazardous environments and provides  additional medical services based on the  check-up results. On average, about 100,000  HMC employees and supply company  employees visit the Industrial Medical  Center for medical services each year. Strengthening Health Care  Measures to Protect Rapidly Aging  Workforce HMC is taking strong measures to address  chronic diseases such as high blood  pressure, dyslipidmia, diabetes and other  diseases that are becoming more prevalent  especially among the older population.  This is a serious concern for HMC as the  average age of our employees is increasing  especially at the Ulsan plant. Employees  who have been diagnosed with symptoms  are placed in a health management program  and receive monthly medical check-ups  and treatments. The employees under  management are excluded from working  overtime to ensure speedy recovery. Thanks  to comprehensive management, 90% have  shown positive progress. Since 2004, health treatment services are  being provided to employees suffering  from muscular skeletal diseases. By the  end of 2010, a total of 5,380 employees  had received health treatment services  for muscular skeletal diseases, and the  symptoms in 97% have been improved as a  result of treatment received during working  and off hours. A small number of workers  have been identified officially as patients  suffering from occupational injuries.  Companies exist for customers and therefore, customer satisfaction  is the highest value for all companies. Understanding the customers  perspective is the most essential prerequisite for producing services and  products of the highest quality. HMC will continue to uphold customer- first management as a core principle and listen to customer opinions. customers Employees Customers Suppliers Local Communities 60 03.2 Society Quality first Management Quality is the most important characteristic of an automobile because it directly affects  customer safety. HMC recognizes that the production of vehicles with superior quality and  reliability is our fundamental duty to our customers, as well as a key in raising customer  satisfaction. Therefore, a strong effort in quality improvement has been made ever since the  launch of the quality improvement initiative in 1999. In 2002, the quality management teams  at HMC and KMC were merged into the Hyundai-Kia Quality Management Division under  the direct supervision of the HMC chairman himself. In 2003, we created two new quality  management units for ensuring the quality of cars exported to the North American market.  The quality management and maintenance teams were also merged to ensure more effective  operations. In 2004, the Global Quality Management Office was established for the purpose of  responding to various quality problems reported any day of the year, 24-hours a day. Our  CEOs strong will to instill quality-first management was essential in deeply rooting the  importance of quality management within the corporate culture. Currently, top executives  meet twice a month to discuss quality management issues. Frequently, meetings by top  executives foster a sense of shared responsibility, and have made quality a high-priority issue  for all divisions within HMC including R&D, production, purchasing, financial administration  and sales. In 2009, HMC launched the Global Quality 3355 campaign aimed for ensuring  our vehicles to be ranked within in top three in terms of product quality in three years and  ranked within top five emotional quality in five years. The new initiative has created strong  momentum for HMCs quality improvement effort. In 2010, we also strengthened our quality- focused marketing effort with a goal of positioning HMC as a Best Buy Brand. In addition to  improving product quality from a manufacturers perspective, we are also improving vehicle  characteristics that affect the emotional quality of our vehicles.   Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 61 03.2 Society  Employees Customers Suppliers Local Communities 62 03.2 Society Improving Customer Satisfaction  on Quality Many HMC vehicles have been ranked  highly in the Initial Quality Study (IQS)  conducted by JD Power, an U.S.-based  global marketing information services  company. HMC scored 102 PP (Problems  per 100 Vehicles) in the 2010 IQS study as a  brand, which placed HMC in 3rd rank in non- luxury brand category. In terms of vehicle  models, the Accent was the segment winner  for the sub-compact car category. Our  vehicles also performed favorably on JD  Powers Vehicle Dependability Study (VDS),  scoring148 PP. As a result, HMC was ranked  in 6th in the non-luxury brand category,  well above the industry average VDS score.  The study, which measures problems  experienced by the original owners of three- year-old vehicles, includes 201 different  problem symptoms across all areas of the  vehicle. Overall dependability is determined  by the number of problems experienced  per 100 vehicles (PP 100), with a lower  score indicating higher quality. Established  in 1968, the JD Power is a marketing  information services company specializing  in consumer satisfaction surveys of the  automobile market and their results are one  of the key references for consumers making  a purchasing decision on new vehicles. Improving Customer  Satisfaction    HMC has been operating a customer service  center that handles customer complaints  and inquiries since 1995. Customers can  either call or post inquiries on the customer  service web site to file complaints and  receive expert assistance on problems  they are experiencing.

The survey collects customer opinions in four areas  including product quality, sales service, maintenance service and  corporate image. The data is then analyzed to calculate an HCSI  score and also to identify areas for improvement. HMC scored  64.3 points in 1999 and 79.2 points in 2010. In addition to its use in  improving specific business processes, the survey result is also used  as a basis for policy decision in overall business practices. We also  pay close attention to the customer satisfaction surveys conducted  by external organizations including the National Customer  Satisfaction Index (NCSI) by the Korea Productivity Center, the  Korean Customer Satisfaction Index (KCSI) survey conducted by the  Korea Management Association Consulting (KMAC), and the Korea  Standard Service Quality (KSSQ) Index conducted by the Korea  Standards Association.    Employees Customers Suppliers Local Communities 64 03.2 Society Customer Service HMC has established a national  maintenance network that consists of  23 regional maintenance service centers  and 1,400 affiliated maintenance service  providers as of December 2010. The regional  service centers have internal High-tech  Centers equipped with cutting-edge  equipment capable of the detailed analysis  needed for the provision of precision  maintenance services.  In 2007, HMC launched a premium  membership service called BLU Service  in Korea for both existing HMC vehicle and  new owners. The members can receive  comprehensive vehicle maintenance  services including annual vehicle check- ups, an integrated bonus point system,  membership benefits and more.  In 2011, HMC launched a new Home to  Home repair service for the collection  of vehicles at a time and location of the  customers choice and then, returning the  vehicles when the repair work is completed.  It is a premium service unique to HMC  customers. We introduced new services in  the past as well. For instance, HMC launched  Before Service in 2006; a new concept that  offers maintenance services before they  are reported. Such a service has never been  offered in the industry before. In 2010, more  than 9,500 customers benefited from this  free check-up service. An extensive maintenance service network,  which consists of more than 6,200 service  providers equipped with cutting-edge  equipment and manned by highly capable  HMC-certified technicians, are in operation  in more than 190 countries as of December  2010. HMC is operating a Global Service  Support Center to ensure the highest  quality service by the providers.  The Before  Service program for overseas customers  was launched in 2007 and more than 3.39  million customers benefited from free  check-up services in 2010 alone. When a series of customer complaints and  repair records indicate a significant quality  issue, we conduct an internal assessment  and announce a voluntary recall when it is  deemed necessary.  In 2010, a problem with door locks in 46,363  2010 Sonata models, produced between  September 3 and December 6, 2009, was  identified through an internal assessment  following customer complaints. The door  lock system design was immediately  changed to solve the problem and a  voluntary recall was announced in Korea  and the U.S. to repair Sonata models  manufactured before the change was made.  As a result, 41,931 vehicles, 90.4% of the  recalled units, have been repaired. Customer Data Protection With the increasing importance of  protecting personal information and the  growing occurrences of data leaks, HMC  is striving to reinforce the protection of  customer information. Customer data is  managed according to rigorous internal  security regulations, while the use of such  data is strictly limited in purpose and scope.  Outside agent companies on consignment  are required to abide by personal  informational protection guidelines, and  once the consignment duties are concluded,  customer data is fully retrieved and  home  to  home  serviceS  Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 65 03.2 Society destroyed to avoid any privacy leaks.  HMC employees working in the department  in charge of managing customer  information, as well as users of operations  systems receive relevant training at least  once every quarter. HMC also has in place  a Database Secure System (DSS) to ensure  stronger protection of personal information  on the Internet. Vehicle Safety Vehicle safety is the most important  development priority for all HMC vehicles.  Most automobile safety technologies  including airbags, seat belts, and ultra high- strength auto bodis are defensive and  passive in nature with a focus on minimizing  damage from accidents. However, safety  technologies such as intelligent safety  systems capable of detecting a possible  accident and activating measures to prevent  accidents are becoming more proactive  in nature, leading to ultimate protection  of drivers and passengers, as well as  pedestrians. HMC is increasing production  of vehicles equipped with cutting-edge  safety features. For example, the new  Elantra launched in 2010 is equipped  with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System,  Emergency Stop Signaling, Vehicle Dynamic  Control, and a Vehicle Stability Management  System. We will increase the application of  intelligent safety systems, which have been  traditionally reserved for large vehicles, in  smaller vehicles. Vehicle Safety Assessment HMC conducts a great number of collision  and road tests to develop vehicles with  the highest safety. As a result, our vehicles  score highly in vehicle safety assessment  tests worldwide. In Korea, Sonata and  Elantra won the 2010 Safe Car of the Year  in their respective segments in the New Car  Assessment Program (NCAP) conducted by  the Korea Automobile Testing & Research  Institute under the supervision of Koreas  Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime  Affairs. The two models also won   five stars () for both driver and  passenger safety, which was assessed  through frontal, rear and offset collision  tests.

Smart vehicle  Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 67 03.3 Society Three Core Strategies for  Shared Growth We have been operating various  supplier support programs in areas  including financial support, as well as the  establishment of a global management  system, in order to sustain the sound  growth of our suppliers as independent  companies. In 2010, HMC began to implement our new  shared growth strategy which builds on our  supplier partnership founded on a mutually- beneficial cooperation initiative. The new  strategy focuses on supporting the growth  of our suppliers in becoming globally- recognized partners through a combination  of support programs. HMC has identified  global competency building, strengthening  of a sustained growth foundation, and the  establishment of a shared growth system  as the three core strategies for realizing  shared growth with suppliers. We then  launched technical assistance programs for  quality improvement as well as overseas  sales expansion support. Various programs  were also launched to foster a corporate  culture that embraces the concept of shared  growth. An automobile is created from thousands of parts from various suppliers; it is the creation of a collaborative effort  between a car company and a large number of suppliers. Naturally, competition in the automotive market is  fought by both automakers and suppliers in partnership. As a manufacturer on the forefront of competition, HMC  is implementing fair trade practices in conjunction with suppliers to foster a stronger partnership. We are also  providing supplier support for quality, technology and environmental management to increase the competitiveness  of our key suppliers. suppliers fostering Global Competency of  Suppliers Supplier support programs for fostering  global competency includes technology  development support, quality management  capacity building, and productivity  improvement support programs.  We were already operating a number of  supplier support programs including the  Guest Engineer program, on-site training  for second-tier suppliers, and supplier  participation in R&D Motor Show. In  addition to these programs, we established  the Supplier R&D Support Corps, the  Supplier Quality Management Training  Center, and a number of tailored policies for  different types of suppliers in order to boost  technological competency and product  quality. In 2010, we held our first R&D Motor Show  during which suppliers were briefed on  features of recently released competitor  models. Designed as one of the first  Shared Growth programs, the Motor  Show contributed to capacity building of  supplier employees in charge of R&D and  quality management.  It was a great success  which included the participation of 2,438   Employees Customers Suppliers Local Communities 68 03.3 Society employees from 252 first and second tier  suppliers. The Supplier R&D Support Corps,  which is staffed by 270 members including  40 full-time staff, is another important  organization established for on-site support  of R&D activities and the realization of  improved quality by transferring HMCs R&D  expertise to suppliers. The Supplier Quality Management Training  Center was established to foster capacity for  enhanced quality management and offers  Quality Management Expertise courses for  supplier company staff in charge of product  quality management. The courses are  evaluated thoroughly using feedback from  participants in order to ensure effectiveness. Strengthening a Sustained Growth  foundation We are operating various support programs  for strengthening of a sustained growth  foundation including overseas sales  expansion support, financial stability  improvement, and the establishment of  infrastructure for growth. Sub-programs for  overseas sales expansion support includes  collaborated overseas business expansion  with HMC, increased use of second and  third-tier supplier products in overseas  plants, and direct assistance for overseas  sales to othter auto companies. We are also operating a proxy purchasing  program, through which, HMC purchases  a large volume of steel at low price and  provides them to suppliers at zero margin.  We also revamped Green Partnership  Activities for providing expert advice on  greener business management. A Shared  Growth Academy was also established  to help suppliers achieve greater stability  in their business operations. Sharing  information and supporting R&D activities  on new environmental technologies and  facilities is an important area of focus for  our supplier support program. Establishment of a Shared Growth  System HMC has organized a Win-Win Supplier  Consultation Group, which consists  of suppliers from all tiers in order to  strengthen the network among suppliers,  provide stronger support for second- tier suppliers, and foster a shared culture  of growth. Overall, we are aiming for  the Establishment of a Shared Growth  System. Specifically, we have increased  support for information exchange sub- groups which consist of members of the  consultation group who belong to the same  region or industry sectors. HMC staff also  visit suppliers to foster a network among  suppliers of similar industry sectors. Establishment of a Shared Growth Website  and the Supplier Volunteer Corps are new  initiatives designed to promote a culture  of shared growth among suppliers. HMC  is also increasing supplier visits to listen  to their concerns and ideas more closely  in order to ensure the effectiveness of our  supplier support programs. Provision of Environmental  Standards Guidelines for  Suppliers In 2007, HMC signed an environmentally- friendly parts supply agreement with first  tier suppliers and provided guidelines on  environmental and ethical management  practices.  We also announced the HMC Environmental  Standards Guideline which contains  information on the set of environmental  requirements for manufacturing of auto  parts to be used in our products. The  HMC Environmental Standards provide  guidelines on materials prohibited from  use including four heavy metals (Lead,  Mercury, Cadmium, Hexavalent Chromium)  and other hazardous materials subjected to  regulations. The guideline provides a wide  array of information including a data entry  method for the International Material Data  System (IMDS) for calculating a vehicle  recyclability score as well as Material Safety  Data Sheet (MSDS) management, which are  both necessary for ensuring compliance of  applicable environmental regulations. We are also encouraging all suppliers to  earn ISO 14001 environmental management  certification. As a result, 100% of our first  tier suppliers have received certification as  of the end of 2010.  green partnership program Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report 69 03.3 Society grEEn parTnErSHip  program aT a glacE supply Chain  environmental management supply Chain  eco-Partnership supply Chain  Carbon management Establishment of Supplier  Environmental Management  Structure 2003.7~2006.6 Transfer of Environmental  Management Knowledge to  2nd & 3rd Tier Suppliers 2006.4~2008.3 Support Suppliers Establish  Carbon Management System 2008.11~2010.10 SCEM SCEP SCCM SCEM:  Supply chain Environmental   management project In 2003, HMC launched the Supply Chain  Environmental Management (SCEM) project  with a goal of strengthening supplier capacity  to meet environmental regulation standards  and to compete internationally. Fifteen suppliers  participated in the project and the Korea National  Clean Production Center participated as a  supervisory body. The SCEM project was launched  in July 2003 and was successfully completed  in June 2006, developing an excellent example  of a multi-stakeholder win-win collaboration  effort involving the participation of HMC, expert  organizations, academia and suppliers. The suppliers that participated in the project were  able to establish an improved environmental  management structure for cleaner production  and the development of more environmentally- friendly products. The project also resulted in both  environmental benefits such as reduction of waste  and economic benefits of cost reduction. Building  on the success of the project, HMC created the  SCEM Network System designed to continue  improving environmental management capacity  of suppliers by increasing information exchange  among suppliers in topics including green  management success stories and environmental  regulation updates.  Since 2003, HMC has invested a total of 5 billion KRW in our Supply Chain Green Partnership Program in  collaboration with the Korean government to help under-resourced suppliers establish an effective green  business management system. SCEP:  Supply chain Eco-partnership     project The Supply Chain Eco-Partnership (SCEP) project  was launched in April 2006 as a two year program,  following successful completion of the Supply  Chain Environmental Management (SCEM)  project. The objective of the SCEP project was to  transfer of environmental management knowledge  to HMCs second and third-tier suppliers.  During the project, HMC helped suppliers  create a foundation for the establishment of an  environmental management system by providing  guidance on hazardous materials management,  manufacturing processes improvement and  energy management. The project took advantage of the supplier  network established through the SCEM project in  order to promote active communication among  suppliers and improve the efficiency of each  supplier's environmental management operations.  The project also allowed HMC to categorize  suppliers by sector (parts and materials), size  (large, medium and small), and environmental  management capacity (high, middle and low) and  then develop customized green management  models applicable to each supplier. The models  will continue to serve as a basis for development  of tailored green management models for different  suppliers. SCCM:  Supply chain carbon        management project In November 2008, the Supply Chain Carbon  Management (SCCM) project was launched in  order to further strengthen the green partnership  established through the SCEM and SCEP projects  in addition to establishing a carbon footprint  management structure. The two year project was  designed with four core modules including the  establishment of a carbon management structure,  reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) via process  improvement, assessment of the supplier product  carbon footprint, and total carbon footprint  assessment of the complete vehicle. Suppliers  who participated in the project established a  working carbon management structure with GHG  emissions inventory, GHG emissions reduction  strategies, and a detailed implementation plan.  Overall, a total CO2 reduction of 16,187 tons was  achieved by participating suppliers as a result of  the project.  communities As a responsible global corporate citizen, we are conducting a wide range of social  contribution activities tailored to the needs of local communities of our operation in the spirit  of our CSR slogan Moving the world together. local 70 Traffic Safety Making Streets Safer, Happy Way Drive Campaign It is our firm belief that adults are always wholly responsible for traffic  accident involving children. As a car company, HMC is endeavoring to  improve traffic safety and driving culture in order to protect children  from traffic accidents.  More than 80% of children involved in traffic accidents are preschool  children. HMC has been operating the Happy Way Drive Campaign  since 2008, which is a traffic safety promotion program designed  for preschool children by distributing angel wing-shaped boarding/ unloading stickers on nursery and kindergarten buses to remind  drivers to take extra caution around the bus and contribute to the  reduction of traffic accidents. By March 2011, a total of 4,235 safety  stickers (also known as the Angel Wings) have been attached to  preschool commuting buses. HMC also visits these nurseries to  provide traffic safety education.  We also appointed popular animation character Poli as honorary  ambassador of traffic safety, and it is now used on childrens safety  equipment and traffic safety promotion DVDs that help children  learn about traffic safety. In addition, HMC has operated a variety of  traffic safety program for children. For example. there are  the Zero  Accident Childrens Traffic Safety Campaign, the Interactive Traffic  Safety Education Class Program, and dissemination of traffic safety  education materials to increase safety awareness. In 2009, we also  established the Kids Auto Park, which is the largest interactive theme  park designed for traffic safety education in Korea.

I can reduce traffic accidents. I am serving my community in  collaboration with police. Its a great  experience.  I even get scholarship for doing this. I feel very lucky. - a. ayyamuthu, a college Student member  of Hyundai Student Traffic volunteers Scholarship Scheme (Hmi) Bringing Order to the Street –  Hyundai Student Traffic Volunteers  Scholarship Scheme Traffic accidents are increasing rapidly in  India where automobiles, motorbikes and  pedestrians often share roads without  traffic lights. It truly has become a national  problem. As a car maker, Hyundai Motor  India (HMI) feels obliged to take action.  In 2006, HMI established the Hyundai  Student Traffic Volunteers Scholarship  Scheme to alleviate traffic situations. The  volunteer corps consists of college students,  and they work with local police to help  manage traffic, after receiving training. The  program is also designed to help bright  students experiencing financial difficulties  as they receive scholarships for their college  tuition.  The 5th Student Traffic Volunteers  Scholarship Scheme was launched in  August 2010. The 5th corps consisted of  120 members selected from a pool of 325  applicants. The volunteers provide their  service during peak traffic times leading to  reduced traffic accidents. Their service is  much appreciated by their communities.  The program addresses multiple social  issues by combining traffic safety  improvement measures with educational  support and scholarships for students in  need, and it is well received as an exemplary  social contribution activity. As of 2010, 400  Indian students have served as volunteer  traffic wardens. HMI has already launched  the volunteer traffic warden program in  Chennai and Kolkata. The program will  expand to more cities including Mumbai  and Hyderabad. by a committee, which consists of experts  who specialize in supporting people with  disabilities, the elderly, as well as children  and youth. The proposals are then selected  and approved for funding via a fair review  process. The contest is designed to enable  implementation of promising social  welfare projects. The committee selects  specialized projects with highest potential  to make practical impact and feasibility for  implementation. In 2010, the committee  approved a total of 45 projects designed  for supporting people with disabilities, the  elderly, as well as children and youth. In  addition, a number of Regional Support  Network projects that focus on the  provision of comprehensive support to  beneficiaries in partnership with regional  social welfare centers were also approved.             03.4 Society  Global :   72 1.

Environment Restoring Native Species for  Healthier Ecosystem –  Green Zone Korea It used to be rather difficult to fall asleep in  summer nights in country areas because  of incessant chirping of frogs. Today, we  can hardly hear such chirping even in  remote country towns. Many native species  are disappearing from us due to factors  including habitat loss, climate change,  proliferation of invasive species and  pollution. Since each species play a crucial  role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem,  their existence is a must requirement  for a healthy ecosystem. In addition to  promoting protection of habitat as one of  our business management principles, we  are also conducting projects to increase  local biodiversity. The Green Zone Korea project, launched  in 2005, was the first eco-restoration project  aimed at restoring endangered species  in the Ulsan area. In the first phase, we  focused on reintroduction of Myungju  butterfly (Sericinus swallowtail butterfly).  Six natural habitats for the butterfly species  were created within the premise of Ulsan  city and project led to successful restoration  of the butterfly species.  We are currently working on restoration of  Taehwa river ecosystem as second phase  project. First, we reintroduced mitten crabs  which is known as the cleaner of the  environment. Then we restored Korean Rose  Bitterling, a flagship species of  Taehwa river  which only live in Korea and Bath White,  an endanger butterfly species which is also  a known environmental quality indicator  species. By the way, we built Ecology Learning  Centers, where visitors can learn about  reintroduction process of Myungju butterfly,  in Ulsan, Asan and Jeonju. In 2010, we  also created a 1,500m2 Butterfly Ecology  Park within the Ulsan Taehwa Grand Park  with the Ulsan city government. Spanning  16,154ft in area, the park is created to  resemble a natural habitat for the Myungju  butterfly as well as three other butterfly  species including Blue-striped swallowtail,  Papilionidae and  Yellow swallowtail, which  are known to be only found in Ulsan and  only a handful of other regions. Turning Desert into Green Pasture –  the Project Green Zone China Desertification is happening at a most  rampant rate in China. More than 20% of  Chinese territory has already turned into  desert and the amount is increasing every  year. According to the UNEP, about 13% of  desertification happens naturally, however  the rest, 87%, is due to anthropogenic  influences. Most of the desert in China is  located in the Inner Mongolia (Neimenggu)  region, and they are expanding every  year. Expansion of desert areas in China is  increasing in frequency and the intensity of  yellow dust storms that cause respiratory  disease, as well as environmental damage  to countries in North East Asia including  China and Korea. In order to mitigate desertification in China,  HMC launched the Hyundai Green Zone  China project in 2007.  The project involves  creating a grassland larger than 50km2 in  Chakanor, an area within the Kunshantag  desert in Inner Mongolia (Neimenggu),  China, to prevent further desertification in  the area and to the restoration of the local  ecosystem. During phase 1 of the project,  the project implementer planted indigenous  plant seeds that grow well in the regions  alkali soil. Multiple layers of wood fences  were also erected in the planting area to  prevent seed erosion due to strong winds. Social Enterprise Easy Move Social enterprises help people support  themselves by creating jobs. HMC  established the social enterprise Easy  Move which specializes in production of aid  equipment for the disabled in August 2010,  in collaboration with the Gyeonggi province  government. We plan to employ more  than 200 people for the operation and will  allocate 80 jobs to people with disabilities,  as well as retirees.  Easy Move is designed to help those who  have been marginalized by society by  providing job opportunities in a company  which produces aid and rehabilitation  equipment for the disabled. Easy Move  serves the dual purpose of creating jobs  and products that are also designed to help  others. It is recognized as a model social  enterprise. HMC plans to invest 2.9 billion KRW in  Easy Move over the next three years. Easy  Move will produce a large range of aids/ rehabilitation products for the disabled with  a target of achieving 18 billion KRW in sales  by 2012. HMC Joins the 2010 White Band  Campaign for Global Eradication  of Poverty Poverty continues to be a serious problem  in many regions, and there still many  who do not have enough to eat.

Companies and  individuals from more than 100 countries  participated in this initiative by wearing  a white band with End Poverty on it.  Many HMC employees of major overseas  operation sites including the U.S., Germany,  China, India and the Czech Republic have  been participating in the White Band  Campaign since 2009.

Increasing greenhouse gas  concentrations is known as the main culprit  of global warming and carbon dioxide  (CO2) accounts for 80% of human-caused  greenhouse gas emissions.  What can we do to reduce CO2? Finding  replacements to fossil fuel is the key, but we  are unlikely to find a practical replacement  anytime soon. What can we do instead?  The answer lies in trees. Unlike animals  and insects, trees and plants convert CO2 to  oxygen. Therefore, more trees means less  CO2 and more oxygen. Hyundai Motor America (HMA) began its  tree planting initiative with the Genesis  Forest Project in 2008. The project was  designed to offset the CO2 emitted by the  Genesis in 2009 by permanently preserving  3,000 acres of tropical forest in Brazil.  HMA has also launched the Climate  Grants program in addition to the review  of project proposals for forest protection  and reforestation. A number of carbon  offset projects were submitted, and HMA  approved an annual funding of 35,000 U.S.  dollars for projects in Alto Mayo in Northern  Peru, Nhambita in Mozambique, and in the  Kakamega forest in Kenya. HMC will continue to support reforestation  and forest protection projects in order to  reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Education  fostering future Leaders in a  Globalized World – The Happy  Move Global Youth Volunteers Since 2008, HMC has been operating the  Happy Move Global Youth Volunteers with  an aim of developing future global leaders,  and to raise HMCs contribution to the global  community. A total of 1,000 students are  selected each year and sent to India, China,  and the Czech Republic where HMC has  offices and factories, during summer and  winter breaks, to perform volunteer services  such as cultural exchanges, health services,  and other volunteer activities.  By providing hands-on experience in local  communities worldwide, this program  enables young students from Korea to  broaden their worldview and to better  understand the meaning of social corporate  responsibility of global corporations in a  globalized world. In addition, HMC provides internship  opportunities and holds annual marketing  and technology contests to provide hands- on learning opportunities in job areas of  their interest. Its great to have desks and chairs  at school. I am so happy Hyundai Motors India (HMI) has been  operating a number of educational support  activities including improving school  facilities, job training and employment  opportunities for students in impoverished  areas. Due to the increasing wealth divide,  school facilities in poor neighborhoods are  far from ideal. In general, school facilities  of public schools are significantly worse  than that of private schools. In fact, many  schools do not have desks and chairs, and  young children have no choice but to sit  on the floor. HMI decided to address this  problem by donating desks and chairs for  school children in schools near Chennai. The  desks and chairs are made using recycled  wood from the wooden boxes which were  used for shipping parts, which make the  donation not just socially beneficial, but also  environmentally positive. HMI is also operating technical job training  programs and providing automotive  experiment equipment  for schools in the  Assam region located in North Eastern  India. A number of Automotive Job  Training Centers have been established in  major Indian cities to foster maintenance  technicians throughout India. The center has  helped many local citizens to find a job in  automotive sector. Medical Support A Journey of Hope for Childhood  Cancer Awareness-Hyundai Hope  on Wheels Thanks to advances in research and  treatment, many children with cancer are  successfully treated. However, there are  many children who are still struggling to  fight this disease. For those, HMA has  once again launched its twelfth Hyundai  Hope on Wheels campaign to encourage  these children to win their fight and raise  awareness of childhood cancer. Brianna  Commerford, 12, who battled Stage IV  Hodgkins Lymphoma when she was just  10 years old, and is now healthy and in  remission, joins the campaign as our  new honorary ambassador. She has been  visiting more than 40 childrens hospitals  across the country and sharing her story to  spread awareness and help bring hope to  other children facing cancer.

By the  end of 2010, Hyundai Hope on Wheels  donated more than 23 million dollars  to support childhood cancer research at  childrens hospitals across the country since  1998. HMA joined the fight against pediatric  cancer in 1998 through the efforts of Boston- area HMA dealers and the leadership of   Tom OBrien, who raised funds benefiting  the Jimmy Fund at the Dana-Farber Cancer  Institute.

It is a  popular sport for African children regardless  of where they live. Some young players  play football with a dream of becoming a  professional player and escaping poverty.  As an official sponsor of the 2010 World  Cup, HMC aims to roll out football fever to  children with limited access to sports and  educational opportunities right across the  continent with the launch of the One Million  Dream Balls for Africa project. Each ball bore a donors name, and anyone  who registered as a member of HMCs  2010 FIFA World Cup micro-website or  anyone who bought a Hyundai car from  the companys worldwide sales network  become a donor. More than 240,000 donors  participated in the project, and one million  soccer balls were donated to Africa through  the United Nations. HMC also held the Africa Road  Tour in six  countries including South Africa, Nigeria,  Ghana, Algeria, Morocco and Egypt. More  than 30,000 soccer balls were handed over  to African children during the road show.   Many African children suffer from poverty.  We hope the One Million Dream Balls for  Africa help them find time to feel the joy  of sports and also help them dream of a  brighter future. We wish to convey a message of hope and dreams to children  in Africa through One Million Dream Balls for Africa project.  As a global company, HMC will continue its efforts to fulfill its  corporate social responsibilities worldwide. - Seung-suk yang, president & cEo Hyundai motor company 12.

Hyundai Hope on Wheels for pediatric  cancer awareness and fund-raising for pediatric  cancer research.     interview HMAs success has been extraordinary since the U.S. financial crisis.  What do you consider the most important aspects leading to this  success even in these difficult times? Weve been focused on a simple operating philosophy at HMA since 2008 that frames all  of our business decisions. We call it ABC, which stands for Assurance, Blue Drive, and  Connection. Assurance represents all that we do to build trust with consumers.  Its the  first step in establishing a relationship with prospective owners.  Weve expanded the  idea of Assurance from our successful job-loss vehicle return program, to an umbrella  program that also includes Americas Best Warranty, our industry-leading Roadside  Assistance Program, and our strong safety and quality record. Blue Drive represents the  bold commitment weve made as a company to be the global eco-leader, and to lead the  industry in fuel economy. This provides benefits to society and consumers alike, and has  been a strong focus of our marketing and PR efforts. Connection speaks to the efforts  were making as a company to deliver products and services that consumers truly desire,  in keeping with our Modern Premium positioning.   HMA announced its 2025 average fuel efficiency target of 50 mpg in  2010. What would be the key measures for achieving the target? With the support of HMC senior management, HMA has set a target of at least 50 mpg  by 2025. While that seems like an extraordinary goal, it is our culture at Hyundai to set  stretch targets - goal that we do not know specifically how to achieve, but that by their  very boldness will drive us to innovative solutions that get us there. For our 50 mpg  target, it helps to keep in mind how far we have already come, thanks to the engineering  excellence and dedication of Hyundais R&D Team. Our new Elantra already achieves  a corporate average fuel economy contribution of 44.4 mpg. When we consider that  Elantra has an EPA mid-size car classification, and thus represents a likely mid-point of  the U.S. car market in 2025, it seems well within our capabilities to take our average fuel  efficiency level over 50 mpg in the next 14 years. While hybrids and electric vehicles will  have some role in our lineup in the years ahead, we believe that at least 80% of our sales  volume in 2025 will be powered by the internal combustion engine, but with significant  enhancements. Our engineers are hard at work on improvements that will wring more  efficiency out of our vehicles, that will ensure Hyundai remains the global eco-leader in  fuel efficiency and GHG reduction through 2025 and beyond. Lastly, it is also important to maintain a positive relationship within the  community to sustain continuous growth. How are the current HMA  CSR activities in the U.S.?    At HMA, we believe good things happen to companies that do good things.  Weve  had a strong CSR component in our business approach for many years, but in 2010  we dramatically enhanced our efforts here with an integrated CSR, PR, and Marketing  initiative related to our philanthropic focus, pediatric cancer. We call this initiative Hyundai  Hope on Wheels, and its history stretches all the way back to 1998, when it was started  by Boston-area dealer Tom OBrien. Since then, HMA and its dealers have donated over  23 million dollars to the cause of pediatric cancer, including a record-breaking  9 million dollars in 2010 alone. September is pediatric cancer awareness month, and we  dedicated over half of our media weight to a unique 30-second spot raising awareness  of this terrible disease. Hyundai Hope on Wheels shows the power of working together  on a cause that is bigger than our business objectives alone.  By tying our dealers, our  employees, and other key stakeholders together around this valued cause, we see the  astonishing power of our vision and our actions.  This helps make us a stronger team in  all that we do. President & CEO JOHN KRAfCIK Hyunai Motor America (HMA) 77 ABC Pyramid  Independent Assurance Statement to Hyundai Motor Company Management We have reviewed environmental and social aspects of the Hyundai Motor Company 2011 Sustainability Report (hereinafter,  the Report).

Details on HMCs policies and philosophy that are relevant to human rights promotion and personal development support can be found at the companys webpage  (http://audit.hyundai.com). HMCs management philosophy, core value, and  global environmental management philosophy also support HMCs pursuit  of mutual benefit and prosperity with all stakeholders.  Labor Standards 	   Principle 3  Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and   the effective recognition of the right to collective   bargaining; Principle 4  the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory   labor; Principle 5  the effective abolition of child labor; and Principle 6  the elimination of discrimination in respect to employment     and occupation. HMC respects the freedom of association and the right to collective  bargaining, and abides the labor laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as the International Labor Standards created by the International Labour Organization. HMC strictly abides by minimal age requirements when hiring new employees, and all HMC employees have joined the  organization of their free will. Employees are compensated fairly for the  work they have conducted at respective operation sites as stated in the  agreed terms and conditions of their contract and in conjunction with local  laws and regulations. Environment 	   Principle 7  Businesses should support a precautionary approach to   environmental challenges;  Principle 8  should undertake initiatives to promote greater    environmental responsibility; and Principle 9  should encourage the development and diffusion of   environmentally friendly technologies. HMC fully recognizes the importance of good environmental management as a core requirement for success and is fully committed for preemptive action to tackle environmental issues. HMCs proactive stance on  environmental issues is clearly stated in the Global Environmental  Management Policy announced in 2003. This years sustainability report  contains much information on positive achievements due to HMCs  preemptive actions on tackling climate change, depletion of natural   resources, hazardous materials, and air emissions. HMC is focusing on  the Blue Drive initiative that is focused on vehicle CO2 emissions and the  development and widespread use of low carbon green technologies. Anti-Corruption 	   Principle 10  Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms,   including extortion and bribery. HMC does not condone corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. HMCs policy against corruption is well stated in the ethics charter and employee code of conduct. The purchasing division has established its own ethics charter to further discourage corruption. The ethics committee, which consists of outside directors, was created in 2007, to increase  independent monitoring and supervision of transparency in internal  business transactions and regulation compliance. We are also conducting  employee training on a regular basis to promote higher internal ethical  standards and we operate a cyber audit office to minimize corruption.
