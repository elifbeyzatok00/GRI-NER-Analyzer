The Ethico Report 2011 Efico Group based on the Communication On Progress of the United Nations Global Compact COP Year 2011  Antwerp, March 2012 EVOLUTION, PROGRESS, SOLUTIONS & INNOVATION FOR A SUSTAINABLE GREEN COFFEE SUPPLY CHAIN EFICO GROUP SUPPORTS THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT PRINCIPLES SINCE 2003 This is our Communication on Progress  in implementing the principles of the  United Nations Global Compact.     We welcome feedback on its contents.   Foreword   This annual communication  report, or Communication on  Progress (COP) is an important  conclusion and demonstration of  the Efico Groups commitment to  the UN Global Compact and its  principles. As a Global Compact signatory,  Efico is committed  to publicly  communicate with stakeholders  on an annual basis of our progress  in implementing the ten princi- ples with the aim to stimulate and  to enhance sustainability and  transparency with internal and  external stakeholders.  We share our UNGC commitment  in all our communication mate- rial and we get more and more  positive feedback about our  membership.  Within the international con- text in which we are operating,  the awareness of UNGC is really  improving.   By reading this report you will find  the implemented  activities we  achieved in 2011.  In the version of our COP 2010, we  made a large description of our  activities. This year we suggest  to fulfil this report following the  UNGC requirements expressed  during the workshop organized  by the Belgium Network. We will  summarize the improvements  and progress we have made on  each principle.   As part of the learning process,  we proposed a GC Active level. Brief description of nature  of business Company Profile:  Efico is a coffee and cocoa tra- ding company, established in  1926, with offices in Belgium,  Germany, Switzerland, Brazil,  Ethiopia and Guatemala. Our team of traders continues  to uphold the values of a long- standing family business, and pro- vides tailor-made services with a  personal touch.  The company has always been  characterized by its spirit of res- ponsible entrepreneurship and  proactive approach to the sustai- nability of the sector. Efico has subscribed the United  Nations Global Compact prin- ciples since 2003 by taking  ownership of its values and by  implementing an ambitious sus- tainable approach which covers  the green coffee supply chain.  This received several international  recognitions. Efico shares this know-how of sus- tainability with its stakeholders  and approximately 450 European  coffee roasting companies.  In 2011, Eficos turnover totalled   252 million and during that  same year Efico traded 1.060 mil- lion bags of green coffee and  40,000 bags of cocoa.  www.efico.com   www.seabridge.eu  www.eficofoundation.org   www.eu-greenbuilding.org The European UN Global Compact Companies Towards Rio+20  A BEST PRACTICES COLLECTION Edited by  Full article available on :  www.globalcompactnetwork.org Statement of continued support 2011  by Patrick F. Install Chairman Efico Group Ongoing Commitment As a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, since 2003, we endorse  its ten universal principles covering human rights, labour, the environment, and  anticorruption.   Following our core values and Code of Conduct we are committed to behave  ethically in all our business activities - and with partners involved within the  coffee and cocoa supply chain.  We are aware of the people concerned by our operations and respect all relevant laws. We do business by continuously  improving our financial, environmental, and social performance to improve the worlds sustainability. At EFICO, we are committed to align our business goals with our impact on society and environment. Global citizenship  influences how we run our business, holding us to high standards of integrity, ethics, responsibility and transparency in  everything we do, as sustainability is part of our Groups DNA. Through internal policies and strong, mature and long-term relationships with stakeholders, we work to ensure that we  live up to our ideals. We consider that cultivating partnerships with customers, suppliers, industry peers, port authorities,  governments and NGOs is a vital part of business continuity to achieve our common goals and  share added value  throughout the green coffee supply chain.  In 2011, the global economy experienced a very high volatility of commodity market prices and restrictive capital avai- lability. This situation requires a lot of concern. Thanks to the hard work and talent of the Efico team, we were able to  maintain forward progress on our core business. That includes our commitment to global citizenship, which we believe  becomes even more important in difficult times. On top of our ongoing actions, as for example the increase in sales of sustainable  products, we realized two very important projects this year. The first is the achieve- ment of our project Climate-Friendly Farming which is part of our overall project of  CO2controlled supply chain. The second project concerns the signing of the MOU  with the Customs Authorities of Zeebrugge. These two projects enable us to work  closely with our stakeholders to build innovative models that will benefit society on  long-term. As to the development of our Group we opened a new office in Brazil, the largest  coffee producing country in the world. And we created a new company Binary  Services, an independent ICT company providing business solutions based on  Microsoft Dynamics NAV customised to the Groups needs. Also available for third  parties, for example, to optimize Warehouse Management or Trading Commodities.  For the first time, we participate at The Best Practices, an initiative of the Italian UNGC Network. As an Advisory Member  of the Steering Committee of the UN Global Compact Belgium Network, we actively strive to further promote the UNGC  principles and the activities of the local network. This Ethico report describes only a few activities carried out this year throughout the Groups program to fulfill our  responsibilities as a global corporate citizen, and to promote innovation that contributes to a sustainable future for our  planet and its people.  Sigurdsson: Het is een tijdje geleden nu. Ik zag me verplicht om de productie van haar laatste album Vol      Patrick F. Install                           Chairman Efico Group   Commitment to  global citizenship  becomes even  more important   today  Approach Our goal is to deliver products and services that meet the highest standards of our customers to ensure that high quality products are traceable, safe, reliable and sustainable and reduce the environ- mental impact of our activities throughout the supply chain.   Efico Global Strategy to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Supply Chain Emissions are measured and analyzed. Once high consumption factors have been identi- fied an action plan is developed to reduce and compensate for most greenhouse gas emissions.  Our action plan is innovative as it applies reductions in areas of emission with sound technology. Unlike many com- pensation plans designed for tree planting programs, ours is a proactive approach to a continuous reduction of emissions. The plan is implemented in producing and con- suming countries with a proven business model applied to the different stages of our supply chain.  Sustainable achievements and results  Responsible actions in producing countries: - Pre-finance over euro 18 million in 2010, in partnership with the Belgian Export Credit & Insurance Agency the Office National Ducroire (ONDD)  - Create a United Nations Global Compact audit of the princi- ples, in partnership with Mayacert. Starting in 2004 and every year after that, at least one of our coffee producing suppliers is audited.   - 3 Offices in Producing Countries: Brazil, Ethiopia and Guatemala, enable us to be active and have presence in local markets.  - Train farmers in the Central American region on sustainable agri- cultural practices. Training provided by a Guatemala-based agronomist.  - A private foundation compliant with UNGC principles, Efico Foundation supports multiple stakeholder sustainable develop- ment projects in coffee and cocoa producing countries.  Since its creation, the Efico Foundation has sup- ported 36 projects in 14 countries for a total of euro 1,310,000* in partnership with 60 different organizations, NGOs, re- search institutes, universities, national pro- ducer associations, other foundations, and cooperatives or local producer organiza- tions.   In 2008, Efico co-developed and sup- ported the Climate-Friendly Farming Project, a pilot project in Guatemala, which completed the certification require- ments of the Rainforest  Alliance sustainable program with a vol- untary, additional climate module that describes towards pro- ducers how to prepare for climate change and reduce their own environmental impact.  Today, agriculture is among the top rea- sons for global climate change and is responsible worldwide for 14% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This percentage in- creases to 30% with the deforestation resulting from farms and farm expansion. Most coffee plantations grow in an agroforestry system (tall trees provide shade) with high carbon stock. As part of our pilot project, carbon storage was measured and greenhouse gas emissions were calculated. This is the starting point to reduc- A sustainable  approach  throughout  the green coffee  supply chain  by Katrien Delaet,  Head of Sustainable Projects,  Efico Group   The challenge for the group is to detach  economic growth from environmental impact and create added value for the sector   * As of August 2011. ing and compensating CO2 in the supply chain. In September 2011, the first farm became Climate Certified, which will allows us to market Climate Friendly products in the near future.   Responsible actions in consuming countries - 3 Offices in Consuming Countries: Belgium, Germany and Switzerland enable us to be active and have presence in local markets.  -  Purchase Policy for Sustainable Products: In 2010, 26% of our volume was certified, verified or provided by a sustainable pro- gram and sold through programs such as Nespresso AAA, Rain- forest Alliance, UTZ Certified, Organic, Fair Trade, 4C, etc.   - Ecological Footprint Policy Rationale: In 2008, we performed an ecological footprint analysis and mapped emissions linked to our activities to reduce impact to the maximum.   - Purchase Policy for Sustainable Products was implemented in different Efico Group sites.  - Sustainability Policy Dissemination: We share our sustainable expertise with suppliers, customers and partners with a variety of sustainable products, with our commitment to the UN Global Compact principles, our role in the local Belgium network, and with the support of 47 European coffee roasters to the Efico Foundation.   - SEABRIDGE: A new approach to sustainable and innovative lo- gistics dedicated to green coffee. Green coffee is a natural food product very sensitive to light, temperature variation, odors, air quality, and humidity. In 2008, Efico built a new, European sus- tainable facility center for storage, processing and distribution of green coffee in the port of Zeebrugge (Seabridge). As an inde- pendent company within the Efico Group, Seabridge operates for Efico, as well as for third parties, such as coffee roasting compa- nies, trading houses, producer organizations, insurance and mar- itime companies Worldwide it is the only automated sustainable service center with air-conditioned storage space of 20,000 m2, capacity for  300,000 coffee bags combining performance with the triple pivot of sustainability. In 2008, Efico was awarded the Innovation & Design Award by the SCAE (Specialty Coffee Asso- ciation of Europe) for its innovative Seabridge concept.  Location: In the port of Zeebrugge, which shares our long-term sustainable vision to streamline logistics performance.  State-of-the-art facilities: Insulation allows higher efficiency levels - 30% compared to traditional facility performance - for which we obtained a Green Building Certificate and an award from the European Commission. Facilities are approved by the Federal Agency for Food Safety.  Investment: Approximately euro 30 million.   Tracking and Traceability: A unique code traces all our goods from origin to destination, ensuring traceability of all our prod- ucts.  Optimum Storage Conditions: Air is maintained at a constant temperature and humidity, is filtered, sterilized and ventilated. Forklifts are electric and run on green energy produced on the roof of the building. This equipment extends the life cycle of cof- fee and preserves its unique qualities.   Technologies: Operation is fully automated, which reduces work from the staff considerably. Equipment allows for mixing, clean- ing, sorting beans and, possibility for receiving, storing and dis- tributing coffee. 4,600 photovoltaic modules =  1 GWh / year of green power annually, equivalent to the average annual con- sumption of approximately 300 families, allowing removal of 20,610 tons of CO2 over 30 years.  Direct Access to Rail Transportation on site for reception and dis- tribution of goods. The totality of goods are received by rail, which reduces traffic burden. Most of the goods are forwarded by rail.  Waste Management complies with the prevention, reduction and recovery-based priorities of the Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) con- cept. Where possible, the life cycle is extended and waste is used as raw materials to create new products. The same concept ap- plies to our customers waste: jute bags, sisal and plastics. Waste water on our site is also processed.  Future perspectives   A driving force in our supply chain, our proposed sustainable solu- tions provide added value to the sector in producing countries and in Europe. Long-term partnerships strengthen our actions. The suc- cess of our project is largely due to continuous knowledge sharing and exchange with our stakeholders, because they share our val- ues and requirements.  49 Since 1926 Efico has been a coffee and cocoa trad- ing house of international scale with offices in Bel- gium, Germany, Switzerland, Brazil, Ethiopia, and Guatemala. Our team of traders continues to up- hold the values of a long-standing family business and provides tailor-made services with a personal touch. The company has always been characterized by its spirit of responsible entrepreneurship and proactive approach to the sustainability of the sec- tor. Efico has subscripted followed the United Na- tions Global Compact principles since 2003 by taking ownership of its values and by implementing an ambitious sustainable development policy that has received several international recognitions.   Efico shares this sustainable know-how with ap- proximately 450 of its European coffee roasting company buyers. In 2010, turnover totalled euro 166 million and that same year Efico traded 1 million bags of green coffee and 70,000 bags of cocoa.   www.efico.com  EFICOS BUSINESS MODEL IS BASED ON THIS SUPPLY CHAIN APPROACH   Companies Producers Transport  & Logistics Product Use Waste Coffee  Roasters A supply chain consists of all stages, directly or indirectly, involved in fulfilling customer  requests. In the Efico coffee supply chain we indentify 6 steps, from farmer to the European  coffee roasting companies. This does not mean that Efico is not concerned about the final  stages. As a trading company of raw materials, Efico supplies qualitative green coffee that  enables our customers to make coffee favoured by consumers.  We work hand-in-hand with our clients on a tailor-made approach to improve quality,  achieve certification programs, reduce CO2 consumption of activities, optimize eco-effi- ciency & waste management, exchange product knowledge, provide marketing support  and optimize costs and return.  Throughout this dynamic supply chain, Efico strives to make its supply chains more efficient  by improving the information sharing throughout.  This constant flow of information is essen- tial to create added value for the entire sector. Long-term business relationships need to be  based on trust and honesty, making sure all parties are satisfied about the business deal.  THE SUPPLY CHAIN CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS    PRODUCING COUNTRIES                             &                             CONSUMING COUNTRIES                              Link to film: From Flower to Cup  BOTANICAL ASPECTS  There are more than 80 varieties of coffee plants;  the 2 most important types are Coffea Robusta and  Arabica. Coffee plants produce the best beans when  they are cultivated in appropriate agro-climatic con- ditions combining: altitude (varying from 600-2,000  meters), soil chemistry, a certain degree of humidity,  variety and weather (amount of rainfall, sunshine and  temperatures from 15 to 25 C). Coffee production  occurs between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.  Also the age of the plant and the care it receives are  determinant. Young plants are kept in the nursery for  a period of 3 to 6 months. These factors determine the  expected productivity, starting only after 3 years. HARVESTING The fruit turns bright, and deep red when it is ripe  and ready to be harvested. In most countries, coffee  is picked by hand, called Cherry Picking; only red,  ripe cherries are selected. This requires recollecting  several times. Another method consists of Stripping;  all cherries (both ripe and unripe) are stripped from  the branches, with one smooth movement by hand  or by machine. In some regions in Brazil, were lands- capes are flat and extended, harvest is entirely  carried out by machines: Mechanical Harvesting.  Coffee tree branches pass through vertical shafts  inside the harvester. Each shaft rotates in the opposite  direction. The daily harvest is collected and transpor- ted to the farm. Getting the cherries as fast as possi- ble to the units is crucial for the coffee quality.                                         From Cherry to Green Coffee Bean  Every cherry contains two beans which have to be separated from its surrounding layers. Three different coffee methods are possible: Wet, Semi-Washed or Dry-Process.  WET PROCESS: WASHED COFFEE   The freshly harvested cherries are sorted by manual selection, then processed through a pulping machine where the skin and pulp are separated from the bean. Coffee  beans are separated by weight as they are conveyed through water channels; the  lighter beans float to the top, the heavier, ripe beans sink to the bottom. After separation,  the beans are transported to large, water-filled fermentation tanks. Depending on a combination of factors they will remain in these tanks from 12 to 48 hours. The purpose  of this process is to remove the slick layer of mucilage (called the parenchyma). When fermentation is complete, the beans are washed by being sent through additional  water channels.  Finally, the coffee bean is ready for drying.  SEMI-WASHED PROCESS: SEMI-WASHED COFFEE   This method meets halfway between wet and dry processing. The separation of the beans is done by flotation & depulping, without conducting the fermentation process. DRY PROCESS: UNWASHED OR NATURAL COFFEE   Arrived at the processing unit, the cherries are spread out on huge surfaces to dry in the sun on patios of concrete or canvases. All layers (outer skin, pulp and parchment)  stay intact and are dried as a whole, turned throughout the day, covered at night, or if  it rains, to prevent them from getting wet. Depending on the weather, this process   might continue for several weeks for each batch of coffee. When the moisture  content of the coffee beans drops to 11 percent, the dried cherries are moved to  warehouses  where they are stored. Robusta-coffees are usually dry processed. Next steps are identical for the 3 methods: DEPULPING; the hull of the coffee bean, called parchment, is mechanically removed and the beans can also be polished,  SORTING, CALIBRATING and PACKAGING; Deparched beans are manually or mechanically sorted & sieved to remove bad beans, stones or other foreign matter.  There are different qualities or grades. Coffee is put into bags, usually of 69 kg and QUALITY CONTROLS; coffee is analyzed and undergoes quality tests in laboratories.   Green coffee is loaded onto ships for transport to consuming countries.  It is shipped in jute or sisal bags or bulked into containers.  The exporter buys from cooperatives or auctions. In some countries the government controls coffee trade.  Coffee has to travel a long way from grower to consumer. Eficos local offices play a crucial role. Their know-how of the local market and producers enables them to  guarantee to get the right product on the right place, at the right time, at an acceptable price to our customers. Several key issues of this step are quality of shipment  dealers/brokers, shipping lines, port facilities, quality of the container, and tracking and tracing.  Green Coffee is the most important agro-export product for many developing countries.  It is produced and exported by nearly 65 countries and ranks as one of the top cash crops.  The coffee industry is also a social, cultural, institutional and political network that has served  as a base for the countrys development. Coffee  provides directly & indirectly a livelihood for 100  million people. 70% of production is carried out  by small-scale producers. Coffee is often compa- red to wine for its complex aromas and the spe- cific attention it requires. The coffee supply chain  varies according to a country or region. Green coffee is the most important agricultural commodity and the second raw  material traded in the world, after petroleum and before wheat, and represents  4% of the global Food Trade. The coffee market, open to speculation, has prices  widely varying, reaching fluctuations of up to 15%  in the same day. The two largest  coffee stock exchanges are New York (Arabica) and London (Robusta). In Europe,  90% of adults drink coffee, the most consumed beverage after water.  Worldwide 2.5 billion cups of coffee are drunk every day. In recent years,  consumers care about the origin and the conditions under which it is produced. The mission of our trading team is to develop and build long-term relationships  with our suppliers throughout the world in order to consistently source unique,  high-quality coffee for our clients while maintaining our promise of tailor-made  services.   Green coffee is a natural food product which  is very sensitive to light, temperature variation,  odor, air quality and humidity. In 2008, Efico built  a new, European sustainable facility center for  storage, processing and distribution of green  coffee in the port of Zeebrugge (Seabridge).  As an independent company within the Efico  Group, Seabridge operates for Efico, as well as  for third parties, such as coffee roasting com- panies, trading houses, producer organizations,  insurance and maritime companies. Worldwide  it is the only automated sustainable service  center with air-conditioned storage space of  20,000 m, capacity for  300,000 coffee bags  combining sustainable performances.  In 2008, Efico was awarded with the Innovation  & Design Award by the SCAE (Specialty Coffee  Association of Europe).  STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITIES:  Insulation allowing higher efficiency level:  - 30%  compared to traditional facility performance -  for which the group obtained a Green Building  Certificate and an award from the European  Commission. Facilities are approved by the  Federal Agency for Food Security. Optimal  storage conditions equipment extend the life  cycle of coffee and preserve its unique quali- ties. Efico created a new approach to sustaina- ble and innovative logistics dedicated to green  coffee. Eficos final goal  is to manage all steps  throughout the supply chain  and to deliver products and  services that meet  the highest standards  to make sure that  high quality products are  traceable, safe, reliable and  sustainable, whilst reducing  the environmental impact of our activities.    To ensure best practice across a broad spectrum  of transportation, we choose a site with direct  access to rail. Almost all goods are received by  rail and sent by rail, reducing the burden of traf- fic. As our operations are fully automated and  controlled, the structure of our services is per- formed by a professional partnership with NMBS  which allows us to receive and send our goods  on fixed appointments.   EVOLUTION, PROGRESS, SOLUTIONS & INNOVATION FOR A SUSTAINABLE GREEN COFFEE SUPPLY CHAIN Top-down overview of the Efico Group activities within the framework of the 10 UNGC principles  WITH A PERSONAL TOUCH  HUMAN RIGHTS  PRINCIPLES BASED ON THE  UNIVERSAL DECLARATION PRINCIPLE 1 Businesses should support  and respect the protection of  international  proclaimed human rights PRINCIPLE 2 Businesses should ensure  that they are not complicit  in human rights abuse  Within our sphere of influence  we take steps to support and  promote human rights.  We conduct our operations with  honesty, integrity and openness  and respect for human rights  and the interests of our employ- ees, business partners, suppliers  and customers.  Efico establishes itself as a trus- ted partner by working hand- in-hand and sharing know-how  with its partners in the sector.  Global principles with local  implementation are the only  way to operate successfully and  sustainably. Our local offices are  encouraged to get involved in  the development of the local  society. Flexibility is essential.  A  fine balance between global  principles and maintaining con- sistency with both corporate  values and local expectations.  Through the Efico Foundation  projects and the UNGC Audit,  we encourage improvements in  human rights in producing coun- tries to build a better future for  the local communities involved  in coffee and cocoa production.

We choose well-managed and reliable  partners operating ethically. Some activities were restricted in 2011  due to unsafe conditions in some produ- cing countries and unreliable roasting  companies. Internally those decisions  were discussed and followed. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS  In Ethiopia, our second largest coffee  sourcing country after Brazil, we have  taken steps to develop and improve our  relations. The government has an active  role in green coffee commercialization,  which brings us to an active communica- tion with the government and its embassy  in Europe. EFICO FOUNDATION  We invest  166,000 in projects, which is  an increase of 13% compared to 2010.  And we received 203 applications; an  increase of 117 cases compared to 2010. UNGC PRACTICAL GUIDE  Developed to train producers to imple- ment UNGC principles in their daily  activities. This new tool will allow our  suppliers to be prepared for the audit  and improve their performance.  UNGC SOURCING SUPPLIERS AUDIT The supplier Americo Melo was audited,  and above all, this year we conducted  and financed the 4C verification pro- gram of Cojcaf, which was our UNGC  Audit supplier of 2010.  Corrective mea- sures have been set up especially to  improve the relations between workers  and management. In doing so, they suc- ceed to obtain the 4C verification.

Since 2005, we support further economic development of our Group by creating new jobs and by increasing labour  productivity through a well-defined (Risk Management) approach and by following the highest qualitative standards in  management practices to ensure efficiencies at every level. In 2011, our groups employment increased with  27% com- pared to 2010 and 138% compared to 2005, with 6 different nationalities.  The continuous improvement of our processes is of vital importance and is evaluated on a regular basis. Progress is moni- tored during Management Reviews, ISO/BPM and Trade Meetings. For the Longshoremen of Seabridge, special con- sultations are organized with their unions every 3 months. Recommendations are made on goal setting and metrics to  track internal performance in meeting the Groups supply chain sustainability expectations. To secure the supply chain,  safety hazards are identified, security controls are implemented and potential threats and influences are reduced.

A SUSTAINABLE APPROACH  THROUGHOUT THE GREEN COFFEE SUPPLY CHAIN  ENVIRONMENT   PRINCIPLES DERIVED FROM  THE RIO DECLARATION PRINCIPLE 7 Businesses support a precautionary  approach to environmental challenges  PRINCIPLE 8 Promote greater  environmental responsibility  PRINCIPLE 9 Encourage the development &  diffusion of environmentally  friendly technologies  This large program covers the  whole supply chain of the goods  we import.  In producing countries we sup- port suppliers and customers  willing to improve responsible  agriculture practices.  We launched the Worlds First  Coffee to be Rainforest Alliance  Verified as Climate-Friendly.  Innovation in new products is  the cornerstone of tomorrows  sustainable society. This pro- ject was announced during the  United Nations Durban Climate  Change  Conference  by  Rainforest Alliance in partner- ship with the project partners,  where Efico is part of.  To control and reduce the influ- ence of our activities on the  environment we developed an  efficient concept, based on the  conviction that the issues on the  climate have to be tackled at  locations where they occur.  Emissions in coffee producing  countries should be reduced by  activities in producing countries,  and CO2 emissions in Europe  should be reduced in the same  place.  We have built our model on that  assumption with partners in the  sector and throughout the whole  supply chain.

Efico acts as an open group and  enables its partners to carry out  all types of audits. Since December 2011, the sig- ning of the MOU of Seabridge  with the Customs Authorities  facilitates regular checks of our  stock. This signature was followed by a  demonstration of customs con- trols with sniffing dogs looking for  drugs and money.  Our staff and partners have  been informed about these  inspections.

Coffee Roasting Companies  2. Efico Group transfers, at least  50,000/year  and all the operational support-costs 3. Public donations 4. Private donations Controls Thanks to regular project visits, full allocation of means is guaranteed.  If necessary, procedures are followed to prevent or rectify possible undesired practices.  Future challenge After six years of operations, field monitoring is crucial to measure the real impact of projects and their continuity.  Performance evaluation of projects will be a focus in the future.  2012 will also be a reflexion year: the operations, the sustainable criteria and the control systems of our founda- tion have to be evaluated. A brainstorming session will be organized with our partners within the King Baudouin  Foundation end of March. During the last 3 years, we received more and more project applicants. In 2009 the total  amounted to 55 projects, in 2010 to 86 projects, and in 2011 to 203 projects. The operational effectiveness has to  improve the performance of our organization with as main aim to strengthen the impact on livelihoods of rural pro- ducing communities at its maximum.   Communication  Projects could require a maximum of  20,000 per year and 3 year support.  Each year we have a new selection of projects.  The Efico Foundation supports 36 sustainable multi-stakeholder development projects  in 14 coffee & cocoa producing countries amounting to   1,181,461.  33% 38% 8% 21% Coffee Roasting Companies Efico's Grants Public Donations Private Donations                                                                  2010                              2011                      Views                                                       2,489                                9,745   Most viewed films    1) Mechanical Harvesting                 in Brazil                     175                     3,523                2) Seabridge                390                                    569            - Taking care of your coffee             N/A                                   223                                          - A bridge between coffee, men    and machines                                       N/A                                   167   - Ethiopia                 N/A                  741   - From Flower to Cup               N/A                  519   - Climate-Friendly                      Farming Project                       As of October: 79                       73   PRESENCE OF THE EFICO GROUP ON YOUTUBE      WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/EFICOGROUP    PRESENCE OF THE EFICO GROUP ON    WWW.EFICO.COM                                                                     2010 (new website)              2011   Visitors                                                                 31,535                         25,857   - New visitors             64%                              61%   - Returning visitors            36%                              38%   Average time on site                            216             239                Average page per visit                                     3                                   3.6   Most viewed pages     - Efico/Home                                                     14,689                         11,927   - Seabridge/Home           9,861                        5,954   - Efico Foundation/Home                             10,242                          5,253   - Efico/UN Global Compact                           454                               696   - Seabridge/UN Global Compact                236                               178   - Efico Foundation/UN Global Compact    141                               196  FUTURE PERSPECTIVES  Over the years, Efico has maintained the same values, and engaged in structural reforms in how a business can conduct  and improve sustainable economy.  In March 2003, Efico joined the Global Compact with the purpose to generate, dis- seminate and ensure its legal compliance to all parties involved in the supply chain. As a driving force in our supply chain, our proposed sustainable solutions provide added value to the sector in produ- cing countries and in Europe. Long term partnerships strengthen our actions.  The success of our sustainable approach is mostly due to continuous knowledge sharing and exchange with our  stakeholders, following our values and requirements. 2012 will have its challenges. The first step will be the continuation of our current program and the upgrading of our performance.  Next, we will launch a new Climate product and a new Implementation Guide of the UN Global Compact Principles.  We will also develop qualitative agriculture production programs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the supply chain,  increase green energy production, optimize the Efico Groups transport policy and of course continue our support to  the Efico Foundation. As in previous years, this Ethico Report will be shared with all our stakeholders.  The link to this document published on the website of the UNGC will be mentioned in all our communication material.
