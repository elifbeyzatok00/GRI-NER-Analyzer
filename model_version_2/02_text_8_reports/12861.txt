Message   from the CEO  We give priority   to Responsible Operation A t FOURLIS Group we employ over 3.000 people  and we influence multiple stakeholders in Greece,  Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria. Thus, we are well  aware that the power of the Group lies in our  ability to influence the purchases and sales chain through  responsible operation.  For this reason, our main interest lies not only in our clients,  but also in our shareholders and stakeholders, as in our  suppliers, local communities, authorities and, above all, our  employees. The dedication and sensitivity of the people and  executive staff of the FOURLIS Group is essential for us as  ambassadors of responsible operation, the upholding of  human rights, and the fight against corruption wherever it is  identified. We firmly believe that, in order for us to improve the world, we  must firstly begin with our own internal operation. In light of  this, the FOURLIS Group adopted, in 2008, the UNs Global  Compact principals, and since then we have applied them  to our daily business practices, attempting to incorporate  them into the total range of the companys activities, while at  the same time, maintaining the consistent and incompatible  principles of Integrity, Respect, and Efficiency. Apostolos Petalas Chief Executive Officer  9 Social Responsibility Report 2010 D.  Message From the  Social Responsibility  Department    Social responsibility   is a part of us T hree years ago we adopted a new approach to  our everyday lives and to the improvement of our  corporate practices by participating in the UNs  Global Compact. With the Global Compact as our  guide, our whole corporation systematically works with equal  emphasis placed on social sustainability and responsibility,  development and economic prosperity.  Of course, the facilitating cornerstone is our focus on the  Principles of Corporate Governance and Responsible  Management, through the application of practices like the  Code of Conduct and Internal Regulation Charter.  Our main concern, as far as our employees are concerned,  is that we continuously uphold meritocracy, a safe working  environment and  creativity, while at the same time we offer  equal opportunities for advancement and training to our  entire workforce. With regards to our sensitivity to Social and Environmental  Concerns, it is notable that every year we multiply our actions,  helping people and social groups that are at a disadvantage,  while at the same time trying to minimize any negative  environmental impacts that might occur. Some of the Groups  social actions in 2010 include the voluntary blood donation,  the creation of recycling centers, the expansion of programs  and activities that help to conserve natural resources, and  the Groups social contribution to various institutions and  organizations that support disadvantaged groups.  The fact that the efforts of our Group are met with much  enthusiasm, gives us the strength to continue with our  Passion for better living.

Similarly, it is very important that, as  far as possible, a balance between  the sexes is maintained and we  are especially careful not to apply  different employment practices for  our female employees.  For this reason, we have ensured  equal advancement opportunities for  both men and women to Directors  positions.  This is especially visible when  looking at the total number of female  employees in the Group, which is at  54%, while the number of women  in managerial positions reaches  the particularly high percentage of  40,32%. Furthermore, it is notable that in  2010, 159 internal promotions -  movements took place within the  Group, while 711 new recruitments  made. In order to ensure that employee  appraisal is and remains transparent,  we have adopted a single Performance  Appraisal System for the Group, which  is implemented twice a year (June and  December) since 2008. The Performance Appraisal System of  the FOURLIS Group was created to  ensure a fair working environment and  to create a functional management  succession plan for senior positions.  The characteristics that make this  appraisal system objective are:   It was created by the employees  themselves in order to assess  their progress in relation to the  job requirements and in relation  to the Values that govern the  Group.    Employees have free access to  their appraisal forms.   Employees are given the  opportunity to object if they  disagree with any part of the  appraisal.  2010 Ratio of Women in the Group 54,00 40,32 0  10  20  30  40  50  60 Percentage of women in total workforce (%) Percentage of women in managerial/ supervisory positions (%)  25 Social Responsibility Report 2010 . Employee Rewards and Recognition At FOURLIS Group we believe we are obliged to reward our Human  Resources for their contribution to the company. For this reason, we  introduced the reward program presented below, aimed at recognizing the  importance of their contribution towards the progress of the Group.  The reward program is summarized as follows:    Long - term Employment Award  Employees who have contributed to the company for a number of years  (10, 20 & 30 years of recognized contribution) are rewarded. In 2010, 51  employees of the Group were rewarded for long-term employment.     Highlight those who Stand Out - We Live by our Values.  Through this program, which became an institution, employees whose  professional behavior is in line with and reflect the Values of the Group,  are rewarded.  The number of employees who are rewarded every year is decided by  the Board of Directors and is relative to the total number of employees of  each company. In 2010, 17 employees were rewarded.  F. Ongoing Vocational Training At FOURLIS Group, we believe that there is a permanent increasing need for ongoing vocational training which is  completely dependent on the increased demands of the competitive market.  For this reason, the training of each employee of the Group begins upon their employment. The first training session for  each employee of the FOURLIS Group is an Induction Program through which we ensure that all new recruits are informed  about the Structure of the Group, the Values, the Code of Conduct and the Internal Regulation Charter.  The Group and / or each company ensures that  the specialized training programs are realized  either internally with the aid of its own executives  know-how and that of internal trainers, or  externally in collaboration with organizations and  training centers.  To ensure the training programs effectiveness  for each employee, the following parameters are  examined:    The company goal to be achieved through the  specific training The specifications of the employees position The demands of  the employees position The level of knowledge of the employee  26 Human Resources The following training programs took place in 2010 within the Group:    Development of managerial skills through sessions like: Management Skills, Legal, Finance for Non-Financials, Giving  Constructive Feedback, Coaching skills, Appraisal Training, Language Skills.   Training in technical areas like Information and Technology, Finance, Electronic Transactions - Invoicing, Communication,  Interior Design, Income Tax, Internal Control and Regulatory Compliance.

G. Health and Safety At FOURLIS Group we are well aware that it is our obligation to provide a safe and healthy work environment. For this reason, on  an annual basis, we make sure that we follow the provisions of Greek legislation laid out in the labor law, evaluate the possible  risks we may face over the following year and implement the appropriate measures to ensure prevention of accidents as far as  possible.  The main measures the Group has taken to achieve the above-mentioned goal are:    We chart the areas of possible risks and take actions depending on the level of risk.   Periodic inspections are carried out on all the premises by the safety technicians   A Professional Risk Assessment Study is drawn up by the Occupational Health and Safety Technician   Training programs on health and safety are implemented. First aid training is provided for specific groups. Fire safety training is  provided for specific groups The following table presents, by case, accidents in the workplace, safety training and absences due to illness recorded in the  FOURLIS Group during 2010. Accidents - Illness   2010 Number of workplace accidents 272* Number of workplace accidents resulting in more than 3 day absence 30 Total man-hours devoted to safety training 14.079 Days of absence due to sick-leave (over 3 days) 4.771,7 Days of absence due to sick-leave (under 3 days) 3.873,3 * refers, mainly, to minor injuries  27 Social Responsibility Report 2010 Well Being - Love Yourself Program In 2010 a new program - Well Being (EF ZIN) - Love  yourself was implemented. The aim was to inform  employees about health and well-being topics as well as  motivating them to adopt a healthier way of living.  The basic themes of the recently launched program-  prevention, balanced diet, and regular exercise- and  the activities relating to them, were introduced to the  employees through a fresh idea: a recycled bag with  fresh fruits; the goal of the launch idea was to encourage  employees to take the first step towards a healthier  lifestyle, starting with a more balanced diet.  Through the Well Being - Love yourself program, all  employees had the chance to enjoy several benefits  such as free medical examinations, discount packages  in collaboration with well-known gyms, outdoor activities  and nutrition consultancy centers, participation in athletic  tournaments as well as informative seminars given by  qualified scientific consultants.  In addition, on a regular basis, the Well Being Newsletter  (Ef Zin Newsletter) is distributed both electronically and  printed form and also posted on Social Responsibility  announcement boards.  EXAMPLES OF THE "WELL BEING" GROUPS ACTIVITIES Medical Examinations for all employees  Free examination for diabetes (Blood Sugar)  In March of 2010, as part of the Well Being program, free blood sugar examinations were realized on the Groups  premises for all employees in collaboration with ERRIKOS NTINAN, EUROMEDICA and the CYPRUS DIABETIC  ASSOCIATION.  Employees responded dynamically and 67% of the total employees participated. Employees, who took part in the blood sugar examinations, were provided with an individual examination card with  the date and the result of the reading of the examination.  Free Mammograms, Pap Tests and Examinations of the Large Intestine From 11th October to 10th November 2010, in collaboration with the Hellenic Anticancer Association, free  mammograms, Pap Tests and large intestine examinations were provided for all women employees over the age of  40 who registered. In total, 50 female employees of the Group participated in these free examinations. Its worth noting that throughout the year many programs at special prices for all the employees of the Group  and their families were offered by BIOATRIKI and YGEIA, like check ups, check ups for children, eye checks,  osteoporosis examinations, blood pressure examinations, etc.  28 Human Resources Sporting Activities Employees of the Group, who are sports  enthusiasts had the opportunity to show their  talent in soccer, basketball and tennis in The  F1 Team 2010 tournament organized by the  Social Responsibility Department in May 2010 at  athletic centers in Loutraki Athens, Thessaloniki  and Cyprus.  All employees of the Group and their families  could watch the athletic tournament as special  activities have been organized for the children.  Student awards for employees children   At FOURLIS Group, we aim to function as a family and so the family of each employee is important to us. We put this  desire into effect in 2010 through the following actions:   Moral and material rewards for 25 junior high school students and 6 senior high school students, children of  employees, who showed outstanding school performance over the previous year.    Moral and material rewards for 24 students, children of employees, who succeeded in gaining entrance to higher  education institutions.   29 Social Responsibility Report 2010 .

At FOURLIS Group, we believe that  we have to keep our People informed  about the actions of the Group and  also enable them to communicate with  the rest of the employees, regardless  of level of seniority.  In 2010 we provided the following  opportunities:    Information on Social Responsibility  issues of the Group through the  electronic newsletters Live to  Learn and f in (Well Being).   Information on the results of the  Annual Climate Survey that has  been organized by the Groups  Human Resources Department  since 2008.

Since 2009, all the  employees at IKEA have had  the opportunity to put forward  suggestions regarding new  practices that the company could  adopt aiming at progress and  greater operational productivity. An  indication of the effectiveness of the  program is the fact that in 2010, 322  employees took part and a total of  607 new ideas were presented - of  which 345 were implemented and  150 are under evaluation.   30 Society 5. Society . Introduction  I n 2008 we adopted the central motto Together we can! for our Social Responsibility Program, thereby entering a  new era in Social Responsibility.  We believe that the company, as Responsible Citizen, Can, and  must create value as much for its shareholders as  for its stakeholders, including the Society. Especially for the Society, we ensured that we met its needs through:  the annual blood donation we organized once again  donations from the employees of the Group to charities in Greece and Cyprus  aid provided to institutions and non - governmental organizations  31 Social Responsibility Report 2010 . The Participation of our Employees Annual Blood Donation Clothing Collection The employees of the FOURLIS Group, responded to the Social Responsibility Departments call to  collect and donate  clothing just before the Christmas holidays in 2010. The clothing was donated to the following charities in Greece and  Cyprus:  Volunteers of the World (Athens)  Greek Childrens Village (Filiro- Thessaloniki)  ARSIS (Thessaloniki)  Mayoral Social Policy (Thessaloniki)  Red Cross (Larissa)   Anakyklos Textile Recycling (Cyprus) The clothing gathered was organized and distributed to all the institutions, taking into account each institutions needs.  C. Our Social Actions The social activities of the FOURLIS Group, like the donations to non-profit organizations, financial and material support  to needy societal groups, and the informational programs of the Group, characterize its social policy. The actions of  the FOURLIS Group contribute both materialistically and morally to the community for the improvement of life for our  Stakeholders.  Since 1985, the employees at  the FOURLIS Group, have been  taking part in the Voluntary Blood  Donation organized twice a year  in collaboration with Agia Sofia  childrens hospital.   In 2010, the number of donors  increased with 439 employees  donating compared to 209 in 2009.   In total, 439 blood bottles were  collected, out of which 43 have  been used for employee needs, and  the rest to cover the needs of the  hospital.  2010 Annual Blood Donation 0  100  200  300  400  500 Donors (numbers) 2009 439 209  32 Society The following table presents some of the institutions and organizations that benefited from the FOURLIS Group social  actions during 2010.

The company donated all the  necessary goods converting an  unused space into a functional  guest house.  And of course, nothing would  have been possible without the  voluntary work of the employees of  IKEA and the Groups companies. Specifically, five rooms, the living  room, dining room and kitchen  of the Hatzipaterion guest house  were completely furnished.  This guest house was created to  host the families of children from  the rural regions who participate in  the foundations program.  2010 169.240 103.000 Annual Social Contributions of the FOURLIS Group 0  50.000  100.000  150.000  200.000 Financial Support (euros) 2009  33 Social Responsibility Report 2010 EXAMPLE OF IKEA ACTION:  UNICEF IKEA contributed 1 from each sale of stuffed toys that took place in its stores between 1st November and 31st  December 2010, to UNICEF Greece.

Our Activities Over the Following Year The company aims to continue the implementation of the existing policies and actions,  while at the same time it aims to:  increase the number of voluntary blood donors in the annual blood donation  increase the number of employees participating in company voluntary actions  EXAMPLE OF INTERSPORT ACTION:  INTERSPORT Camps INTERSPORT adopted a new initiative for children in 2010 - the INTERSPORT Camps - thus taking another step  towards bringing the society closer to sports.  INTERSPORT Camps are sports camps for children between the ages of 6 and 14. In collaboration with Arsenal  Schools and the Cavaliers Youth Hoops program of The National Basketball Academy, the Camp offered unique  athletic experiences for the children who took part in 2010.      6  14 ,           ,          Arsenal Soccer Schools & Cavaliers Youth Hoops  Program  The National Basketball Academy,        , SPORTCAMP  .     & :  www.intersport.gr,  www.sportcamp.gr .: 27440 23999 - 66860   fax: 27440 26930 M   : EXAMPLE OF  INTERSPORT ACTION:  Tennis Tournament  Intersport organized, for the second consecutive year, the  INTERSPORT Tennis Open, a great athletic event, which took  place on 1st October 2010 in Thessaloniki and on 13th October  2010 in Athens. The tournaments lasted from 10 to 19 days. The FOURLIS  Group employees could participate in the tournament with only  restriction the priority in the list of entries.   36 Environment 6. Environment . Introduction E veryone in the FOURLIS Group knows that our company, just like any other humanistic and business  activity,  needs natural resources. We are also aware that we need to take into consideration the activities of the  Group and the way in which these activities influence the environment so as to reduce, as far as possible, our  negative impact on the environment.  Our aim is to increasingly systemize our practices each year so as to minimize any negative impact on the environment.  The first step in minimizing our impact is to recognize which activities affect the environment, like for example, the way  in which we consume natural resources, the quantities of liquid and solid waste we produce, the amount of energy we  consume, etc.  .  Analysis of the Results of Our Actions Being aware of the global environmental problems, such as the shortage of water and raw materials, and having  knowledge about our impact on the environment, we implement a structured Impact Analysis that we have been  applying over the last few years with the aim of becoming aware of our basic impact on the environment.   37 Social Responsibility Report 2010 Furthermore, we try to directly manage any impact we may have on the environment by adopting environment - friendly  technologies, but also indirectly by cultivating environmental awareness within and outside the Group.  We believe that our actions will be more effective if they are combined with information dissemination on the practices  we adopt and the reasons for applying them. For this reason, we regularly set up information dissemination and  awareness campaigns for the public and our workforce.  C. Management of our Materials We ensure the responsible management of consumables used in an ongoing effort to reduce related impact. Use of Paper Through a series of practices we manage our consumables, starting with the use of recycled, recyclable, chlorine - free  paper, the minimization of the use of paper and the final recycling of waste materials.  Recycled Paper Over the last two years, we have implemented the exclusive use of recycled, recyclable and chlorine - free paper. In  total, the percentage of this paper bought by the Group for office use in 2010 came to 26.727 kilos, in comparison to  29.390 kilos in 2009.   Paper Saving Our goal was to minimize, as far as possible, the use of paper for printing. For this reason, we avoid printing and we  prefer the use of the internal electronic network and the use of document sharing within the network.  2010 2009 FOURLIS Group Paper Management Practices  1.540,3 1.541 279,5 131,6 7 26,7 29,4 0  200  400  600  800  1000  1200  1400  1600  1800 Paper recycling (tons)  Fax server use (%) Duplex printing (thousands)  Purchase of recycled paper (tons)  38 Environment In particular we apply the following:   Use of fax servers  We have installed fax servers in 7% of our premises. Through this practice we  were able to control faxes so that only absolutely necessary ones are printed  and paper is saved.   Duplex printing  This practice has helped us cut in half the use of paper for printing. The  total number of pages printed in duplex printing in 2010 came to 279.467 in  comparison with 131.620 pages in 2009. The number of employees who are  able to make use of duplex printing comes to 377.   Creation of an internal Intranet network  With the implementation of an internal network we were able to minimize  unnecessary printing, since all information regarding the Group was made  available electronically and there is no need for printing.    Application of Human Resources electronic tools  We noticed that a significant amount of paper was being used by the Human Resources Department which handles  all the CVs sent to the Group, employee payment receipts and vacation applications. All these are now handled  through an electronic system which helps us successfully reduce the use of paper in this particular department.  Paper Recycling At FOURLIS Group, we have adopted paper  recycling in all our companies. Especially at IKEA, we have installed recycling  bins at all our stores over the past two years,  aiming to encourage clients as well as our  workforce to use the recycling bins, in the hopes  that this will become a habit.  Its worth noting that through this practice, in  2010, IKEA managed to recycle 1.495 tons of  paper compared to 2009 when 1.435 tons of  paper was recycled.  In total, FOURLIS Group recycled 1.540,3 tons of  paper in 2010 compared to 2009 when 1.541 tons  of paper was recycled - a small difference due to  the fact that use of paper was reduced.  Use of Ink As far as use of ink is concerned, the companys impact on the environment was significantly reduced with the  application of the above for the minimization of printing. However, the Groups consumption of ink remained high.   39 Social Responsibility Report 2010 Ink Saving In 2008, we adopted new technology practices, like laser printers, which contributed significantly to the protection of  the environment since less ink is required for their use.  Laser printers make up 84% of the total number of printers at FOURLIS Group, from 83% in 2009.  However, at IKEA and INTERSPORT stores there was an increase of 35% in the purchase of ink because of the  operation of new stores, as in 2010 we bought 4.317 units of ink while in 2009 the corresponding number was 2.790  units.  In addition, out of the total amount of ink we bought, we finally recycled 547 units, while in 2009 we recycled 2.072  units. The reduction in recycling of ink cartridges is justified as in 2010, the management of consumables is handled by  the printer supply companies. Recycling of Other Waste Materials A priority of the Social Responsibility program applied  by the FOURLIS Group regarding environmental  protection, involves the recycling of all recyclable  materials used by the company for its operation. For this reason, we continue to focus on the benefits  of recycling, investing in improving infrastructure and  informing our employees and clients.  The table below presents the total recycling of the  FOURLIS Group in 2010, compared to the amounts for  the same materials recycled in 2009.  FOURLIS Group Total Recycling  MATERIALS 2010 2009 Paper** (kilos) 1.540.095 1.541.070 Ink cartridges - Toners (units) 547 2.072 Batteries (kilos) 7.019 2.266 Cooking fat*** (liters) 13.980 30.743 Aluminum (kilos) 648 1.613 Glass (kilos) 6.840 4.268 Fluorescent lamps (kilos) 800 284 Plastic (kilos) 103.660 16.120 Metals (kilos) 22.610 19.590 Wood (kilos) 260.900 -  *     The recycling statistics pertain to the companies of the FOURLIS Group in Greece and Cyprus **    The paper recycling statistics pertain to amounts collected from all uses, like wrapping paper, carbon boxes, office paper, etc. *** The cooking fat is collected from the restaurants in IKEA stores   40 Environment Use of  Water Due to our daily needs for store hygiene, and the  sheer number of employees, our company consumes  a significant amount of water, and therefore includes  water as an environmental action item.  In 2010, IKEA, INTERSPORT and TRADE LOGISTICS  consumed 3.100.860 liters of water, compared with  1.902.314 liters in 2009. The increase was due to the  creation of new stores.  The following chart presents the water consumption  for IKEA (except Athens), INTERSPORT and TRADE  LOGISTICS of the FOURLIS GROUP for 2010 in  comparison with consumption of water in 2009 and  2008. Consumption of  Water for IKEA, INTERSPORT & TRADE LOGISTICS   2010 2009 2008  water consumption (except Athens) (liters) 29.879 22.496 25.418 INTERSPORT water consumption (liters) 1.891.000 1.335.000 896.000 TRADE LOGISTICS water consumption (liters) 1.179.981 544.435 320.734 Total water consumption (liters) 3.100.860 1.902.314 1.242.152 EXAMPLE OF IKEA THESSALONIKI  ACTION  Reduction in water consumption IKEA, recognizing that due to its volume of work and employees it has a significant impact on the environment,  tries to minimize its environmental impact wherever possible.  Based on the above principle, the Thessaloniki store reduced its total water consumption by 4,8% in comparison  to 2009, while the stores specific water consumption declined by 2%. The following table represents the total and specific consumption of the IKEA store in Thessaloniki in 2010,  compared to 2009 and 2008.    2010 2009 2008 Total water consumption (liters) 15.348 16.115 17.726 Specific water consumption (liters/employee) 50 51 52  41 Social Responsibility Report 2010 D. The Energy We Consume  The Electricity Conservation program is one of the main environmental protection programs we apply. We systematically  monitor the consumption of energy in the companies in our Group, through various sources, with a view to implementing  actions that will allow us to reduce it.  Electrical Energy Conservation The chart below presents the total energy consumption (electrical energy, natural gas and oil) in all the Groups  premises in Greece and Cyprus in 2010.  FOURLIS Group Energy Consumption 2010 Total consumption of electricity (KWh) 32.298.646 Total consumption of heating oil (liters) 54.607 Total consumption of natural gas (m3) 105.754   *  Conversion indexes: Electrical Energy 0.7312tn CO2e / MWh, Heating oil 0.002681 tn CO2e / lt, Natural Gas 0,2025 tn CO2e / MWh. Given the fact that the company is active in various  sectors, our facilities are not uniform throughout and  display significant differences.  Therefore, we have taken note of differences in the  buildings so we can intervene effectively to reduce  electricity consumption. Typical company practices which contributed to reducing  electricity consumption in 2010 were:  Careful use of lighting   The replacement of conventional lamps with energy  saving lamps throughout our premises   The replacement of information systems with  corresponding low energy consumption systems    The completion of the replacement of CRT screens  with new technology in 100% of all screens of the  Group   Expanding use of blade servers to 65% of all servers  in the Group from 60% in 2009. The reduction in  electricity consumption due to the use of blade servers  is estimated to have reached 30%. Due to electricity consumption, total  carbon, oil and gas emissions in the  Group came to 23.990,1 tons; the  vast majority, 98,4%, being due to  indirect emissions from electricity  use. Carbon Emissions from energy consumption Natural gas (CO2 Tons) Electrical Energy (CO2 Tons) Oil (CO2 Tons) 23.616,7 227,0 146,4  42 Environment EXAMPLE OF IKEA ACTION: Energy and Natural Resources Conservation  From the very beginning of its foundation, IKEA has displayed concern for the environment. Openly concerned, it has  made systematic efforts to reduce consumption of natural resources.  In 2010, IKEA stores realized the following actions:    Reduction in hours of use of the surrounding lights at night and the number of lights which operate in alternation   Deactivation of lights operating behind the stores   Sole use of energy conserving lamps   Reduction in hours of operation of lights in the warehouses, showroom and public areas wherever possible   Installation of automatic electricity management (B.M.S.) wherever possible   Limited use of air conditioners through the use of wind curtains at customer exits and warehouses wherever  possible More specifically, as a result of the above actions it is noted that:  The airport store reduced its consumption of electrical energy by 8,2% compared to 2009   The store in Larisa managed to reduce its consumption of electrical energy by 49,5% compared with the budget  for 2010   The store in Egaleo reduced its consumption of natural gas by 15,4% Through the above actions, IKEA has helped protect the environment by conserving natural resources, while at the  same time, has had economic benefits to the amount of 82.715.

Our Public and Employee Awareness - Building  Activities  At FOURLIS Group, we believe that in addition to the actions  we take to reduce our impact on the environment, we can also  play an important role in indirectly protecting it through regularly  informing our customers and employees.  Information Campaigns  Information campaigns, aimed at our customers and employees,  have been implemented since 2008, and aim to cultivate interest  in environmental issues through the use of posters, leaflets and  symbolic gifts.  In particular, in 2010, through our actions we promoted the  following practices:   Participation   in environmental protection programs      in the companys environmental protection programs    Rational Use   of paper      of lighting      of energy in the workplace      of water   Recycling   paper      batteries                            Preference   for recycled paper      recyclable environment friendly bags EXAMPLE OF INTERSPORT ACTION:  Electrical Energy Consumption  INTERSPORTs Electrical Energy Saving program, which started in 2009, continued in 2010 and displayed  important results since the use of technology that regulates the cosine of the main switchboard reduced electricity  consumption by 11%. In 2010, five INTERSPORT stores made use of technology which regulates the cosine of the main switchboard.  44 Environment Environment Friendly Bags INTERSPORT and SERVICE ONE are the first companies in the Group that in  2008, fully endorsed the use of biodegradable and paper bags, while in 2010,  100% of our companies no longer use plastic bags, including IKEA that uses  only paper and re - usable bags.  Earth Hour This year, as well as in 2009, IKEA and INTERSPORT Greece and Cyprus took part in the symbolic action known as  Earth Hour, which mobilizes millions of people worldwide who, through this symbolic act, remind everyone that saving  the planet, requires the participation and compliance of all inhabitants on Earth.  EXAMPLE OF FOURLIS TRADE & SERVICE ONE  ACTION Environmental Information Action Through FOURLIS TRADE and SERVICE ONE, we continued, this year, our environmental awareness campaigns. In 2010, our clients were given the opportunity to rectify incorrect practices regarding choice, use and conservation  of electric and electronic appliances, but also their recycling thereof (when their lifespan is up) by taking into account  the advice given directly by SERVICE ONE technicians, and also indirectly through informational leaflets with  environmental messages which were distributed to customers homes.  Its calculated that, in 2010, more than 10.500 customers were informed about the correct use of electrical  appliances, compared to 800 people informed in 2009.  EXAMPLE OF IKEA ACTION Environment Day At FOURLIS Group we take part in World Environment Day on the 5th of June.  In 2010, IKEA gave special meaning to this day by giving customers a 5% discount on their purchases if they brought  something - even if it was only one battery- to the store for recycling.  EXAMPLE OF IKEA ACTION Distribution of recycling bags As part of the whole effort of the Group to promote public and employee  environmental awareness, IKEA organized the distribution of 40.000 blue  re - usable bags together with printed material on recycling in Thessaly,  and 37.000 bags in Ioannina.   45 Social Responsibility Report 2010 EXAMPLE OF FOURLIS TRADE  ACTION Reforestation in Athens and Thessaloniki The initiative taken by FOURLIS Group in collaboration with the  Reforestation Department and LIEBHERR, to plant trees in burnt areas  of Penteli in Athens and Seich Sou forest in Thessaloniki, gave many  concerned citizens the opportunity, through this symbolic action, to declare  that they are trying to improve quality of life for all of us.  The team spirit, collaboration and will of the volunteers who actively took  part in this effort to conserve the sustainability of the planet, aided in the  realization of our promise, since in 10 hours 8.000 trees were planted.  EXAMPLE OF  IKEA ACTION Creation of Recycling  Centers In 2010, IKEA created two  Complete Recycling Centers  in Egaleo and Ioannina which  operate 24 hours a day and can  be used by both children and  adults. Through these Recycling Centers,  anyone who wishes, can return  plastic bottles, metal tins, glass  containers, plastic bags, batteries  and other packaging for recycling,  thus winning discount coupons  for free shopping in participating  stores, or, if they wish, they can  donate the corresponding amount  to charities.  During the period 01/04/2010 to  31/01/2011, the above Complete  Recycling Centers, recovered  1.579.581 packages or  92.678  kilos of packaging.   F.  Our Activities Over the  Following Year  The goal of the company over the following year is to continue the  implementation of policies and actions it already applies, and also to:  increase the amount of paper recycled   reduce the amount of electrical energy, natural gas and   oil consumed  increase recycling of ink  reduce consumption of water  46 Global Compact Table 7.  Global Compact   Table . Introduction T he Greek Global Compact network was founded in May 2008.  The determination of the ten principles of the Global Compact was based on internationally  accepted standards, as developed by the Member States and the United Nations and are based  on four pillars:   1. Human Rights  2. Working conditions   3. Environment  4. The fight against corruption The aim for the creation of the Global Compact was the monitoring of corporate responsibility and to prove, as much to  the employees as to the rest of the stakeholders, that a companys commitment to responsible behavior and action is a  strategic and operational priority.  Over 4.700 businesses and 1.300 non-profit organizations active in over 130 countries participate in the Global  Compact. This large participation of companies and organizations places the UN Global Compact as the biggest global  voluntary initiative.  47 Social Responsibility Report 2010 Every member of the UN Global  Compact is obliged to:   publicly announce the progress of the  company on the application of the  principles of the Global Compact for  dissemination to all the stakeholders  (consumers, employees, society,  investors, media, government  agencies)   put into effect changes in methods  of operation to incorporate the ten  principles in their strategy, culture and  daily tasks   widely disseminate the Global  Compact and its principles by means  of the communication channels at  their disposal .
