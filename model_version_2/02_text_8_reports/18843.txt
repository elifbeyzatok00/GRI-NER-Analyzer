In October 2011, we signed up to the United Nations Global Compact. In the context of our sustainability strategy, this  represents a conscious step towards increased transparency and visible corporate responsibility. The initiative, founded  by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, aims to strengthen the social commitment of businesses by inviting them  to affirm a catalogue of basic values.     The Vaillant Group is explicitly committed to the Ten Principles of the Global Compact in the fields of human rights,  labour standards, environmental protection and the fight against corruption, and undertakes to continue fostering and  supporting them in its sphere of influence. We will report annually on our progress in implementing the Global Compact  in our day-to-day business in the form of a Communication on Progress. Furthermore, we will detail significant  developments in the implementation of the Ten Principles in the Vaillant Group Sustainability Report.
