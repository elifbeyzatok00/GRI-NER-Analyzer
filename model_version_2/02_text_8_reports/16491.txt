In  what turned out to be a volatile year,  our team of 51 professionals based on  three continents was tireless in mak- ing the most out of opportunities that  arose.  The focus on international sales  expansion has mantained across the  portfolio. In addition, our companies  were well prepared to benefit from the  significant rebound of sentiment and  industrial activity that took place dur- ing the first half of 2011, while main- taining strict cost control as confidence  and market visibility worsened again  during the second half of the year. 11  out of 15 Group companies recorded  their highest ever earnings during 2011,  a remarkable achievement. Almost half of the growth that has been  created since Investindustrials entry  in the current Group companies comes  from non-European markets. This is a  significant shift from in the prior gen- eration of investments, where a growing  and less penetrated Europe represented  the vast majority of sales increase.  Investindustrial is present in Asia and  the Americas to be able to accelerate  the companies internationalisation into  new markets. In 2011 the Group sales  in the Unites States more than doubled  through a mix of acquisitions and strong  sales performance. Sales in Asia grew by  25%, in Europe by 8% and in the rest of  the world by 39%.  Investindustrial com- pleted several key expansion initiatives  in new markets, including the comple- tion of  a production facility in Thailand  for the production of Ducati motorcycles  for the Asian market. In terms of add-on  acquisitions, the two most significant  transactions were Inaers acquisition of  Bond Helicopters in the UK and Polynts  acquisition of PCCR in the United States. Andrea C.

The two main liquidity events  came from the sale of curtain wall manu- facturer Permasteelisa to Japanese indus- trial conglomerate JS Group, and from the  successful recapitalisation of the Spanish  theme park PortAventura. We continue to  selectively find new attractive or industrial  homes for our companies, only to redeploy  the capital in new investments in our core  markets where we can enter at attractive  valuations and begin a new industrially- driven ownership period. The sale of  motorcycle manufacturer Ducati to Audi in  early 2012 is a further example of this.  Investindustrial started 2011 with approxi- mately 700 million available for invest- ments, and used half of this capital to ac- quire three new quality companies and to  make eight new add-on acquisitions. The  firms view is that difficult economic times  are key moments to remain active and  improve its competitive positioning. Since  we believe that we will continue to oper- ate in a fragile market, we significantly  increased our capital available for invest- ments to 1.3 billion. With this capital and  moderate financial leverage, we expect to  invest 3 billion mostly in Italy and Spain  over the next couple of years. As such,  Investindustrial is likely to be one of the  most important sources of private capital  investing in Southern Europe, a strong  statement about our commitment to the  region and conviction that it is home to  many exceptional, world-class companies  and brands. Total  investments  generated  aggregate sales of 7.4 billion  in 2011 with an increase of 52%  relative to the prior year. During  2011, Investindustrial sold one  and acquired three companies;  excluding these new  transac- tions, portfolio sales grew by  27%. In 2011, Investindustrials ag- gregate investments generated  an EBITDA of 1,226 million,  93% higher than last year. Ex- cluding new acquisitions, the  growth was 26%. In line with sales and EBITDA  growth, the workforce of the  portfolio companies increased  by 28% reaching almost 42,000  employees at the end of 2011. 4,313 479 4,741 4,381 4,837 7,370 -8% +3% +10% +10% +8% +8% +52% +93% +28% 569 588 635 1,226 2007 2007 2007 2008 2008 2008 2009 2009 2009 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 TOTAL SALES (m) EBITdA (m) ANd mARgIN (%) TOTAL EmPLOYEES 11.1% Aggregate numbers considering 100% of the companies  present in the portfolio at the end of each year +10% +19% +3% 12.0% 13.4% 13.1% 16.6% 2011 portfolio  figurEs 26,524 27,339 30,143 32,511 41,688 10 11 AnnuAl rEviEw 2011 chairman's report  chairman's report AnnuAl rEviEw 2011 | |  3.7 bn 1.3bn 2 3+8 16.6% During 2011, Investindustrial acquired com- panies with a combined enterprise value of  3.7 billion.

The Groups capital  availability is a strategic advantage in the  current market environment. In 2011, the Group made three new invest- ments in SNAI, Gruppo Coin and Banca  Popolare di Milano and a further 8 add-on  acquisitions to three of its portfolio compa- nies. By supporting growth through acqui- sitions, Investindustrial strengthened the  international footprint of its investments in  such markets as Australia, Brazil, Germany,  Malaysia, Norway, Peru, the UK and the  United States. During 2011, Group sales grew by 52% and  EBITDA grew by 93%, increasing profitability  margin to 16.6%. Growth in emerging mar- kets was strong during the year, and occurred  broadly across Asia and Latin America for  most of the portfolio.

Within that group, Investindustrial  is the only leading firm focused on Italy  and Spain. We are consistently ranked as  the leading investment group in Italy and  Spain in an industry-wide annual survey  by Private Equity International, and was  awarded the leader in Italy again in 2011.  I am proud to see that the dedication and  expertise of our team and trusted partners  has made Investindustrial a rising star  among European investment firms.  With this annual review, we aim to share  some useful insights with you into how we  operate and how our group companies are  growing in a responsible and sustainable  manner.

It is a great honor for  me to manage a company that since 2007 has  increased its margins by more than 40%, more  than doubled its market share and developed 17  new models.  Ducati today is ready to capture  global growth opportunities with a particular  focus on the emerging markets. The co-operation with Investindustrial has allowed  Inaer to implement a successful long-term value  creation strategy mainly focused on international build- ups. Inaer today is a global leader in the emergency  helicopter services and represents a unique platform  growing organically at double digits, from which to  further capture consolidation opportunities arising  in the sector globally. Inaer is a leader as a result of  its focus on safety standards in its operations and  services and its strong commitment to invest in  innovation, development and fleet renewal. The strong partnership with Investindustrial  has allowed Stroili Oro to significantly  strengthen the potentials of the brand. The  Group is supporting the company to expand  its domestic and international network,  diversify product offering, increase market  share and profitability and capture global  growth opportunities with a particular focus  on the Chinese market. After the successful experience with the largest  Italian theme park Gardaland, it is a great pleasure  for me to continue working with Investindustrial in  PortAventura. After only two years of cooperation  with Investindustrial, PortAventura has achieved  significant business results through a new  development strategy based on strengthening of  product offering implementiation of a more accurate  commercial strategy and cost optimization. The  company today is on the right path to implement a  long-term value creation strategy.

Ducati (www.ducati.com) is a leading  manufacturer of sports and performance  motorcycles. The company sells motor- cycles throughout the world and operates  a global network of distributors and direct  shops in Italy, the US, France, Germany, the  UK, Japan, China, India and the Benelux  countries. Ducati produces and sells ap- proximately 42,000 motorcycles per year  and has approximately a 11% market share  in the sports motorcycle segment.  In March 2006, Investindustrial led the  acquisition of 29.9% of Ducati. In Decem- ber 2008, as a result of the tender offer  launched in April 2008, Investindustrial  and its co-investors increased their share- holding to 100% and the company was  subsequently delisted. Ducati was identi- fied as a company in need of refocusing  and an ideal opportunity to further develop  a strong, well known brand. Together with an expericenced management  team, Investindustrial has been able to sig- nificantly increase profitability by investing  in research and development, improving  working capital, streamlining production,  implementing cost cutting actions and de- veloping a more suitable sales mix. These actions enabled Ducati to weather  the economic downturn well and to more  than double its market share over the last  five years. Ducati reinforced its distribution  network and further enlarged its interna- tional footprint: new exclusive stores and  multi-franchise dealers were opened and  the company also reinforced its presence  in selected emerging markets.  19.7% Sales growth      57% Developments since entry EBITDA growth      249% EBITDA margin growth    123% thE 1199 pAnigAlE mArks AnothEr milEstonE  in ducAtis rich r&d history  The new 1199 Panigale S Tricolore was presented in November  2011 at the EICMA International Motorcycle Show in Milan 21  strategies for value creation AnnuAl rEviEw 2011 | 20 AnnuAl rEviEw 2011 strategies for value creation |  STRENghTENINg Of PROfITABILITY ANd mARkET LEAdERShIP EBITdA (m) and margin (%) ducati global market Share (%) (Sport performance motorcycles) The success of the development strategy  can be read in the 2011 results: despite a  market decrease of 10%, Ducati registered  an increase in the number of motorbikes  sold of 13% resulting in a 25% increase in  market share during 2011.

The company is  focused on capturing further growth opportu- nities through a number of global actions that  the management is currently implementing:  Continuous expansion of product offering:  since 2007 Ducati introduced 17 new models.  After the successful launch of the Multistrada  in April 2010, Ducati launched the Diavel in  November 2010 to enter the high performance  sport cruiser segment. The Diavel has been  a great success to date with a 34% market  share in the sport cruiser segment at the end  of 2011. In November 2011 Ducati launched  the 1199 Panigale which was presented at the  latest EICA International Motorcycle Show in  Milan and was awarded Most Beautiful Bike  of Show.  Opening of new production facilities: a  factory in Thailand was recently opened in  order to capture cost production benefits  and sales potential in the Asian markets. The  new manufacturing plant is expected to gen- erate additional volumes of approximately  8,000 bikes by 2015. Furthermore Ducati has  reached an agreement with Dafra to assemble  motorbikes in Brazil in order to capture cost  production benefits and sales potential in  the Latin America markets. The agreement is  expected to generate additional volumes of  approximately 5,000 bikes by 2015.  Expansion of commercial presence with  particular focus on emerging markets (Chi- na, India, Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil).  These markets represent a unique oppor- tunity for the company. Ducatis relevant  market in Asia is expected to grow from ap- proximately 8,000 units to 120,000 units  by 2015. In 2011 Ducati in Asia (excluding  Japan) showed a growth of 73% versus  2010. Ducatis current relevant market in  Brazil is approximately 40,000 units and is  expected to grow to 60,000 units by 2015.

Inaer (www.inaer.com) is the worlds larg- est provider of emergency and mission  critical helicopter services contracted on  a long-term basis with public administra- tions. The Company has over 40 years of  experience with operations in Spain, Italy,  France, the UK, Portugal, Chile, Peru, Ire- land, Norway and Australia.  Inaer operates the third largest helicopter  fleet in the world with 362 aircraft as of  the end of 2011, of which 211 are owned by  the company. Headquartered in Alicante,  Spain, the company employs more than  2,800 pilots, engineers and other staff. At  its current size, Inaer has a clear competi- tive advantage over its local peers: 	 a large and modern fleet;  	 strong bargaining power with suppliers; 	 long-term public contracts giving strong  visibility of earnings; 	 extensive network of operating bases; 	 highly trained personnel with its own  flight simulator; 	 own maintenance facilities operating to  superior quality standards in services; 	 other economies of scale such as in  insurance and purchasing. Inaer provides public clients with services  including emergency medical services,  fire-fighting, sea and mountain rescue,  civil protection customs surveillance and  services to oil and gas platforms. The  companys market-leading position and  concession-based revenue profile has  enabled Inaer to achieve consistent growth  and execute on its global (pan-European)  acquisition strategy in recent years.

The  acquisition  represents  the  ninth  add-on completed by Inaer since Investin- dustrials entry in December 2005 and  strengthens the continued transformation  of Inaer into a geographically diversified  operator with competitive size advantages.  Investindustrial believes that Bond Aviation  Group represents an excellent investment  to continue building on Inaers leading Euro- pean position as a provider of mission critical  emergency helicopter services, reinforcing its  market leadership in Europe and give the com- pany an increased presence in the UK market.  The acquisition allows Inaer entry into the  heavy fleet category of operations, where  Inaer was not present and that could give  access to future growth.  Furthermore the Group can increase its pres- ence in a strategically attractive segment of  the Oil & Gas helicopter services market that  strongly resembles Inaers core business  lines, given the mission-critical nature of he- licopter transportation in the North Sea, the  high component of search & rescue opera- tions, and the structure of Bonds contracts  with major Oil & Gas blue-chip operators  (long-term, fixed charged revenues).

Stroili Oro (www.stroilioro.com) is the lead- ing Italian retail chain for jewellery, watches  and other affordable gold and silver acces- sories. Stroili Oro has more than 350 stores  located within shopping centres, major  department stores and city centers. Investin- dustrial invested in the company in 2006  after having identified in Stroili Oro a brand  with a significant potential for further devel- opment and international expansion. Stroili  Oro has a series of key attributes which have  consistently created value notwithstanding  a challenging economic environment. It is  the market leader in Italy in terms of direct  points of sales and turnover, and it has a  strong brand awareness and competitive  pricing thanks to an advanced logistics and  purchasing model. Under Investindustrials  control the company improved its profitabil- ity through a series of actions which include: 	strengthening	of	the	management	team	 with professionals with a proven track re- cord and significant industry expertise; 	 significantly	 increased	 the	 number	 of	 stores (+ 86) since entry; 	increase	the		Stroili	Oro	brand	awareness	 through an effective media advertising  campaign; 	roll-out	of	stores	in	China; 	roll-out	of	city	centers	stores	in	Italy. The success of this strategy is demon- strated by a significant increase in sales  and profitability. Today Stroili Oro is the  market leader among Italys Jewellery re- tailers located in shopping malls, having  a size more than three times the nearest  competitor. sTroili oro 2011 ebiTda margin  Sales growth      123% Developments since entry EBITDA growth      183% EBITDA margin growth    27% 19.7% The new Stroili Oro  TV and advertisement  campaign with Ilary Blasi 29  strategies for value creation AnnuAl rEviEw 2011 | 28 AnnuAl rEviEw 2011 strategies for value creation |  Since Investindustrials entry, Stroili Oro has  been able to more than double sales and in- crease profitability by further consolidating  its domestic leadership and initiating the  development of an international expansion  strategy. During 2011, Stroili Oro continued  its determined marketing and communica- tion campaign to heighten brand recogni- tion and position the company together  with leading international jewellery brands.  The company demonstrated organic growth  throughout the recent European financial  crisis despite declining consumer confi- dence and has steadily increased its profit- ability from 16% EBITDA margin at Investin- dustrials entry to 20% in 2011. Stroili Oro has developed a strong product  strategy focused on continuous product inno- vation (two collections per year) and constant  research of contemporary trends to position  its products as the most fashionable jew- els. During 2011 Stroili Oro continued the ex- pansion and rationalization of its commercial  network with 22 new openings and closure  of 11 low-performing stores. In addition 17  existing stores were converted into new pro- prietary Stroili format. Stroili evolved from a  retail chain to a branded retailer. During 2011, Stroili Oro started the roll- out of directly owned stores in China. As  of today, 12 stores are being operated  in leading commercial locations such as  Shanghai and Suzhou. Investindustrial,  with its Shanghai office, has been able to  provide full support during the expansion  phase. The gold and precious jewellery  and costume jewelley segments have been  growing at a combined rate of 14% during  the last years and are expected to continue  to grow. In China, Stroili Oro is positioned  in the faster growing end of the market and  with a product offering consistent with that  in Europe. Stroili Oro is actively expanding  its retail concept into other markets and  has opened up the first of a series of stores  in Moscow, Russia.  The significantly increased brand recognition  achieved over the last couple of years has en- abled Stroili Oro to expand in major Italian city  centres in high fast-traffic locations and increas- ing the potential for significantly higher sales  per square meter. As of today, 18 city center  stores have been opened in some of the main  Italian cities (including Rome, Milan, Florence,  Udine, Padua, Livorno) with highly satisfactory  initial results.

PortAventura (www.portaventura.com), es- tablished in 1995, is the largest Southern  European theme park and third largest in  Europe. The park comprises an amusement  park with 34 rides, over 100 daily shows  and 43 shops and arcades, a water park,  four hotels with capacity for over 2,000  beds and a 4,000 person convention and  conferencing centre. PortAventura is located in the north-eastern  coastal area of Spain (Costa Dorada), by the  tourist resort of Salou and less than one  hour from Barcelona. The area is a major  tourist destination which attracts visitors  from across Europe. The park attracts more  than three million local and international  visits each year. The acquisition was made  possible through the close relationships  with La Caixa, the largest savings bank in  Europe, and its majority-owned investment  company Criteria Caixa Corp.  Since Investindustrials entry, PortAven- tura performed remarkably well despite a  very difficult economic environment. The  companys positive performance is a result  of the industrially-driven approach of In- vestindustrial and its repeat management  team from Gardaland led by Sergio Feder.  The key drivers of the overperformance  to date are the successfully repositioned  commercial strategy, improvements in the  park offering from shops and food, the ad- dition of a new kids area in 2011, and an  efficiency programme that has significantly  increased the profitability. porTavenTura 2011 ebiTda margin  Sales growth      22% Developments since entry EBITDA growth      65% EBITDA margin growth    34% 33.7% PortAventura, Spain theme park overview 32 33 AnnuAl rEviEw 2011 strategies for value creation |   902 20 22 20 / www.portaventura.com / portaventura@portaventura.es  6         P o r t A v e n t u r a   P a r k P o r t A v e n t u r a   H o t e l e s    4     2012 Since Investindustrials entry at the  end of 2009, PortAventura has shown a  strong performance: EBITDA increased  by 63% to approximately 59 million  with a margin of 34% and the number  of visitors has increased by 18% as a  result of new park offerings and a re- launched commercial strategy. Over the past two years the company has  focused on the following areas: New park offering: In 2011, the company  inaugurated the new kids area, Sesa- moAventura, with a total investment of  11 million in order to improve the parks  offering. As a result, the parks visits  have improved by almost 500,000 visits  compared to the previous year, recording  the highest number of visits during the  month of June for PortAventura since its  inception in 1995. The company is cur- rently building a new ride in a hypercoast- er style that will be the tallest in Europe  (76 meters) and with Europes longest  drop (78 meters). It will be inaugurated in  May 2012 and will be a landmark change  in the skyline of PortAventura. The new  ride is expected to be a major attraction  for the tour operators and local repeat  visitors during the 2012 season.

As a result, it has  been able to reverse the negative trend in vis- its prior to Investindustrials entry, achieving  a substantial increase of 300,000 visits from  the Catalonia region in 2011. On the hotels  front, the company has worked very closely  with major tour operators both in Spain and  internationally to develop a cohesive market- ing effort increasing hotel bookings by 29%  since 2009. PortAventura is investing signifi- cantly to further diversify its customer base  and to attract new customers especially from  the promising Chinese market. In addition, a new website and booking engine  have been implemented, and best practices  in the call centre introduced, increasing direct  bookings by more than 40% since 2009. Thanks to the excellent performance of  PortAventura, during 2011 Investindustrial  completed a recapitalisation of the com- pany which returned half of the investment  to investors. In addition, the recapitalisa- tion financed the acquisition of the two  hotels (Gold River and El Paso) as well as  the convention centre that up until now  was operated through a long-term lease  agreement with La Caixa. The successful  recapitalisation was one of the few of its  kind in Spain in the last few years.

These seasoned executives bring  valuable industrial expertise in a wide  range of sectors and are closely linked to  the Groups industrially-driven operational  model. The Industrial Partners form mem- bers of the extended Investindustrial or- ganization to assist with maintaining best  practice corporate governance, pressure  testing industrial plans and identify- ing global value creation opportunities.  Recently two new executives joined the  Industrial Partners network: Luca Garavoglia is Chairman of Gruppo  Campari, the sixth largest player in the  global wine &spirits industry with sales of    1.2 billion. Mr. Garavoglia is also Chair- man of the technical committee for fiscal  affairs and corporate governance of Con- findustria and is a member of the board of  several companies and institutions includ- ing FIAT, RCS, Assonime, Federvini and FAI.

Prior to that he held  CEO positions in several companies includ- ing Ferretti Group, Carraro Group, APS, CIFA,  Fai Komatsu and Ford New Holland. For a leading mid-sized Southern European  company, penetrating new markets is often  on top of the strategic agenda and a key value  driver for a successful investment. With its  offices in New York and Shanghai, Investin- dustrial is organised to provide active support  throughout that process and to maximise the  chances of success. Whether it be the devel- oped markets in Europe or North America, or  the emerging markets in Asia, the Groups  office network and local teams are available to  meet the specific companys needs.  The  Investindustrial  internationalization  model is driven both by add-on acquisi- tions and organic growth. During 2011,  eight add-on acquisitions were completed  across Europe, North America and Asia- Pacific for a total value of approximately  600 million. The three main transactions  are the acquisition of Bond Aviation in the  UK by Inaer, Polynt Groups acquisition of  Momentive Specialty Chemicals Incs com- posites and coating resins business (PCCR),  and the acquisition of Velosi by Applus.    With regards to organic growth several initia- tives have been developed by the portfolio  companies in the Asian and Latin America  regions. Ducatis manufacturing plant in  Thailand became operational and the com- pany is expanding its distribution network in  Asia. Through a joint venture, Ducati will also  benefit from an assembling facility in Brazil.  Stroili Oro is continuing the roll-out of jewel- lery stores in China while Perfume Holding  established a joint venture with LuxAsia, the  largest Asian independent distributor. Inaer  has further expanded its activities in Latin  America starting to penetrate the Peruvian  market in addition to Chile.

Furthermore  the new 1199 Panigale has been presented at  the EICMA event in Milan in November 2011  and will be commercialized starting from March  2012. In 2011 Ducati recorded both the highest  sales and EBITDA in its 85-year history. The  growth has been driven by the North American  area that became the most important market  with a growth of approximately 45% and by  the Asian and Latin America markets validating  that the companys efforts in emerging markets  are showing results. As of 31st December 2011,  the company reported a market share of 10.6%,  up from 8.5% as of 31st December 2010. In the  current market environment Ducati has shown  both its resilience and the ability to expand its  market share by taking advantage of the de- cline in sales of its competitors and generating  significant cash flows despite the investment  required to develop new models. sales (m) ebiTda margin (%) ebiTda (m) employees (#) 2007 429 2008 2009 2010 2011 495 475 528 858 +15% -4% +11% +63% 2007 62 2008 2009 2011 2010 76 85 148 92 +22% +12% +8% +62% 2007 14.5% 2008 2009 2010 2011 15.3% 17.9% 17.4% 17.3% +6% +17% -3% -1% 2007 3,271 2008 2009 2011 2010 3,189 4,857 -3% +52% 14,288 4,742 -2% +201% Coin store in Piazza Cinque  Giornate, Milan (Italy) Gruppo Coin (www.gruppocoin.com) is Ita- lys leading apparel retail group successfully  operating a network of approximately 850  stores in Italy and 86 abroad under three dif- ferent brand names: OVS Industry (the larg- est Italian apparel retailer), Coin (the largest  Italian department store operator) and UPIM  (acquired in 2010 and in the process of be- ing converted into OVS Industry or a younger  format named UPIM POP).

The company  has the largest Italian network of almost  600 shops and owns the rights for 2,500  betting corners and the concession to  operate 5,052 video lottery terminals. The  gaming industry has high barriers to entry  arising from its concession nature and  hence provides good revenue visibility.  During 2011 a new management team was  appointed and the company is now very  well positioned to capture value from the  introduction of new games. Snai is con- sidered an  ideal platform from which to  further consolidate the Italian gaming and  sport betting industry. Inaer (www.inaer.com) is consolidating its  global leadership in the emergency and  mission critical helicopter services market  both by reinforcing organic growth in the  domestic market and by implementing se- lective international bolt-on acquisitions.

Investindustrial started 2011 with 650  million available for investments, and used  approximately half of this capital to acquire  three new quality companies and to make  8 new add-on acquisitions. The firms view  is that difficult economic times are key mo- ments to remain active and improve its com- petitive positioning. Since we believe that we  will continue to operate in a fragile market,  we significantly increased our capital avail- able for investments to a current 1.3 billion.
