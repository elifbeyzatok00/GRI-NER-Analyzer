FAIs Stakeholders       3  Chairmans Statement for continued support (1)  Opening of our new Hangar 6 at Nuremberg International Airport    Looking back to the last year, we are  deeply grateful to all our clientele, business partners   and our  employees for all their advise and assistance. Having had this support of each and  every one   of us we were able to do grand strides towards future which means setting new, huge milestones.  In April 2011, we could open our new Hangar 6 in Nuremberg International Airport. In close collaboration  with constructional and architectural Experts, we could create a new office- and functional building considering  exploitation of land and on economical and natural resources. We met the challenge to implement renewable   energy technology as it is solar energy, which can supply much more than the required power which is   necessary to secure the daily operations while installing a   100 kwp roof top solar power plant, ensuring a  carbon-neutral  running. We are proud having accomplished   this kind of project as the first ones on a German Airport.    Through this exceptional project, we could preserve jobs   on more than a temporary basis – on local employment   market as well as in our internal structure.        Chairmans Statement for continued support (2)  Opening of FAI Clinic Mdina Chrif    20,000  residents of Mdina Chrif in Senegal   can sigh with relief: if they are in need of medical   aid, they do not have to head for the long way to the   80 km far apart Kolda any more.       In April this year, me and my wife Ingeborg, accompanied by Ute-Henriette Ohoven – Special-Ambassador    of the  UNESCO Foundation – Education for Children in Need could finally open up the clinic which   groundbraking took place in  2010 .    The Investment was locally supervised by the Austrian Relief-Organization Hope  87.    The new clinic  safeguards first medical care for pregnant women, infants or any other patients who are  in need of medical help.     For many years we put ourselves out for social projects but this was one of our most important ones   so far.   4   Chairmans Statement for continued support (3)  Over the intervening years we attend to Global Compacts Initiative, there is continouos advancement  which affects notably and sustainable our business.     We recognize and demonstrate our committment to the 10 principles as we pursue imploringly the   concepts since we joined the Global Compact in year 2005.                        Siegfried Axtmann  Chairman  5   6  Human Rights Aspects  Principle 1  Businesses should support and respect the  protection of internationally proclaimed  human rights and      Principle 2  make sure that they are not complicit in human  rights abuses.        To respect the dignity of each human being   and to create the rule of law and within the company,   which can develop their human rights are not only  basic ethical precepts, but also conditions for  sustained political stability and economic and  social development in the world.             This principle is very important for us.  As globalization gains that task more and more   practical relevance, it becomes clear that the   protection of fundamental freedom, respect the  rule of procedure, the political and social equality  are the basis of state stability in the interest of  multinational corporations and therefore in our  interest.   7  Labour Standards            For our colleagues we         want the best so we put         much emphasise on light         suffused workplaces and         lounges to recreate, what         has been successfully  implemented in our new Green Hangar recently.    For the prosperity of our personnel we provide   work clothes for all weather-situations, to prevent   diseases we offer vaccinations for everybody voluntarily  and free of charge.     To offer a maximum contribution to a balanced  nutrition we work together with a local partner who   offers a considerable choice of hot meals, most of them    base on biological food.    Principle 3  Businesses should uphold the freedom of  association and the effective recognition  of the right to collective bargaining.      Principle 4  The elemination of all forms of forced and   Ccmpulsory labour.      Principle 5  The effective abolition of child labour.      Principle 6  The elimination of discrimination in respect   of employment and occupation.   8  Environmental Aspects      Principle 7  Businesses should support a precautionary   approach to environmental challenges.      Principle 8  Undertake initiatives to promote greater  environmental responsibility.      Principle 9  Encourage the development and diffusion  of environmentally friendly technologies.      Our major goal this year was to cast a covetous   eye on the numerous display work stations.   To prevent our employees from any health   detriment, we installed  almost exclusively on all our   desks monitors with LED background illumination.  The usage of these particular screens conserves  energy up to 37.2 kilowatt-hours and additional  reduces CO2 emission of about 23.6 kg.    The implementation of virtual servers enables an  exploitation of existing resources at a minimum  application of hardware.    We are always mindful in being delivered with   packaging material consisting of a minimum  of 80 %   corrugated paper what results in another reduce of    CO2 emission consequently.     9  Anti-Corruptional Aspects        Principle 10  Businesses should work against all forms  of corruption, including extortion and  bribery.      Corruption is inherently wrong. It is a misuse of   power and position and has a disproportionate   impact on the poor and disadvantaged.  We fight against corruption in all its forms   as it is the most important thing for us to do.  One of our major goals is to fight against all forms  of corruption.  Based on our experience for many years, it   Always has been our endeavour to meet high   ethical  standards as we are not willing to  take any risks – neither legal nor reputational.
