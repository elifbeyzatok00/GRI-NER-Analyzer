50 ANNUAL REPORT 2010 TOMRA  51 USING THE POWER OF BUSINESS  TO DO GOOD Corporate Responsibility  - Communication on Progress This report serves as TOMRAs first Communication on Progress, a central  requirement as part of TOMRAs membership in the UN Global Compact.  TOMRA joined the UN Global Compact at the end of  2009 as it provided a recognized framework for incor- porating key principles into operations and strategies.   This provided a platform for assessing existing policies   and procedures and rating TOMRAs performance  against the ten principles of the Global Compact to  identify what further actions should be taken. PROGRESS REPORT 2011 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOALS > Start update of TOMRAs carbon footprint > Complete assessment of vehicle fleet > Promote TOMRAs ethical policies through:   – Internal workshops   – Audit of key suppliers > Improve TOMRAs employee satisfaction     rating versus 2010 > Reduce the number of accidents per full time     equivalent (FTE) employee The final CR Program and targets have been  reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of  Tomra Systems ASA. The method used to develop  the CR program has involved representatives from all  areas within TOMRA and has been an important step  towards further integrating corporate responsibility  principles into TOMRAs strategy and operations. REVIEW OF 2010 GOALS > Revise waste management guidelines for the Group   – Completed > Assess available options for vehicle fleet development and     associated costs, including energy and climate impacts   – In progress: target 1H 2011 > Assess compliance with REACH Directive for     chemical usage in manufacturing   – Completed > Establish energy awareness program for RVM sales     and service technicians   – Deferred to 2012  > Implement and communicate Anti-Bribery Policy     throughout the Group   – Phase 1 completed  > Develop 5-year CSR program   – Completed UN GLOBAL COMPACT AREAS  Environment  Anti-corruption  Human Rights, Labor  Labor, Anti-corruption  All TOPICS INCLUDED IN CR PROGRAM  25% reduction in eco-intensity by 2015  Anti-bribery program for the TOMRA Group  Employment opportunities and working conditions  Managing risks in TOMRAs operations  Meeting stakeholders expectations The initial assessment showed that TOMRAs existing  policies already covered the majority of the ten prin- ciples – particularly the ones that were most relevant  for its business activities. However, it also highlighted  inadequacies in the systems for implementation and  follow-up.   As TOMRA already had an Environmental Program  in place (approved October 2009), it was decided  to expand it to include the other corporate  responsibility elements. In May, TOMRA launched  a process in the company to develop a first set of  priorities for the Corporate Responsibility (CR)  program. This involved identifying the most  significant corporate responsibility risks and/ or  opportunities for TOMRA and, through a process  in Group Management, ensuring that the areas  chosen as priorities were linked to the overall  strategies and ambitions of the TOMRA Group.

Some 2009 data has been amended to ensure consistency  with 2010 reporting. 1. Beverage container collection through RVMs. Carbon dioxide savings are calculated based on the total number  of beverage containers collected through TOMRAs over 70,000 RVM  installations - more than 35 billion units annually. All glass beverage  containers are assumed to be non-refillable, which gives a significantly  lower assumed weight. The split between packaging types is based on  beverage consumption data and TOMRA estimates. The full benefit of  collecting and recycling the beverage containers into new material,  versus landfill, is included in the calculation. 2. Packaging material transport and handling The carbon dioxide saving is based on the tonnage of beverage  container material transported and handled by TOMRA in USA.  The full benefit of collecting and recycling beverage containers into  new material, as opposed to landfill, is included in the calculation,  meaning that some of the saving is also included under Beverage  container collection through RVMs. 3. Packaging material sorted for recycling from mixed sources, TITECH Estimated material throughput in Titech installations is used in  the calculation of avoided carbon dioxide emission. The full benefit   of sorting materials and recycling into new is included in the calculation. 4. Reduction of transport due to material compaction, Orwak It is estimated that the installed base of ORWAK Group products  can compact around 85 million tonnes of material daily, reducing both  transport kilometers and fuel usage each year. This is estimated to save  over 60,000 transport movements each day. This calculation does not  take into account the carbon dioxide benefit of material recycling. Note  the change in annual savings following the sale of Presona during 2010. The provision of information on carbon dioxide emission avoidance  is illustrative only, and intended solely  as an aid to illustrate the  benefit to society generated by the TOMRA Group. The above  information does not constitute a full Life Cycle Analysis. The  methodology and assumptions used  in calculating carbon dioxide  avoidance are available upon request. TOMRAs direct emissions and energy consumption   are primarily driven by the Material Handling  operations, which utilizes a significant vehicle fleet  to perform its day-to-day activities. A number of  actions have been implemented to improve the  efficiency and effectiveness of these operations.   Some of these actions have targeted the distance   travelled by each vehicle, while others have  increased the use of cleaner vehicles and fuels. During 2010 TOMRA also gathered information  relating to the vehicle fleet. This data will be  analysed during 2011 to identify where further  actions can be taken to reduce emissions and  energy consumption.   GRAPHS – ECO-INTENSITY  PERFORMANCE VERSUS TARGET In 2010, TOMRA reduced its eco-intensity for  energy and CO2 emissions. The reduction in overall  emissions was primarily driven by actions in North  America, including the introduction of cleaner fuels  on selected vehicles and the closure of selected  facilities. GLOBAL IMPACT TOMRA recognizes its duty to minimize the  environmental impact of its products and services  throughout their lifetime. As part of this effort  TOMRA would like to work closer with its customers   to improve its understanding of how they utilize  TOMRAs products. This would provide a broader  platform for developing actions to reduce  operating energy consumption, which will  ultimately benefit TOMRAs customers and the  environment.  During 2011 TOMRA will start this  process for its reverse vending machines. Environmental program, 2010-15 TOMRAs environmental program runs until 2015 and the main objective  is the achievement of a 25% reduction in eco-intensity versus 2009. Scope 1: All direct GHG emissions        Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity, heat or steam   Scope 3: Other indirect emissions from purchased goods or services          ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW  54 ANNUAL REPORT 2010 TOMRA  55 EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION TOMRA believes that a high level of employee  satisfaction is critical to the companys success,  and therefore recognizes the importance of  meeting employee expectations and being an  attractive employer. In order to first identify those expectations,  TOMRA has introduced a new employee satisfaction  survey throughout the organization. The survey was  first undertaken in Norway in 2009 and provides  comparable and measurable results – both  internally and with similar companies. In 2010, partly as a result of the initial survey,  TOMRA focused on people development and en- suring that its workplaces were safe and attractive.  TOMRA Groups internal HR network has worked  hard to ensure a consistent approach, based on  TOMRAs core values of innovation, passion and  responsibility. The network has also shared experi- ences to develop best practice for common use in  areas such as recruitment and reward systems. TOMRA is committed to providing equal employment opportunities and eliminating workplace discrimination.  TOMRA also aims to have a balanced workforce that reflects the global society in which it operates.  As a result,  the Code of Conduct was amended in 2010 to prioritize attracting women and ethnic minorities when recruiting.

TOMRA strives to be prepared for  the opportunities while also implementing procedures  and controls to mitigate the risks. During 2010 TOMRA focused on addressing the  risk of corruption affecting operations and has held  a number of workshops with key personnel to ensure  that TOMRAs policies and procedures are fully  understood. The workshops also covered possible   dilemmas that employees could encounter in the  course of their activities and how to deal with such  situations. This was part of TOMRAs anti-corruption program    In Norway, where the survey was first launched,  TOMRA has concentrated on involving and  developing its people – a key resource. Specific  actions included improving internal communication,  training sessions for future leaders, and revising the  new employee introduction program. The positive  impact of these actions was reflected in the latest  survey results. which will continue into 2011 and future years.   The management team at TOMRA are working to  promote a culture of zero tolerance for bribery  and other forms of corruption. TOMRAS ECONOMIC IMPACT TOMRA reports the value distributed to different  stakeholders, including employees, shareholders  and society in general. The value added generated by TOMRA was just over  1,300 MNOK in 2010.  This was lower than recent  years largely as a result of the EU fine, which TOMRA  has appealed (further details on page 15 and notes 5  and 24). This value was distributed to stakeholders as  shown in the graph.

Salary should include both fixed and variable  elements. The fixed salary should reflect the  individuals area of responsibility and performance  over time. Principles for remuneration shall be  allowed to vary in accordance with local conditions.  The remuneration structure shall be based on  such factors as position, expertise, experience,  conduct and performance. The variable salary  shall not exceed 50% of the fixed annual salary  and is based on the achievement of specific  performance targets by TOMRA Group and/or  the respective managers unit. The Board has appointed a Compensation  Committee that is headed by the Chairman of the  Board and reviews decisions regarding remuneration  and terms and conditions of senior executives.  The  performance goals for the CEO are determined by  the Chairman of the Board. Goals for the other senior  executives are determined by the CEO and reviewed  by the Compensation Committee. The goals may be  related to financial targets, such as profit from oper- ating activities or return on capital employed, and  other performance-related objectives. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE At TOMRA, corporate governance is defined to  include those processes and control features which  have been established to protect the interests of  TOMRAs share-holders and other stakeholders such  as employees, suppliers and customers. TOMRAs  Corporate Governance Policy has been approved by  the Board of Directors and is available on TOMRAs  corporate website (www.tomra.com). Values, code of conduct and quality systems  Responsibility, Passion, Innovation. These three  elements stand at the center of TOMRAs value  structure, representing the core values of the  corporation. TOMRA considers these principles  to be of vital importance for the success of the  organization and the basis for the way it conducts  itself as it strives to achieve its business goals.  TOMRA has also developed and implemented an  internal code of conduct which sets out key principles  for employee behavior when representing TOMRA. TOMRAs quality and environmental management  systems are based on the international ISO 9001 and  ISO 14001 management systems standards. All units  within the Technology division of Tomra Systems  have been certified according to these standards.  This ensures that TOMRAs internal systems and  procedures are aligned with international best  practice and that responsibility and authority for  all important tasks is appropriately allocated. Corporate governance compliance TOMRA has implemented a corporate governance  program in accordance with the Norwegian  recommendation for corporate governance. On the  left is a short summary with references to the  chapters in the recommendation dated 21 October  2010, focusing on any discrepancies between  TOMRAs practices and those recommended. Principles for remuneration of  senior executives 2010-2011 The term senior executives applies to the CEO  and other members of Group management.  The CEOs remuneration package, and any  adjustments thereof, are agreed between the  CEO and the Chairman and approved by the Board.  The remuneration packages for the other senior  executives, including adjustments of these, are  agreed between the CEO and the respective manager. The terms of these agreements are  reviewed first by the Compensation Committee  and finally by the Board of TOMRA.  In 2010, a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was established, tying potential earnings to the  return rate that the company generates for its  shareholders measured against an index of return  rates from comparable companies (NASDAQ).  Earnings shall only be applied to the LTIP if TOMRA  exceeds the index. Earnings are capped at one times  the fixed salary level per year, and half of  this amount (after taxes) must be placed in TOMRA  stock when realized. In addition to fixed and variable salary, other benefits  such as company car, health insurance, interest- and  installment free loans, newspaper and telephone  might be provided. The total value of these benefits  should be modest and only account for a limited part  of the total remuneration package. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMPLIANCE TOMRA has established a code of conduct as well as an  anti-bribery policy that outline the ethical guidelines for  the corporations management. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION TOMRAs scope of business and strategy is established in  the bylaws, and is described in further detail in the annual  report and on the website.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT  58 ANNUAL REPORT 2010 TOMRA  59 Senior executives participate in the same pension  plans as other employees within the unit in which  they are employed. No special pension plans have  been established for senior executives, except where  a pension plan had been established in a company  prior to being acquired by TOMRA, and the senior  executive participated in the plan on the date of  acquisition. The notification period for senior  executives shall be three to six months, with the  exception of those employed in the US, where fixed  length contracts may be utilized. The CEO is entitled to 12 months severance pay due  to termination by the company. No agreements shall  be established which provide members of senior  executives any automatic right to more than 24 months of severance pay. A detailed account of  the remuneration of each member of senior  executives, including the LTIP, is found in note 14  of the financial statements. The principles and guidelines for management  remuneration for 2011 have not changed materially  from those approved in 2010, which were presented  to the general assembly in April 2010. The policies  concerning remuneration of senior executives and  the setting of salaries have been in line with the  established guidelines throughout 2010. Internal Control Environment and  Risk Management Systems The Board is ultimately responsible for TOMRAs  systems of internal control and for reviewing their  effectiveness. Responsibility for individual areas of  control has been allocated through the CEO down to  the respective member of Group Management. The  system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate,  the risk of failing to achieve business objectives.  The system can therefore only provide reasonable,  but never absolute, assurance against material  errors, flaws or losses. Processes exist for identifying, evaluating and  managing material risks. Methods used by the Board  and the Audit Committee to evaluate the quality of  the corporations internal control include: - Review of the auditing plans for both the external    and internal audit - Review of reports from management as well as    internal and external auditors on the systems of    internal control and any weaknesses identified - Discussions with management concerning the    actions to be taken to address problem areas  The Audit Committee includes three board members  and the Chairman of the Board receives minutes  from each Audit Committee meeting. The main  features of the risk and control framework are outlined in the following sections. Risk Management The Board is responsible for approving the Groups  strategy, its principal markets and the level of  acceptable risk. It has established risk management  processes to identify the key risks facing the business  and ensure those risks are managed effectively. Control Environment An organizational structure with defined levels  of responsibility and delegation of authority to  appropriately qualified management has been  established. A chart of authority documents each  level of authority throughout the organization. Matters reserved for the Board are clearly defined  and appropriate authorization limits and reporting  procedures have been implemented. Information and Communication The corporation has established systems for  planning and financial reporting. Actual results  compared to budget and previous periods, including  managements written comments on these results,  are reviewed monthly by the Board. In addition,  strategic business initiatives and investment  spending plans require Board approval. Control Activities Internal control procedures have been tailored to the  requirements of individual business activities. Controls for areas with particularly high inherent risk  include clear guidelines for delegation of authority,  segregation of duties, and requirements for regular  reporting and reviews. The Audit Committee assists the Board in  overseeing the process for identifying, evaluating  and managing risks by considering internal and  external audit reports, and reviewing the Groups  financial statements. Monitoring Systems Line management is responsible for the operation  of internal control routines and these routines are  subject to independent review by internal audit and,  where appropriate, by the corporations external  auditor and external regulators. The reports of all  these bodies on internal control are reviewed by the  Audit committee on behalf of the Board. The Audit  Committee ensures that, where necessary,  appropriate corrective action is taken. Internal audits are performed by the Group  Controller and the Group Accounting Manager. In  their roles as internal auditors they report directly  to the Audit Committee. The internal audit team  carries out independent assessments of risk and  the adequacy of related internal controls within the  corporation. Findings and recommendations for  strengthening the control framework are agreed with  local management and the implementation of agreed  changes is monitored by the internal audit team. The  Audit Committee reviews the internal audit findings  and proposals concerning improvements to material  areas, coverage and performance and considers  significant findings and recommendations. The  internal audit team has unrestricted access to all  records, personnel and property of the corporation  to collect such information as is necessary for the  performance of its work. The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has  reviewed the effectiveness of the corporations  systems of internal control for 2010 and the period  leading up to the presentation of the 2010 financial  statements. As might be expected in a corporation  of TOMRAs size and complexity, a small number of  deviations were identified during the period under  review. Actions to rectify identified inconsistencies  have been taken. One specific case, identified in  January 2011, involved kick-backs from three  suppliers to a manager within the Group. As a result,  the manager was dismissed, business relations with  the suppliers were terminated and the case has been  handed over to the police.
