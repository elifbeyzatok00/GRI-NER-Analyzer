While expanding our activities we create goals in fields where we  ensure maximum positive effect on the welfare of our employees, protecting  the environment, creating honest and mutually beneficial relationships with our  partners and the society. Our effort is being appreciated by the companys  shareholders, workers, clients and that makes our business worthwhile.  During the last few years the radical change in economic conditions provided  new challenges. We had to make quite a lot of decisions on saving our  expenditures, still we still follow the responsible business practice. It is not easy  to always act right however we learn a lot from our mistakes, correct them and  take all necessary measures for them not to be repeated. Today we are happy to have the opportunity to go through the work done  during 2010 together with you. By introducing them publically we sincerely  hope to encourage social consciousness in business and society. By the way  the summary of our work in the report gives us the opportunity to assess our  own progress and understand how our business can be meaningfully and  responsibly developed. During the last year we managed to do quite a lot. However we understand that  we still have a long path of sustainable development to walk. We invite you to  join us in this journey. Together we can do much more! We wish you a pleasant reading!  SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2010 5 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2010 Executive letter Thank you for reading our companys social responsibility report.  While talking about the work a company performs the impact on the environment is  quite often left aside these days. Is environment protection important? To protect the environment means to know how to live with the nature, live using the  opportunities it provides us with but not breaking its laws.  Companies are seeking maximum profit and simplifying quite a few processes  by refusing everything that is not necessary because that way it would be more  effective, more useful and more economical. While following that the investment  pays off more quickly. Employee and leadership motivation systems also contribute  to the seek of better profit.  It is not easy to change all that. Unfortunately while gaining profit in such way we sacrifice the future. The cities  are getting bigger, territories of old factories are turning into modern offices and  commercial buildings, but people are not so fond of settling in there. It is said that  industrial areas are more polluted.  To clean and tidy them up and make them suitable for people to live in – these are  the questions quite often left for the next generation to solve. Maybe we can live and work in such a way that the company would not do any  harm to the people nearby and the environment would stay clean? It depends solely  on us on how we will get along with the society and what we will leave after us, how  those who will live after us will manage to continue our activities and whether we  will leave something precious to the future generations and whether they will have a  friendly and safe environment. Maybe it is worth to try? Yours respectfully  Virginijus Gumbaragis  6 SOCIALINS ATSAKOMYBS ATASKAITA 2010 Our aim is to offer our clients  innovative packing and marking  solutions and to become leaders  in that area in Baltic states  and improve the welfare of  our shareholders, employees  and business partners.

Improvement of occupational health and safety In 2010 we installed automatic irrigation system inside the companys factory so  that our employees to breathe healthy and clean air. This system ensures average  humidity in workplaces. Healthy and comfortable environment protects from dry  skin effect, prevents dry eye syndrome, reduces the opportunity to get professional  diseases.  Inside the area where we keep and mix paint we improved the performance of  ventilation system. Next step – we plan to install ventilation inside the workplace of  our paint technologist. Considering employees suggestions we built a summerhouse near the entrance to  the factory. That way the entrance to the factory is not directly from the outside and  that prevents dust and draughts getting into the factory.  While collaborating with the company Tuvlita we strengthened health and safety  guarantees for our employees, executives and employees attended additional  occupational safety trainings factory workers attended ergonomics seminar. During  the seminar employees had the opportunity to perform audit of their workplace  themselves. Considering conclusions and suggestion made after the audit together  with their executives they prepared workplace improvement plan and set the dates  for the works. Like every year the company funded flue vaccination for its employees and preventive  health checkup. Safe and healthy workplace,  respected employee rights,  creative climate, employees  who demonstrate their  abilities, who are motivated  and continuously improving  their skills, informal  communication – those are  the things we aim at while  creating a workplace.   12 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2010 During the years of its existence PakMarkas has created traditions that are  highly cherished. Traditions we ourselves have created forms the culture  of our company, unifies the people inside it and encourages creativity.  MAINTENANCE OF TRADITIONS  13 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2010 Workplace  Employee motivation After a few years of break new version of employee activity assessment system was  introduced. This work tool ensures better communication between executives and  employees lets to find out and set goals and reach them single-mindedly, organise  training and plan career paths. Company employees visited various specialised exhibitions, took part in training and  seminars. During 2010 50% (totally 78) of companys employees attended training.  Improvement of employee efficiency In the begining of 2010 we participated in a survey for Lithuanian companies  organised by the company Kitokie projektai which aimed to look more closely at  what kind of troubles, according to employees, can be connected to the efficiency  of work. After summarizing the results of the research employees were given  recommendations about how to act when they see a collegue all worked up and  their executives were suggested precautionary measures they can take to prevent  that from happening. Maintenance of traditions In 2010 we followed our tradition and organised summer and Christmas feast to  our employees and their family members. During these parties we awarded our  employees for activities in the public interest and in other areas.  It is not a secret that our little ones are those who are waiting for Christmas the  most. To make them happy we organised children works exhibition for children of our  employees and after that a meeting with Santa Claus. In spring it was the second time we organised a cleaning initiative PakDarom 2010.  Employees that came to participate in it were all in great mood and planted trees,  collected rocks and raked leaves. After we finished our work we were delighted to  gather around the fire, have a snack and talk with collegues.  After Easter holidays employees were gathered in an annual egg rolling contest they  began to like. The most exciting part of the contest were the awards for the biggest  egg and for the winner of the contest. The company has many sporty employees and those who like to follow the healthy  way of living. When they are not working they have the opportunity to play table  tennis. The biggest table tennis fans can participate in an annual PakMarkas table  tennis competition. We are happy that the number of participants is increasing.  It is important for us  that each employee of  our company could feel  valued and needed.  So in 2010 we created a tool  for executives – adaptation  methods which help new  employees to adapt more  easily to the companys  environment and conditions.  14 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2010 While following environment monitoring programme we  continuously measure the impact our company has on  the environment by observing the amount of pollutents  emited to the air and water. Four times a year we  measure the amount of paper, photopolimers, electricity,  gas, reactive electrical energy used and residual water  emited. Once a year we perform air pollution test. ENVIRONMENT SURVEILLANCE  15 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2010 Environment protection Energy savings On May 2010 seeking to ensure the more efficient use of electrical energy we  introduced reactive energy compensation system – we installed automatic  compensation equipment. According to the data of January-May 2011 the  consumption of electricity has reduced 12% in comparison to the same period  last year. We started using energy-efficient light bulbs instead of luminescent light bulbs  in the company factory. New light bulbs work according to the principle of LED  technology, are a few times more efficient and do not have any components  harmful to the environment such as mercury. Assessment Our effort to care for the environment was awarded the title Company–  environment protector 2010 in the category of small and medium size  companies. While taking daily business decisions, introducing new technologies,  choosing raw materials we consider the impact it all may have on the environment  and the health of people. We care about what kind of environment we are living in  now and are going to live in in the future.  National Responsible Business Awards are organised each year by the United  Nations development programme  in Lithuania together with the Ministry of social  security.    PakMarkas environment protection policy: 	 Perform the companys economic activity observing environmental  protection laws and provisions of other legal acts concerned with the issue; 	 Use the least environment polluting technologies while performing our  activities, seek pollution prevention and continuous improvement of  environmental status; 	 Organise effective system for usage of raw materials, energy and non- renewable sources, work leaving as less waste as possible and organise  recycling; 	 Seek to have responsible employees who understand that environment  protection and protection of natural resources is not an issue concerning  only the entire company but it is also his/her personal duty. Rapid consumption growth  inevitably leads to the growth  of usage of natural resources  and larger amount of waste  left during various production  stages. We are not able to  stop this growth however  we can contribute to the  saving of natural resources  and rational sorting of  production waste. The main  responsibility PakMarkas  takes is to protect the  health of the environment.   Waste sorting We pay much attention  to the processing of  production waste. Waste left after printing  are sorted and sent to  processors. In 2010 our  company gave 5 tons of  corrugated carton and 2 tons  of polythene for recycling.   16 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2010 We support the volunteership idea and believe that business  can meaningfully contribute to the promotion of voluntary  activities. In summer 2010 PakMarkas employees participated  in blood donation initiative the second time. Even 12 employees  of the company voluntarily donated 6 litres of blood.  VOLUNTEERSHIP  17 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2010 Society Youth training projects We are happy to see that PakMarkas is well-liked among active and curious  youth. In 2010 the company was visited by primary school students on repeated  occasions. We showed them the factory, told them how the package is made and  how the labels are printed.  It is the third time we are participating in the joint school and company partnership  project Jaunasis Kolega. Eight students from Vievis gymnasium became  PakMarkas engineers, product managers, staff specialists and administrators. We  believe that after we share our experience with students it will be easier for them  to decide on what profession to choose. In 2010 we continued the Polygraph Specialist Training organised by the  Lithuanian Printers Association – we started educating the third generation  of qualified printers who later plan to receive printing machine operators  qualification. 19 students from Lithuanian chambers of commerce, industry and  crafts aquired comprehensive printing knowledge and developed their skills during  the practice in our company. For academic youth it is a great opportunity to learn  more about printers and printing machine operators professions, visit printing  houses and see how their future workplace looks like.  NGO joint initiative We have joined the joint business and NGO initiative which is practicable  through the project Vartai: social and environment protection innovation of  companies funded by European social funds – together with Kitokie projektai  we started implementing joint initiative Burn-out syndrome prevention: clear  communication and effective way of solving conflicts.The aim of the project is to  encourage partnership between business and non governmental organisations by  consolidating corporate social responsibility principles.  One Chinese proverb says:  If you want to create a life  for a month – grow wheat.  If you want to create a life  for a year - plant treas. If  you want to create a life  for a century – educate a  person. While constantly  keeping in touch with society  we help young people to  gain knowledge, encourage  vocational training and  while learning them we  learn much ourselves.    18 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2010 Seeking to find out whether our clients are sattisfied with the service  we provide we carried out a survey. The results of it showed that  according to our clients the employees of our company feel big  responsibility towards not only their own work but they also take  corporate social responsibility. We informed executives and employees  in our subdivision about the results of the survey and clients oppinions.  CLIENTS OPPINION  19 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2010 Business environment Good manufacturing practice  In 2010 we finished adopting Good Manufacturing practice (GMP). The  observance of its demands guarantees strict control of production and quality  and ensures high quality of our products. Production process development Seeking to maintain high quality of our products we pay special attention to the  additional training of our employees. In 2010 we started implementing factory  workers qualifications assessment and training programme. Annual staff  assessment and qualification overview help to find out about the strong and  weak parts of our production process and increase throughput. Transparent relationship We have concrete and transparent relationships with our clients and partners –  our companys main financial information can be found in various sources and a  few times a year we prepare financial reports to the press/the media. The most  important company news can be found on our companys website and in our  companys special publication for clients and partners called Pakinios.  PakMarkas quality policy: 	 The main principle of the quality policy is to meet the needs of the client  by offering qualitative and modern packing and labelling solutions; 	 The main factor while reaching quality policy goals is the continuous  additional training of employees and personal improvement; 	 Main principles for intercommunication are respect for others and  businesslike communication. One of the main aims of the company is to seek total quality management. Our relationships with  our clients are based  on responsibility, mutual  trust and honesty.  We are responsible for  making products and  offering services which  would allow our clients to  reach the biggest success.  So we are introducing  modern technologies,  improving production  processes and offering  additional training.   We believe that big works start from small things.
