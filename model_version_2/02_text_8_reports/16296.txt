2 FOREWORD  BY OUR MANAGING PARTNER Foreword  by our Managing Partner  Welcome to Kromann Reumerts CSR Report 2012. This marks  the third time that we report our CSR activities to the UNs cor- porate network Global Compact, the worlds largest initiative for  corporate social responsibility. We continue to support the Global  Compact and its ten principles on human rights, labour, the envi- ronment and anticorruption, and we persist in our efforts to inte- grate them into our organizational and commercial processes so  that CSR can become an even more natural part of our business. We have already made significant progress towards fulfilling our  goals for CSR work heading towards 2013. This is first and fore- most due to a very high level of commitment from our employ- ees. They are the entire driving force behind the initiatives that  we are currently implementing in our efforts to help promote the  UNs goals on sustainable development. Over the past year we have been working towards becoming  more ambitious in CSR by, among other things, helping to drive  the development of CSR in business and promote awareness of  Global Compact. It is for this reason that we have added CSR as  a parameter for consideration when Kromann Reumerts partners  want to assume directorships and seek permission from the firms  management to do so. This ensures that consideration of CSR  and discussion about how such companies can work with CSR  becomes a central part of board work.  It is our vision to set the standard within the legal profession.  Similarly, our vision on climate is that we will set the standard  within our industry for environmental and climate issues. And we  are well on our way. In fact, by the end of 2011 we had already  reached our goal of reducing our CO2 emissions by 20%, even  though our original expectation was that it would take us until  the end of 2012 to achieve this goal. Therefore, we are now set- ting our sights even higher in our efforts to reduce our carbon  footprint. Read more in this report under the section Environment  and climate. Even though we seek to make a contribution in multiple areas,  our business is driven by legal advice and it is therefore within this  area that our core strengths in CSR lie. It is here that we can help  make the biggest difference. We continue to provide legal assistance to our selected pro bono  partners, which this year count 11 organizations. Detailed infor- mation regarding the status of the goals set in our last report and  our objectives for pro bono work going forward are included in  the section Partnerships and pro bono.  During 2011 we supported the Danish campaign Verdens Bed- ste Nyheder (in English, The Worlds Best News) and until 2015,  we will continue to support the UNs 2015 goals to fight poverty  worldwide. Our involvement in helping the poorest people in the  world makes sense – along with the rest of the initiatives we have  described in this report – because credibility is one of our core  values.  We hope you enjoy the report!

VALUES MISSION Vision We set the standard Values Quality We provide practical solutions with  commercial and professional insight. Commercial insight We take the time to understand  the business and needs of each client. Spirited teamwork  We stand together as a team, dedicated  and attentive in our work with each other and with our clients. Credibility  We take responsibility for our actions,  for our development and for one another.  Mission Valueadding solutions and advice  with dedication and focus.  Kromann Reumert is Denmarks leading law firm, with offices in  Copenhagen, Aarhus, London and Brussels. We employ a team  of around 600 dedicated people who work with each other and  with our clients in a dedicated and attentive manner. We have  approximately 300 lawyers that cover a long list of practice areas  and we continue to work on developing new areas to meet our  clients needs.  WE SET THE STANDARD  It is our vision to set the standard  within the legal profession. Good is not good enough – we want  to be the best. This is why we continually place demands on  ourselves to stay up to date on the latest in Denmark and inter- nationally. We want to stay a step ahead. OUR BUSINESS STRUCTURE  Kromann Reumert is a partner- ship that shares risk and revenue equally. This ensures that all  partners maintain a mutual interest in working together and al- ways strive to handle each case in the best way possible – legally  as well as commercially. It also guarantees an internal arrange- ment that assigns cases to precisely where we have the resources  so that they can be addressed in the most efficient way by the  most appropriate specialists. 5 KROMANN REUMERT:  IN BRIEF Kromann Reumert: In brief  6 KROMANN REUMERT:  IN BRIEF The firms supreme governing body is the Partners Meeting  which comprises all of the partners. The partners elect a Board  of Directors consisting of five partners, who typically hold office  for three-year terms. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is  Partner Marianne Philip. Kromann Reumerts Managing Partner, Claus Juel Hansen, is  responsible for the day-to-day management of the firm. He  works together with a professional Executive Management  team, consisting of three directors: Tina Larsen, Sille Stener and  Sren Villadsen. Together they are charged with providing sup- port to our practice areas and developing them to the highest  level possible.   Legal advice that can be applied in practice  When we  receive a new client, it is important to us that we develop an  inherent understanding of how their business works. We ensure  that accumulated knowledge about key aspects of our clients  business is shared within the firm so that we can address individ- ual tasks as well as possible, and with emphasis on creating value  that the client can benefit from. We endeavour to deliver practi- cal solutions and to be proactive, particularly where changes or  potential changes in legislation, administrative practice or case  law may be relevant to our clients.  It is our experience that flexibility and accessibility are keywords  in the ongoing cooperation with our clients. Thats why at Kro- mann Reumert the office is never closed. We are always ready to  step in whenever our assistance is required.  Our international outlook  Kromann Reumert is an interna- tionally oriented firm with both Danish and international clients.  We are Denmarks only member of the worldwide Lex Mundi as- sociation, an extensive international network of 160 premier and  independent law firms comprising more than 21,000 lawyers  from around the globe. We are also active in most of the inter- national lawyers organizations – including IBA, ABA and AIJA,  and several of our partners currently hold or have previously held  executive-level positions in the international legal community.  For our clients, the benefits of our unique international position  include high-quality multi-jurisdictional advice and unique access  to a range of specialists in almost every part of the world. At the  same time, we are well placed to help our clients stay abreast of  the latest international trends and developments, including those  that may extend to Denmark. Through our Outbound Service we  assist Danish companies, among others, with their international  activities and the legal challenges that follow.   7 KROMANN REUMERT:  IN BRIEF This requires that we follow our clients around the world. We are  currently focusing in particular on China and India, both of which  are still experiencing economic growth. Among other activities,  we have established a team of lawyers who have extensive ex- perience with Chinese relations, and our lawyer Mandeep Singh  Rathour – who has an Indian background – is part of the team  advising in connection with transactions in India. Over the last 12  months we have been involved in client acquisitions in, for exam- ple, Brazil, China, Australia, Ecuador and the US. This means that  our lawyers must proactively immerse themselves in the laws,  cultures and traditions in each of these countries. Included within  these areas is CSR as an important focal point for us and Danish  companies in connection with acquisitions and launching busi- nesses abroad.  Danish companies typically have very high internal standards for  CSR-related areas, and through our own knowledge and experi- ence in this area, we can assist to increase awareness of Global  Compacts fundamental principles and raise the level of their ap- plication in many other places around the world.  Furthermore, Kromann Reumert is the first Danish law firm to  establish International trade as an area of focus, which covers  topics like the global trade of goods and services of increasing  importance both economically and politically.  In 2011 Kromann Reumert was awarded such titles as the Cham- bers Europe Awards for Excellence 2011 Denmark and WHOS  WHO LEGAL The International Whos Who of Business Lawyers. The year 2011 also saw PLC Which Lawyer, Chambers Europe,  IFLR and Legal 500 give our firm top rankings within a long list of  specialties, and similarly recognize a long list of our partners for  their individual expertise.

ABOUT THIS REPORT 8 This report is Kromann Reumerts third CSR Report – and also our  third COP Report (Communication on Progress Report) – that we  are required to present to Global Compact on an annual basis.  Our goal with this report is to provide our clients, employees and  other interested parties with an understanding of how Kromann  Reumert works with CSR and how we aim to make a difference. The report is structured around Global Compacts ten principles  that address aspects of the four themes: human rights, labour,  the environment and anti-corruption. Additionally, the report also  features a strong focus on partnerships, since the foundation of  our CSR work is our employees and their desire to carry out pro  bono work in a number of organizations.  The reporting year runs from Spring 2011 to Spring 2012. Within  each theme of the report we also describe the specific period that  is being addressed. Report   About this  9 OUR AMBITIONS These ambitions also form the basis for the CSR activities de- scribed in this report and will remain so until 2013. But even  though our overall ambitions stay the same, we continually strive  to expand our goals and objectives within the four themes of hu- man rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. Ambition 1 With respect to Ambition 1, and as described in the  section on Environment and climate, we have already reached  our CO2 targets – prompting us to set new and more ambitious  goals. Additionally, we retain a high level of commitment to our  employeerun pro bono work which has been further integrated  into our legal business. More information about this is included  in the section Partnerships and pro bono. AMBITION 2 Regarding Ambition 2, our goal has been to in- crease awareness of the Global Compact and CSR in business.  We have achieved this through several initiatives. Among other  things, our Communications Manager, Kirsten Hejlskov Jensen,  has had the opportunity to speak about CSR on multiple occa- sions and has given presentations on CSR in the context of intro- ducing the Global Compact into small and medium enterprises.  We have also added CSR as a parameter for consideration when  Kromann Reumerts partners want to assume directorships and  seek permission from the firms management to do so. In this  way we seek to ensure that CSR becomes a part of board work  in external businesses, since members of the board are invited  to directly consider and discuss how the respective business can  work with CSR.  We have further attempted to increase awareness of CSR by pro- viding meeting facilities and conducting various brunch meetings  for SOS Brnebyerne (SOS Childrens Villages), as well as holding  a seminar for directors of charitable organizations where we ad- dressed board responsibilities and Corporate Governance.  Moreover, through our involvement in the Danish campaign  Verdens Bedste Nyheder (The Worlds Best News), we have  helped to spread the word about reducing poverty. And Christian   Lundgren, the partner responsible for pro bono work within our  firm, featured in a Berlingske Business article about Kromann   Reumerts CSR work with pro bono partnerships.  The activities mentioned above are just some of the things we at  Kromann Reumert have done to raise awareness of both CSR and  Global Compact. Other initiatives aimed at fulfilling Ambition 2  are described in detail within the individual themes of the report. We will strive to be part of the driving force behind the  evolution of CSR within business.  We will strive to integrate CSR into our own business and  organizational processes so that it becomes a completely  natural part of good business.   Ambition 2 Ambition 1 Our ambitions Our CSR report for 2011 outlined two overarching goals or ambitions for our CSR work leading up to 2013:  2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 FRAMEWORK GLOBAL COMPACT AS THE FRAME FOR  CSR STRATEGY AND INITIATIVES   Ambition 1 Employee-run pro bono work  +  CO2 emissions targets   Ambition 2 Raise awareness of CSR and Global  Compact  organization Kromann Reumert has established a CSR Steering Committee. The Committee is made  up of the partner responsible for our pro bono work, Christian Lundgren, our HR Di- rector, Sren Villadsen, our Director of Corporate Strategy & Branding, Sille Stener,  the firms Facilities Manager, Jane Meier Christiansen, and Communications Manager  Kirsten Hejlskov Jensen who – together with  Communications Consultant Henriette  Srensen – fulfils the practical role of project manager. CSR- 10 CSR- ORGANIZATION Facts about our  11 11 CSR- ORGANIZATION The Committee meets four to five times a year to discuss both  strategic goals and practical initiatives. Our HR Director Sren   Villadsen works together with Christian Lundgren, one of the  firms partners, to oversee pro bono projects and maintain con- tact with the employee-run pro bono groups. The pro bono  groups themselves are responsible for the work they undertake  through their selected pro bono partnerships.  Jane Meier Christiansen, our Facilities Manager, is responsible for  Kromann Reumerts work with climate and the environment, as  well as supplier management. Our Director of Corporate Strategy  & Branding, Sille Stener, together with Communications Manager  Kirsten Hejlskov Jensen and Communications Consultant Henri- ette Srensen, has overall responsibility for ensuring our commit- ment to the Global Compact and other CSR-related initiatives.  Overall responsibility for Global Compact is therefore placed with- in the Corporate Strategy & Branding area so as to exploit its full  potential in relation to our business, and integrate it into our cor- porate strategy and value chain.

Kromann Reumerts role was to raise awareness about the UNs  Millennium Development Goals by broadcasting The Worlds  Best News to as many Danes as possible. We anticipate that in 2012 we will again support the UNs 2015  goals to end poverty throughout the world. About the campaign   13 HUMAN RIGHTS  ENVIRONMENT  LABOUR  1-2 7-9 3-6 1.

Global Compacts  ten principles 13 GLOBAL COMPACTS  TEN PRINCIPLES  14 HUMAN RIGHTS           Principle 1-2 The first two of Global Compacts principles concern  human rights. Kromann Reumert helps protect human  rights through several partnerships. Among others, we  work with Institut for Menneskerettigheder (The Danish  Institute for Human Rights), Copenhagen Pride, Reden  (The Nest) and Reden International (The Nest Inter- national). We mainly provide legal assistance to these  organizations, but in 2011 we also contributed by col- lecting various donations. Read more about these in the  section Partnerships and pro bono. Human rights   15 15 HUMAN RIGHTS RESULTS: MARCH 2011 – MARCH 2012 Last year, under the heading of human rights, we set a goal to create a code of conduct. We chose this goal because we strive  to maintain a responsible supply chain. A code of conduct places demands on our suppliers to comply with particular standards  regarding human rights. The status of this goal is: Goal Activities We will require certain standards from our  main suppliers In 2011 we created a code of conduct to promote respectable working conditions  and environmental standards in cooperation with our suppliers. NEW GOAL: MARCH 2012 – MARCH 2013 In the coming year, we at Kromann Reumert will continue to make demands on our suppliers. We have therefore set out to  achieve the following: Goal Activities We will require certain standards from our  main suppliers In 2012 we will facilitate and implement our code of conduct. Among other things,  this means that we will demand that our 20 largest suppliers live up to our code and  the guidelines it contains. In the future, our code of conduct will be incorporated as  a mandatory part of all supplier agreements with Kromann Reumert.  16 LABOUR            Principles 3-6 Labour COMMITMENT Kromann Reumerts most important resource is its em- ployees. They are fundamental to our business and the source of the  results that are achieved every day – and the key to helping us maintain  Kromann Reumerts position as the leading law firm in Denmark. It is  therefore absolutely essential that we do our very best to ensure that  our employees can continue to deliver highlevel results. That means that  they must be nurtured and carefully managed within an environment that  inspires and creates enjoyment through teamwork.  17 RESULTS  In our last CSR report we described a series of goals  and activities in areas that included knowledge sharing, work- loads and cooperation. In the following sections we outline the  status of these goals for the period March 2011 to March 2012. KNOWLEDGE SHARING  Over the past year we have worked  to improve the sharing of both technical and commercial knowl- edge within local departments and across the firm. Sharing  knowledge is an important aspect of our business because we  need to deliver the newest and most up-to-date knowledge to  our clients in order to provide the best quality advice and meet  their specific needs. The sharing of knowledge is also essential for problem solving.  The more knowledge you have about a problem, the more confi- dent you can be in finding a solution for it. With this in mind we  have created an introductory folder for all of our newly recruited  lawyers that essentially functions as an abbreviated guide to nav- igating all aspects of the job – from start to finish. The folder is  a tool to increase the ease and efficiency with which our lawyers  can tackle everyday problem solving. We are currently developing a new intranet which will help make  our work processes more transparent and, importantly, significant- ly increase the effectiveness of our knowledge sharing process. We have also had success with implementing Key Account Man- agement for a number of large clients. This has helped us gain  a better understanding of our clients businesses so that we can  provide more specific advice that creates real value for their work. ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES  During the year we have also  focused on how we can best allocate our resources so that we  provide the right skills to departments that sometimes need extra  help – at the same time as respecting our employees work-life  balance. At a firm as large as Kromann Reumert, it is not always sufficiently  clear who needs help. At the request of both managers and em- ployees, our new intranet will introduce a resource barometer that  makes it possible for each employee to indicate their workload  level. This will make the process of allocating resources more trans- parent and make it easier for managers to distribute work. Further, in 2012 we have introduced a new, flexible arrangement  for trainee lawyers rotating from one legal department to another  as part of their training. Our new system ensures that they develop  strong ties with and stay closely connected to the department they  have previously worked in and are given the opportunity to help  out both their new and their old departments – depending on  where resources are most needed. LABOUR  18 COOPERATION  We are consistently working to improve col- laboration across the firm. As one example, we use our annual  company day (known as V-Dag in Danish) to concentrate on  a series of team building activities. Additionally, we have also  made efforts to strengthen the role of leadership in each of  the legal departments by giving selected lawyers more man- agement responsibilities. In 2011 we commenced a network- ing project that appoints selected lawyers as mentors for a  number of trainee lawyers in order to give them guidance in  building both their own and the firms professional networks.  The networking aspect is also one part of our extensive efforts  to continually provide our employees with the best training  possible so that they can continue to develop their skills. EMPLOYEE DATA  Our employee data for 2011 shows that  the firm is continuing to grow with more employees and more  partners, as well as also slightly more women than men. We have done a great deal over the past year to increase em- ployee welfare, including improving the working environment,  switching raw ingredients in our kitchen to organic foods, or- ganizing health weeks and giving all employees unlimited ac- cess to organic fruits, juices and coffee. We have also focused  on subsidies for sports clubs, discount memberships for fitness  centres, massages during work hours, and offering an ergo- nomic evaluation of workstations. Alongside this, absenteeism  has dropped from 5% in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 to only  3.4% per employee in 2011 (and as low as 3.1% if absences  due to sick children are omitted). We cannot prove a direct link  between these health initiatives and the decrease in absence  due to illness, but we presume that this is a contributing factor.  We will therefore continue to focus on health in 2012. LABOUR  19 EMPLOYEE DATA Employees in total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Number of employees  483 547 596 585 588 Number of partners  57 54 59 67 70 Total percentage of women 54,9 53,2 53,2 53,2 54,9 Percentage of female partners 12,25 12,96 13,56 22 20 Average age 35,9 36,2 36,1 35,3 34,6 Health Percentage of absence due to illness, per employee 5 5 5 5 3,4 Work-life balance Women working reduced hours 37 42 34 32 39 Men working reduced hours 0 1 1 1 2 Number of mobile workplaces 250 320 380 410 400 Results of employee satisfaction survey – work-life balance  (rated on a scale of 1-100, where 100 is the highest) 60 67 -* 67 -* Education Total number of days that employees spent attending  courses - 2400 2600 2600 2700 Number of course days per employee - 4,3 4,4 4,5 4,5 Number of internal courses - 70 80 82 80 Employee satisfaction Combined result – employee satisfaction (rated on a scale of  1-100, where 100 is the highest) 73 81 -* 80 -* Management (rated on a scale of 1-100, where 100 is  the highest) 70 74 -* 77 -* The above table features employee data that is compiled every year from 1 January to 31 December.  *Since employee satisfaction surveys are not carried out every year, there are no results for 2009 and 2011. The next survey will be carried  out in Spring 2012. LABOUR  20 GOALS FOR THE COMING PERIOD  Rated against other Nor- dic countries, Denmark sits at the bottom in terms of the number of  women in top-level management or board positions. We are there- fore faced with the particular challenge of creating greater diversity  in the workplace and encouraging more women to take on man- agement positions. Studies have shown that there is a relationship  between diversity and innovation, so it is important to make room  for more women in management so that Danish companies can  achieve the best results possible going forward. One of Kromann Reumerts goals for the coming period is to help  drive the changes that are needed to put more women in board  positions. Our Chairman of the Board and Partner, Marianne Philip,   and our Director of Corporate Strategy & Branding, Sille Stener,  have collaborated with Heidrick & Struggles Copenhagen office  to introduce the network Women Corporate Directors (WCD) into  Denmark (also called a WCD Chapter). Among other activities, a networking event will be held on 30 Au- gust 2012 to bring together board members from the highest levels  of the Danish business community and female board candidates  who could potentially join as new members of the Danish WCD  network. At the event, a number of influential speakers will dis- cuss board diversity, and participants will have the opportunity to  network with each other in a speed networking session. Kromann  Reumerts office in Copenhagen will host the WCD arrangement. Other goals selected for the coming period are described in the ta- ble below. NEW GOALS: MARCH 2012 – MARCH 2013     In the coming period we will work with the following goals and related activities: Goals Activities Employee satisfaction survey 2012 We will conduct an employee satisfaction survey in Spring 2012. Focus on secondment We will continue to focus on making it both attractive and relevant for our employ- ees to be seconded to businesses for short periods. It often increases the depth and  breadth of our lawyers commercial insight to get outside the firm and experience  business challenges from a different perspective. Focus on health initiatives We will continue to focus on providing an environment that our employees can  thrive in, with optimal conditions for maintaining a healthy lifestyle – even at work. More leadership responsibilities for  lawyers In the coming period we will retain our focus on giving our lawyers more manage- ment responsibilities. Focus on an increase in diversity and the  appointment of more women to board  positions  Using the network Women Corporate Directors (WCD) as a starting point, we will  highlight the need for more women in board positions through activities like a  networking seminar that brings together directors from the top tier of the Danish  business community and women that are potential board candidates. LABOUR  21            Principles 7-9 Environment and climate COMMITMENT Kromann Reumerts work within the area of en- vironment and climate originates from our vision on climate: We  will set the standard within our industry for environmental and  climate issues. ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE  22 22 ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE In 2008 we set a goal to reduce our CO2 emissions by 20% by  the end of 2012. We have already reached that goal. Therefore,  we have set ourselves a new target to reduce our carbon foot- print – and in doing so we have dared to be even more ambitious  because our employees are so committed. We will cut our CO2  emissions by an additional 10% within the next four years – that  is, between now and the end of 2015. ACTIVITIES Our staff in the Facility Services department are still  highly involved in efforts to conserve CO2, and they are especially  proactive with regard to finding new ways to go the extra mile  to reduce CO2 emissions. At the same time, they have also faced  a number of challenges in working towards the goals that we  have set for ourselves. First and foremost, we had torrential rain in Copenhagen  on 2 July 2011; the likes of which had not  been seen for 55 years. The result was  flooding in many places – even in  the basement of our offices at  Sundkrogsgade in Copenha- gen. That meant that we  needed to have seven  dehumidifiers running  in our basement for  between  three  to  four months, and it  used a significant  amount of power. In connection with  the flooding we had  to empty out our en- tire collection of ap- proximately 33,000 ar- chived cases to put new  floor joists under the floor,  and at the same time we de- cided to switch out all the light- ing. We changed out 48 basic  fixtures of 32-watt fluorescent  lamps, replacing them with new  LED tubes that use only 18 watts per tube – or almost half the  wattage per tube. At the Copenhagen office our work to replace the fluorescent  lighting with LED lights in our stretch ceilings turned out to be a  greater challenge than first thought. An examination of the instal- lations revealed that all of the electrical installations in the ceiling  were illegal. Such work needed to be repaired by the landlord  before we could switch to LED lights. In any event, we managed  to complete the work in November 2011 and have now replaced  all of the fluorescent lights with LED tubes in both Aarhus and  Copenhagen, and have also replaced all of the transformers. TRANSPORT An increasing number of our employees are  choosing to cycle to work. The number of bicycles in our parking  garage is on the rise, particularly in Copenhagen. There- fore, we have almost doubled the number of bike  racks in our basement and now have room  for up to 241 bicycles. At the same time, we have also  increased the promotion of  video conferencing to an un- precedented level and the  result has been a grow- ing interest among our  employees in the use of  video conferencing facil- ities instead of travelling  between Aarhus and  Copenhagen. This op- tion is attractive because  it both saves time and  reduces CO2 emissions. In  February 2012 we arranged  for two additional offices –  one in Aarhus and one in Co- penhagen – to be fitted out with  video conferencing equipment. We  can now simultaneously hold two  separate internal meetings with video  conferencing.  23 23 ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE In 2008 we set a goal to reduce  our CO2 emissions by 20% by the  end of 2012. We have already  reached that goal.   RESULTS: APRIL 2011 – APRIL 2012   Between April 2011 and April 2012 we reached the following goals and completed the following activities: Goals Activities We will set new goals within the environ- ment and climate area We will reduce our CO2 emissions by 10% between 2012 and the end of 2015. We will make our heating more efficient In our Aarhus office we have replaced 24 windows and are planning to replace some  of the further 102 original windows to avoid heat loss. At our Copenhagen premises the heating is regulated in all offices. Reduce CO2 emissions when setting up  new workstations In constructing our mezzanine level in Aarhus we have installed only LED lighting  and motion sensors for automatic on/off activation. Replacement of the four ventilation fans  on the roof of the Copenhagen office Replacement of the fans was completed in Autumn 2011.  We anticipate that this  will reduce our CO2 emissions by 29 tonnes per year. Continue our switch to LED lighting in  both offices At the Copenhagen office our work to replace the fluorescent lighting with LED  lights in our stretch ceilings presented a greater challenge than first thought. Analy- sis of the electrical installations in the ceiling revealed that they were illegal. Such  work has now been repaired by the landlord and the lighting has been changed to  LED. We completed the work in November 2011. In connection with this work we also replaced all of the transformers since this will  improve efficiency. All of the fluorescent lights have been replaced with LED tubes in both Aarhus and  Copenhagen. We are continuing to monitor developments in this area and to make changes where  the reductions in CO2 emissions will give us a return on investment in 2 years.  Increased efforts in sorting waste Our focus on the sorting of waste in Aarhus has resulted in an increase in the  amount of recycled materials from 18% to 38%.  Transport The number of cyclists has increased, particularly in the Copenhagen office.  We have installed bike racks in our basement to create 90 more bike parking spaces,  which means that we can now cater for 241 bicycles. Effectively, this corresponds to  giving 48% of our employees the opportunity to cycle to work.  ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE 24 ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE DATA   The activities we have undertaken result in the following data:  2008 2009 2010 2011 Comments Waste (tonnes) 121 118 142 105 The reason for the reduction in  waste is that our Copenhagen office  has not shredded archived case files  to the same extent as in previous  years. Waste sent to be recycled (tonnes) - 68 67 43 Focus area for 2011 Electricity consumption (kWh) 1,670,161 1,855,118 1,776,946 1,746,576 Electricity consumption per m2  (kWh) 84 78 68 66 District heating (MWh) 1,542 2,090 2,777 2,304 District heating figures for 2010  are corrected here because data for  the Aarhus office included in our  CSR report for 2011 was incorrect.  This means that the total figure for  district heating in our two offices  increased from 2,090 MWh in 2009  to 2,777 MWh in 2010. But it also  means that the reductions between  2010 and 2011 are greater than  originally calculated. District heating (MWh per m2) 0.08 0.09 0.11 0.09 Water usage (m3) 5,669 6,830 5,485 6,757 Water usage (m3 per m2) 0.28 0.26 0.21 0.25  The reason for the reduction in waste from 2010 to 2011 is that  our Copenhagen office has not shredded archived case files to the  same extent as in previous years. The reduction in our electricity consumption from 2010 to 2011 is  the result of efforts by Kromann Reumerts Facility Services depart- ment to specifically focus on saving electricity – and thereby reduce  CO2 emissions. 0 2008 2009 2010 2011 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 10 0 2008 2009 Affald i tons 2010 2011 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 The primary reason for the large increase in 2010 compared to  2009 is the difference in average outdoor temperature. The mean  annual temperature is +7.7C. 2009 was a very hot year with a mean temperature of +8.8C,  while 2010 was somewhat colder at only +7.0C. Naturally, this  means that there was a much greater demand for heating in 2010  than in 2009. Moreover, our Aarhus office had challenges in 2010  with the ventilation systems heating surface and some heating  vents. tThe average temperature for 2011 was estimated at 9.0C.  The milder weather meant a reduction in our heating needs, which  produced a good result for 2011. The increase in our water usage for 2011 was due to a defective  industrial dishwasher in our Copenhagen office, and we also iden- tified an urgent need to replace old heating vents in our Aarhus  office. Now we can prevent the inappropriate overuse of water in  the future.   0 2008 2009 2010 2011 0.10 0.15 0.25 0.30 0.05 0.20 0 2008 2009 2010 2011 0.04 0.06 0.1 0.12 0.02 0.08 ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE 25 Measuring CO2 Our goal to reduce our CO2 emissions does not include district heating or transportation. Our CO2 targets are based on CO2 reduction  per square metre and the following parameters are relevant to the calculations: 2008 2009 2010 2011 M 2 19,938 25,925 25,999 26,561* *We significantly increased our office space between 2008 and 2009, and again between 2010 and 2011.

This means that we have reached our goal to reduce our overall CO2 emissions by 20% from 2008. We  have therefore set a new target to reduce our overall CO2 emissions by a further 10% by the end of 2015. Next  years CSR report and others leading up to 2015 will be based on the 2011 figures. NEW GOALS  27 ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE NEW GOALS APRIL 2012 – APRIL 2013   We have identified the following goals to work towards before reporting again to Global Compact in Spring 2013: Goals Activities We will further reduce our CO2 emissions Replacement of the existing cooling system with free cooling in the server room at  the Copenhagen office is scheduled to take place in the first half of 2013. Finetuning of the cooling system in Copenhagen in Summer 2013, particularly if the  weather is warm. We will further reduce our electricity  consumption We will work on finding ways to make our automatic on/off lighting sensors activate  from shorter distances in our hallways.  We will further increase our savings on  heating In cooperation with our landlord at the Aarhus office, we will review the central heat- ing system with a view to replacing the 25 year-old pumps that use too much power. At the Aarhus office we will measure the flow temperature of water running into the  radiators. If the water is too hot, we will have it regulated. At the Aarhus office we will investigate the return on investment involved with install- ing motorized control valves on all radiators within the leased premises, since there is  currently no regulation of the heat relative to ventilation.  Our heating must not use in excess of 120 kWh per square meter, which is the average  consumption level for 75% of all office buildings. All figures will be published in subsequent CSR reports leading up to 2015, with the  2011 measurements serving as our point of departure.  At the end of 2010, Kromann Reumert entered into a cli- mate partnership with DONG Energy. The joint initiative  is designed to help us further reduce our CO2 emissions  through access to professional advice, and at the same time  support the production of renewable energy. KROMANN REUMERT IS CO2 NEUTRAL  Kromann Reumert  buys RECS certificates from DONG Energy corresponding to  the 1500 MWh of electricity that we consume annually for  our offices in Copenhagen and Aarhus. The purchase of  RECS certificates means that DONG Energy allocates to us  1500 MWh of energy produced from its wind farm at Horns  Rev II. This means that the same amount of power that is  used by Kromann Reumert is produced in wind energy. We  are therefore CO2 neutral in our power usage. In the course of 2012 we will seek to gain more from our  collaboration with DONG Energy and through professional  advice find out how to achieve greater savings on our en- ergy consumption.  Kromann Reumerts    climate partnership  with Dong Energy ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE 28 In 2011 we finished replacing all of our letterhead paper with  FSC-certified paper. We have changed our stationery, envelopes,  writing pads, business cards, records and file folders, as well as  greeting cards with matching envelopes. We are extremely satisfied with the change and have not en- countered any problems with quality. Kromann Reumert will  therefore use only certified environmentally friendly paper in the  future.  In the preceding two years, we have printed our CSR reports  on FSC-certified paper. However, we have chosen not to print   this years report in order to protect the environment and reduce  both our paper usage and CO2 emissions.  WHAT IS FSC?  FSC is an international certification for wood  and paper that ensures sustainable use of the forests that the  wood is taken from. The certification guarantees consideration  for nature, and the animals and communities that exist in and  around the FSC-certified forests.  Environmentally  friendly paper FACTS   29   ANTI-CORRUPTION  AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE            Principle 10   Anti- corruption --  and Corporate         Governance COMMITMENT Transparency International Danmark is the Danish branch of the global organization  Transparency International (TI), which aims to combat corruption and bribery on a global scale. According  to Transparency International Danmark, it is countries like Sweden, Finland, New Zealand and Denmark  that are the worlds least corrupt. Consistent with our efforts over the last two years, we have sought to  adapt Global Compacts tenth principle to Danish conditions. With this report we have added Corporate  Governance to the title.   30 Kromann Reumerts structure is a partnership, which means that it is not subject to the same regulation as  listed companies on the Copenhagen stock exchange (NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen A/S) who are required  to explain how they meet the good corporate governance recommendations that Denmarks Committee  on Corporate Governance has produced.  Nevertheless, we support the Committees work to promote the development of corporate governance in listed  companies. And we also seek to live up to a number of the Committees recommendations – albeit adapted to  reflect our own corporate structure – and the ethical guidelines that we must observe as a law firm. Among other things, we strive to maintain a high degree of transparency in our organizational structure.  Read more about this in the section Kromann Reumert: In brief in this report. FACTS Kromann Reumerts Chairman of the Board  and Partner Marianne Philip is Vice-Chairman  of the Committee on Corporate Governance  in Denmark. The Committee published recom- mendations in Denmarks first report on cor- porate governance in 2001, entitled: Nrby- udvalgets rapport om Corporate Governance  i Danmark – anbefalinger for god selskabsle- delse i Danmark. Read more about the Com- mittee and download the report at  www.corporategovernance.dk. FACTS Kromann Reumert publishes regular newslet- ters to inform our stakeholders about the lat- est developments in CSR and corporate gov- ernance, and on issues such as trade barriers  in international trade. Read our newsletters  at www.kromannreumert.com/en-UK/Publica- tions/Pages/Publications.aspx. FACTS A number of Kromann Reumerts partners are associated with Business Kolding/INSEAD, which is  one of the worlds leading business schools. Partners from our firm teach corporate governance in  the education programme for board directors.  RISK MANAGEMENT  As is stated in last years CSR report, we also work with risk management as part of  achieving better transparency in our corporate governance. In line with this, we support one of the recommen- dations published by the Committee on Corporate Governance in Denmark – that risk management work is a  managerial task, and a prerequisite for a companys board of directors being able to perform their duties. At Kromann Reumert we used 2011 to identify, analyze and categorize all of our risks. In 2012 we have  commenced focused efforts to consolidate the work of the entire organization and make risk management  an integral part of our management strategy. We have implemented a risk management system to highlight  the risks that the firm faces. The system also serves as a tool that can help manage and minimize the most  critical risks. We have established a Risk Management steering group that includes our Managing Partner, Claus Juel Hans- en, and our CFO, Tina Larsen. The group is charged with making sure that we continue to develop our meth- ods, processes and procedures together with an optimal risk management strategy for Kromann Reumert.    ANTI-CORRUPTION  AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE   31 31   ANTI-CORRUPTION  AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  BUSINESS ETHICS  As a law firm, it is imperative that we are  consistently proactive in relation to our ethical responsibilities.  We therefore allocate a considerable amount of resources to- wards ensuring that we maintain high ethical standards in our  work.  All Danish law firms are required to comply with the Administra- tion of Justice Act on legal professional practice. The Danish Bar  and Law Society oversees compliance with professional respon- sibility and has created ethics rules for lawyers that require strict  adherence to legal professional standards and ethics. The legal  professional practice rules are a code of conduct that regulate,  among other things, confidentiality and conflicts of interest. As part of our general quality assurance, we have put in place  a number of internal procedures and rules that supplement the  legal ethical rules. These help us detect and resolve any poten- tial conflicts of interest. Aside from Kromann Reumerts rules on  conflicts of interest, we have also created a specific set of rules  designed to prevent insider trading and money laundering. INTERNAL PROCEDURES AND RULES  Each individual law- yer is responsible for complying with the rules administered by  Kromann Reumerts Ethics Committee, which is made up of five  partners. The Ethics Committee must be consulted where there  is any doubt about obligations, and must also take up issues on  its own initiative. BEFORE A NEW CASE OR CLIENT IS ACCEPTED   Kromann  Reumerts clients are businesses. Before a new client or case can  be approved, a thorough review of all ethical issues must be un- dertaken. The responsible partner within the firm will then sign  a declaration stating that there is no existing conflict of inter- est and no foreseeable risk of a conflict of interest arising, that  Kromann Reumerts rules on preventing money laundering have  been observed, and that there are no circumstances that should  prevent Kromann Reumert from accepting the matter. If there  are any questions or any doubts as to whether a particular matter  should be accepted, they must be referred to the Ethics Com- mittee. The Ethics Committee ensures that the partners in the firm share  a common understanding about what the ethical principles are  and what they mean. The Committee maintains a continuous  dialogue with the partnership to ensure that day-to-day activities  remain consistent with the firms values. thic  32   ANTI-CORRUPTION  AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 32 RESULTS FOR APRIL 2011 – APRIL 2012   Below is the goal that we set out in our last report, together with the results we have achieved in the period April 2011 to April 2012: Goal Results We will help raise awareness of CSR and  corporate governance at the highest lev- els of management within businesses. We have added CSR as a parameter for consideration when a partner seeks permis- sion from our Ethics Committee to take up a directorship. If companies do not have  a CSR strategy, we encourage the partner to discuss with the board how the com- pany can work with CSR, as long as it makes sense in relation to that business. In 2011 we continued our active cooperation with Business Kolding/INSEAD, where  a number of Kromann Reumerts partners teach corporate governance. Kromann  Reumert has also contributed with activities like hosting a graduation event for the  Business Kolding/INSEAD Executive Board Programme, where around 50 business  managers participated. In last years CSR report we stated that we would design a practical CSR tool for  directors to use at board level. However, we have decided not to go ahead with this  work since our research has shown that there is already a range of tools available  that can be used for board work.

NEW GOAL: APRIL 2012 – APRIL 2013   In the coming period we will work towards the following goal and related activities: Goal Activities We will help raise awareness of CSR and  corporate governance at the highest lev- els of management within businesses. We will continue our active cooperation with Business Kolding/INSEAD, where a number  of Kromann Reumerts partners teach corporate governance. We will continue to help raise awareness of Global Compact and corporate governance. 33   ANTI-CORRUPTION  AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  nti-corruption Human ri Environme and climate abour orruption Anti-corr nvironment  nd climate uman righ Labour Human rights Milj Human rights  PARTNERSHIP  AND PRO BONO 34 artnership  nd Pro Bon Kromann Reumert has created partnerships with a range of organizations that our employ- ees assist by providing legal services for free or at a significantly reduced price. The work is  done pro bono, which means for the public good. COMMITMENT  Kromann Reumerts pro bono work is carried out in accordance with our  pro bono policy, which consists of the following principles: PRINCIPLE 1  Kromann Reumerts pro bono projects include work that the firms em- ployees perform for free or at a significantly reduced price, without such work being  predominantly for Kromann Reumerts own benefit. PRINCIPLE 2  Kromann Reumert carries out relevant pro bono work that is not religious  or political in character (although there are some grey areas). PRINCIPLE 3  The scope of our pro bono work is proportionate to our firms size and   character. PRINCIPLE 4  The individual departments within the firm have the autonomy to take on  pro bono projects in the same way that they can take on other cases, but in order to coor- dinate the firms collective pro bono efforts we have put in place a Pro Bono Committee  that assumes responsibility for Kromann Reumerts pro bono work.   PRINCIPLE 5  As a general rule, we apply the same rules in handling pro bono cases as for  all of our other work. However, when we consider whether or not to engage in pro bono  projects, we undertake a more extensive assessment to ascertain whether a case might  involve a conflict of interest or otherwise adversely affect Kromann Reumert.  35 35 PARTNERSHIP  AND PRO BONO                  Our  pro bono-  partnerships: In brief We signed agreements  with two further or- ganizations in 2011:  nskefonden and  HovedHuset.

They strive to meet  each childs ultimate and innermost  desire – to make each sick child the  centre of attention and foster hope,  strength and joy during a period  when illness threatens that childs  life. Read more at  www.onskefonden.dk.    Hjerneskadeforeningen  Between March 2011 and March 2012 our legal staff recorded 1,099  pro bono hours. Additionally, a number of our administrative employees  assisted with pro bono work, including our Project Center and Printing  Services, and their time was not registered. It is therefore difficult to cal- culate the total contribution we have made to the organizations we are  partnered with. We have also collected donations for various causes at  the request of different employees. For example, in the winter seasons of  2011 and 2012 we collected winter clothes for Reden and Reden Inter- national. In 2012 we donated around 120kg worth of jackets, sweaters,  pants, hats and gloves. In connection with the replacement of our coffee machines, we have  also donated 400-500 porcelain coffee mugs to Reden in Aarhus and  Copenhagen. Reden in Aarhus also received three desks. The level of  involvement in Kromann Reumert remains high, and there is a growing  interest among our employees to help organizations by providing legal  assistance. This is evident when, for example, we use our intranet to  advertise for new members to join our pro bono groups.   Results for 2011 36 RESULTS  FOR 2011  37 37 RESULTS  FOR 2011 RESULTS IN RELATION TO OUR INDIVIDUAL PRO BONO PARTNERS FOR THE PERIOD 1 MARCH 2011 TO 1 MARCH 2012 Organization Goals articulated for 2011 Activities in 2011 OMBOLD OMBOLDs shortterm goal is to transition  from a grassroots organization to a more  established organization active within the  area of social marginalization. As part of  this process, OMBOLD has – for the first  time – received funding from the Dan- ish state. In this connection, Kromann  Reumert will assist with helping to put  in place the legal framework necessary  for the institution, including establishing  dialogue with the public authorities and  updating OMBOLDs Articles of Associa- tion and employment contracts. In 2011,  OMBOLD plans to launch a sponsorship  concept called Klub 2011 (Club 2011)  which is intended to secure a higher  degree of selffinancing. For this project,  Kromann Reumert will assist OMBOLD  with establishing framework agreements  and individual sponsorship agreements. We have provided advice to OMBOLD on their employment contracts. Kromann Reumerts Printing Services department has carried out printing  tasks for OMBOLD. We have provided suitable premises, equipment and catering for OMBOLDs  annual twoday employee seminar. We have assisted with various applications within OMBOLDs regulatory  framework, including applications to Civilstyrelsen (the Danish Department  of Civil Affairs). We have also provided assistance on an ad hoc basis where required, and  have generally fulfilled OMBOLDs needs regarding legal advice. Klub 2011 remains on standby and we did not undertake any activities in  relation to this project in 2011. SOS Brnebyerne (SOS Childrens Villages) We will continue to provide the current  level of assistance with a view to continu- ing to improve, among other things, inter- nal procedures within SOS Brnebyerne  so that it can be seen to be a professional  organization and partner from both inter- nal and external perspectives.  We will take care of SOS Brnebyernes  needs with regard to legal advice within  any area and at the same time continue  with and build on our role as trusted  advisor.  SOS Brnebyerne is expected to join our  special training event for board members  in voluntary organizations. We have advised in relation to various legacy cases where SOS Brneby- erne has been appointed beneficiary, including correspondence with other  beneficiaries and any administrators, and guidance and advice about the  treatment of estate assets or liabilities. We have helped with advice for the associations members on the modifi- cation of existing wills and the creation of new wills, especially guidance  regarding inheritance laws. We have assisted in the preparation of documents for SOS Brnebyerne,  particularly in relation to gifts and bequests in favour of the organization,  and we have assisted with general information on inheritance rules and the  options for making donations to SOS Brnebyerne. We have also advised SOS Brnebyerne on various questions concerning the  legality of donations. In this context, we have helped establish an associa- tion so that SOS Brnebyerne can publically solicit new members without  violating the law that prohibits collecting money in public places. We have  also provided advice to SOS Brnebyerne on different contractual issues  regarding an agreement on the provision of recruitment services. We have also assisted SOS Brnebyerne in relation to a long list of isolated  questions concerning issues like campaigns, and have provided advice on a  series of internal matters, including revising the Articles of Association.    38 RESULTS  FOR 2011 Organization Goals articulated for 2011 Activities in 2011 Brnehjlpsdagen  (or Childrens Help Day) We will continue to provide the same  kinds of legal assistance on an ad hoc  basis as required, as well as project assis- tance for various projects.  Kromann Reumert will take care of  Brnehjlpsdagens needs with regard to  legal advice.  We have assisted Brnehjlpsdagen with a revision of the rules of pro- cedure for its board, together with amendments to the funds Articles of  Association, questions about intellectual property and the preparation of  consent forms and advice on disclaimers for events taking place on property  loaned for that purpose.   39 RESULTS  FOR 2011 Organization Goals articulated for 2011 Activities in 2011 nskefonden (or The Make A Wish Foundation) Goals were not listed in last years report. We have handled various legal tasks for nskefonden on an ongoing basis.  Among other tasks, we have assisted nskefonden in relation to questions  about internal compliance rules set out by the international parent organiza- tion, Make A Wish Foundation International, including (but not limited to)  interpretation and consistency issues regarding the types of illnesses that  qualify a child to have his/her wish granted. We have had various documents from Make A Wish Foundation Internation- al translated into Danish and adapted them according to Danish law. We have also assisted nskefonden in getting key areas regulated by  agreements, including the development of a sponsorship agreement and an  ambassador agreement. We have also helped with employment law advice in relation to volunteer  workers and concerning a specific employment relationship. Hjerneskadeforeningen  (The Danish Brain Injury Association) We will advise Hjerneskadeforeningen on  separating out a particular project to cre- ate a separate legal entity. We will conduct a seminar on board  responsibilities, to which members of the  board from all of our pro bono partners  will be invited. We will provide legal advice on an ongo- ing basis and continue the existing coop- eration, including drawing up wills for the  associations legacy donors. We have helped Hjerneskadeforeningen separate out the project Hoved- Huset to create a private institution. The project, which commenced in 2006  with funds from Socialministeriet (The Ministry of Social Affairs and Integra- tion), is a work community for people afflicted by brain injury who seek an  active life with employment. HovedHusets philosophy is that everyone can  do something, and that everyone is good at something! Kromann Reumert   assisted with the transfer of projectrelated activities and assets from  Hjerneskadeforeningen to HovedHuset. Additionally, we held an especially wellattended seminar on directors re- sponsibilities for charity organizations. The seminar came about through the  regular exchange of ideas between Hjerneskadeforeningen and Kromann  Reumert. We have also provided advice that has required input from many of our  specialty departments. Such advice has concerned issues like: employment  matters, lease contracts, changes to the Articles of Association, material for  the associations website including IP-related issues, and ongoing over-the- phone advice to Hjerneskadeforeningens staff in response to questions about  contributions from donors, gifts and bequests, and pending legacy cases.  Organization Goals articulated for 2011 Activities in 2011 Reden (The Nest) We will provide legal advice on an  ongoing basis and continue the existing  cooperation. Assistance provided to Reden has included the analysis of a funding agree- ment for operations from the City of Copenhagen and its significance in  relation to appeals against decisions, rights for the use of logos and the  review and assessment of Redens Articles of Association. We have also helped Reden by giving them Kromann Reumerts unneeded  coffee mugs, and we have collected clothing for Reden customers. This can  now be used at various shelters. Reden International (The Nest International) We will provide legal advice on an  ongoing basis and continue the existing  cooperation. We have assisted Reden International with employment law issues associ- ated with being an institution that is operationally dependent on fixed-term  funding, an update of Reden Internationals employment contracts, advice  on whether or not to join a collective agreement, and help with handling  claims made by several former employees and their unions. We have also assisted with legal advice for putting in place a scheme where  women in Reden Internationals EXIT system can be offered fixed-term  contracts for paid cleaning work at Reden Internationals premises. This is  intended to help women prepare for entry into the labour market.  We have also helped Reden International with a clothing collection for its  patrons. This can now be used at various shelters. 40 RESULTS  FOR 2011  41 41 RESULTS  FOR 2011 Organization Goals articulated for 2011 Activities in 2011 Copenhagen Pride We will provide legal advice on an  ongoing basis and continue the existing  cooperation. We have provided legal assistance for matters such as a dispute with an  actor/comedian, and other ad hoc tasks. Institut for Menneskerettigheder (The Danish Institute for Human Rights) We will provide ongoing legal advice,  which includes identifying important and  urgent matters that need to be prioritized  over other tasks. We have provided all of the legal advice that Institut for Menneskerettighe- der needed in 2011. We have helped to investigate and evaluate whether a particular contract  that was awarded was required to be put out to tender. We have assisted Institut for Menneskerettigheder in concluding a lawsuit  regarding the dismissal of an employee. Judgement was received in Decem- ber 2011. The case is being appealed to the High Court and we are currently  awaiting a ruling from Civilstyrelsen (The Department of Civil Affairs) as to  whether the former employees can access free legal aid to appeal. Ashoka We will provide legal advice on an ongo- ing basis to Ashoka and Ashoka Fellows in  Denmark. We have assisted Denmarks first Ashoka Fellow, Specialisterne (The Specia- list People Foundation), in the preparation of standard contracts designed  for cooperation with foreign partners who seek to pursue Specialisternes  concept in other countries. Specialisterne aim to change the worlds view of  autistic people and take advantage of these peoples special abilities, inclu- ding by creating more jobs for them for the mutual benefit of the individual  and society. We have also assisted Specialisterne with ongoing advice regarding structu- ral, employmentrelated and other internal matters. Educational efforts  We will place increased emphasis on iden- tifying educational institutions where our  teaching about the meaning and impact  of the law will make a difference. Our  pro bono education group will continue  teaching at CPH West and Erhvervsakad- emiet (The Business Academy). We have taught students at CBS West (the hairdresser school) about inter- net trading (online sales) and starting a business. We have also assisted Dansk Skoleskak (an educational organization for  school children) in a case concerning the allocation of funding. We have  helped them lodge a complaint with tribunal Tipsungdomsnvnet regarding  the Danish Youth Councils decision on the allocation of grants. No decision  has been taken yet. We have also helped with board work at Stiftelsen Georg Stages Minde, a  foundation that trains deck hands and operates a training ship.
