SUSTAINABILITY  Promoting It, Living It  Article 13s Commitment to   The United Nations Global Compact                  Communication   on Progress    Article 13 Ltd.      2011           UNGC Communication on Progress 2011  Statement of commitment     A year has passed and I, as Director of Article 13, and all my colleagues are happy to publish our  eighth Communication on Progress (CoP) report. Since our signature to the ten principles of the  United National Global Compact, in 2004, we have never forgotten that our commitment is an  ongoing process which requires involvement from every member of our organisation, continual  reflection and incremental steps towards improvement.     Thus I, as well as the whole Article 13 team, continue to strive to ensure that we respect and  promote the UNGC principles within our own internal structures. Furthermore, as our major  level of action in promoting sustainable development is through our everyday business  activities, we are also dedicated to integrating the UNGC principles as key elements in our  wider research, advocacy and consultancy work in sustainability and corporate responsibility  around the world.     Indeed, as promoting sustainable development and responsibility is at the heart of our  business, Article 13 is committed to continuing to lead and to build a social legitimacy within a  range of organisations and markets. We see international law, principles and standards – such  as the UNGC – as keys to ensure continual improvement and to enable innovation towards a  truly sustainable society, which we all have the duty to measure and report on. Thus, we  believe that participating in the UNGC and spreading its values is helpful to our business and  our society, both now and into the future.     Our CoP this year provides an overview of what we have done versus our commitments in  2011. In addition, we have reviewed what we have learned this year and identified  improvements that we can make for our 2012 plan. Our strategy continues, from our baseline  in 2010, to focus on the UNGC areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti- corruption.                    Jane Fiona Cumming  Director  Article 13             ARTICLE 13 – PROFILE    Article 13 is a UK-based global consultancy specialising in business responsibility across all  sectors but typically in the areas of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), sustainable  development, materiality, stakeholder engagement, communications, governance, and  behaviour change through social marketing.     Our company name was taken from the 13th Article of the Convention on Biological Diversity,  Rio Earth Summit (1992). Article 13 of the convention was concerned with education and  awareness of biodiversity issues1   . As such, we are dedicated to assisting companies in planning  and implementing CSR and sustainability policy and encouraging the development of actions  that make a positive impact on society. We have a distinguished record in the area of  Sustainability, where we have applied the formidable experience of our directors and  associates to the issues facing companies in environmentally –and socially– sensitive sectors.  Unusually, perhaps, we combine a strong ethical motivation with hard-headed commercial  realism. At Article 13, we bring together the best minds in academia and industry, then add a  special expertise in training and top-level mentoring, and a sophisticated creative polish  derived from the world of marketing communications. The result is a uniquely-comprehensive  package of competencies that achieves a permanent and positive change on every front and  throughout every level of an organisation.  We are not in the business of spin, of papering over cracks, of projecting an acceptable image  over a dubious reality. Rather, were concerned with achieving real and measurable change in  our clients attitude and behaviour; to refit corporations and government bodies to meet the  demands of a rapidly-evolving landscape. Our goal is to enable organisations to adapt for the  future by adopting a more sustainable approach across the spectrum of their activities and by  building relationships based on trust with all of their stakeholders.     Our own in-house commitments to professional and personal development are a reflection of  this. United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) issues (Human Rights, Labour, Environment and  Transparency and Anti-Corruption) and our own values are deeply ingrained throughout Article  13s strategy.  As responsible business experts, we pride ourselves on continuously improving  our efforts to uphold these corporate citizenship values and advocate the business case both  to, and through, our stakeholders.    We are made up of a dedicated team of professionals and a network of global experts who  have worked at senior levels nationally and internationally in the CSR, sustainable  development, governance and communications arenas. Our expertise enables our clients to  address CSR, sustainability and governance challenges, identify future risk, and embed                                                    1 http://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/?a=cbd-13             responsible practices in mainstream business strategy. At Article 13, we maintain a small,  permanent, office-based staff and collaborate, as required, with global experts on specific  projects throughout the year. Diversity, in terms of nationality and gender, is reflected in both  groups.                                    25% 75% Office-Based Male Female 65% 35% Associates Male Female 62% 13% 25% Office-Based UK Europe Other 78% 11% 11% Associates UK Europe Other 62% 38% Overall Male Female 77% 11% 12% Overall UK Europe Other The percentage of  office-based  and  associate employees  that work for Article  13 by gender.  The percentage of  office-based  and  associate employees  that work for Article  13 by nationality.  The total percentage  of people who work  for Article 13 based  on  gender  and  nationality.           GOVERNANCE,  COMMITMENTS  AND  ENGAGEMENT  Our commitment to the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC) is integrated throughout the  organisation, including strategic planning and  implementation at the executive level. A  dedicated team member is in charge of  planning, tracking, reporting and monitoring  our activities and reporting to the Board on a  monthly basis.     We have issued various public policies. Our  Sustainability  Policy  contains  general  guidelines  about  how  the  company  implements sustainable development in the  business. To demonstrate active leadership  and inspire others to do the same, we review,  update and communicate our policies on an  annual basis to ensure company compliance,  to raise awareness, and to identify new ways  to support and respect the protection of  human rights, labour, the environment and  ethical business practices.     Every year, our Communication on Progress  (CoP)  is  made  publicly  available  on  www.unglobalcompact.org  and  www.article13.com. As part of this process,  we commit to share the CoP with our  employees, board members, clients, suppliers,  associates and other members of the Article  13 network as appropriate. This is done  through  our  internal  electronic  communication channels and, externally,  through our regular eNewsletter. Interested  stakeholders  are  also  informed  via  PowerPoint presentations delivered in face- to-face meetings, workshops and training  programmes.       MATERIALITY2 In terms of our permanent headcount, Article  13 is a small business. However, our  operations extend globally and, reflecting the  nature of our business, we seek to set an  example and a precedent for our clients and  other stakeholders across all aspects of the  sustainability agenda. As such, determining  which issues to address – assessing the  materiality of all the issues we could address –  is a critical process for us.       Risks:  As our business activity steadily grows each  year -through increased staff, increased travel  and general expansion, the potential for  increasing our carbon footprint also grows  and more care -and creativity, must be  employed to ensure that we, as individuals  and as a company, not just maintain our small  carbon footprint but find ways of reducing it.      Because of the international reach of our  operations, there is a relatively high level of  travelling linked directly to our core business.  We have, therefore, sought to meet the  challenge of limiting our CO2 emissions whilst  still ensuring our business success.     As an evidence-based research company, we  also have to consider the day-to-day materials  consumed in our offices. We closely monitor  the amount of paper we use (and re-use), we  are careful to use recycled materials both  internally and with our clients and we actively  seek to purchase only local, environmentally- friendly, ethically-sourced products. We are  also, however, aware of the need for  continuous improvement.                                                       2  http://www.globalreporting.org/ReportingFramew ork/G3Online/DefiningReportContent/LowerBlock /Materiality.htm           As would be expected, we are also ever- vigilant in preventing discrimination within  our company, seeking to protect human and  labour rights in all areas.     Opportunities:  Advocating  the  integration  of  CSR,  Sustainability (and UNGC) principles into the  core strategies of clients    Participating in the building of a responsible  business culture      HUMAN RIGHTS   Based in the UK, where such issues are  consistently regulated, and with only a limited  number of employees and suppliers to  monitor, Our direct involvement in human  rights concerns is relatively small. However,  advocating and promoting respect for human  rights has, and will continue to remain, a key  issue for us. Through internal activities and  policies  engaging  our  employees  and  associates  through  to  discussion  and  implementation of increased human rights  advocacy with our clients around the world,  we continuously strive to better ourselves and  those with whom we work to ensure that we  are both maintaining and promoting the  importance of human rights. In 2011, we have  been particularly active in this endeavour and  have focused much effort on new initiatives in  this area.     The ways in which we continue to advocate  human rights include:      Disseminating good practice via our  case studies which form a key part of  our website     Monitoring our new and existing  suppliers through dialogue, surveys  and policy implementation to ensure  they respect human rights      Managing the promotion and respect  of human rights within our workforce  (see page 6 of the CoP)     Advocating and supporting personal  commitments to human rights (page  17 of this CoP)     Providing information regarding the  UNGC, including its promotion of  human rights, to our contacts and  potential clients.    The Directors of Article 13 are responsible for  incorporating  the  promotion  and  implementation of human rights issues in the  companys strategy and activities.      LABOUR  At Article 13, we strive to maintain an open  and equitable working environment that  encourages inclusion and innovation. We  operates a transparent Human Resources  system with built-in accountabilities for staff  and management. All staff are given a full  induction  that  involves  training  and  development,  health  and  safety,  environmental  practice  and  employee  conditions. We also operate a regular review  and assessment for each employee supported  by in-house coaching conducted on a weekly  basis by one of the directors or the  individuals line manager.  Staff are actively  encouraged to participate in decision making  and regularly given the opportunity to  contribute to the development of company  strategy.    We  also  operate  a  transparent  and  accountable labour practices management  system, building and reviewing specific           policies to ensure, where possible, we are not  complicit in any forced or compulsory labour  practices.     ENVIRONMENT  We continue to be committed to high  environmental standards by living, working  and promoting Sustainability in our own  activities as well as in those with whom we  work. We continue to fight, proactively,  against global climate change by reducing the  carbon footprint of our own business  activities and advocating the same for those  of our suppliers. In 2011, we continued to  advocate and utilise green technologies and  materials in our everyday business practice -  including renewable energy - and regularly  communicate our successes, as well as plans  for improvement, to our key stakeholders.     Our approach to meeting our environmental  responsibilities  combines  a  number  of  different strands:      Advocating & supporting personal  commitments  to  environmental  protection through our new Personal  Commitments programme (page 17 of  this CoP).     A formal audit of five suppliers within  our supply chain to evaluate their  level of environmental protection.  This revealed that whilst all five met  our  minimum  environmental  standards, some of their competitors  went further. As a direct result, we  switched suppliers where appropriate.      Continuous informal monitoring of  our suppliers to make sure they  uphold  reasonable  minimum  standards  of  environmental  protection.     Monthly tracking of paper use for A13  office (see page 16 of this CoP).      Distribution of a monthly internal  newsletter to disseminate tracking  results.      Recycling / reuse of paper.     Using reusable grocery bags.      ANTI-CORRUPTION & TRANSPARENCY  We aim to work against corruption and  promote transparency in our relationships  with our employees and clients as well as  through  our core  consultancy  services,  disseminating best practice directly to our  clients. For us, transparency is directly linked  to communication. Internally and externally,  we always make sure that information we  disseminate  is  clear  and  continuously  updated.     Our website and newsletter are the two main  communication vehicles used to inform our  stakeholders and increase their awareness.      As  described  above,  we  operate  a  transparent Human Resources system with  built-in  accountabilities  for  staff  and  management. And our public integrity policy  confirms our commitment to acting against  corruption in all areas of our activity.

As an innovator of new ideas and proponent of  sustainable change, we seek to continuously improve ourselves as  a means of inspiring and setting a precedent both for those whom  we work and those with whom we work. Some of the main on- going initiatives we have implemented and utilise internally are:    Office environmental initiatives   Energy : The company is supplied with 100% renewable energy  and always measures its consumption with a view to reducing it  (monthly heating management).    Waste : Each employee is encouraged to reduce waste and to  use the various dedicated recycling  bins.    Procurement : All groceries for the office are bought fair trade,  organic or locally sourced.   Travel : We propose and use train travel  rather than flights  when possible    Internal communication and employee development    Peer Review Programme : Weekly programme which  encourages employees to report on their work and receive  personal feedback from a director.    Staff handbook : Document given to all new employees and  interns explaining Article 13s internal policies.   Training : All staff are given a full induction that involves  training and development. We also operate a regular review  and assessment for each employee supported by in-house  coaching.    Our policies are designed to implement and promote the UNGC :    External Policies   Sustainability Policy : Explicitly states our commitment to the  companys stakeholders   Staff Diversity & Equal Opportunity Policy : describes our  commitment to fair and responsible treatment of potential and  current staff.   Supply Chain Policy : defines our commitment to human rights  in our supply chain in accordance with UNGC principles.    Integrity Policy : details our commitment to the ethical  performance of the company in regards to clients, suppliers and  all staff   Environment policy : explains how the company aims to reduce  its environmental impact   Internal Policies   Fair Commercial Terms Policy : details our commitment to fair  treatment of suppliers and associates   Client Engagement Policy : Specifically mentions our  commitment to client and client projects in relation to the UNGC   Training & Development Policy : Describes our commitment to  encouraging innovation by our employees   Health and Safety Policy : Details our commitment to ensuring  the safety of all our staff     We also subscribe to these externally-monitored standards:   United Nations Global Compact : Active member since 2004    ISO 9001:2008: Member since 2008    Investors in People : Participant since  2005    We regularly promote similar policies and programmes  (including GRI standards) to our clients.  Article 13s communication and advocacy strategy encompasses  our efforts taken to increase awareness of internal and external  stakeholders through our company activities, including coaching  and training for business sustainability.     Our Peer Review Programme encourages every employee to share  their work and receive feedback from colleagues, allowing us to  continuously improve our work as well as encourages  transparency.     Our annual Communication on Progress report is published on  www.article13.com and shared with Article 13s employees, board  members, clients, suppliers, associate and other stakeholders.     Every Friday, all Article 13 employees are invited to leave work 30  minutes early to have an informal drink together at our Friday  Night Club.     Our website regularly publishes case studies on selected initiatives  that highlight CSR practices as well as case studies on work we do  for our clients. Additionally, we publish bi-annual features to  inform our readers on important CSR topics, offer a CSR /  Sustainability glossary as an aid to learning, and publish our press  to keep stakeholders up-to-date on our company. A monthly  eNewsletter is also distributed to anyone who subscribes to it.     Article 13s directors regularly attend and speak at conferences  around the world regarding CSR and Sustainability and we  regularly organise and facilitate masterclasses on various CSR and  sustainability topics.     How Do We Use the UNGC Principles Every Day?  Communication & Advocacy    Behaviour Change    Compliance and Beyond             We are always aiming for high quality business relationships through ethical services consultancy and transparency in communications.     Specific activities attributed to our achievement of our target this year:   Conducting sector policy, benchmarking and strategy research to advise on minimum  compliance as well as recommend best practice initiatives.     Working with a client in the energy sector to establish a strategy and reporting  framework encompassing their CSR impacts, activities and communications to  stakeholders; and linking this strategy to their business objectives.      Providing independent recommendations regarding industry-specific best practice CSR  initiatives, including information and guidance on national and international standards  for two clients in the global food production and distribution industry.       Aiding a global transportation client in developing a CSR communication strategy  resulting in the publication of their first-ever CSR report.      Offering specialised training to organisational clients through our Masterclasses in  reporting standards, sustainability and CSR, transportation, packaging, sourcing, CSR  strategy and supply chains.      Attending and presenting at CSR and sustainability conferences around the world  including the writing and presentation of a leading-edge position paper on human rights  for a global anti-piracy conference.       Organising and leading a forum for student voices on decisions regarding employment  and involvement in their educational journey.      Continuing to regularly advocate the adoption of AA1000, GRI and UNGC standards to  many of our clients from countries and sectors around the world.       Communication is key for us and so we continuously strive to increase  both the ways we communicate to our internal and external  stakeholders as well as improve the levels of communication that we  adopt with them. This year, we feel that we have exceeded our set  target in several ways:    Each month, we send out an eNewsletter to everyone who has requested to receive it  (signup is available on our website) which details latest updates, information and other  relevant CSR and sustainability news and issues. While this publication is regularly sent  to nearly 5,000 people around the world, our monthly eNewsletter received an  additional 479 subscribers in 2011 (as of October 15).    In July, we published a set of case studies focused on informing our online readers of  best practice initiatives on materiality and innovation (see our case studies on adidas  and Michelin) and in October a second series was published focused on exciting CSR  work being implemented by Olympics sponsors in London (see our case studies on EDF,  GSK and Rio Tinto). All our case studies are always published online and in our monthly  eNewsletters.     Our October Expert View feature, published online and distributed to our eNewsletter  subscribers, describes the importance of stakeholder engagement and offers insight to  how it can be obtained within any organisation.    Internally, we hold regular formal and informal meetings between staff, including  directors, to discuss UNGC issues and goals, our successes and ways we can improve.  We also maintain a monthly newsletter to all our office-based staff to provide detailed  information regarding our carbon footprint tracking and paper and electricity usage as  well as any new information regarding personal commitments, important up-coming  dates (including staff birthdays!) and other office news.     Target 1: Increase Awareness of our Internal & External Stakeholders  HOW DID WE ACHIEVE OUR TARGET?    HOW DID WE GO BEYOND OUR TARGET?                                                     One of our key initiatives this year was to conduct research on our supply  chain to determine the level of environmental and social responsibility of  several of our suppliers. Using publicly available information as well as  personal conversations, we benchmarked five of our suppliers against 2-3  main competitors in areas of CSR, environmental sustainability and cost in  order to better understand our role within the value chain. This supply  chain audit proved to be an invaluable tool for our company and our team.         Full results of our supply chain research and any switches we made as a  result of it will be published on our website and social media later this  year.       Although all of our suppliers are considered to  be active in CSR initiatives, through our  supply chain research this year, we were able  to reconfirm our commitment to all ten UNGC  principles within our value chain as well as to  find new leaders in the field in order to  continuously improve it.            As part of our client work this year, we provided education regarding  sustainability and materiality for a client in the food industry  procurement supply chain. This involved leading a workshop with  procurement directors as well as external experts to identify the issues,  stages, and key actions to be taken towards a more sustainable supply  chain; we then advised on how to integrate this into the company's  overall sustainability strategy.          Materiality  Materiality is determining the relevance and  significance of an issue to an organisation and  its stakeholders. A material issue is an issue  that will influence the decisions, actions and  performance of an organisation or its  stakeholders    Definition: AA1000 - 2008.     Target 2: Actively Monitor the Impact of Our Supply Chain  We work with suppliers for various services and are committed to ensure that these suppliers maintain the high standards we set in regards to all ten UNGC principles.  Through policy and practice, we strive to manage our supply chain in a way that continuously encourages and enforces ethical and sustainable behaviour and products.    HOW DID WE ACHIEVE OUR TARGET?    HOW DID WE GO BEYOND OUR TARGET?                                                   In 2010, the team at Article 13 expressed an interest in further developing  our participation in human rights. It was decided that perhaps one of the  most active ways of doing so would be by partnering with a local non- governmental organisation (NGO) where we as a company, as well as  individuals, could contribute to human rights in a more active, collaborative  and hands-on way.  Throughout 2011, research was conducted to find a  local, recognised NGO that was non-political in nature and effectively  promoting human rights with whom we could non-monetarily partner  (using the UK Charity Commissions Hallmarks of an Effective Charity  standards). Through our research, a suitable NGO has been identified and  there are currently on-going discussions between us to determine the best  way to approach a partnership. We hope to announce an official  partnership as well as our goals for it in early 2012.     Additionally, one of our employees did a sponsored climb of Mt.  Kilimanjaro as a means of raising awareness and donations for Camfed, a  global charity which fights poverty and HIV / AIDS in rural Africa by  investing in young womens education, enterprise and leadership. Through  sponsorship and GiftAid, he was able to raise 2,700.      As part of our client work in 2011, we worked with a trade union to  provide training for its members to better understand sustainability, CSR  and specifically the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We also  gave practical support and guidance on how this training could be taken  back to and into the members respective organisations.    In addition, we developed a localised operational CSR strategy for a  global company in the mining sector in order to understand best  practice and to set, monitor and achieve global standards around  human rights. As no company is able to offer work to everyone within  the region, a key feature of our work with this client was the  development of an appropriate approach which takes into consideration  the companys boundaries of inclusion so as to ensure human rights are       What are the Millennium Development Goals?    Adopted by World leaders in the year 2000 and set to be achieved by 2015,  the Millennium Development Goals provide a framework for the entire  international community to work together towards a common end –  making sure that human development reached everyone, everywhere. If  these goals are achieved, world poverty will be cut by half, tens of millions  of lives will be saved, and billions more people will have the opportunity to  benefit from the global economy.   Target 3: Zero Negative Impact on Human Rights  Human rights have always been a key value of Article 13 even if our activity impacts are quite low. In this area, we were particularly keen throughout 2011 to ensure that we  were both maintaining and promoting the importance of a responsible and ethical business.     HOW DID WE ACHIEVE OUR TARGET?    HOW DID WE GO BEYOND OUR TARGET?                                                     We operate a continuous internship programme at Article 13 as a way of  developing skills as well as inspiring new ideas and creativity among all  our staff. All interns meet weekly with their manager and regularly with  directors to discuss the work they are involved in, answer any queries  they may have, and generally check-in as a means of ensuring their  comfort and integration into the office and with other members of staff.  At the end of every internship, all interns also take part in an exit  interview and questionnaire to discuss and communicate their internship  and ways to achieve continuous improvement.         Eight Monday Press mornings, or office-wide meetings among all staff,  have also been conducted this year as a way to encourage and facilitate  communication and collaboration. As an office-wide event, eight  internationally themed office-wide lunches have also taken place this  year; and we always celebrate every staff members birthday with a card  and cake.     Our twice-yearly well-being events this year  included a trip to Kew Gardens for an outdoor  concert and picnic and Christmas dinner at a  local restaurant.            What some of our previous interns have said about  their time at Article 13:  "My time at Article 13 has afforded me a different  perspective of the role of business in development and  environmental issues; I now appreciate to a far greater  level the importance of business-led development and the  role independent organisations (such as Article 13) can  play."  "I have never experienced an environment that expressed  such gratitude for tasks done well."  "Thanks to Article 13 I can work with experienced CSR  experts, probably best in the UK.  The communication  inside the office is great and I feel that my actions have an  impact on the company and are part of a bigger picture."    Target 4: Commit to Care about Our Employees and Associates  At Article 13, we continuously strive to maintain a working environment that emphasises inclusion, innovation and community and which encourages the personal and  professional development of all our employees and associates.    HOW DID WE ACHIEVE OUR TARGET?    HOW DID WE GO BEYOND OUR TARGET?                                                     Through monitoring our electricity and travel, this year we have reduced  our annual CO2 emissions by 12% relative to business activity.     By  encouraging  more  environmentally-friendly  ways  of  travel,  implementing use of the track changes system in our peer review  programme and printing rules communication campaign, relative to  business activity we have reduced our annual paper usage by 72%    Electricity  Consumption  (Kwh) 2010 2011 CO2 Emissions  (Tonnes) 2010 2011 Paper Consumption (sheets) 2011 2010             This year, in addition to reducing our carbon emissions, we also reduced  the amount of electricity as well as the amount of paper we used. Next  year, we aim to reduce our impact by using even less.     Starting this year, we  have one member of  our team dedicated to  monthly reporting and  communication of  Article 13s CO2  emissions and paper  consumption.  Target 5: Minimal CO2 Consumption in Relation to Business Activity  Article 13 continues to be committed to high environmental standards in our office as well as in the activities of those with whom we work. One way we are able to do this is  by continuous monitoring and implementation of initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint  HOW DID WE ACHIEVE OUR TARGET?    HOW DID WE GO BEYOND OUR TARGET?                                                   This year, Article 13 has implemented a Personal Commitments programme  for all office-based staff. Although entirely voluntary, each team member at  Article 13 is encouraged to make one or more achievable commitments  relating directly to at least one of the ten UNGC principles. These commitments  can be delivered both in and out of the office in both a work and home  environment and in any area(s) which those participating feel strongly about  and would like to improve. Individuals are asked to report back informally on  their progress and successes on a monthly basis and this information is  disseminated throughout the office in the Article 13 internal newsletter.         Personal Commitments this year include:    Donating to charity    Volunteering with an NGO    Procurement from local retailers    Walking / riding to work    Reducing car use    Maintaining more electronic copies of documents rather than  printing    Using track changes    Using reusable shopping bags / reusable coffee cups    Incorporating more recycling measures at home    Explaining and promoting the UNGC to new and potential  clients    Developing clear job descriptions     There has been a great acceptance of the programme and many  commitments were made by team members this year. All full- and part- time staff have voluntarily taken part and have reported continuous  progress in their efforts. Additionally, in conjunction with other  programmes and initiatives at Article 13, the Personal Commitments  programme has helped us to reduce office paper consumption by 23% from  last year and decrease our electricity use by 19% despite an increase in  business activity. Article 13 staff have also increased their use of public  transport for getting to and from work, cutting CO2 emissions by 32% in  2011 relative to 2010.              Paper Consumption (sheets) 2011 2010 Electricity Consumption  (Kwh) 2011 2010 CO2 Emissions  (Tonnes) 2011 2010 Target 6: Personal Commitments  One area of concentration in the UNGC and an important aspect of Article 13s commitment to it is the incorporation of the Compacts ten principles into the day-to-day  activities of the business. Because every personal commitment is tailored to each members role, routine and passions, implementing the Personal Commitment Programme  has offered Article 13 a great way to enthusiastically incorporate UNGC principles into the overall business strategy as well as our day-to-day and personal routines.  HOW DID WE ACHIEVE OUR TARGET?    HOW DID WE GO BEYOND OUR TARGET?                                         This year, we will undertake an internal audit of national and international  regulations that are pertinent to our activities in order to update our policies  (current policies can be found in this reports appendix). We will continue to  update all of our policies annually and communicate them through publication  of this CoP and via our website.       We continued to implement the standards of ISO 9001:2008 to ensure that we  meet the quality requirements of our clients and stakeholders. Our  accreditation in this programme was externally audited in November 2011.       In 2011 we also participated in the national Investors in People (IiP) programme  as a way to continuously improve our high management standards. Externally  audited every three years, we last underwent external evaluation for IiP  certification in November 2008.                     We have designated a health and safety coordinator responsible for the daily  management of health and safety policies who has successfully completed  national fire marshal and first aid training designed for the workplace.     We also have an open dialogue policy and encourage comments - both positive  and negative - and suggestions regarding health and safety policy or  procedures.    In 2011, no member of our office-based staff has suffered any occupational  injury or disease, nor were there any lost days, absenteeism or fatalities due to  occupational injury or illness in 2010.         Target 7: Maintain Zero Direct Negative Impact in All UNGC Areas  Respect for laws and regulations is the first step in terms of building a responsible strategy - but we seek to go beyond that in many different ways.      HOW DID WE ACHIEVE OUR TARGET?    HOW DID WE GO BEYOND OUR TARGET?    FOR US, ITS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLES    Upholding and promoting the 10 UNGC Principles and the  Millennium Development Goals is not simply an addition to  what Article 13 does. Those values are at the very heart of our  business.     To ensure that Article 13 is improving its commitment, the  challenge is to be able to measure, to publicly report and  monitor the activities.                     Appendix     Article 13 Policies           Effective 1st August 2007; reviewed August 2009, October 2010, Updated November 2011  1  CLIENT ENGAGEMENT POLICY  ARTICLE 13 LTD    It is the policy of the management of Article 13 Ltd to establish clear and transparent working relationships  with its clients in order to manage expectations appropriately and deliver according to project requirements.   Article 13 is committed to developing long term relationships with its clients.  As a responsible and connected corporate citizen, Article 13 is committed to continuous improvements in its  engagement with clients.  Article 13 seeks to demonstrate active leadership in its supply chain activities, and  inspire clients and partners to do the same, such that human rights, labour standards and environmental laws  and codes of practice will be regarded as setting the minimum standards for the Companys whole supply  chain performance.  Article 13, in accordance with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, recognises the impact of its  decisions in respect of clients and client projects upon the local, regional and global community and  environment.  Article 13, therefore, is committed to thoroughly researching and making informed decisions  about the clients it works for and the projects it works on.  Article 13 will consider at board level any decision to work with clients whose core business might be  considered unethical.  If a decision is taken to work with a controversial company, Article 13 would ensure that  the client adheres to strict conditions.  All employees and temporary workers have a duty to:    carry out their work with clients and on client projects with high regard to ethical standards;    treat confidential information with due care and proper consideration of the legal and ethical  ramifications.    draw to management attention any information they come across, which may impact on Article 13s  decision to work with a particular client or on a particular project.      COMMITMENTS  STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES       Effective 1st August 2007; reviewed August 2009, October 2010, Updated November 2011  2    The management of Article 13 will strive to safeguard the reputation and future sustainability of Article 13, its  associates and suppliers.  Article 13 will therefore decline to supply services unless the client makes a serious  commitment to ensure, for its own organisation and for the suppliers it can influence, that:    employment is freely chosen;    freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining are respected;    working conditions are safe and hygienic;    child labour is not tolerated;    reasonable living wages are paid;    working hours are not excessive;    except where dictated by regional law, no discrimination is practiced based on equality in hiring,  compensation, access to training, promotion, termination or retirement, race, caste, national origin,  religion, age, disability, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, union membership or political  affiliation;    regular employment is provided;    no harsh or inhumane treatment is allowed, including threat of physical abuse, sexual or other  harassment and verbal abuse or other forms of intimidation;    environmental stewardship is practiced.  In practice, Article 13 will as far as possible:    communicate with clients regularly in an open and transparent manner, ensuring that regular  progress reviews and evaluations are built into the project cycle;    adhere to its ISO 9001 policies and procedures, including striving for 100% customer satisfaction    recognise and make a point of reinforcing communication with any new contact person for potential  and existing clients;      avoid delivering services to a client that does not uphold or demonstrate commitment to the ten  principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC);    avoid working with clients or on projects widely known to involve poor practices;    review potential clients and engagements with them on ethical grounds and involve the board in final  decision-making and setting of attached conditions wherever doubt is raised over a prospective  clients integrity, the controversial nature of the core business or a projects sustainability.    treat all data in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998  STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES       Effective 1st August 2007; reviewed August 2009, October 2010, Updated November 2011  3    The management of Article 13 reserves the right to terminate work with a client or on a specific project if the  client is:    not seen to be serious about moving towards responsible practices or is corrupt or not working in the  spirit of the UNGC principles;    displaying aggressive, unsatisfactory or unprofessional behaviour towards Article 13 and its staff.     Article 13s policy for client engagement will be reviewed annually and amended as necessary.  A copy of this policy and all subsequent revisions will be brought to the notice of each employee.  All new  employees will receive a hard or electronic copy and a verbal statement on client engagement as part of their  induction training.  Staff views and questions relating to environmental matters are actively encouraged and should be raised with  their employee representative, Office Manager or the Directors as appropriate.    Expert advice will be obtained when required from appropriate sources/organisations.

Article 13 recognises that its operations and client projects have an effect on the local, regional and global  environment. As a result, Article 13 is committed to continuous improvements in environmental performance  and the prevention of pollution.  Environmental regulations, laws and codes of practice will be regarded as setting the minimum standards of  environmental performance.  Article 13 seeks to demonstrate active leadership in environmental management, and inspire clients, partners  and its wider networks to do the same.      All employees and temporary workers have a duty to consider the effects on the environment of their work for  Article 13, both in Article 13s internal operations and through projects for clients and partners.    Office Environmental Guidelines may be found in the Staff Handbook.      The Directors are responsible for implementing an action plan to ensure Article 13 achieves its commitments  and goals.    Article 13 aims to ensure that:    material consumption is reduced, through efficient use and careful planning to make actions as  sustainable as possible;      energy consumption is reduced. Energy from a renewable source will be purchased and  investment made in energy efficiency products where possible;    COMMITMENTS  STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES       Effective 1st August 2007; reviewed August 2009, October 2010, Updated November 2011  2    its operations are carbon neutral wherever possible. To this end, we look to use low-carbon  options and where is this not possible, we explore carbon offsetting through donating to a local  environmental or carbon offset project.      waste (particularly of a hazardous nature) is minimised. Waste will be recycled wherever possible  and disposal will take account of local environmental impacts;      preference is given to suppliers, where economically justifiable to do so, whose environmental  management reflects stewardship of the local, regional and global environment;      public and non-motor vehicle transportation is used for business travel and travel to work, where  possible;      staff are consistently trained in relevant environmental issues.    The directors, in consultation with all staff, will set environmental targets based on these goals and designed  to improve Article 13s environmental performance.    Article 13s environmental performance and policy for the environment will be reviewed annually and  amended as necessary.    Article 13 carbon emissions will be monitored monthly.    A copy of this policy and all subsequent revisions will be brought to the notice of each employee. All new  employees will receive a hard or electronic copy and a verbal statement on the environment as part of their  induction training.     Staff views and questions relating to environmental matters are actively encouraged and should be raised with  their employee representative, Office Manager or the Directors as appropriate.

The promotion of health and safety measures is regarded as a mutually beneficial objective for management  and employees at all levels.  The avoidance of hazards arising from the Companys operational activities,  services or products is of paramount importance.  Article 13 will provide appropriate instruction, training, supervision and information to enable all employees to  perform their work safely and efficiently.  Training will be provided to employees to ensure that they are  aware of their duties and responsibilities and that health and safety is a prime consideration in all aspects of  their work and the work of contractors, customers and visitors on Company premises.  Article 13 will emphasise in all health and safety matters the high degree of individual personal responsibility  that must be accepted by each employee.  All employees and temporary workers have a duty to co-operate with management by:    working safely and efficiently, taking all reasonable steps to safeguard their safety and that of any  other person who may be affected by their actions;    using protective equipment provided and meeting statutory obligations;    reporting accidents/incidents that have or could have caused injury or damage;    adhering to Article 13s Health & Safety policy and procedures for securing a safe place of work;    assisting in the investigation of accidents with the objective of introducing measures for preventing  recurrence;    identifying potential hazards and reporting them for corrective action.

In the case of the self  employed and/or temporary workers, operating under a contract for services, the health and safety  responsibilities are shared between the worker and client employer.  Article 13 will pass on all relevant  information on any qualifications and skills the temporary worker needs in order to carry out the work safely.  It is the duty of all management and supervisory staff to maintain a safe and healthy place of work and to  ensure that everything reasonably practicable is done to prevent personal injury or damage to property in the  process of its activities.  Jane Fiona Cumming, Director, is responsible for the overall implementation of the Health & Safety Policy and  shall arrange for funds and appropriate facilities to be available to meet the requirements of this Policy and  Health & Safety Procedures.   Lacey Ward, Office Manager and overall Health & Safety Co-ordinator, has the day-to-day duty of ensuring  compliance of this Policy and Health & Safety Procedures.   Article 13s policy for health & safety will be reviewed annually and amended as necessary.

For Article 13 integrity means that it seeks to:    manage its own activities so that organisations working with Article 13 can be confident that it meets  the ethical supply chain standards set by itself for others;    work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery, in accordance with the tenth  principle of the United Nations Global Compact.  Article 13 will work against corruption, bribery and extortion defined as follows:  1.  Corruption: the misuse of entrusted power for private gain.    2.  Bribery: a form of corruption: the promise, offer, or gift of something of value, especially money, to a  person to gain influence or to procure goods, services or other reward beyond what has been legally  contracted;    3.  Extortion: the threat of injury to a person or their property or reputation in order to obtain something of  value from them or to induce them to undertake, or not undertake, an action;  The cooperation of all employees is essential for the success of this policy.    If any employee considers that unethical decisions are being made, they should:   1.  raise the complaint with a director verbally;  2.  if this is not appropriate or the issues are not resolved, then employees may speak to a non-executive  director directly.       COMMITMENTS  STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES       Effective 1st August 2007; reviewed August 2009, October 2010, Updated November  2011  2  The Directors are responsible for implementing the Integrity Policy and acting in compliance with all applicable  national and international laws and regulations.  Neither Article 13 nor its employees, in the course of their duties for Article 13, shall:    solicit, or accept money, loans or credit from clients or suppliers, except as provided for by client or  supplier contracts;    accept gifts, entertainment, favours or services from present or potential suppliers which may appear to  diminish the objectivity of Article 13s decision-making process.  To ensure that transparency is maintained in reference to our finances, the following process will be followed:  1.  Incoming invoices and expenses claims are checked by the Financial Controller.  They are then passed to  the company directors for approval and are signed by them as confirmation of this approval;  2.  Approved invoices and expenses are passed back to the Financial Controller for entering onto the Sage  accounting system;  3.  At the appropriate time, based on terms of business, invoices and expenses are paid by BACS by the  Financial Controller;  4.  All paperwork is filed by the Financial Controller and kept securely for seven years after the end of the  financial year;  5.  At the end of each financial year, the accounts are audited by the company accountants, Diverset Ltd,  who ensure that all financial dealings within the past year are in accordance with legislation and ethical  practices.    It has become common business practice to purchase food and beverages for business meetings.  Beyond this,  Article 13 will not accept or make contributions in the form of money, gifts or any other means that may be  deemed as a bribe.    Under no circumstances will Article 13 or any of its directors or staff members attempt to extort anything from  anyone, be they a client, supplier (including associates) or a staff member.    Article 13 shall not misuse its power or position in any way, shape or form for private gain.  The Integrity Policy will be reviewed annually to determine the need for alteration and revision.  A copy of this policy and all subsequent revisions will be brought to the notice of each employee.  All new  employees will receive a hard or electronic copy and a verbal statement on integrity as part of their induction  training.  Staff views and questions relating to integrity are actively encouraged and should be raised with their  employee representative, Office Manager or the Directors as appropriate.    Expert advice will be obtained when required from appropriate sources/organisations.

Article 13 believes in the fair  and equal treatment of all employees and that encouraging diversity is critical to our future success.  This  means we are committed to encouraging diversity in the work place and in doing so hope to reflect, where  practical, the make-up of the local community within which we operate.      Diversity and equal opportunities are to be encouraged on the basis of sex, marital or civil partnership status,  pregnancy and maternity, race, nationality, ethnic (or national) origin, religion or beliefs, age, sexual  orientation, political affiliation, gender reassignment, disability, previous (unrelated) criminal offense and  membership (or non-membership) of a trade union and any other legal membership organisations.     Article 13 is committed to promoting an environment where all individuals are recruited, selected for specific  projects, appraised, trained and promoted on the basis of fairness and professional competence.  This will  enable Article 13 to tap into the widest possible sources of talent, ensure the effective use of staff and  promote the best people regardless of their background.    The cooperation of all employees is essential for the success of this policy.  If any employee considers that they  are suffering from unfair treatment, on any of the grounds set out above:   1. we encourage employees initially to deal with unfair treatment informally first – e.g. asking the  person acting unfairly to stop.  The person may not realise that their actions are causing offence;  2. if the person persists, the employee affected may take further action raising the complaint with a  director verbally;  3. if this is not appropriate or the issues are not resolved, then employees may speak to a non-executive  director directly.   If the complainant believes the problem has still not been resolved satisfactorily, they may refer to the  grievance procedure.    COMMITMENTS  STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES       Effective 1st August 2007; reviewed August 2009, October 2010, Updated November 2011  2  The Directors are responsible for implementing the diversity and equal opportunities policy.  Wherever possible, Article 13 will endeavour to resolve complaints quickly and as sympathetically as possible.   Where required, counselling and support will be made available.  Appropriate disciplinary sanctions (up to and including dismissal) will be taken against any employee who is  found to have discriminated against another person or group.  Any investigations will be carried out only with the agreement of the employee that may have been  discriminated against.  At all times, during and after the investigation, we will take reasonable steps to prevent  further discrimination or harassment.  If investigations indicate that discrimination or harassment may have  taken place, the case will be dealt with under the companys disciplinary policy.  Wherever possible, all vacancies will be advertised simultaneously internally and externally.  Steps will be taken to ensure that knowledge of vacancies reaches under-represented groups internally and  externally.  All vacancy advertisements will include an appropriate short statement on equal opportunity.  Job applicants, and staff considered for specific projects, will not be subject to discrimination.  Selection criteria (job description and employee specification) will be kept under constant review to ensure  that they are justifiable on non-discriminatory grounds as being essential for the effective performance of the  job.  Wherever possible, more than one person will be involved in the selection interview and recruitment process,  and all should have received training in equal opportunities.  Reasons for selection and rejection of applicants for vacancies will be recorded.  Under-represented groups will be encouraged to apply for training and employment opportunities with Article  13. Wherever possible, special training will be provided for such groups to prepare them to compete on  genuinely equal terms for jobs and promotion. However, actual recruitment to all jobs will be strictly on merit.  Wherever appropriate, and within the law, suitably qualified people from disadvantaged groups will be given  priority.   Wherever possible, efforts will be made to identify and remove unnecessary barriers and to provide  appropriate facilities and conditions of service to meet the special needs of disadvantaged or under- represented groups.

Where necessary, employees will be able to check and correct the record of their own details. Otherwise,  access to this information will be strictly restricted.  Article 13s policy for diversity and equal opportunity will be reviewed annually and amended as necessary.  Personnel records relevant to diversity and equal opportunities will also be analysed regularly, and appropriate  follow-up action taken, including any revision of this policy.  A copy of this policy and all subsequent revisions will be brought to the notice of each employee.  All new  employees will receive a hard or electronic copy and a verbal statement on diversity and equal opportunities  as part of their induction training.  Staff views and questions relating to diversity and equal opportunities are actively encouraged and should be  raised with their employee representative, Office Manager or the Directors as appropriate  Expert advice will be obtained when required from appropriate sources/organisations.

As a responsible and connected corporate citizen, Article 13 is committed to continuous improvements in  ethical purchasing and supply. Article 13 seeks to demonstrate active leadership in supply chain activities, and  inspire its partners to do the same, such that human rights, labour standards and environmental laws and  codes of practice will be regarded as setting the minimum standards for the Companys whole supply chain  performance.  All employees and temporary workers have a duty to consider the effects of any purchasing decisions on the  supply chain in relation both to Article 13s internal operations and through purchasing decisions within  projects for clients and partners.  The management of Article 13 strives to source products and services, and supply the Companys services from  organisations in which:    employment is freely chosen;    freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining are respected;    working conditions are safe and hygienic;    child labour is not tolerated;    reasonable living wages are paid;    working hours are not excessive;    no discrimination is practiced, based on equality in hiring, compensation, access to training,  promotion, termination or retirement, on the basis of sex, marital or civil partnership status,  COMMITMENTS  STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES       Effective 1st August 2007; reviewed August 2009, October 2010, Updated November 2011  2  pregnancy and maternity, race, nationality, ethnic (or national) origin, religion or beliefs, age, sexual  orientation, political affiliation, gender reassignment, disability and membership (or non- membership) of a trade union or any other legal membership organisations;    regular employment is provided;    no harsh or inhumane treatment is allowed, including threat of physical abuse, sexual or other  harassment and verbal abuse or other forms of intimidation;    environmental stewardship is practiced.  In practice, Article 13 will as far as possible:    purchase Fair Trade items in preference to other goods;    avoid purchases of goods or services widely known to involve poor practices;    purchase goods made from sustainable sources using local suppliers with ethical and transparent  practices.    Article 13 will also, where appropriate, raise the issue of supply chain policy during client engagements.  Article 13s policy for the supply chain will be reviewed annually and amended as necessary.  A copy of this policy and all subsequent revisions will be brought to the notice of each employee.  All new  employees will receive a hard or electronic copy and a verbal statement on supply chain issues as part of their  induction training.

Encouraging  employees to think outside the box develops the ability to evolve constantly, through innovation and  improvements to the organisation, employees and stakeholders.  Article 13 aims for involvement in decision-making from the start.  This builds a level of responsibility and buy- in from the team.  If people are involved in identifying training and development issues and then building an  action plan to address them, they are more likely to benefit and learn from each other.   The combined effect  is empowerment with accountability and responsibility with support; encouraged, in part, by an in-house peer  review and coaching programme.  Investing in Article 13 employees is an investment for the future to ensure that staff are working to the best of  their ability.   All employees and temporary workers have a duty to co-operate with management by sharing knowledge.   Knowledge sharing is a key to success.   Therefore, an in-house Guard file has been developed.  This is a  bespoke system of filing and archiving information in such a way as to provide access and cross referral to  other literature, case studies, prior Article 13 experience/work or individuals.    The Directors are responsible for the implementation of the Training & Development Policy.  Candidates for jobs will be assessed against a detailed specification of skills and core competencies, as well as  on their commitment to Article 13s aims.    All staff will be appraised twice annually to determine their training and development needs.  The approach  taken is individually tailored to build the capacity of employees and the diversity and innovation of the  organisation.  COMMITMENTS  STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES     Effective 1st August 2007; reviewed August 2009, October 2010, Updated November 2011  2  To build staff competencies and to ensure current core competencies are shared within Article 13, external  training sessions will be held to integrate existing and new core competencies into the organisation at all  levels.    Article 13s policy for Training & Development will be reviewed annually and amended as necessary.  Through six monthly performance evaluations with each employee, current and future growth opportunities  will be identified.  A training needs analysis should be conducted at these review meetings to ensure Article 13  can provide its staff with the best possible learning and innovative methods of improvement that can be  provided via internal or external training.  The Guard file will be reviewed quarterly to ensure that Article 13 is using it, it is proving useful to the group  and that emerging stakeholder needs are being incorporated.  A copy of this policy and all subsequent revisions will be brought to the notice of each employee.  All new  employees will receive a hard or electronic copy and a verbal statement on Training & Development as part of  their induction training.  Staff views and questions relating to training and development matters are actively encouraged and should be  raised with their employee representative, Office Manager or the Directors as appropriate.    Expert advice will be obtained when required from appropriate sources/organisations.
