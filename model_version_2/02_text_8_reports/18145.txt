Likewise, we faced an unfriendly business environment: ex- ternally, the Middle East, one of our key markets, witnessed  worsening uncertainties, while investment returns remained  flat at home. However, our strengthened fundamentals and  the win-win approach of stakeholders helped us overcome  the risks effectively.  In particular, with the belief that taking up our social respon- sibility and pursuing eco-friendly management serve as a  stepping stone for the companys continued growth, we have  embraced LSpartnership, which calls for the cooperation and  win-win relationship with stakeholders, as the new way for- ward in our corporate management. Rooted in LSpartner- ship, our suitability management will serve as a pivot that  keeps our employees and partners remain unwavering in the  fast-changing environment, and become our capacity with  which we can turn this crisis into a new opportunity.

On top of this, the political turbulence in the Middle Eastern and African markets made business forecasting extremely unstable.  Despite this hostile business environment, we achieved a notable sales growth compared to the previous year through  our efforts to secure new customers in the Middle East, South America, and Central Asia. However, in terms of profit,  the incurrence of unexpected non-recurring losses ultimately led to the disheartening result of a deficit in earnings before tax,  in spite of our internal efforts.  Dear Stakeholders, Accepting the current difficulties as growing pains that must be faced if were to leap higher, we will strive to translate all our  continued efforts for the future into tangible outcomes. At the same time, we will reinforce our internal standards and processes  to ensure that all employees engage in transparent and fair transactions.  The year 2012 marks the 50th anniversary of LS Cable & System.  Even this year, when we prepare to take our first step towards the next 50 years, the business environment before us still remains  hostile, with high exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, as well as the delayed recovery of advanced economies  and the unrest in the Middle East. However, based on the preserved strength we have built over the last 50 years, we will over- come the current crisis with wisdom and become a sustainable company that contributes to the value and sustainability of  humankind  In 2012, the year of the Black Dragon in the Asian zodiac, we promise to become your best partner in realizing all your dreams.  Thank you for supporting LS Cable & System.  CEO & Chairman  Christopher Koo Chairman Message Based on our preserved strength  built over half a century, we hope to  become a sustainable company that  contributes to the value and sustainability  of humankind    7 I. MAnAgeMenT Q What does LSpartnership mean? LSpartnership is a new management philosophy that LS Group declared at the  beginning of 2011. It entails internally achieving excellent results with talented  employees who are armed with a sense of ownership, based on respect, care,  and trust, while externally cooperating with openness and achieving growth with  stakeholders. Although rooted in our former management policy, Walking with  Customers, the new philosophy widens the scope of stakeholders to include em- ployees and partners as well as customers, and seeks sustainability management  that ensures mutual growth. LSpartnership is not a mere fancy slogan or motto; rather, it will become the  principle that drives our business, corporate culture, and employees, and serve as  a standard against which all behaviors and value judgments are measured.  Q   In terms of sustainability management, what are  some of LS Cable & Systems key achievements in 2011?  For us, global management is an opportunity for growth and demands the as- sumption of new responsibilities and roles as well. By taking into account the  impact on and the expectations of our stakeholders, we pursue management  that brings value to our shareholders, investors, customers, local community,  suppliers, and employees while existing in harmony with the environment. To  this end we laid the groundwork for implementing sustainability management  in 2010, and published the LS Cable & System 2010 Sustainability Report, our  first sustainability report, in 2011. Some of our achievements include creating a  green society, promoting shared growth, and building an infrastructure for social  contribution through an eco-friendly product line-up including electric vehicle  (EV) solutions, Shared Growth Council activities and the public hospital renova- tion project in China. We will continue to contribute to ensuring a more prosper- ous future for our global partners and future generation through green man- agement; customer-satisfaction based on quality management, fair-trade and  cooperation with our suppliers. Furthermore; we will promote and disseminate  our sustainability management practices to our business sites around the globe.  Q What were some of LS Cable & Systems business  achievements in 2011? We have been focusing our efforts on glolocalizaion. In particular, we began  implementing our plans to establish power cable manufacturing plants in the  USA and India and have a plan to localize our energy business, and will fully  launch our business after the plants are completed in 2012. We also won a num- ber of strategically meaningful contracts. Namely, we became the first Korean  cable manufacturer to win a turn-key contract from National Grid, an American  company, for a 35 kV submarine cable project, as well as a 380 kV extra high volt- age cable contract from Tennet, the Dutch Transmission System Operator. These  CeO Message CEO Jongho Son We will become a trustworthy partner,  creating greater values with  our stakeholders achievements paved the way for us to enter the European market, where few  top global players have held a prominent position. We have also been making  inroads into new global markets by winning large-scale contracts, including those  for extra-high voltage cable, busduct and optical fiber integrated power cable in  Asia, Oceania, South America, and the Middle East.  We have also been striving to find new customers and create new markets by  acquiring GL certification, which is the most prestigious of its kind in the field of  wind power generation and by attending international fairs, such as Hannover  Messe, and publishing newsletters to inform customers of our products, applica- tions, and solutions.  With regard to new technologies and new products, we have signed a perfor- mance agreement with the Ministry of Knowledge Economy for national proj- ects related to smart grids and the development of super conducting power  devices and application technologies. Furthermore, for the first time in Korea we  launched Chaver, a wireless charger for Smartphones such as iPhones and Gal- axy phones, and have completed building a high-speed electric vehicle charging  infrastructure for local governments. Q  Lastly, wed like to ask you about the corporate  policies for 2012.   Marking the 50th anniversary of our company, I plan to lead LS Cable & System  with the following three business policies. for next 50 year growth. First, we will step up our efforts to innovate our profit structure. We plan to  achieve our business goals by improving the profitability of existing businesses  and deriving desired outcomes from projects that are aimed at securing new  growth engines, while also reducing deficit deals and making our subsidiaries  fully-fledged.  Second, we will aggressively pursue marketing innovation to increase sales pro- ductivity. We will make sure that our product development and sales go hand in  hand, and also enhance our marketing capabilities by strengthening the com- petitiveness of our global business through the creation of synergy between our  head office and subsidiaries.  Lastly, we will innovate our corporate culture to achieve our vision of becoming  the Global No. 1 cable manufacturer by 2015. By bringing innovation to our work  process through an open corporate culture and Work & Life Balance, we will  boost our confidence in achieving our goals.  8 Link the worLd think the future LS Cable & System 2011 Sustainability Report Inside a human body are blood vessels approximately 100,000 km (60,000 miles) long as well as  countless nerves that connect organs and tissues and supply the oxygen and nutrients they need  to function.

MAnAgeMenT A new Business environment Surrounding  the Cable Industry  These has been a view that the cable industry was a stable but  matured industry with low potential for growth after the 1980s.  However, rapid urbanization, the worldwide electricity shortages  and the development of ultra high-speed information/communica- tions have provided the industry with new opportunities for growth.  On the contrary, we need to devise a strategy for risks including  the global economic downturn, a rise in commodity prices, climate  change and environmental regulations. While taking full advantage  of opportunity through high-quality eco-friendly products, global  management, and our partnership with stakeholders, we will control  risks by taking relevant countermeasures.  LS Cable & System Prepares to  Take the next Step Forward   In 2011, we improved internal capacities in order to secure new  growth engines. To move away from the safer practice of selling a  single type of product, and to respond aggressively to the changes  taking place around the cable industry, weve put into action various  improvement measures such as innovating our business model and  boosting investment in R&D. Furthermore, we focused on strength- ening the capacities of our overseas plants that we had expand- ed in order to minimize business fluctuations caused by the local  economys volatility and to respond promptly to the demands of  our global customers. Rather than focusing on short-term achieve- ments that lack streamlined objectives or strategies, we will store  our capacities for the future by building a strong foundation. Mega Trend Climate change The report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that the average global temperature has  risen by 0.74C and sea level has increased by about 10~25 cm in the last 100 years. As climate change has already had an observable effect on envi- ronment, bringing with it desertification and increased droughts and flooding, it has become one of the biggest threats to human security.  Convergence of technology  Technological convergence refers to combining technologies once used separately by different industries to  develop new technologies, products, and services. Especially in business, new opportunities are created by boosting application capacity for IT (In- formation Technology), BT (Bio Technology), NT (Nano Technology), and ET (Environment technology), the four major technological revolutions. Urbanization  With an astonishing increase in population and economic power in Asia and South America, urbanization is taking place at a rapid  pace. Under the UNs definition, a city is referred to as a region with a population of more than 100,000. The urban population is expected to jump  by 84%, from approximately 3.4 billion in 2009 to 6.4 billion by 2050., by 84%  Risks Opportunity Global economic recession Secure price & quality competitiveness  Expande into markets with opportunities Rising commodity prices  Increasing demand for products with high efficiency  due to an increase in transmission & distribution cost  Fiercer global competition Climate change  Increasing demand for more durable products stable in climate  change  Growing demand for reducing CO2 emission  Increased demand for renewable energy  Rising demand for highly efficient products due to an increase  in transmission distance*  Rising demand for products related to eco-friendly power  generation  New environment Our response * When solar heat, wind power, or other renewable energies are generated in regions with adequate amounts of sunshine or wind. Thus, the distance between the generation site and locations where power is  consumed increases compared to that for thermal power or hydroelectric power generation.  Develop high efficiency products of higher voltage & larger  capacity   Reduce cost through innovation activities Secure price & quality competitiveness    Respond to policies protecting local products through  localization Develop high strength products      Implement energy conservation & GHG reduction activities  Declared and put LSpartnership into practice  Strengthened communication with stakeholders  Implemented projects for social contribution  Develop eco-friendly products  Build an eco-friendly supply network through partnerships  Develop high efficiency products of higher voltage & larger  capacity   Provide solutions for solar and wind power  Develop and commercialize submarine cables  Reinforcement of environmental regulations Rising demand for eco-friendly products  Stronger demands of stakeholders  Electricity shortage Need for highly efficient electrical grids   Need for electricity demand management   Rising demand for replacements as existing electric  grids significantly deteriorated in advanced nations  Increasing investment in infrastructure in developing nations  Advance global management by building overseas bases  Developed new technologies and products  Reinforce cooperation  with the local community  Advance global management by building overseas bases  Develop new technologies and products that reflect local  characteristics  Reinforce cooperation  with the local community  Develop high efficiency products of higher voltage & larger  capacity   Implement projects related to building smart grids  Development of next generation, ultra high-speed information  & communication networks Need for building an information & communications network  Rising demand for optical fiber cables  Diversify optical fiber cables  Provide wired & wireless communications solutions    10 Link the worLd think the future LS Cable & System 2011 Sustainability Report Where we operate Korea egypt  Cairo India  LSCI Haryana LSCD New Delhi Bangalor Mumbai Chennai Kolkata Hyderabad Malaysia  LSCM Penang Indonesia Jakarta Portugal  Viana de Castelo Donghae Plant Headquarter Anyang Plant Gumi Plant Indong Plant R&D Center Australia  Sydney China  LSCT Tianjin LSHQ Yichang  LSCW Wuxi LSIC China HQ Beijing - Xian, Shanghai, Guangzhou China R&D Center Wuhan  SPSX Tainjin SPSX Suzhou IVA Changzhou France   SPSX Europe HQ Compiegne IVA Mayzieu UK LSCU London ESSEX UK Huyton Quarry Hi-wire Yorkshur Italy  Quattordio nigeria   Abuja U.A.e Abu Dhabi Singapore  Singapore Vietnam   LS-VINA Haiphon LSCV Hochimin Japan  LSCJ Tokyo Saudi Arabia Riyadh Russia  Moscow germany  Bramsche Arolsen South Africa Johannesburg Philippines  Manila   11 I.

Aiming to commercialize the superconducting cable system, which  serves as the basis for smart grid projects, we joined hands with Ko- rea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) to install a superconducting  cable system for power distribution at the Icheon substation, Gyeo- nggi Province, becoming the second in the world to test-operate the  electric power system. We are also kickstarting our superconducting  cable business by supplying our products to the U.S. Tres Amigas  Superstation Project, the worlds first superconducting power grid  commercialization project, with American Superconductor Corpora- tion (AMSC).  Super-conduction  Cable System Superconducting cable 4 This system collects real-time data on the transmission lines,  the temperature of the installation environment, thermal ca- pacity, and transmission load. It converts the collected data  into transmittable power and provides quantitative informa- tion on short- and long-term load allocation to the the power  transmission line operator.   IT Solutions for electric Power R-TASTM : Real Time Ampacity Estimation  System 3 Developed by LS Cable & System for the  first time in Korea and the fourth time the  fourth in the world, the 250 kV DC MI Mass  Impregnated extra-high voltage submarine  cable is a specialty cable that transmits  large quantities of electric power between  islands and between the mainland and islands while also serv- ing as a telecommunications cable, bringing together the best  cable technologies. Its installment in the 105 kilometer-long sea- bed section between Jindo and Jeju Islands is scheduled to be  completed in 2012. Moreover, we have been awarded a contract  for a 35 kV submarine cable project from National Grid, a power  grid operator in the eastern part of the U.S, which is a turn-key  contract covering everything from cable delivery to installation  and the completion test. We completed the project at the end of  2011, and entered commercial operation in 2012. We offer turn- key solutions for the entire power transmission system, including  the survey & selection of route for installment, manufacturing &  transport of long length cables, installments, installment of pro- tective equipment for cables, and testing. Submarine Cable  System Submarine cable 2 2 Overhead lines, which are usually installed and operated on  transmission line towers, can be categorized into overhead  transmission lines and overhead ground wires. Transmission  lines transmit electricity from power plants to primary substa- tions located near customers. Overhead ground wires protect  transmission lines from lightning strikes and help the fault cur- rent flow in the event of a breakdown. OPgW combines the op- tical fiber with the overhead ground wire, adding the ablity to  play as a telecommunication cable.  Over Head Transmission  Line, OPgW Optical fiber overhead Ground  Wire Over Head Transmission line 5 With a range from 0.6/1kV to 22.9kV, this  power distribution cable is used to sta- bly supply power to distribution circuits  in residential, commercial, or industrial  buildings.

The copper rods  are mainly used for manufacturing cableconductors and for  other special uses (e.g. train wires, rectangular wires, etc). In  addition, we are enhancing our presence as a global player by  developing cutting-edge new materials, such as oxygen-free  copper and copper-replacing alloys, and by localizing business.  Copper Rod 1    We suceeded in developing a wide variety  of industrial materials, including the forging  material for vehicles, housing materials for ABS Anti-lock Break System  and ESP Electronic Stability Program, tubes for condensers, and polyamide- coated tubes, for which domestic businesses had relied solely  on imports. The high-strength XTAL Extra Thermal Aluminum Alloy conduc- tor for overhead transmission lines, the first of its kind in the  world, uses a new alluminum alloy, ensuring stable conductivity  at high temperatures with no change in strength or form. Cus- tomers have lauded it as a highly innovative product.    Aluminum Materials 3 PFC Magnet wire is made by coating the surface of a copper or  aluminum conductor (round or flat) with a special varnish that  has insulating properities. It is coiled inside driving motors of  electrical or electronic devices, and converts electric energy  to electromagnetic and mechanical energy, and to convert  mechanical energy to electric energy. It is an essential com- ponent of all machines that consume electricity, including  transformers, dynamos, vehicles, TVs, refrigerators, washing  machines, air conditioners, microwave ovens, and motors. In  particular, the fine rectangular wire for automobiles, whose  thickness is 1/10 that of conventional rectangular wires, is  suitable for small & high power motors and increases motor  output by more than 50% compared to conventional round  magnet wires, reducing the weight of the automobile and thus  enhancing fuel efficiency.

The new company vision reflects our determination to achieve  sustained growth by becoming the worlds best in all areas, including financial performance, so- cial responsibility, and environmental management, through our consistent pursuit of innovation  based on our management philosophy of partnership.  Towards global no.1 In 2009, we arrived at the conclusion that stunted growth origi- nated from the business fragmentation between subsidiaries, sales  centered around single products, and insufficiently integrated man- agement infrastructure. As a response, we set forth four strategic ini- tiatives that needed to achieve our vision, by gathering the opinions  of our employees and holding strategy meetings at each business  division. The initiatives consisted of 1) Expansion of global presence,  2) Business model innovation, 3) Improvement of global manage- ment competency and 4) Improvement of financial structure.  In 2011, they were revised to 1) Strengthening overseas business  competitiveness, 2) Improving profitability, 3) Strengthening global  management competency, and 4) Improving financial structure, to  reflect the changed management environment such as increased  uncertainties in the global economy and exacerbated unrest in the  Middle East, which is our strategic region. Nevertheless, this revision  was still rooted in the four strategic initiatives first set forth in 2010.    To foster the overseas plants as the foothold of value cre- ation_Strengthening overseas business competitiveness  The demand for cables is closely related to the infrastructure in- vestment of a nation or region. Thus, the impact of local economic  condition on business is quite large. We have been diversifying our  global market to minimize the fluctuation in business performance  of each region, and have successfully secured our global foothold  in China, Southeast Asia, India, and North America. As part of the  first phase of our plan to strengthen our overseas business com- petitiveness, we have been focusing on stabilizing our business  abroad through measures such as building mutual understanding  and trust, building a consensus on future strategies, and rational- izing our business structure that is centered around areas of core  competencies. During the 2nd phase, we will focus on enhancing  our corporate value based on measures aimed at enhancing our  business structure, improving our profit, and strengthening our or- ganizational competencies, with the goal of boosting our competi- tive edge.  To realize performance by secured assets_Improving  profitability A company is like a tree that is nurtured with the  interests and care of its stakeholders, and its most important role is  to yield a high amount of fruit. We plan to deliver investment prof- its to our stakeholders by realizing performance in areas we have  been fostering our future growth engine, while also accelerating our  growth to the next level. We are expanding our profit base through  our next generation technology products, including superconduct- ing cables, submarine cables, and smart grids, customer-oriented  applications and solutions that provide all cable-related products  and services needed for an entire project, and the synergy created  from the global network.  To strengthen management fundamentals_Strengthen- ing global management competency  Factors that influ- ence corporate management have become more diverse, and the  management environment is also changing at a more rapid pace.  We plan to strengthen our fundamentals to overcome the high level  of volatility in our surroundings. While securing technological com- petitiveness through R&D, we are promoting and disseminating our  corporate culture of creating greater value through cooperation,  Ability to grasp the needs of the market and customers and create   related strategies Market Intelligence 01 Ability to meet market needs with products and services that opimize  process efficiency Technology 02 Ability to develop and implement the most efficient solutions Creative Executor 03 Sustainability  Management  LSpartnership Global No. 1 Company in 2015 Vision Corporate  Philosophy Strategic  initiatives To  Strengthen  overseas  business  competitive- ness To Improve  financial  structure To  Strengthen  global  management  competency To Improve  profitability Corpoate Vision Core Competencies   19 I.

Furthermore, by helping sustainabil- ity management, which involves responding to the needs of mul- tiple stakeholders in the global market and assuming responsibilities  given to us, we take root, and will take one step further from being a  great company to being a beloved company.  To enhance stakeholders value by creating economic  value_Improving financial structure  A company has to  create economic and social values for sustainability. It is true that  our debt ratio has increased slightly due to our aggrressive invest- ments aimed at securing a long-term growth engine. Nevertheless,  we hope to improve our financial structure, stabilize our business  base and provide greater value to our stakeholders by reaping out- put from investment, securitizing our assets, and improving profit- ability.    LSpartnership, Creating greater Value Together  We are  interacting with stakeholders in a horizontal network. Based  on our corporte philosphy of LSpartnership, which was declared in  January 2011, we will share a business goals with our stakeholders-  customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, investors, and the  local community and cooperate to achieve them through mutual  respect, care, and trust.  Rooted in Integrity, which involves complying with principles and  fundamentals based on morality and working in a transparent and  rational manner, LSpartnership consists of Respect, which involves  understanding ones partners opinions and values and coopera- tion with sincerity; Care, which involves providing opportunities to  ones partners to unleash their capabilities and helps them grow;  and Trust, which provides a trustworthy partner based on ultimate  responsibility and expertise.  In other words, LSpartnership is about achieving great performance  through mutual respect, care, and trust, and trust by LS people, who  are armed with integrity and a sense of ownership, and pursuing  LSpartnership LS is  your trustworthy partner   Members of LS  perform better when together    greater value together through open cooperation.

We pursue sustainability management as one of our strategic  initiatives, based on the corporate philosphy of "LSpartnership".  Launching the Sustainability Management Council in 2010 as a  company-wide council, we established a sustainability manage- ment implementation roadmap reflecting an analysis of the exter- nal environment and our competencies and results of the employ- ees interviews. Furthermore, we devised 13 strategic initiatives and  61 implementation tasks that are linked to our vision of Global No.  1 Cable Manufacturer by 2015.  Sustainability Management Implementation Roadmap With the goal of buildling a global sustainability management sys- tem that combines sustainability and the management process, we  have established a 3-stage roadmap that covers the period from  2010 to 2015, with three phases that last for two years each. With  objectives given for each phase, the roadmap specifies the policies  and tasks to be implemented by 6 sustainability working commit- tees – namely, Green Management, Social Contribution, Ethics  Management, Risk Control, Employees, and Suppliers.  We have successfully implemented Phase I, building the frame- work. Based on the established framework, we will enhance the  implementation process and step up our efforts to shoulder the re- sponsibility as a global company by promoting sustainability man- agement throughout our subsidiaries at home and abroad. For a  more effective implementation of sustainability management, we  have a plan to establish a Plan-Do-See Cycling system and develop  a set of performance indicators for progress review.

As a top deci- sion-making body, our Board approves of major agendas on issues  such as corporate policies, strategies, and business activities. Board  members are appointed through a general sharesholders meeting,  and based on their experience and expertise in management, they  strive to accomplish corporate vision and maximize stakeholders  value. As of May 2012, our Board consists of four members; and  since cable industry requires large investments and nimble response  to various risk factors that exist at our overseas business sites, our  CEO currently serves as the chairman of the board. Moreover, to  implement strategies more effectively, the Board receives regular  and irregular briefings on the performance carried out worldwide.  Special meetings are convened for immediate decision making. In 2011, 15 board meetings were held in total, from which 27 agen- das were passed, including those on debt warranties of overseas  subsidiaries, evaluation results of internal accounting management  system, current status of compliance, and implementation results  of the fair trade self-compliance program. (please refer to Business  Report for details) Remunerations payable to directors are capped  as approved by the general shareholders meeting, and consist of  salaries and (special) bonuses that are prescribed by positions. We  assess directors performance using indicators linked to our business  goals and evaluation purposes, thus reflecting results in their remu- nerations.  Management Transparency & efficiency through  the Holding Company System  In 2008, the former LS Cable Co., Ltd. split into LS, a holding com- pany, LS Mtron for the machinery and electronic business, and LS  Cable & System for the cable business. As a result, LS Cable & Sys- tem became an affiliate of the LS Group. A holding company sys- tem helps establish a simple governance system consisting of the  holding company and its affiliates, and also enhance management  transparency because the performance of the entire group could be  identified clearly. Furthermore, management efficiency is improved  since we can focus on business while the holding company acts as  a coordinator, providing guidance on investments and visions. This  system also helps clarify who are responsible for the outcomes.  Auditing System for Securing Management Trans- parency & Fairness   For transparency and fairness, we carry out internal and external au- dits by a third party institution. In compliance with the Act on Ex- ternal Audit of Stock Companies, our external audits involve a third  party accounting firm verifying appropriateness of our accounting.  Through our internal audits we review and supervise our internal  control system and managerial practices. External auditors are ap- pointed by the general shareholders meeting under the Commer- cial Act and company policies. Auditors supervise the transparency  and fairness of the companys accounting and work process, and  they reserve the right to require Board of Directors to report on op- eration and look into the companys financial position.  We have implemented responsible management by establishing a management system centered  around the board of directors, and have improved transparency through a holding company. We  are also enhancing our management performance by creating synergy between the owner CeOs  and professional CeOs. We comply with Koreas commercial law and OeCDs principles regard- ing corporate governance. We have put in place an institutional framework for sound corporate  management by defining a decision-making process at the corporate level and the roles of the  administrative body through the Articles of Association, while also strengthening our performance  management system. governance     listed         unlisted   Holding Company System LS  LS Cable &  System  LS-Nikko  Copper  LSIS    LS Mtron    22 Link the worLd think the future LS Cable & System 2011 Sustainability Report We interact with a wide variety of stakeholders.

MAnAgeMenT 2011Material Issues  We have identified 58 material issues and 19 issues considered  most important regarding Sustainability Management and 7 topics.  Those topics are combining 6 areas of sustainability manage- ment strategiescustomer, green management, social contribution, risk control & ethical man- agement, employees, and suppliers with financial performance and creativity/in- novation as our future growth engines. Regarding the most material  issues in the 8 areas, policy directions, our activities in 2011 and  future plans are reported in detail in this report.  Six new Material Issues When compared to 2010, among the 19 the most material issues,  there are 6 newly-added material issues: management vision &  strategy, new growth engine exploration, management stability,  competency development of employees, local community develop- ment, and green product. Our analysis showed it reflected external  environment of global economic slowdown, increasing interests in  internal development following external expansion and growing  consumer demand for green products.  2011 Material Issues We seek to implement sustainability management in more effective ways by identifying and man- aging issues having importance to our corporate strategy as well as stakeholders.

We experience diverse changes and trends surrounding the  cable industry vividly through our relations with customers,  competitors, and related other industries. In the face of such  changes, ceaseless efforts to respond to such changes and  prepare for the future are needed to develop and deliver  technologies that our customers really want.  – CeO Jong-Ho Son   Q  LS Cable & System is capable of generating  revenue over the long-term Employees 71.33% Q  Our company, LS Cable & System is proactive in  improving its business process  Employees 61.52% Survey Results 84.21% Customers 84.85% Customers 74.24%  Q  LS Cable & System is making efforts to   secure future growth engines  Employees 75.89% Suppliers Chief executives Comment 01 Financial Performance & Creativity / Innovation Topic  Topic 2.

However, we marked a deficit due to a low  profitability by global economic turbulence and non-recurring loss. In 2012, we aim to prevent such  recurring loss and achieve business objectives by leveraging our accumulated competency.  Created Value The price of copper, which accounts for the highest portion of cable  manufacturing, has continuously increased to reach USD 10,000  per ton in 2011. It dropped a bit in the second half, recording the  annual average price of USD 8,821, which is about 17% up from  the 2010 figure of USD 7,535 per ton. In 2011, our nominal sales  increased about USD 388.1 million due to the increase in copper  price.  Also, we posted USD 4,160 million in sales with increase in USD 806  million, on the back of new market expansion in Middle East and  Asia areas for transmission and distribution businesses as well as  newly- launched business projects such as submarine.  However, heated competition in Middle Eastern and Asian markets  caused profitability to be deteriorated. Its partly attributable to Ko- rean won-US dollar currency exchange rates, which fell to KRW 1,108  in 2011 from the 2010 average of KRW 1,156 per dollar, having the  impact of reducing profit by about KRW 16 billion. Furthermore, due  to extraordinary losses, and fines from the Fair Trade Committee,  operating profit of 2011 reduced USD 143 million from the previous  year, recording USD 13 million deficits.  Distributed Value We create values in cooperation with our major stakeholders. The  values created benefit not only us but also all our stakeholders. We  have realized profitable return to our investors through interest ex- penses, while providing employees with diverse support for self-de- velopment and financial security through employment. In addition,  we have contributed to growth of our suppliers through fair trade  and supports, and enabled our customers to be more competitive  with high quality products we deliver. We, as a corporate citizen, pay  taxes to the central and local governments of where we operate,  and contribute to the advancement of the local community through  philanthropic activities. growth In 2011, our sales jumped by 24.0% from the previous year. This  was the result of different factors: 17% increase year-on-year in  the price of copper which is the key material of cable products, new  market expansion in Middle East and Asia, and the launch of new  projects (submarine cable and solution business). Asset increased  USD 300 million or 10.3% compared from the previous year. It was  a solid growth of growing current assets since inventories decreased  10% while trade receivables and short-term financial instruments  increasing USD 257 million.  *As we adopted K-IFRS (Korean International Financial Reporting Standards) from the fiscal year that started after January 1, 2011, financial performances of 2010 is presented at a converted value.  * Major adjustments (following changes to K-IFRS) in financial position, income (expense), and major cash flow are presented in our Audit Report.

Risk Control II. 2011 PeRFORMAnCe  31 Profitability Despite high growth in 2011, we recorded operating profit deficit  of USD 13 million for the first time since our foundation. With the  economic downturn in Europe and the US, major European cable  companies expanded their entry into Middle Eastern and Asian  markets, which in turn led to fierce competition, decrease in market  price, and deteriorating profitability. Also, losses incurred from the  newly launched project, fines from the Fair Trade Committee, and  losses on non-ferrous products and currency translation adversely  affected profitability as well.  We will minimize non recurring losses through strengthening pre- review and management on new projects and investments. Also for  the existing projects, we make efforts for sustained profitability by  eliminating internal waste factors and vitalizing innovation initia- tives in the field. Stability Our current ratio improved 17% compared to the previous year to  record 107.9% as of the end of 2011. However, the debt to equity  ratio jumped to 377% from 299% in 2010, due to increased borrow- ings that are largely attributable to a bond issuance worth USD 207.6  million with a call provision in November 2011, which was a measure  to pay back some private loans prior to maturity in early 2012. We  plan to reduce the debt to equity ratio back to 2010 levels through  liquidating idle land and generating operating income in 2012.  Activeness Total asset turnover ratio continues to improve each year. Going for- ward, we will improve it even more by eliminating inefficiencies in  processes and assets. Future Plan to Improve Financial Performance We marked a deficit in 2011 incurred due to deteriorated profit- ability by the global economic slowdown and extraordinary losses.  we aim to minimize such extraordinary losses and achieve business  objectives by leveraging our accumulated competency for better  performance. In the energy business, we will improve profitability  by receiving more orders for high voltage cable from overseas and  carrying out quality & product management initiatives. And we will  nurture promising business projects such as submarine cable, indus- trial specialty cable, and superconducting cable among others in an  effort to secure stable profits into the future. For better financial per- formance in the telecommunications business, we plan to restruc- ture our business model with greater focus on high value-added  products, and expand the solution business. In addition, to meet our  growth goals over the long term, we will continue nurturing future- oriented projects including the infrastructure for EV Electric Vehicles.

Suppliers 32 Link the worLd think the future LS Cable & System 2011 Sustainability Report Innovation of Way of Doing Business for Customers  We Satisfy Customer needs from near  Since cables are key products used in building up national infrastruc- tures, a cable manufacturing company has to have deep knowledge  on the situations of a country and specifications of the product cus- tomers need. Improving cooperation among sales bases, produc- tion bases and the head office in 26 countries, we aim to satisfy  customers demands across the world accurately and promptly and  provide products and services what customers need more effective- ly, as well. For this goal, we make honest efforts to improve produc- tion competency of overseas subsidiary and diversify our portfolio  of products and services. Strengthening Competency of Sales Bases We perform  business with 64 sales bases in 26 countries around the world.  Thanks to continuous expansion of sales bases since 2009, our busi- ness has grown significantly not only in quantity, but also in quality  based on cooperation between subsidiaries and prompt informa- tion sharing on market and customer needs. expansion of sales bases | We have continuously expanded our  sales operation, from the existing Asian and Middle Eastern mar- kets to North America and Europe regions, and more recently, to  South America, Australia, Russia, and Africa. We set up new offices  to better listen to ideas/opinions of local customers and provide our  services from a nearby base. Strong cooperation between overseas subsidiaries |  We also  intend to make our customer service more effective by closely  cooperating with overseas subsidiaries in the areas of training, in- formation, procurement, and customer service. Linking both core  competencies that we and Superior Essex (SPSX) hold, we try to do  telecommunications, industrial materials, and power businesses  successful. Also cooperation among sales offices is instrumental in  strengthening our customer service.  Strengthening Competency of Production Bases In order  to expand our global production bases and reinforce their produc- tion competency, we have made following efforts: Sharing resources and mutual support | We support overseas  subsidiaries, which are located in different regions and have dif- ferent production capacity, to make sure that quality products are  manufactured at all production bases. Currently, our subsidiaries  share training, work process, technologies and resources, and sup- port each other.  equipment technology Support | We have organized the Facil- ity Service (FS) team to better support our subsidiaries with their  equipment maintenance & productivity system establishment. The  FS team not only provides equipment technologies directly, but also  contributes to developing production technologies and quality con- trol through competency building training. R&D center established in China | We opened our R&D center  in Wuhan, China, in November 2011. We expect benefits from this  center in diverse fronts including development of products custom- ized to the location, strong business competitiveness through core  technologies development, and improvement of technological com- petency. In addition, the center is expanding cooperation for joint  research and technology development with High Voltage Research  Institute, which is a research division under the State Grid Corpora- tion of China, largest power company of the nation. Portfolio expansion | In an attempt to diversify the portfolio of  overseas production subsidiaries, we made investments in produc- tion facility of power cables in our subsidiaries in the US, China and  India. The investments enabled us to identify necessary products  at different growth stages of the local market and to provide distri- bution/high voltage cables to local customers in a timely manner.  Furthermore, we are going to provide what local customers want  with profound understanding of regional characteristics and various  specifications of the product.   'Directors Big Y Task' | This initiative requires an overseas sub- sidiary CEO and the Business Group at Head Office to perform a  Directors Big Y task jointly, and is designed for the following two  purposes: 1) to create synergies through mutual cooperation and  the CEO of our overseas subsidiary information sharing and 2) to  enhance competitiveness through performing the task. The Direc- tors Big Y is a program, under which a director take responsibility  to resolve a strategic task having most significant importance to the  organization. It is an innovation activity for realizing desired perfor- mance with full responsibility utilizing organizational resources. The year 2012 marks the 50th anniversary of LS Cable & System's foundation. Although it is said that  we are on a path of continuous growth with a stable organization, we, rather, accelerate innovation.  We need to provide what customers want as the way they want in order to grow stably and continu- ously in the fast-changing management environment today. This is our innovation initiatives! Topic 1.

Risk Control II. 2011 PeRFORMAnCe  33 We Provide What Customers Want   On the basis of our understanding of customers industry as well  as technological competitiveness, we provide quality products and  services that customers want. In addition, we provide packages of  products and services from the perspective of customer, which en- sure convenience to customers but also enhanced quality of prod- ucts by maximize the interoperability of the products.  Application/Solution Services  In order to provide customer  oriented solutions, which is different depending on industries, we  transcend the category-based sales and instead offer customers  customized solutions combining cable-related all products and  services that a customer needs in areas including vessels, airport,  port, railway, automobile, building, infrastructure, wind turbine and  photovoltaic power generation. In addition, we organize a KAM Key  Account Manager team as a single channel of sales to satisfy customers  in need of diverse product lines related to cables, so to minimize  the inconveniences customers might experience when purchasing  diverse items.   Development of Lighter & Smaller, More efficient Prod- ucts For cables of different sizes, but the same performance, the  smaller and lighter one costs less in maintenance, and therefore, is  more advantageous to the user. Also it costs less to install a smaller  and lighter one. For this, we have developed the following high ef- ficiency products. gAP-type low sag & high capacity overhead transmission ca- ble  |  We have successfully commercialized a high-efficiency prod- uct, which uses aluminum alloy as conductor due to its high conduc- tivity. As a replacement for current power cables, this product alone  makes it possible to transmit twice as much electricity without the  need for additional power transmission towers and lines.  Light-weight optical fiber overhead cable  |  An Increase in com- munications data transmitted requires an increase in the number of  cables that are being installed over the ground. To reduce installa- tion and maintenance costs and improve urban landscape, we have  developed light-weight optical fiber overhead cable. For domestic  clients, we modified our installation method not to roll up the re- maining cables* and ensure the same performance. Wireless power transmission technology  |  We have developed  wireless charger for smart phones, named Chaver. Putting a cover  on the cell phone and placing it on the pad are all you need to do.  It takes about 2 hours to fully charge a phone, the same charging  efficiency as wired a charger. Chavers excellent technology is being  recognized by Wireless Power Consortium, WPC with its certification  of Qi, a new wireless charging standard. We plan to launch wireless  charger for notebooks and tablet PCs. Aluminum PFC tube  | There is a growing trend of making electron- ic products and vehicles lighter. For vehicles particular, light-weight  parts are being used to improve fuel efficiency. In line with this trend,  we have developed and been providing Aluminum PFC tubes, lighter  than existing copper tubes, to be used for vehicle air conditioners. It  is also cost competitive due to increased copper prices.  MCX harness  |  Data processed within televisions have increased  thanks to high-quality digital TVs and transition to 3D. To solve the  problem of complex cable bundles mounted inside a TV, we have  developed MCX harness, which enables efficient data transfer with  much fewer cables (51 cables 31cables). Development of eco-Friendly Products  With much attention being paid to resource depletion and global  warming, there is a growing interest in eco-friendly alternative en- ergy and high-efficiency energy sources. We provide products to be  used for generation, transmission and distribution of eco-friendly  energy such as wind turbine. Also we have made continuous efforts  to develop products that dont emit toxic materials in any circum- stances: production and operation, and unusual events such as fire.   Customer KAM Energy  Products  Services   Telecommunications  Integrated Modules Industrial Materials *Rolled-up remaining cables : overhead cables installed using electric polls are usually connected on the  ground and raised to support strands. After installation, the remaining cables are rolled up and attached  to the junction box. But since it is not pleasing to the eye and also adds electric load to the polls, we  install cables without it.

The Directors Big Y projects are generally  future-oriented ones aligned with strategies of their business group,  involving directors not only in production and R&D group but also  management and support group, and CEOs of subsidiaries at home  and abroad. Directors Big Y activities help lay the groundwork for  mid / long-term growth.  Process Innovation  By managing information on all functions and activities of sales,  production, purchasing, accounting, and logistics on-line through  the integrated corporate management information system, our  employees to access the information they need with much ease,  while guaranteeing transparent management and fair performance  evaluation. Recognized our increased efficiency of internal manage- ment process, we obtained AEO certification and FTA Exporter Cer- tification, in 2011. AeO Certification We, first in the domestic cable industry, ob- tained Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) certification from the  Korea Customs Service in March 2010. The certification allows us to  deliver safe products faster as we save time and money with stream- lined custom procedures and process. Based on WCOs criteria on  safety management for export/import supply network, customs  authorities of each nation grant the certification to the company  that meet the following criteria: compliance, internal control system,  safety management standards and financial soundness. Currently,  this system is in effect in 45 countries including the US, China, EU,  Japan and Canada. FTA exporter Certification Granted by the Korea Customs  Service to a company with ability to prove the country of origin, the  certification allows the holder to enjoy benefits including a simpli- fied process to get the certificate of origin issued and less paper to  be submitted. The certification allows us to respond to customer  needs even faster with significant money and time saved in the ex- porting process.  Problem Solving Activities through 6-Sigma  We have been pursuing 6-Sigma initiatives since 2007 for internal  innovation, which will result in improved products and services. 6-Sig- ma activities task solving activities with clear objectives and planned  schedule involve solving problems through objective and scientific  analysis. Currently we implement 6-Sigma projects in diverse areas,  such as internal process reform, product quality improvement and  product development. Through 6-Sigma projects, we can achieve  a corporate improvement objective, while participating employees  sharpen their competency through problem solving experience. We  hold the performance-sharing meeting on a yearly basis to share  excellent cases and spread the improvement results throughout the  organization. Innovation of Work Process We are dedicated to realizing the grand principle of innovation, growth with Customers, by inno- vating hardware and software we provide to customer, and the way we process it internally, as well.

The 3R and  5S refers to Right product, Right quantity, Right place and Soft,  Straighten, Shine, Standardize and Sustain, respectively. The My  Machine activities require all employees to maintain their site pro- duction facilities with a sense of ownership. All these activities are  designed to improve productivity and product quality. In addition,  we operate group activities of Quality Control project at production  facility that solve on-site problems using 6-Sigma methodologies,  reward excellent activities semiannually and distribute them to the  entire organization. Listening to employees Suggestion Idea  We operate the Imagination Island and Execution Island, from  which we collect various ideas and suggestions from employees to  make positive changes to our business. The Execution Island is an  online suggestion system, in which employees can post their ideas  about problems in the production site or make suggestions for im- provement in following areas: productivity, quality, waste/loss re- duction, energy, delivery, environmental safety, work improvement.  The Imagination Island is an idea/opinion sharing program at the  corporate level and allows employees to post their ideas on business,  products, sales, quality, cost reduction, corporate culture, systems,  and work system. Depending on participation level, each employee  is entitled to an imaginary title and can collect mileages, making it  all the more enjoyable to participate in.

For the registered opinions/ideas of customers, a problem solving  group composed of experts from different fields analyzes key customer requirements and derives  corrective measures to improve customer satisfaction. Improvement Initiatives based on Customer Opinions   Performance Management We select and manage indica- tors related to customer satisfaction, and monitor performance  through the ERP system. In addition, evaluation is regularly carried  out, using criteria that we developed to assess performance. Based  on the evaluation results, we decide on detailed plans to achieve  the objectives.  Customer Oriented Process  Customer Oriented Process  (COP) is an effective tool to handle customer requirements. The  process begins with collecting customer requirements. Then we  take a systematic approach, reviewing identified requirements us- ing checklists for each step of the product (sales, work procedure,  design, production, delivery and financial accounting, and mainte- nance). This process enables us to identify areas for improvements,  execute corrective measures, and utilize the results back in product  improvement and development.  6-Sigma We select some customer requirements having critical  influence on product quality as CTQ (Critical to Quality), and have  them managed as 6-Sigma projects. We analyze collected customer  requirements; and identify major issues from the analysis. Among  the major issues, we derive CTQs and select them to be resolved  using a 6-Sigma tool. Active Process of Customer Complaint Management Quality Review Meeting We hold the quality review meet- ing each year to share quality-related customer complaints at the  corporate level. At the meeting, we go over quality management  performance over the year and share major cases of quality man- agement failure to find the root causes and ways to prevent similar  issues from happening again.         Complaint Handling We make continuous efforts to prevent  issues that result in customer complaints. When a complaint arises,  we respond with agility in accordance with the established system,  which involves cause analysis, developing improvement measures  and continuous monitoring to prevent recurrence of similar problem.

Telecommunications solution seminar | In March 2011, we in- vited about 200 people engaged in wireless/wired communications  business, to our seminar held at the LS Tower located in Anyang,  Gyunggi Province. We introduced our telecommunication solutions.   guangzhou technology seminar | In July 2011, we held power  technology seminar jointly with LS Hongqi Cable & System, our Chi- nese subsidiary, in Guangzhou, China. With the 130 attendees from  the power industry of the region, we shared information on our high  voltage technology and its application in products, including super- conducting cable, submarine cable, and high capacity overhead  transmission cable. Accurate Product Information  Usually, our product provision is decided based on open bidding. We  provide detailed information on product, which required for in bid- ding participation and try to ensure accuracy of information we pro- vide through marketing activities including advertising, promotion  and sponsorship along with product information materials such as  brochure. We comply with the regulations on marketing, communi- cation and product provision and there is no violation case in 2011.  Listening to Customers  Intranet We share information on markets, technologies and  customers via Intranet and the collected information is discussed  among related departments and can be reflected to our customer  response and service.  Customer Satisfaction Survey We conduct customer survey  every year to understand customer satisfaction level and derive ar- eas for improvement. The survey results are shared within the com- pany and managed as improvement objectives. We intend to listen  to more customers by upgrading the survey methods.  Our approach to strengthen communication with customers is bi-directional: We 1) provide cus- tomers with information on our corporate policy, initiatives and products, and 2) identify customer  needs and requirements and incorporate them in our product development and manufacturing.

Also, within the Business Group the Quality Assurance  Team, which directly report to the director, is organized to test and  guarantee product quality Quality Manual  We created quality manual and procedure  based on ISO9001 to set forth a clear standard and procedure for  effective quality management activities. Also we monitor on a regu- lar basis the quality improvement activities whether they are carried  out according to procedure defined in the manual.   Corporate-wide Quality Management System To make  sure that all our activities in every step—e.g., corporate manage- ment, resource securing, product development, purchasing and pro- duction— are in line with requirements by customers and ISO, we  clarify roles and responsibilities of each Group and manage systems  so that products and services with satisfying quality can be provided  in a stable and continuous manner.  Product Safety Management  In every step from development and design, to manufacturing  and inspection, and to sale and maintenance, we strive to increase  product safety and reliability so that customers can use our product  safely throughout the end of the lifecycle of the product. Especially,  by establishing the Product Safety Management System (PSMS), we  meet legal criteria at home and abroad as well as social expecta- tions. Based on PSMS, we carry out preventive and corrective activi- ties to enhance customer safety. Protection of Customer Right We initiate a product recall when we become aware of a defect  that makes a product unsafe, in order to remove the unsafe product  from use and so to protect consumers. A product recall is a system  that calls an entire line of products considered dangerous or defec- tive back, and take a corrective actions including refund, repair, or  replacement. We do not collect customers private information as  a Business-to-business (B2B) company that most of our customers  consist of companies. Also, all data base including customers are  managed by IT security system such as access right to information  by works and position, document security, prevention system of in- house information(DRM), which ensure protection of customer in- formation. There is no incidents of non-compliance with regulations  on customer privacy and provision of product and service.   Quality Management Based on our guiding principle on quality that we recognize our customers as the reason for  our existence and do our very best to obtain customer trust and satisfaction by providing safe  products and services that meet customer needs and requirements in a timely manner, we have  established the ISO-based quality management system.

Our cooperative network bol- stered by the competitive edge of our suppliers ensures better  quality products for customers and greater growth opportuni- ty for companies around the world. Depending on the kinds of  products or services provided, our suppliers are generally classi- fied into four main categories: suppliers of (1) raw materials, (2)  commodities, (3) non-ferrous metals, and (4) maintenance ser- vice. In 2011, we maintained transactions with 919 suppliers. In  relations with suppliers, we consider the size of companies and  features of items that they supply, since our suppliers are clearly  divided into two distinct groups: large businesses supplying non- ferrous metals and petrochemical products, and SMes supplying  other materials.

Risk Control II. 2011 PeRFORMAnCe  41  Fair Transactions with Suppliers  We aim to establish a cooperative network with suppliers based on mutual trust through fair trans- actions. For this, we comply with guidelines of the Fair Trade Commission and, in particular, im- mediately make payment price adjustment based on international raw material prices, which is  a reasonable transaction method to reduce suppliers financial burdens in transactions with us.  In addition, we seek to ensure fair trade in actual transactions by expanding cash payment and  company-furnished raw materials.  Introduction of 3 guidelines of Fair Trade Commission We have adopted the Fair Trade Commissions top 3 guidelines,  namely fair contracting practices, supplier registration/manage- ment and in-house review committee on sub-contractors. We have  fully disclosed our guidelines that institutionalize the above three  items on the E-Procurement website, thus helping them trust us and  check our purchasing policy. As for the payment, the single most  sensitive concern for suppliers, we made it possible for suppliers to  file for adjustment of payment at any time.  Also we gladly accept  an adjustment request, as long as it is reasonable. We issue hard  copies of standard terms and conditions in relation to trade with  all suppliers, and plan to improve this practice in 2012 by internally  checking for any unissued items. Price-Sliding System based on International  Raw Material Prices In order to minimize the burden on suppliers due to price changes  of international raw materials, we introduced a price-sliding system  based on raw material price, by which price changes of raw materi- als are immediately reflected in payment for purchase. We make purchases based on actual trade prices of copper, which  is the most heavily used and relatively expensive material used to  manufacture cable products, and conduct price adjustments ac- cording to the changes in prices of petrochemical products and oil,  as well as the exchange rates. In 2011, a total of USD 9.6 million  was increased in 843 cases by the payment adjustment mechanism  and requests from suppliers.  Organization for Supplier Support  and Management The Purchasing Planning Team and Purchasing Teams in each busi- ness site are responsible for supporting and managing suppliers.  The Purchasing Planning team is in charge of general shared growth  initiatives, while the purchasing team deals with purchasing-related  work including supplier selection, bidding, and quotation. Informa- tion on our suppliers and transactions are posted and managed on  the E-Procurement system, allowing a systematic management of  suppliers.  Contribution to Suppliers Stable Management  In 2011, we improved payment terms for financial stability of suppli- ers. Cash payment, which used to be limited to payments less than  USD 4,500 per month, has been expanded to cover payments up to  less than USD 180,000 per month starting from April, 2011. Due to  this change, cash payment ratio of 2011 has improved significantly  from 16% to 40%, with a total of USD 360 million paid in cash. We  have paid cash equivalents (cash or trade receivable secured loan  without recourse) for all transactions, including payments worth  more than USD 180,000. We plan to pay cash for payments up to  USD 270,000 per month for each supplier and maintain a 100%  cash equivalent payment ratio. As suppliers are highly susceptible to the fluctuation of raw mate- rial prices and market conditions, we also provide suppliers with  company-furnished copper, a key material used for manufacturing  cable, to alleviate their burden caused by buying raw materials. With  company-furnished material worth USD 130.8 million in 2011, we  contributed to the stable management of suppliers. We hope to  grow together with our suppliers by identifying and supporting sup- pliers experiencing difficulties in securing raw materials.

Mutual cooperation funds Extending loans at preferential interest rates to second-tier suppliers (low rate 1.5% ) We provide supports for suppliers in a variety of field and in 2011 in particular, we laid the ground- work for providing support to second-tier suppliers. going forward, we intend to broaden the scope  of such support measure and continue to seek partnerships with suppliers to ensure substantial  cooperation that goes beyond perfunctory support.  Support for Technical Development  For technological development of suppliers, we perform joint de- velopment projects and help protect technologies through patents  assistance. In 2011, we extended about USD 1 million to fund  12 technology development projects of 16 suppliers and assisted  technology license permission of two suppliers and one joint pat- ent application. We aim to enable suppliers to develop and improve  technologies and will further expand our technological assistance  through joint R&D, technology information sharing, assisting new  product development with option to purchase, technology escrow*,  and product localization.  Support of Trainings We provide training programs on patents, product quality and sus- tainability management, all of which are designed to increase com- petitiveness of the suppliers. In 2011, we delivered 8 training ses- sions and seminars for 154 employees of 117 suppliers. The training  programs that we plan for 2012 will cover contents relevant to the  real management environment to satisfy needs of the suppliers.  Also we will provide more diverse training opportunities.  Financing Support We extended the zero-interest, no-collateral direct credit to support  suppliers with operational cost and factory relocation expenses. Also,  we created mutual cooperation funds together with financial insti- tutions so that suppliers can access credit at low interest rates. We  raised USD 1.2 million in 2011, a 73% increase from the 2010 level,  to create a USD 23.5 million-worth mutual cooperation fund. We will  further expand the scope of financial assistance to our suppliers. Second-tier Supplier Assistance In line with our effort to promote shared growth, we began support- ing second-tier suppliers. 2011 was the year we focused on estab- lishing the system to expand our support to second-tier suppliers  with the combination of direct assistance and indirect assistance  through first-tier suppliers. In 2012, we plan to launch various ini- tiatives including incentives so that first-tier suppliers actively par- ticipate in paying in cash and increasing unit prices for second-tier  suppliers. * Technology Escrow: A system to fully protect suppliers technology by keeping technology in the Large  and Small Business Cooperation Foundation, independent certified institution.

In  selecting suppliers, we analyze whether suppliers fulfill the necessary requirements for transaction  including management status, production capacity, and product quality, based on corporate-wide  global purchase policy. Also, we comprehensively consider economic, social, and environmental  performances, such as environment management capability, safety at workplace, and compliance.  After evaluation, we take a customized management approach so that suppliers can grow into a  more competitive company.  evaluation, and evaluation result reflection. As a method to en- hance objectivity and fairness of the selection process, all suppliers  are classified according to business line and material profile and are  subject to different criteria weights based on the assigned Evalu- ation Group. Also, suppliers are also entitled to additional credits  in relation to the win-win growth cooperation so that second-tier  suppliers may enjoy the benefits of the win-win growth. We certify  suppliers that excel in evaluation as Q-Partners and provide prize  money, certificates, medals as well as incentives such as in-house  training programs, marketing support, acceleration of payment due  dates. Based on evaluation results of 2011, we selected six new Q- Partners : JC Com. Co., Ltd, HYTC Co., Ltd, Haedong Co., Ltd, BBN  Steel Co., Ltd, Sungwoo Techron, and Hankook Wire.   * EG(Evaluation Group) Classification : classify evaluation group by business line and material profile  Fair & Transparent Selection System In order to select competitive suppliers, we introduced the global  purchase policy as well as supplier selection process. We secure  transparency in supplier selection and procurement by operating  the E-Procurement system (http://eproc.lscable.com), through which  suppliers access our selection policy.  Q-Partner, Certification of Outstanding Supplier We have an evaluation system in place to promote competitive- ness of suppliers. Evaluations are conducted annually on quality(Q),  cost(C), service(S) and delivery(D) and target the suppliers with  transaction worth more than USD 0.5 million and more than 10  deliveries during the evaluation period from January to December.

Customers  44 Link the worLd think the future LS Cable & System 2011 Sustainability Report Communication, Very First Step to Mutual Trust We keenly listen to the ideas and suggestions of our suppliers to resolve their grievances through  Shared growth, CPOs site visit, seminars and supplier opinion survey. Through communications,  we will improve our network competitiveness, through which we share performance and growth  with suppliers.   Shared growth Council The Shared Growth Council, which is composed of 35 excellent sup- pliers, was established in April, 2011. The council will have more  than four official gatherings a year in order to promote growth strat- egy and information sharing between us and suppliers, and among  suppliers through workshop, training and site visits. If 2011 was the  year to lay the groundwork for the council, it will have discussions to  deliver tangible results in 2012.  Listing to Voice from a Site  Our CPO Chief of Purchase Officerr visited suppliers to listen to their opinions  regarding management issues. Visiting all 35 member companies  of the Shared Growth Council in 2011, he witnessed business op- eration, listened to opinions including even those not related to  the contract with us, and shared ideas for improvement. We plan  to make such visits on a regular basis and hold open discussions  meeting with about 40 suppliers in 2012. It will establish a solid  foundation for communication between us and our suppliers and  contribute to growth of the suppliers. Outside Supplier Seminars The Purchasing Team created a venue to communicate with Produc- tion Management & Development department in order to provide  main outside suppliers with the opportunity to expand their busi- ness contract. In the business presentation-like seminars, each sup- plier presented its major equipment and technologies and shared  ideas whether it can supply products to other Business Groups as  well. A total of 9 suppliers participated in 3 seminars in 2011, and  we plan to discover innovative business items and strengthen cre- ative cooperation relations through quarterly seminars with outside  suppliers in 2012 as well. Satisfaction Survey of Suppliers  The Purchasing Planning Team has conducted a survey of suppli- ers to better understand their satisfaction of transaction with us.  Our survey for 2011 was conducted in November and targeted top  120 suppliers by purchase amount on three categories: transaction  process, supplier management, and win-win growth initiatives. The  survey results show that satisfaction level improved in all three cate- gories, compared to 2010. We will continue to conduct such surveys  regularly so that we can listen to diverse opinions, based on which  we will identify and address areas of improvement. grievance Procedure Channel We receive and address suggestions, criticisms, and grievances  through the Cyber Reporting menu on Ethical Management web- site. Received comments are independently managed to ensure  confidentiality and thus to help all suppliers express opinions and  enjoy all due rights. The Purchasing Planning team often promotes  the Cyber Reporting menu, while listening carefully to ideas/sugges- tions of suppliers and strengthening effort to internalize fair transac- tion practices all the time. Under the transaction process category, suppliers responded positively with more  than 80 points with regards to registration & evaluation of suppliers, ordering and  import inspection, and most noticeably, 92.5 points in the payment area. Price  agreement was scored at 71.5 points, which is not high enough but 11.7 points up  from the previous year and hints a major progress in our effort to apply fair price  of supplied products. Under the win-win growth initiatives category, the level of  satisfaction jumped to 84, 32 points up in a year, showing the initiatives are ef- fectively spread to suppliers. In 2012, we will find and implement ways to increase  satisfaction level in the price area.

The policy serves  as useful guideline for suppliers in understanding and practicing  sustainable supply network of LS Cable & System, as it covers our  economic, social and environmental considerations throughout the  purchasing process. In 2011, we carried out trainings on global pur- chasing policy and disclosed them on the E-Procurement system for  suppliers to reference. We plan to distribute translated versions of  global purchasing policy to overseas subsidiaries to help systematic  purchasing activities and supplier management.  Sustainability Management Monitoring We monitor sustainability management to identify the status of  sustainability management of suppliers and encourage its practice.  In 2011, we monitored 10 member suppliers of the Shared Growth  Council and conducted self-diagnosis, on-site inspection, and im- provement plan establishment.  Monitoring Results The monitoring identified one excellent  supplier and two good and the remaining seven suppliers failed to  meet the monitoring criteria. Most suppliers fared well in terms of  labor and welfare, while fair transaction and law compliance, envi- ronmental responsibility, and local community contribution were  evaluated to be in need of improvement. We will focus on those  less-performing areas in 2012 with the goal of increasing the aver- age from 56.6 points in 2011 to 70 points, and expand the scope  of monitoring as well. Building upon what we achieved in establishing sustainability man- agement monitoring environment for suppliers in 2011, we will con- tinuously operate the monitoring system in 2012 so that it can take  its place as our own supplier management program.

Each group focuses on helping  out the marginalized in local communities, utilizing fees collected  from members, ad-hoc donation, and contributions. Salary-Odd Sum Donation Upon the voluntary consent of  employees, we collect odd sums amounting to less than USD 1 from  their salaries and bonuses on a monthly basis. We donate a match- ing sum to the fund that adds the same amount of grant as employ- ees offer. With the odd sum donation, we grants about USD 3,500  in sponsorship every month to 37 needy neighbors including senior  citizens living alone, people with physical handicaps or children living  with their grandparents in Anyang, Gumi, Indong and Donghae(as  of 2011). In addition, we support the Bono Welfare Center in Ansan  City which takes care of children with physical handicaps, so to en- able the children to communicate better with the society and hold  on to their dreams. Sponsorship for Welfare Programs of Anyang & gunpo  We proposed to set aside about USD 1,800 to donate USD 900  each to the welfare projects of Anyang and Gunpo, our local com- munities, out of the yearly donation that all LS Group affiliates make  together to the Community Chest of Korea. Through consultation  with the local governments, we selected the appropriate programs  through which our donations could be used to support the socially  vulnerable class in practical ways. Based on these activities, we re- ceived a plaque of appreciation from the city of Gunpo that is given  to companies excelling in social contribution.

In 2011, Greenflor Team completed their relocation to  the plant in Indong. The research institute in Anyang was relocated  to the new R&D center in Gunpo in March 2012. These are long- term measures to develop the site of Anyang plant and research  institute into production and research complexes, housing facilities,  and office buildings of LS Group. They are expected to generate a  positive economic impact on the local communities by creating jobs  and building new infrastructure.  new Investments into Overseas Worksites Through Su- perior Essex, our American subsidiary, we invested a total of USD 60  million in the city of Tarboro, North Carolina, to build a power line  manufacturing plant, which will begin in operation in May of 2012.  We also invested USD 36 million in India to add a production line for  power lines in a telecommunication manufacturing factory located  in Bawal, Haryana, in northern India. The line is scheduled to begin  production from the first half of 2012. In addition, we established  an R&D center in Wuhan, Hubei province. We plan to develop it into  Chinas best comprehensive R&D center in the cable industry, and  are expanding the recruitment of local researchers.  Local communities have high hopes for our aggressive investments.  In an unprecedented press release, the government of North Caro- lina stated that The new plant will create new jobs. On a similar  note, Senator Clark Jenkins was quoted as saying that he expected  the new factory to contribute greatly to the economic revitalization  of Tarboro and North Carolina. Cultural and educational Supports LS-Vietnam Baduk Championship Our Vietnamese subsid- iary LS-VINA has been supporting the Vietnamese national Baduk  championship held in Ho Chi Minh city from 2011. In tandem with in- creasing interest in Baduk in Vietnam, LS-VINA is actively engaging in  distributing Baduk as well as facilitating cultural exchanges between  the two countries. Ever since Chairman Christopher Koo of LS Cable &  System was appointed as an honorary ambassador for Vietnam in Ko- rea, We have been supporting important events to facilitate cultural  exchanges and understanding between Vietnam and Korea, includ- ing 65th Independence Anniversary of Vietnam, Vietnam Cultural  Tourism Festival and Korea-Vietnam Friendship Night. Development Activities  nurturing Technical experts Since our signing of an MOU  with Sudo High School of Technology in 2010, we conduct regular  on-site training in our worksite for talented students in order to nur- ture talented technical experts. In 2011, we selected 4 students and  granted them opportunities to onsite training for 23 weeks. Cultural Heritage Protection We have engaged in Cultural  Heritage Protection Campaign, which involves cleanup and mainte- nance activities near the Iron Age Remains at Songjeong-dong. Des- ignated as Cultural Property of Gangwon Province No. 84 in 2005,  this place is where multiple housing areas and about 100 relics were  found. We plan to expand this movement to other worksite. Local environmental Protection  environmental Conservation We have carried out a variety of  activities to conserve the local environment. In Anyang site, Saving  Anyang Stream campaign is conducted at least twice a year, while  the Gumi and Indong site perform the joint cleanup activities in Mt.  Geumo regularly. These programs have the distinct characteristic of  the participation of both labor and the management. In addition,  employee clubs such as the mountain climbers club and scuba diver  club also participate in environmental cleanup campaigns. Participating in a Wild life Protection Program In order  to protect the migratory birds in the Haepyeong wetlands located in  Gumi, we feed the birds near Nakdong River and carry our cleanup  events held near the birds habitat every year, with the Gumi local  government and Daegu Environmental Office. The Haepyeong  wetland is the largest wintering pond along the Nakdong River for  white-fronted geese. Every year, from October to April, about 35  different species of migratory birds, including some 10,000 white- fronted geese as well as a number of endangered species of cranes,  come to the wetlands to pass the winter or to rest. At our events  aimed at protecting the birds, we scattered rice seeds, barley, wheat,  sorghum, and other foods along the sand bank of the island, and  also treated wounded birds and returned them to nature. We help our local community grow with a balance from economic, social and environmental per- spectives through an investment expansion economically, cultural and educational supports so- cially, and environment conservation activities, environmentally.

Suppliers 52 Link the worLd think the future LS Cable & System 2011 Sustainability Report People, Our Most Valuable Asset We hire a variety of talent from around the world. We now practice our the same, but different  principle with employees from diverse cultural backgrounds pursuing corporate common goals.  The basic approach we apply to all business sites is that we understand social and cultural differ- ences for each business site and incorporate them in the system while respecting human rights.  Respect for Human Rights Compliance with International Human Right Principles  We respect four ILO principles—freedom of association, a ban on  forced labor, a ban on child labor and non-discrimination—and pro- hibit unfair discrimination  for reasons of gender, academic ability,  nationality, religion, or region of origin, as stipulated in the chap- ter 5 of our code of conduct. Also we guarantee the three rights of  labor:  the right to organize, the right to bargain collectively, and  the right to take collective action according to the Article 33 of the  Constitution, and prohibit child labor and forced labor. We observe  rules, principles, and laws with regards to human rights and have  monitored compliance. We operate a variety of channels through  which discriminatory or unjust practices can be reported, such as  the cyber ombudsman and hotline for preventing any kind of sexual  harassment, and anyone can report or get counseling under ano- nymity without having to log on to our website. In 2011, there were  no violations.  Human Rights education We provide anti-sexual harassment  and human rights training programs to the entire employees every  year. In 2011, we conducted anti-sexual harassment training for all  2,393 employees and 1,298 persons completed the ethical train- ing program for diversity and non-discrimination. In addition, we  conduct anti-sexual harassment and ethical management training  in the corporate core training programs for new hires and overseas  transferees. Our facility management &security contractor, the Ser- veone, also provide training on human rights. In 2011, 18 employ- ees of responsible for security, who belongs to Serveone, received a  human right training every month.  global Talent Recruitment  We hired talented people in Ko- rea and elsewhere in the world via various recruitment channels.  Notably, to secure global diversity and strengthen global capacity,  we hire more local employees at our business sites overseas. And  with the goal of increasing the share of foreign employees to 10%  of total employees working in Korea, we try to procure global pool  of talent with partnership with search firms in key strategic spots  around the world and with campus recruits in prestigious universi- ties. We also came up with institutional support to respect diverse  backgrounds of our employees and better protect human rights.  We operate a global help desk to help resolve any grievances/chal- lenges of our employees. We also provide an opportunity to get a  position and short-term training packages in Korea to the employ- ees working in overseas subsidiaries and branches, with the purpose  to nurture core talents to global leaders.  Respect for Female Resources Although female workers are still a minority in portion given the na- ture of the industry, a industrial material manufacturing industry,  we actively hire female talents through creating a female-friendly  work environment and providing institutional support such as ma- ternal leave. As a result, female employees are in increase in num- ber. As of 2011, female managers account for 2.3% of the total of  management positions, and we have a plan to recruit more female  talent and nurture female leaders via specialized leadership training  programs. *Data of domestic subsidiary is not included.  *Data of 2011 includes the number of employees in overseas construction project.  *Data of 2009 was not collected 8.8% 9.0% 9.5% 197 230 218     Female employees    Female of managers or higher positions Female Employees & Managers                                                Unit : person 2010 2011 2009 14 16 17 2.2% 2.5% 2.3% Ratio of foreign employees                                                         71.5%   70.4%  2010 2011  Topic 4.

Risk Control II. 2011 PeRFORMAnCe  53 Strategic Partnership  We have strengthened mutual trust between labor and manage- ment through guaranteeing participation of employees in corpo- rate management and joint collaboration initiatives. Notably, we  made it mandatory to go through discussion with labor union when  it comes to changes in working conditions in an effort to prevent  degradation of working conditions and ensure job security. Strengthen communication for mutual trust We provide corporate management information to employees via  various channels and communicate actively with them to promote  mutual understanding.  Sons Book Caf We make use of reading as a tool to facilitate  internal communication and share their ideas, while encouraging  reading as a way to get knowledge, ideas, and inspiration. Selected  books by the CEO are distributed to all employees, and the employ- ees are encouraged to post their ideas not only on the books but  also on corporate management on the webpage, titled Sons Book  Caf. We read 5 books together in 2011.  Onsite Satisfaction Survey  The labor/management joint  council conducts an onsite satisfaction survey every year. The sur- vey has 8 categories:  1) Opinions on managers (manager, deputy  general manager, and general manager) 2) opinions on supervisors  3) communication 4) corporate culture 5) labor-management re- lationship 6) labor union 7) working environment & safety 8) job  management 9) welfare & reward. The result of the survey is used  to find out and address onsite issues, thus improving employees  satisfaction level.  Mutual growth through Communication and Trust  [Collective Employment Agreement Article 20]  The company shall try as much as possible to ensure job security of the members and discuss  matters having an important effect on job security(new HRM system, wages, benefits, organizational  restructuring and downsizing, etc.) via the Participation & Cooperation Promotion Council in each  workplace before implementation. Our mutually beneficial labor-management relationship is on the basis of mutual trust and com- munication. In accordance with international human rights principles and domestic laws, we guar- antee the right of employees to form and join trade union. Also, the management group and labor  union promise to respect and cooperate with each other in order to improve the working condi- tions while facilitating corporate growth. Both have collaborated as strategic partners without  labor disputes for the last 23 years and shared common vision through seamless communication.

For this end, we have developed  a systematic human resource development system having a tie with corporate strategies and  competency desired by the company. Also, we encourage our employee to develop such competency  as Positive Mindset, Creativity-driven Innovation and Professionalism.   Objective-Oriented Performance Management  & Fair evaluation We have the SPCM (Strategy Performance Competency Manage- ment) system to manage and improve the performance of our  employees. Early every year, employees set goals for their business  group, team, individual tasks and personal development and check  their achievement progress through counseling with supervisor and  interim review, and follow-ups that help resolve problems. The SPCM  system also sets up KPI (Key Performance Index) and competency  metrics to ensure effective performance through regular review and  feedback. Noticeably, the system provides a clear guideline on per- formance evaluation criteria and requires compliance of established  evaluation processes. In the meantime, we have supervisors provide  feedback on evaluation results and give employees the opportunity  to raise an appeal to prevent distortion of the evaluation and ensure  transparency. The performance management system encourages  performance improvement as it is liked to the incentive system that  provides performance-based reward by employee or by team. In ad- dition, equal rewards are provided for equal performance, and there  is no discrimination in salary between male and female employees. Strategy- linked Human Resources  Development System Our HR development system designed to nurture global talents fo- cuses on three directions: entrepreneur leaders who will implement  business strategies, professionals who grow to become top experts  in each field, and global leaders leading our overseas business. All  employees are given equal opportunities to improve their capabili- ties in accordance with human resources management regulations  and the companys code of conduct. Based on evaluated perfor- mance and career development targets, we establish HR develop- ment plan customized for individual employees and facilitate regu- lar counseling sessions with supervisors, which helps employees to  develop their career with a link to corporate development direction.  In addition, we have training programs and courses not only for in  house employees but also for those of the subsidiaries and suppliers  and plan to support the implementation of cyber training system of  subsidiaries starting from 2012.

In 2011, a total of 13 employees received the  specialized trainings required for long-term competency. Various Contests to Promote Innovation Activities To  facilitate continuous improvement, we hold various contests to prize  excellent performances. We encourage employees with excellent  performance and motivate innovation activities by sharing them.  Currently, we operate performance sharing meetings (Directors Big  Y, 6-Sigma project), project presentation meetings (individual proj- ect), on-site group activity presentation (on-site group project), R&D  prizes (R&D tasks). In 2011, 46 excellent innovation activities were  rewarded at the corporate level.

Support for Physical and Mental Health  Giving comprehensive consideration to physical, mental, and eco- nomic health, we operate our welfare system in 6 broad areas.  Diverse programs in each area promote health of employees and  their family, support healthy recreational activities, and encourage  network among colleagues so that employees can refresh them- selves. In addition, children scholastic benefits, housing assistance  programs, and support for retirement preparation keep employees  financially secured so that they can focus on their jobs with a sense  of self-esteem.

OHSAS 18001 Certification All our domestic ites (Gumi, In- dong, Anyang, and Donghae) are OHSAS 18001 certified and get- ting post-certification test & re-certification assessments each year  from the certification authorities. We have continued to improve our  ESH (environment, safety and health) management system that is  up to the global standards and plan to complete certification process  of OHSAS 18001 for domestic and global subsidiaries by 2013.  Managerial efficiency & Transparency ensured through  IT system To better manage information on health and safety  management activities, we use a computerized system, which en- ables real-time access to health & safety management performance  and facilitates company-wide sharing of the information. The sys- tem covers information of the evaluation result of worksite health &  safety level, improvement areas and goals/ improvement program.  We plan to expand the scope of managed data in the system with  system upgrade.  Health & Safety Management by Labor and  Management Occupational Health and Safety Committee  We oper- ate the Occupational Health and Safety Committee, in which equal  number of labor and management (7 representatives, respectively)  participate, including labor union leaders, honorary health & safety  supervisors, safety managers and health managers. The Occupa- tional Health and Safety Committee is convened once every quarter  but a provisional session can be called when it is needed, with a role  of improving the entire level of safety by collecting feedback and  making decisions to mitigate safety risks on the site. In 2011, we in- stalled ventilation facilities in 67 places, selective emitters and noise  control facilities, which are considered that improvement is needed  from the work site assessment result. Labor/Management Joint Activities With the purpose of  making substantial progress in on-site health and safety manage- ment, labor and management jointly visit the site and address is- sues through joint safety checks. In 2011, the joint safety checks led  to improvements in about 114 dangerous equipments. Health & Safety Training To raise awareness on health and safety among employees, we con- duct health & safety trainings on a regular basis. We asked a 3rd  party professional agency to conduct trainings on health & safety  management for safety supervisors every year, and provide regular  trainings for all employees, at least two hours every month, on the  importance of safety, danger of machinery/equipment and their  handling. We operate health & safety trainings for suppliers as well,  and share related information during our monthly meeting with  suppliers.  Notably, workers handling hazardous/dangerous materials or ma- chinery/equipment are required to have applicable qualifications  and complete a special training in an effort to prevent a major in- dustrial accident. Trainings involve both case studies learning and  discussion, in order to achieve the training goals of preventing an  accident & building problem solving capability.

The general manager of each department  draws up a yearly plan on health & safety and announces it, and em- ployees adopt the declaration on zero-accident and safety activity.  Hazard Detection We have improved on-site problems through  voluntary safety check every month. And hazard detection exercise  is carried out involving all employees on the hottest and coldest days  of the year, when safety awareness might fall to the lowest.  Improving Safety of equipment Use All machinery/equip- ment are checked by users to ensure safety on a daily basis. We  commission regular safety checks (once in every other year) to ex- ternal specialists for hazardous/dangerous machinery/equipment.  Also we identify and remove problematic areas through voluntary  safety check every month, while putting easy-to-notice image safety  signs on all machine/equipment.  Health Promotion Program We provide comprehensive med- ical checkups to employees over age 35 and their spouses for free of  charge. We support those with health issue and in need of profes- sional treatment for medical expenses. For employees who need to  take good care of their health, we give them health improvement  plan together with advice on lifestyle, exercise and diet. Psychological Counseling For psychological health and griev- ance resolution, we provide grievance & psychological counseling  services. Grievance counseling service helps employees discuss any  issues that might be difficult to talk to their supervisors through for- mal communication channel. Representatives of labor union or em- ployees association serve as secretaries and listen to employees and  help cope with challenges.

Wireless magnetic resonance charging is a  mechanism that involves creating a magnetic field and making a transmission coil resonate  with a reception coil. In other words, just as the two prongs of a tuning fork create a sound  by resonating together, electricity is transmitted by making two copper coils resonate in the  same magnetic field after adjusting their wavelengths. Because it does not require the use  of cables, wireless electricity transmission technology enables resource conservation and  enhances convenience. It is also garnering much attention due to the fact that because it  requires zero contact, it has secured environmental safety while expanding the scope of  its application in the electric and electronic sectors.

It consists of the Cli- mate Change Committee, the Green Product Committee, and the  Environment Safety & Health Committee. In 2011, the Climate  Change Committee established an implementation plan regard- ing the emission allowance reflecting the GHG target negotiation  with government, set its energy reduction target and devised its  equipment investment plan. Furthermore, it also responded aggres- sively to the changing environment for climate change by deciding  supports for suppliers establishment of the inventory. The green  Product Committee introduced PLEAT in all development projects  to ensure green product development, and applying this to our in- ternal ERP system enabled the effective computerized management  of green development projects.  environmental Management System  We have declared our company-wide policies on environment and  work place safety, and built an environmental management system  that meets the ISO 14001 standard, which is an international stan- dard on environmental management. At the same time, we identify  the environmental risks related to our business each year, and take  corrective actions for improvements. Currently, all of our domestic  plants acquired the ISO 14001 certification and we have a plan that  all our subsidiaries at home and abroad are certified by 2013, start- ing with our Malaysian subsidiary in 2012. In recognition of our capabilities in system-based environmental  management, Gumi, Indong, and Donghae plants have been des- ignated as Green Companies. Moving away from the conventional  policies that focus on meeting regulations, we are currently engaged  in voluntary environmental management activities.    evaluation & Continued Improvement  Every year we implement an environmental impact assessment on  the entire life cycle, from the purchase of raw materials to product  manufacturing and transportation, and take improvement mea- sures against the serious environmental impacts and risk factors  that are derived from the assessment. For environmental impact as- sessments, we categorize our corporate activities into processes that  can be measured and assessed. Then for each process, we identify  the input & output substances as well as the volume and toxicity  of pollutants, and assess the harmfulness of the substances used  during the process as well as the risk factors involved, taking into  account the related laws and regulations. Moving forward, we plan  to promote these life cycle management practices among our sup- pliers as well as our subsidiaries at home and abroad. environmental Investments & Benefits  Investments in environment We continue to make invest- ments in reduction of environmental impact, in transition to an eco- friendly manufacturing process and improvement of the employ- ees safety and health. In 2011, our investment in environmental  safety amounted to a total of USD 22 million: more specifically, we  invested USD 17.5 million in R&D of the green product, USD 1.3 mil- lion in change toward an eco-friendly process and in environmental  equipment, USD 0.9 million in conserving energy, and USD 2.3 mil- lion in enhancing the safety and health of employees and reducing  the impact on the environment environmental Cost & Benefit We analyze the environmen- tal cost and benefit of our activities, with the aims of objectively  identifying the outcomes of our environmental management and  strengthening our competitiveness. Currently we are analyzing  the cost and benefit involving energy saving, green product devel- opment and waste treatment, and will include more items in our  analysis in the future.

In the cable industry, the amount of energy used in the  manufacturing process is relatively smaller than that of other industries, which implies that there is  less room for reducing gHg emissions; however, to solve the global challenge of climate change, we  are striving to minimize the emission of gHgs throughout entire life cycle, which includes not only  the manufacturing process but also the purchase of raw materials and the disposal of the product.  In particular, we have recently expanded the product development related to the renewable energy,  providing an infrastructure with which our customers can contribute to lowering gHg emissions.  *BAU (Business As Usual): Emission volume projected in BAU without mitigation activities  Risks Opportunities Activities Regulatory Physical Others  Korean governments target to reduce  GHG emissions by 30% from BAU* by 2020   A carbon emission cap on  companies,  according to the governments negotiation   Increased responsibility (e.g. writing &  submitting an implementation report)   Expansion of the smart grid market to  secure stable power supply and minimize  power loss   Increased green business opportunities  related to renewable energies such as EV,  wind farms, green buildings, LED lighting,  etc   Expansion of energy-efficient  infrastructure for GHG reduction   Drew up a GHG statement verified by a  3rd party   Launched the Climate Change Committee  & established of company-wide target for  basic energy unit   Implemented the Energy Conservation &  GHG Reduction Implementation Plan  Prioritized the procurement of energy- efficient facilities   Produced wind power cables & busducts  Developed EV harnesses & modules  Produced superconducting cables &  terminals  Installed EV charging systems (17 places)   Stability of VCV tower structure due to  increased frequency and intensity of  typhoons   Decreased construction-ready days due  to a rise in the number of rainy days from  climate change   Increased yellow dust from desertification   - Increased costs for fiber optic cable clean  room maintenance   -Increased defects due to dust   Increased cable durability risk due to  sudden temperature changes and an  increased number of typhoons   Increased demand for submarine and wind  power cables due to typhoons and the rise  in sea levels  Increased demand for reliable and durable  cables resistant to sudden weather changes   Operated a crisis response process in each  workplace   Enhanced safety measures for clean room  facilities   Launched new businesses with mass  production of durable submarine cables   Demonstrated product quality by securing  outstanding production technology and  through in-house high-intensity testing  Rise in costs due to fuel and commodity  price increases  Increased customer preference for low- carbon products  Customers demand for CDP  Stable commodity sources   Increased preference for green products and  green companies   Responded to CDP of supply chain   Secured stable supply of copper through LS  Nikkos copper   Built a green supply chain through green  partnership   Expanded green product certification  (Greenflor, flooring, etc)   Expanded green product line up  Climate Change Risks and Opportunities  An electric car is propelled by electricity instead of fossil fuel. Although its invention  predates that of gasoline-powered cars, it had not been successfully commercialized  due to the inconvenience of charging battery. However, EVs have been placed under the  spotlight once again, due to the increased interest in climate change and the advances  made in EV charging technology. By completing the high-speed EV charging infrastructure  project commissioned by the Korea Environment Corporation (KECO), we installed high- speed EV chargers in 17 places in Korea. Also, we became the first company in the world  to link EV charging system with railroad infrastructures. The GHG emission level of an  electric car is only one tenth of that of gasoline-powered cars. And we are playing a  pivotal role in promoting this green next-generation mode of transportation.

Risk Control  65 II. 2011 PeRFORMAnCe energy Use and gHg emission  energy Use  The amount of energy used in 2011 was  3,083,557GJ, which showed a 0.1% increase from that of 2010.  This pertains only to fixed combustion and the use of indirect en- ergy, and does not include the energy used for mobile combustion.  The cause behind this rise was the increased use of LNG and steam  for wintertime heating, mainly, the amount of electricity used for  production actually decreased slightly. As a result, the basic energy  unit, which shows the input energy per unit product, was 4.29 in  2011, showing a 6.7% improvement from 4.60 in 2010.  gHg Management  We built a GHG inventory in 2005 that  covers entire domestic business including 4 domestic plants (An- yang, Gumi, Indong, and Donghae), head office, two training insti- tutes, and the solution business group. Also, we received a 3rd party  verification for information accuracy. The total GHG emissions in  2011, including SF6, was 230,000 tonCO2eq, showing a 12% de- crease from the year before. Direct emission, which includes fixed & mobile combustion and pro- cess emission (including SF6), was lowered by 21% (29,000 ton- CO2eq), compared with previous year. This can be attributed to the  reduced use of SF6 due to the improvement of SF6 facilities. Indi- rect emissions, the amount of GHG emitted by the use of electric- ity and steam purchased outside the company, decreased by 2,000  tonCO2eq, compared with previous year. energy Conservation & gHg reduction activities  We use LNG, electricity, and steam, and also rely partly on LPG as  energy sources. To use less energy, our Facility Management Team  is leading the activities that are aimed at improving the energy use  of all business sites; meanwhile, waste of energy is minimized in the  manufacturing part through quality improvement, reduction of fa- cility waiting time, and other activities for process optimization. In  particular, we are continuously reducing our use of SF6 by repairing  facilities that use SF6 and introducing a recovering system. On top  of these activities, efforts are being made to reduce GHG emissions  in distribution and in employees commuting activities (operation  of commuter buses, use of public transportation for business trips).  Key Reduction Activities  We invested a total of USD 0.9  million for the innovation activities of all business sites as well as  the Facility Management Teams initiatives. By conducting a self- diagnosis on energy-intensive processes and coming up with ideas  for improvement, we have minimized energy loss and improved pro- duction efficiency, which in turn is improving our basic energy unit.  Resulting from our energy saving activates engaging all grouped,  costs related energy consuming is USD 30 million in 2011, less  UDS  2.15million than the originally expected costs of USD 32.1million.  This is equivalent to 262,631 GJ of saved energy and 13,000CO2eq  of GHG reduction.  Product expansion Related to Renewable energies  We  contribute to the reduction of indirect GHG emissions by developing  renewable energy products and superconducting system solutions.  The increased efficiency of the transmission and distribution system  by the superconducting systems minimizes energy loss, thereby re- ducing the amount of energy used to generate electricity. In addi- tion, we can reduce GHG emissions and construction costs as well by  shortening the number of construction days required from installing  new cables.  We are also contributing to GHG reduction by providing  energy-saving solutions to our customers through the supply of core  modules and operation system to the renewable energy sector, such  as wind power generation cables & operation system and cables re- lated to photovoltaic generation. gHg Reduction in Transportation  In order to minimize the  environmental impacts of transportation, we are diversifying the  modes of transportation by product characteristics. As a result, we  are striving to minimize the use of air transport, which has a larger  GHG emissions footprint, and to increase the use of maritime trans- port. In 2011, 84% of our products were delivered via maritime  transport. In addition, through our Integrated Logistics Team which  was established in 2010, we are lowering the direct and indirect  GHG emissions caused by our transportation, not  only reducing the  logistic costs and enhancing transport efficiency.

We  are continuously developing recycling technologies for raw materials  and products in order to ensure the efficient use of resources, while  also widening the areas we use recycled raw materials. In addition,  to reduce the resources used for packaging materials, we improved  the design of wooden drums, which are our main packaging mate- rial, and optimized the number and size of the drums by securing  advanced technologies, thereby minimizing wood consumption. The  wooden drums used in packaging and transportation are recovered  from major customers upon agreement and recycled after repair  and maintenance. In 2011, we used recycled drums by approxi- mately 6.1% of all wooden drums. Scrap wire is also recovered from  products disposed of at the end of their lifecycle, following the Vol- untary Agreement on Waste Recovery & Recycling with the Ministry  of Environment. In particular, approximately 40 ton of scrap copper  generated from the manufacturing process is fed back into the pro- duction process each month to reduce resource consumption.  Use & Management of Water Resource  The Anyang plant is provided with water from Paldang reservoir, the  Gumi & Indong plants from the Nakdong River and the Donghae  plant from the Dalbang reservoir through K Water, Korea govern- mental agency for comprehensive water resource development and  providing. We use about 2,038 ton of water per day, and our water  consumption is deemed to have only a minor impact on each water  source. The water we use can be categorized into industrial water,  which is used as a coolant for cable manufacturing processes, and  water for daily use, which is used by our employees. To reduce water  consumption, we operate a recycling system that transfers waste  cooling water discharged from the cooling process after extrusion to  a cooling tower, where it is filtered and cooled before being fed back  into the extrusion process. Our total water consumption has risen  slightly over the past three years due to increased production. Air Pollutants Control The major air pollutants emitted from our operation include NOx,  which is generated in the manufacturing process of magnet wires,  and dust, which is created during the SCR* (Southwire Continuous  Rod System) process. The amount of NOx emitted each year is ap- proximately 24 ton, accounting for 86% of the amount of all air  pollutants combined, while the amount of dust emitted every year  equals 2.1 ton, accounting for 8%. We have installed a dustproof  equipments, including a RTORegenerative Thermal Oxidizers and a SCR Selective Cata- lytic Reductor , to minimize the emission of NOx, as well as dust collecting  equipments to control the dust generated by the SCR smelting fur- nace. Furthermore, the pollutants are monitored continuously and  kept below 30% of the legal requirements. In 2012 we will make  new investments in the dustproof equipment for SCR smelting fur- nace in order to boost the efficiency of our dustproof equipments.  Water Pollutant Control  Our plants are not in or near any special water protection zones, spe- cial control zones or protected areas for biodiversity. In addition, the  wastewater generated during the production process at the Gumi  and Indong plants is treated at the wastewater treatment facility  before being discharged into the local sewage treatment plants.  The wastewater from the Anyang and Donghae plant is discharged  directly into the sewage treatment plants. Our wastewater consists  mostly of waste cooling water, which is created during the cooling  process after extrusion in our cable manufacturing process. The  main pollutants in the wastewater are COD and SS, and it does not  contain any toxic materials or heavy metals that are detrimental  to the ecosystem. When it is treated before being discharged into  the sewage treatment plants, the wastewater is treated to 30% of  pollutant density of the legal requirements or below. Thus, it can  be assumed that the wastewater discharge from our worksite has  little impact on public waters and the ecosystem. A specialized 3rd  party contractor monitors the treatment process at least once a  month to ensure the safe treatment of wastewater. In addition, we  have installed wastewater flow meters to measure and record the  volume of discharged wastewater every day. The amount of water  pollutants emitted by our operation decreased in 2011, due to the  process separation of the Anyang plant.  Chemical Substance Management To prevent accidents related to chemical substances and enable  their safe handling and storage, we have established and are imple- menting a set of standards for controlling chemical substances for  each manufacturing process, taking into account their properties  and the environmental threat they potentially pose. At each site, a  comprehensive accident prevention system has been put in place,  covering all stages involved including storage, to eliminate any risk  of accidents. Only employees who have received training and are  deemed qualified can transport and handle hazardous chemicals.  In addition, for major facilities that use hazardous chemicals, regu- lar emergency drills are devised around possible scenarios to train  employees to respond to chemical-related accidents. Hazardous chemicals used in our operation include cresol, xylene,  ammonia, and NaOH. Cresol and xylene used in magnetic wire  manufacturing account for the largest proportion of hazardous ma- terials. We are trying to reduce cresol consumption through various  measures, such as by developing alternative substances. Waste Management  Key wastes generated in our operation include waste oil and organic  solvents from production processes, general industrial wastes such  as discarded synthetic resins, synthetic rubber, and wood, and other  wastes generated by employees in their daily lives. Our waste treat- ment is managed by specialized 3rd party waste disposal contrac- tors, who are subjected to regular inspection and assessment at  * SCR(Southwire Continuous Rod) : Continuous copper rod production system developed and patented  by U.S. Southwire(USA)  Topic5.

Also, by managing the entire process of waste  treatment using the governments online system (Allbaro System:  www.allbaro.or.kr), we enable a real-time monitoring of whether  waste disposal is conducted in an appropriate manner.  Wastes are incinerated, reclaimed, or recycled. To expand the scope  of recycling, we are developing technologies for recycling inciner- ated wastes while also looking for new recycling contractors. As  part of our effort to increase the recycling of wastes, about 70% of  wastes generated in all plants are now recycled by specialized waste  disposal contractors. As a result, a fair amount of copper, PVC, PE,  and other resources are recovered from about 11,200 ton of waste  each year.

Suppliers 72 Link the worLd think the future LS Cable & System 2011 Sustainability Report green Purchasing   We are promoting the purchase of green products by establishing a  green purchasing guideline and revising the related standards and  guidelines. In particular, we signed the 2011 Industry-wide Green  Purchasing Voluntary Agreement in 2011. In reference to the Green  Product Purchase Promotion Act and the Green Growth Framework  Act on Low Carbon & Green Growth by the Korean government, we  break down a green commodity into 2 categories, subject to pur- chase type and intended use. ; below are the details. green Purchasing  We encourage the purchase of office sup- plies, office equipment, and consumables with domestic/foreign  green marks. We have designed the Green product preference  system that suggest to buy eco-products if the price differential  between an eco-product and a comparable conventional product  is within 10% and pace an eco-product at the top of the search  results, when the purchaser looks for a product. green Procurement  We are creating a management system  with which we can procure raw & subsidiary materials, packag- ing, and outsourced products with no hazardous substances. We  have established hazardous substance control criteria consisting  of 3 phases in consideration of global regulatory frameworks and  customer requirements. The procured products raw materials are  currently being investigated through documentary evidence of haz- ardous substances management. Also, by managing the related  documents online through the linkage with E-Procurement, an  electronic purchasing system, we have made management more  convenient and have enhanced the efficiency in responding to cus- tomers requests for information disclosure. By managing the infor- mation on hazardous substances in the entire procurement process  and disclosing the related data to our customers in a transparent  manner, we have successfully reduced the environmental impacts  of our products and are getting ready to respond flawlessly to in- ternational environmental regulations, agreements and customer  requests.  Definition Scope Green   Purchasing Purchase of general goods and  office supplies  Purchase of office supplies and  other goods used in office life  through MRO Products with Eco-Label  certification (green mark) Products with GR Mark  (recycling mark) Products with saved  energy (energy mark) Products with other  environment marks  (domestic/foreign) Green   Procure- ment Purchase of raw materials,  packaging, and outsourced  products (OEM, ODM) Procurement of raw materials/ used as inputs for product  manufacturing through a  contract with suppliers Products that lower  hazardous substances Products that lower waste  Hazardous Substance Control Criteria Substance Method 6 substances  regulated by RoHS Analysis data by  certified agencies  are collected so  that eco-friendly  products are  safeguarded  completely from  the adulteration of  these substances Phase 1  Substances  regulated by  global regulatory  frameworks and/ or green cable  criteria These substances  are banned from  being used for  specific industrial  products specified  by LS Cable &  System Phase 2  Substances to  be reduced  voluntarily These substances  are designated  to be phased out  voluntarily Phase 3  2011 Green Purchases According to Certifications 737 11,268 9,762 884 86 Energy  efficiency  graded products Green Mark GR Mark High  efficiency  energy products Air pollutants  reduced  products green Supply Chain We have built a green purchasing system to promote the production and consumption of the green  products and to provide our customers with green products by eliminating all hazardous substances  in the first stage of raw material procurement. Furthermore, we certify suppliers who provide green  products as green Cooperators. Unit: millions of USD  Topic5. Employees Topic 4. Local Community  Topic 7. Risk Control II. 2011 PeRFORMAnCe  73 green Cooperator  Based on our assessment, we grant the Green Cooperator Certifica- tion to suppliers who deliver green raw & subsidiary materials. As  a green supply chain management system, it completely prevent  hazardous substances from making their way into our product value  chain, making sure that we provide customers with products that  contain no harmful materials. At the same time, this serves as an  opportunity for our suppliers to build an environmental manage- ment system. The Green Cooperator Certification process consists of  three steps, in which the suppliers overall management system for  hazardous substances is assessed. A supplier must first acquire the  Green Cooperator Certification in order to be selected as LS Cable  & Systems Q-Partner. We provide the Green Cooperators with ben- efits given to outstanding partners, as well as training and support  to maintain and enhance their eco-friendly management system.  green Cooperator Test Certification  In May 2011, we se- lected 9 suppliers who were relevant to the law and customer de- mands related to hazardous substances, and carried out our Green  Cooperator test certification. The results showed that the suppliers  management of hazardous substances fell short of our standards.  So to help them build their own hazardous substance control sys- tem, we offered training to the employees in charge and provided  guidelines on establishing the management manual and on quality  assurance.  Also, the test certification gave us a chance to grasp the present  condition of the Green Cooperator Certification Program and to  solve the identified issues. Internally, by using PLEAT, we made im- provements to analyze a products environmental safety for each  stage of the process, from development planning to evaluation,  aiming to incorporate Eco-Design into the entire development pro- cess. Also, we included the standards on hazardous substances in  the specifications for purchased/outsourced products and improved  information-sharing among related divisions. In the future, we plan  to form an auditing team to monitor purchases and nurture audi- tors from the quality assurance teams in each business division to  further strengthen our internal capacities. Externally, we provided  guidelines on the procedure and manual for product environmental  quality assurance system, thereby helping our suppliers build their  management systems, which were deemed by the test certification  to be insufficient. Furthermore, we will ask the suppliers to select  employees who will receive continuous training from LS Cable & Sys- tem, and reflect this in the suppliers training curriculum.  green Supply Chain Build Up by expanding the green  Cooperator Certification Program  In the future we plan  to implement the Green Cooperator Certification Program across  the globe. To ensure the fairness of our evaluation, we will use dif- ferent assessment categories for our suppliers depending on their  transaction volume with us, legal risks, and the type of company. We  will provide the suppliers who have acquired the Green Cooperator  Certification with certificates, and continue to provide training and  follow-up management.

We currently disclose in- formation on our environmental management activities through a  green company information disclosure system. Also, by participat- ing in CDP, we provide our key customers and the government with  GHG data, whose objectivity has been verified through 3rd party  experts each year. In the future we plan to disclose information on  our green management activities through our sustainability report  and website every year.  Communication on environmental Management  We make policy-related proposals on technical roadmaps to gov- ernmental organizations and academic societies involved in the  development of green technologies & products. Furthermore, we  offer regular environmental management diagnosis and training to  our suppliers and suggest improvement measures, thereby helping  them enhance their environmental management practices.  Corporate & SMe green Partnership  To build a sustainability management system in which we can co- prosper with our suppliers, we have been implementing the Cor- porate & SME Low Carbon Green Partnership as a national project  led by the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy. For approximately  two years (Nov. 2011 – Oct. 2013), we will be engaged in projects  related to building a GHG inventory, establishing a hazardous mate- rial management process, building an information system, and nur- turing hazmat management experts. The targets of these projects  are 10 suppliers, who were chosen from a number of outstanding  suppliers designated as Q-Partners. Through this measure we hope  to systemize our GHG/energy/hazmat management.  gHg Inventory establishement  Based on our experience of  building GHG inventories at all of our plants in 2011, we plan to aid  our suppliers build their own inventories.  Hazardous Material Management Process  Through a  clean production process that is linked to Green Purchasing with our  suppliers, we plan to implement hazardous substances control man- agement and produce green products. Building an Information System  Using the system current- ly in place at LS Cable & System, we plan to build an information  communication system that enables hazardous substances man- agement, energy management, and the management of carbon  emission reduction measures. nurturing experts  We will conduct various workshops, group  training, and on-site training on topics such as climate change and  carbon technology for the CEO and executives of our suppliers. 1 2 3 1 Sustainability Report 2Environmental information disclosure system 3Environment trainings for suppliers 4CDP participation 5  Policy proposals on green technology/product 4 5 green Communication  The environmental issues we face transcend national borders, and cannot be solved by the efforts  of individual companies, regions, or nations.

As a result, on top of our RoHS measures that were implemented to boost our exports to Europe and meet the customer de- mands, we have also introduced the CE Marking, which is a new requirement of RoHS II. We develop technologies that enable us  to manufacture products using materials that contain no hazardous substances, and these products are provided through the green  supply chain. Also, before shipment we conduct an inspection using an XRFX-ray fluorescence analysis equipment to check for haz- ardous substances, and we provide our customers with a certified analysis report. In addition, we implement the CE Marking system  through our self-compliance declaration and evidence collection each of the components used in our products contain none of the  6 hazardous materials.  2) Response to REACH The number of substances controlled by REACH has been increased continuously; as of December 2011, 20 new substances have  been added as highly-dangerous hazardous substances, increasing the total number of controlled substances to 73. Each business  Group has a person in charge of green products, who checks on the highly-dangerous hazardous substances designated by REACH  each month, and also collects materials on hazardous substances, such as MSDS, Mill Sheet, and component analysis, from suppliers  to create a list that outlines the chemical substances contained in all materials. We are also currently developing substances that  can replace the highly-dangerous hazardous materials, and we plan to completely eliminate their uses by building a IT System on  environmentally hazardous substances. Our  Responst to International envionmental Reulations Replacement of heat exchanger in heat furnace In the process of analyzing the cause of difference in fuel basic  units and inspecting the facilities, a leakage was detected in the  heat exchanger plumbing of an old heat furnace. A total of USD  42, 423 was invested to replace the heat exchanger, which en- hanced fuel efficiency and lowered the LNG use.  Cleaned & overhauled the condenser  in a 450RT turbo freezer We removed the scale inside the tube of a heat exchange con- denser in a summertime turbo freezer by washing the condens- er and painting the corroded parts.

In particular, we have imple- mented the company-wide risk control system, with the purpose of  maximizing a corporate value by minimizing risks that reflect huge  impact of raw materials on product manufacturing.    Forward exchange System  We match the inflow and the  outflow of each currency and hedge against the remaining expo- sure with derivative financial instrument such as forward exchange  contracts. Through forward exchange contracts, we can fully under- stand of the currency position of the company and promote man- agement stability by reducing the volatility of foreign exchange  rates. Also,  currency trading for speculative purposes is strictly pro- hibited.  Derivative Contract  We are exposed to commodity price risks  on copper, aluminum, lead and others but we could hedge against  the risk by entering into commodity future or forward contracts.  Also, we recognize copper futures based on fair value hedge ac- counting system.  Interest Swap  Interest rate risks mainly arise from long-term  borrowings. We manage cash flow interest rate risks by using  floating-to-fixed interest swaps, aiming at minimizing uncertainties  caused by the volatilities of interest rates and net interest expenses Integrated Financial Risk Management  by Monitoring System establishment  The importance of risk management is being emphasized due to  increased uncertainties in the management environment, global- ization, more volatility in economic variables and strengthened  regulation with introduction of IFRS, the new financial accounting  standard. Reflecting these changes, we have reinforced a more  strengthened financial monitoring system by improving the existing  risk management system, in which risk factors are managed in the  after-process, which makes it less systematic and independent. Our  planned financial monitoring system will identify leading indicators  of each process, which have a significant impact on management  indicators, define risks and provide means of management, ensur- ing an integrated management.

Consequently, the concept of fair  trade is no longer just an issue dealt with through a companys risk  control activities; rather, it is now directly related to the companys  survival itself. In 2011, we were sanctioned by the Fair Trade Com- mission five times for our unfair practices. We have seen the error of  our way, and to prevent a recurrence we introduced a self-compli- ance program for fair trade (CP; Compliance Program) in December  2010, thus striving to help a culture of fair competition take root. CP  is a company-wide compliance management system that is used  to comply with laws related to fair trade. With its introduction, we  can devise clear code of behavior for compliance and prevent law  violations in advance.  Self Compliance System  We hope to become a company  that leads the way in fair competition, thus striving to become the  Global No. 1 Player in terms of compliance as well as external  growth. The CHO, the head of business support division, has been  appointed as the Self Compliance Manager, and our fair trade self  compliance management organization consists of the Self Compli- ance Secretariat as well as the Support, Sales, Production and Pur- chasing Divisions. Currently we are engaged in a wide variety of  activities to promote fair trade, such as reviewing the key issues of  CP, reviewing and diagnosing the current level of fair trade compli- ance, and consulting on business activities related to fair trade. In  particular, by learning from mistakes, from 2012 we will concentrate  more on enrooting the concept of fair trade by reinforcing preven- tive measures. Reinforcing the Implementation of CP  We are stepping up  our efforts with CP activities to prevent risks related to fair trade. In  February 2011, our CEO re-declared our commitment to pursue self- compliance. We invited third party experts to provide training on fair  trade at all of our workplaces, and conducted a training program on  fair trade and Anti-Corruption Act in November to raise employees  awareness. In addition, we distributed a manual on self-compliance  as well as special notebooks for fair trade self-compliance that can be  used as a guideline for all behaviors at workplace. We also conducted  a review on the head offices subcontract transactions and requested  that wrong practices be rectified voluntarily. Furthermore, we estab- lished a contract preview system to check in advance whether the  execution of a certain contract violates the law in any way.  non-financial Risk Management Status of the Fair Trade Self-compliance Program 7 items LS Cable & Systems activities (plans) Status Declaration of self- compliance commitment Re-declared the commitment for self-compliance during a training session on fair trade   Completed in February 2011  Appointment of a self- compliance manager and  organization preparation Appointed a self-compliance manager  Designated one self-compliance staff in each department      - Fair trade self-compliance secretariat (legal affairs team) Completed on December 20,  2010 (ongoing) Distribution of self- compliance manual Published and distributed a self-compliance manual  Completed on December 20,  2010 (ongoing) Regular training programs Conducted fair trade self-compliance training program at all workplaces (5 times) Conducted fair trade & anti-corruption training program at the head office and Anyang plant  Completed in February 2011  Completed in October 2011  Diagnosis and auditing Carried out a subcontract transaction diagnosis at the head office  Completed in September 2011  Punishment for violation  of any fair trade laws/ regulations Registered regulations on penalty provisions for employees violating laws/regulations related  to fair trade  Once a violation is exposed, a review committee will be convened to take disciplinary and  corrective measures  Disciplinary measures  expected General operation (document control system) Set up a bulletin board on a company intranet  Distributed the document control guidelines  Completed in February 2011  CEO Self Compliance Manager CHO Self Compliance staff: One person per each department Fair Trade Self compliance Management Organization Support Sales Production Purchasing Self Compliance  Secretariat  Topic5.

From 2012, while making it  mandatory for all new employees to sign the fair trade & compli- ance pledge, we plan to revise and reinforce our fair trade training  curriculum to make it more applicable to work by offering mandato- ry courses and on-line training at different levels, moving away from  the group-centered training conducted in the past. We will incorpo- rate the revised law and cases into the curriculum, and also improve  our self-compliance manual and conduct frequent diagnoses to  make sure there are no violation risks caused by misunderstanding  the law. In the case of the diagnosis on subcontract transactions, we  hope to expand it to all our workplaces and thus pursue a win-win  growth by promoting a culture of fair trade among our suppliers.  Through these measures, we hope to become a leading company  in terms of fair trade.  Implementation of ethical Management,  a Principle-driven Management As the foundation of corporate management, ethical management  is a social responsibility we must assume as a corporate citizen, as  well as the standard of our business activities and behaviors. LSpart- nership has chosen integrity, which entails honesty and rationality,  as its core value, thereby strengthening our commitment to ethi- cal management and regarding it as the basic element of creating  desirable outcomes. We will reinforce our ethical management in- frastructure and help ethical management take root so that all em- ployees can take into practice it in their daily lives.  establishment of ethical Management System  Based on  our CEOs strong commitment to ethical management, we have set  the vision of establishing a culture of ethical management on a  global scale and are implementing our strategies accordingly. Up  until 2006, we laid the foundation for ethical management by revis- ing our code of ethics, launching the Ethics Secretariat, and creating  new programs and regulations. From 2012, we plan to expand our  ethical management framework to our domestic subsidiaries first,  before promoting it globally to achieve our vision for ethical man- agement.  ethical Management Program  We have in place a cyber  reporting system that offers improved convenience and anonymity.  We also continue to implement various PR measures and training pro- grams to encourage our employees to practice ethical management.  Reporting system |  We have a cyber reporting channel as well as  an online counseling office. Our reporting channel guarantees (1)  confidentiality, (2) job security, and (3) waiver of liability, so that  employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders can feel at  ease when filing a report. We also reward reporters five times sum re- ceived in maximum(up to USD 4,513). In 2011, a total of 33 reports  were made, 3 of which involved unfair work practices. All reports have  been handled and concluded according to regulations.  Clean company program | We strive to promote a clean corpo- rate culture through a self-reporting program on the acceptance of  financial favors from third parties. When the acceptance of such fa- vors has been unavoidable, we encourage the individual involved to  voluntarily make the report. Items collected from the program that  are not returnable are donated to social welfare facilities of local  communities.  ethical management PR articles | Since 2006, we have been  posting a variety of articles on ethical management updates, the  corporate code of ethics and ethical management schemes, guide- lines, best practices, etc, on the intranets bulletin board. ethics management training program We require newcomers  and newly-hired employees with experience to complete a cor- porate ethics training program as a mandatory course, and also  conduct ethics training on employees who will posted at overseas  branches. In 2011, we conducted training in ethics management  & fair trade self-compliance, as well as an anti-sexual harassment  e-Learning program, for employees at all of our workplaces.  Topic 7.

It is an assessment  tool that applies and links international guidelines related to ethics  (including UNs Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Interna- tional Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, the OECD guidelines  for Multinational Enterprises, ISO26000 (international standard on  social responsibility), and GRIs Sustainability Reporting Guidelines),  international indicators including the IVAIntangible Value Assessment, DJSI Dow  Jones Sustainability Index, and the FTSEFinancial Time Stock Exchange index, and our own  code of ethics. It promotes an enterprise-wide ethical management  practice on a global scale. The evaluation aims to analyze the ethi- cal level of employees for improvement, and consists of indices for  ethical management framework, corporate ethics implementation,  and work-related ethics implementation.  In the 2011 evaluation, the total score was 75.8; scores for ethi- cal management framework, corporate ethics implementation, and  work-related ethics implementation were 73.4, 72, and 82.1, respec- tively. In 2012, we plan to devise and implement various improve- ment measures for categories that showed relatively insufficient  performance, such as revising LS Groups integrated code of ethics  and guidelines, reinforcing the promotion of ethics management  system, and disseminating best practices.  ethics management with suppliers | To promote ethics manage- ment among all our domestic subsidiaries, we have integrated our  ethics management system that includes the reporting system and  Clean Company program. Starting from 2012, we also plan to ex- pand our ethics management framework to our subsidiaries.  Responsible political participation | We offer our expertise to  the government and other organizations related to our company on  industrial policy establishment, and are putting responsible politi- cal participation into practice through rational discussions. Over the  past 3 years, we have never made a contribution to politicians or  political lobbyists.  Achievements through Strategic Risk Control  In the midst of a rapidly-changing business environment, we are  effectively managing the risks related to executing strategy by re- viewing its alignment with the changing environment. We seek to  minimize the risk of strategy failures and achieve our goals through  rational and appropriate decision-making in the process of regular  executive meetings, monthly management of indicators, and on- site caravan activities.  A strategic risk can arise in relation to company goals, the appropri- ateness of strategies and resources used for their implementation,  strategy implementation, response to changes in the market envi- ronment, and the impact of strategic decision-making. We strive  to minimize risks through a process that involves identifying risk  analyzing cause  evaluating impact  responding to risk.  Workshop for executives  Two executive workshops are held  every year, once during the first half and once during the second  half, to better respond to the rapidly changing market environment.  At each workshop the attendees discuss the external and internal  business environment, review and revise the established strategies  according to changes in the business environment, thus making  sure that the medium- and long-term goals, short-term strategies,  the strategies implemented by each business division maintain con- sistency and validity.  Management of Indicators  We measure the effectiveness  and efficiency of executing our strategy by managing the progress  being made in relation to staff, customers, sales, production, pur- chases, R&D, and other areas in terms of indicators. In addition,  we regularly monitor the risks and performance level related to our  strategy execution by adding up the indicators each month and  sharing the results within the company.  On-site Caravan  A caravan is a vehicle pulled by a camel or a  horse and is used to transport people and goods across the plains or  the desert. At LS Cable & System, it refers to the activity of visiting  business sites and taking stock of the progress on-site. Each month,  the CEO chooses one business site (including those overseas) and  visits there in person to check whether the on-site activities and per- formance are sufficient and provides guidance on site management  to enhance strategy execution and effectiveness.

26000    evaluation Standards  Based on ISO 26000, the international standard on social responsibility, the  Korea Standards Association (KSA) developed a CSR Implementation Evalu- ation Checklist. The ISO 26000 checklist includes the process on CSR imple- mentation as well as the evaluation of performance in relation to seven core  subjects (governance, human rights, the environment, labor practices, fair op- erating practices, consumer issues, and community involvement & develop- ment). Based on the ISO 26000 checklist, KSA evaluated LS Cable & Systems  level of implementation on CSR.  evaluation Scope  KSA evaluated LS Cable & Systems overall internal/external activities, mid- to  long-term strategies, activities related to CSR, and the process of implement- ing sustainability management strategies, among other factors. The results  were assessed based on the review of internal documents (including policy  documents), performance data, and the computation system.  evaluation Results  LS Cable & System received 885.5 out of 1000 points, verifying that the com- pany has achieved Level IV of ISO 26000 Social Responsibility implementa- tion. This means that its employees have a high awareness on social respon- sibility and that the companys management system, policies, and practices  are well-organized.  Conclusion LS Cable & Systems CSR activities are at a stage in which they are being  integrated into all stages of the companys activities. The companys system  and level of implementation to respond to the ISO 26000 is quite outstand- ing. We recommend that it strengthens its communication with stakehold- ers, monitors its mid- and long-term performance on the implementation  of sustainability management, and incorporates the results into employee  performance in order to heighten its integrated execution capabilities related  to CSR.

KSA, the assurance provider, is responsible for reviewing the validity of the  report content through the examination of the systems and evidence to  produce information and performance data and for presenting indepen- dent assurance recommendations. The responsibility for collecting, analyz- ing and organizing all the claims and reported information in this report  lies solely with LS Cable & Systems.  Independence As an assurance provider, KSA does not have any interest in LS Cable & Sys- tems other than conducting this third-party assurance engagement and  KSAs independence and autonomy is fully assured.  Assurance Standards and Level  KSA followed the AA1000AS (2008) standard, ISO 26000, and the GRI  G3.1 guidelines to perform the assurance engagement. The AA1000AS  (2008) assurance principles of inclusivity, materiality, and responsiveness  were utilized in assessing the report and KSA provided moderate level as- surance which covers reliability regarding procedures to generate specific  performance data.  Assurance Type and Scope  KSA performed Type 2 assurance engagement in accordance with the  AA1000AS standard. Such Type 2 assurance aims to evaluate the re- ports compliance with the reporting responsibility principles under the  AA1000AS (2008) and present reliable assessments of the performance  data of sustainability management contained in the report.

KSA is also assured that the report satisfies requirements for the Applica- tion Level A+ of the GRI G3.1 guidelines.  KSA presents the following feedback in accordance with the AA1000AS  (2008) assurance principles Inclusivity  KSA assessed the level of stakeholder engagement at LS Cable & Systems  in taking response actions on sustainability issues in a responsible and stra- tegic manner and developing these response measures.  KSA believes that the company is running stakeholder engagement chan- nels including discussions and surveys and the engagement process is  operated in an appropriate manner. In particular, KSA is confident that  the inclusion of stakeholder engagement in the companys mid/long-term  sustainability management strategy and action plans is a clear demon- stration of its commitment toward stronger stakeholder engagement.  Materiality KSA assessed whether the company presented material issues that may  affect its stakeholders in this report.  KSA is confident that the company properly undertook the materiality test  process in selecting issues material to stakeholders and is not aware of any  omissions or exclusions of data material to stakeholders. In particular, we  believe that the company is serving as a pioneer in publishing this integrat- ed report which includes both the annual report and the sustainability re- port and thus incorporating interest of a wider spectrum of stakeholders.  Responsiveness KSA reviewed whether the company responded to material sustainability  issues where stakeholder interest is high and that such response activities  were proactively communicated through the sustainability report. KSA believes that the company is responding to sustainability issues mate- rial to its stakeholders in an appropriate manner. The company is under- taking systemized response measures in accordance with its sustainability  management strategy.  Especially, it is commendable that the company  pursues balanced disclosure of information by presenting data as it is  in the report, makes commitment toward continued improvements and  takes relevant actions.   Sector-specific Feedback and Recommendations  In order to properly respond to sustainability issues of stakeholders and to  ensure effective communication of such responses in undertaking compa-  APPenDIX  87 ny-wide sustainability management initiatives, KSA believes that the fol- lowing recommendations are worth LS Cable & Systems consideration.  Sustainability Management Framework  To ensure that LS Cable & Systems moves towards the phase II(incorporation  and dissemination) and the phase III(integration and differentiation) of  the sustainability management practice roadmap already under progress,  LS Cable & Systems would be better positioned to integrate communica- tion activities covering stakeholder engagement, issue identification, rec- ognition of sustainability management challenges and report publication  with its company-wide management strategy action framework.    To set up stakeholder engagement strategies by further segmenting  stakeholder groups and to manage and incorporate stakeholder feed- back on a company-wide level To stipulate the criteria of materiality test and to reflect the recognition  of those dilemmas that may arise due to discrepancies in stakeholder  expectations To present targets according to future mid/long-term action plans and  to report relevant progress, thus continue to enhance the responsive- ness economy   LS Cable & Systems offers a complete overview of its economic perfor- mance through the report. In particular, its balanced presentation of eco- nomic data will assist LS Cable & Systems trust-based communication  with stakeholders. LS Cable & Systems will benefit from continuing with  this practice.  environment   is committed to disclosing more of its environmental management. The  company is recommended to give a focused description of top priority is- sues such as response to climate change and prevention of pollutants in  the upcoming years.    Society Given that LS Cable & Systems initiatives to fulfill its social responsibility  are primarily focused on its Korean business sites, the company would ben- efit from introducing strategic sustainability management performance  management systems to its overseas sites and expand these systems  gradually. Sustainability management at LS Cable & Systems may further evolve  through the integration of ISO 26000, the international standard on cor- porate social responsibility, on a company-wide level and the sustained  improvements. KSA believes that the company would be able to enhance  its internal/external value as a leading organization in meeting social re- sponsibility by examining respective themes of social responsibility and  undertaking sustained improvement activities in the upcoming years.
