In 2006, we expanded the social component of the report and changed its name to the Kikkoman  Group Corporate Citizenship Report.   ScopeThis report covers the activities of the Kikkoman Group, comprising the Groups holding company, Kikkoman  Corporation, as well as its 62 consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method subsidiaries and affiliates (as of March  31, 2012). This report refers to the Kikkoman Group as Kikkoman Group or the Group, to Kikkoman Corporation  as Kikkoman Corporation, and to Kikkoman Corporation, Kikkoman Food Products Company, Kikkoman Beverage Company,  and Kikkoman Business Services Company collectively as Kikkoman. Otherwise companies are referred to by name.   Reporting PeriodFiscal 2012 (April 1, 2011-March 31, 2012)  This report may contain references to activities that were initiated prior to March 2011 or after April 2012.  Date of PublicationDecember 2012 Previous report: December 2011 Next report: Scheduled for December 2013  Note on Statements about the ForecastIn addition to information about past and present activities undertaken by  the Kikkoman Group, this report includes statements about the forecast in the form of plans and projections current  at the time of its publication. These statements reflect the judgment of management based on information that was available  at the time of their inclusion in the report. Changing conditions may cause the results of future business operations  and other events to differ from projections.    1    Message from the CEO    Since Kikkoman was founded, we have given  careful attention to our role as a public  entity in society, and we have conducted our  business based on an awareness of our  connections with society. This approach is  reflected in the current management principles  of the Kikkoman Group.    When the unprecedented earthquake struck in  March 2011, the Kikkoman Group immediately  took action to provide support for the affected  areas. As part of our efforts to help the  affected areas, we called upon our group  companies and individual employees to provide  donations. We received donations from many of  our employees and 18 of our group companiesâ€”not  only in Japan but also in 13 countries and  regions overseas. Our employees are still  proactively  participating  in  volunteer  activities to assist the affected areas with  reconstruction. A large number of our  employees are doing whatever they can in order  to help address such social problems, and this  demonstrates that the mentality that was  established at the start of our company has  taken root and spread throughout our Group.       As a company that manufactures food products, we have a special responsibility that people  eat. The most fundamental and important responsibility of a food manufacturer is to  consistently provide products that are safe and that can be enjoyed with a sense of assurance.  The Kikkoman Group has developed a quality control system for ensuring the safety of products  from the raw materials stage, and we have launched an initiative so that the opinions that  we receive from customers through the Kikkoman Consumer Center our Customer Service Center  are reflected in our business. Since we made our Shokuiku (food education) Commitment in  2005, we have been conducting food education activities aimed at making eating more  interesting and fun. We intend to proactively continue providing tours of our plants and  offering Kikkoman Soy Sauce Academy, in which our employees visit elementary schools  in various regions and talk about the raw materials that go into soy sauce and how soy sauce  is made. Through such efforts, we hope to convey the wonderful aspects of Japans food  culture to many people and contribute to passing on this culture.             2    Kikkoman is a company that conducts business related to soy sauce, which is a traditional  Japanese seasoning. We provide our products and services in over 100 countries and are  continuing to develop our business globally. In 2001, Kikkoman became the first Japanese  company to sign the United Nations Global Compact. We view our signing the Global Compact  as a promise that we will fulfill our responsibilities as a company in the global community.  In 2011, we formulated the Kikkoman Corporate Citizenship Framework in order to clarify  what we believe to be our social responsibilities as a company, establish specific  initiatives, and make improvements.     This Framework sets forth three key themes for helping us to realize the objectives of our  management principles. They are: Responsible Operations, Products /Services, and Actions  for global society. By establishing action objectives based on these themes, and having  each of our employees put them into practice in their day-to-day work, we will continue  to strengthen our activities and thereby fulfill our responsibilities to society.

This attitude is  reflected in our Management Principles.  Now that we have come to supply a variety of  products and services to customers in more  than 100 countries worldwide, we recognize  that our responsibilities to global society  have grown together with the growth of our  business. We aim to become a company that is  valued by people around the world and we  will continue to implement activities that  are aligned with our Management Principles.  The basics of our Management Principles are  that we carry out our day-to-day business  activities in a reliable and trustworthy  manner and that we contribute to the  realization of rich and healthy food  lifestyles through our products and  services. In addition, we aim to fulfill our  responsibilities as a public entity and  contribute to society through activities  that are unique to Kikkoman. We believe that  the cumulative pursuit of each and every one  of these activities is our corporate social  responsibility.

(2) Upgrade equipment   When renewing equipment, switch to more  energy-saving and thermal- efficient types to  help reduce CO2 emissions.  (3) Improve efficiency in energy use    Reduce reliance on grade A fuel oil and switch  to natural gas, and use electricity more  efficiently to reduce the environmental loads  of operations.     FY2012 Review                      Reducing total emissions  Total CO2 emissions for the Kikkoman Groups  major domestic companies in FY2012 fell to  113,880 t- CO2, or 78.6% of the FY2006 level.  Consolidation of plants in the Nippon Del Monte  and the conversion of boilers to run on natural  gas in group companies contributed to the  reduction.    Total CO2 emissions (major domestic companies)                            Reducing emissions per unit of production  CO2 emissions per unit of production for major  both domestic and overseas Kikkoman Group  manufacturing companies in FY2012 fell to  0.166 t- CO2/ton, or 97.1% of the FY2011 level  (a decrease of 0.005 t-CO2/ton), meeting the  objective. This was primarily due to CO2  reduction efforts by Nippon Del Monte. The  entire Group will strive to lower CO2 emissions  per unit of production.

At the Kikkoman Soyfoods Saitama Plant, the soy milk production  process uses high-temperature steam from a boiler to sterilize the  milk. Once sterilized, the milk is immediately cooled. During this  cooling operation, the temperature of the cooling water used to cool  the milk rises. The heat in the cooling water is then recovered using  a waste-heat recovery heat pump (150 t/h, 180 kW), and used to heat  the water supplied to the boiler. In effect, the water is used  simultaneously for cooling and heating, saving an estimated 400 t-CO2  emissions annually.    Inverter-Type Air Conditioning  Manns Wine Co., Ltd.  The shop at the Manns Wine Katsunuma Winery originally had five air  conditioner units; however, they were unable to cool the shop  efficiently with the many customers entering and leaving. Efficient  temperature control has now been achieved by replacing these units  with four new inverter-type air conditioner units and installing a  dividing wall between the shop and the museum display section. As a  result, electricity usage for air conditioning has been reduced by  45%.     Improved Thermal Efficiency Using Heat Insulation Paint Nippon Del Monte Corp.  Nippon Del Monte Corp. used a heat insulating paint to coat the  pasteurizer-cooler on its apple sauce line and can line. The goal was  to control radiated heat from the product sterilization process and  reduce energy consumption. The paint was also used to coat the roof  of the entire apple sauce line, helping the interior air conditioners  to function more effectively. Developed from ceramics used in the NASA  space shuttle project, the paint has a powerful ability to reflect  and disperse the suns energy. In this way, it greatly reduces the  amount of heat that enters through the roof of the plant, improving  the working environment inside.

Kikkomans Guidelines for Containers and Packaging    1. Reduce containers and packaging.  2. Use returnable and reusable containers and  packaging for our products.  3. Consider applying shapes, designs and  materials to containers and packaging that  facilitate simple collection and reuse.  Repackage  current  products  in  new  containers and packaging in compliance  with the relevant laws and regulations of  each country.  4. Make greater use of sustainable resources.  5. Increase procurement from environmentally  conscious suppliers and vendors.  6. Use materials whose chemical compositions  and shapes have been verified as being safe  to humans.  7. Incorporate feedback from customers and  information on where and how they purchase  and use our products into the development  of new containers and packaging.  8. Develop containers and packaging with  universal designs to make them easy to use  for a diverse range of customers.     FY2012 Review                      Improving the recycling rate    The recycling rate for major domestic and  overseas manufacturing companies during  FY2012 was 97.9%, a 2.3% improvement over  FY2011s rate of 95.6%. Sludge recycling  at Kikkoman Biochemifas Kamogawa Plant  contributed to the improvement. Going forward,  we will redouble our efforts to achieve our  target recycling rate of 99% (FY2015).

During FY2012, we focused on the effective  utilization of food-related byproducts (soy  sauce cake, soy sauce oil, okara [bean curd  refuse], mirin cake, apple residue, grape  residue, seaweed extraction residue, and  bonito and kelp soup extraction residues), in  particular by boosting reuse as feed, a  high-priority area and enhanced quality as  defined in the Food Recycling Law.   As a result, the waste and byproduct recycling  rate at major domestic manufacturing companies  reached 97.9%    The waste and byproduct recycling rate  (major domestic and overseas manufacturing  companies)                        Increase use of environmentally friendly  containers and packaging materials  During FY2012, Kikkoman Foods reduced the  weight of its 1.8 semi heat-resistant plastic  bottles from 72g to 69.5g (a reduction of about  3.5%) by adjusting thickness of plastic and  handles as well as lowering a product height.  Also, plastic labels used for 500m and 1  Hon-Tsuyu were thinned from 50m to 35m.   This was made possible by improving film  materials and plastic label lines. The thinner  labels now have a better perforation, so it  became easier to tear off when disposed.  Manns Wine adopted aluminum cans. They are  suited for recycling and lighter in compared  to glasses, which contribute to reduce  energies consumed during transportations.

Kikkoman  Food Products Company achieved 100% conversion of soy sauce cake into animal feed in FY2009.  At Nippon Del Monte, 100% of the apple and tomato residue and other vegetable sludge emitted  from the Nagano and Gunma Plants are recycled as fertilizer. At Manns Wine, 100% of vegetable  residue, sludge, non-burnable items, cardboard and wood chips are recycled. At Kikkoman Soy  Foods, 99.9% of waste is similarly recycled. The Kikkoman Group is also promoting recycling  at is various overseas Group companies.    Introduction of Aluminum Cans for Wine   Manns Wine Co., Ltd.  Manns Wine Co., Ltd. became the first major wine brewers in Japan to use aluminum cans in  February 2012, with the launch of its new LA LA VIN series. This has made it easier to  handle the product during distribution as well as during consumption. At the same time, it  has realized environmental benefits in terms of package recycling and lower energy requirements  for transportation.   In recycling, the new packaging can easily be separated into the components of aluminum  and label, and allows the use of existing aluminum recycling systems. In terms of  transportation, the weight difference between a 300 m aluminum can (approximately 20 g) and  an equivalent glass bottle (approximately 270 g) add up to a 44% reduction in overall product  weight. A rough calculation shows that this will allow an additional 13,272 cans to be loaded  onto a 10 t truck, a transport efficiency improvement of 87% that helps to reduce energy use.

The man-made lake was created in a section of  Singapores Gardens by the Bay, a national park being developed by the Singaporean  government. The theme of the project is the ability of aquatic plants to purify water.   The lake project provides residents and travelers with a  green space, and is designed to showcase Singapores  concept of striving to coexist with nature. It has been  designed with special biotope features such as functions  for cleaning of the water by aquatic plants, nutrient  enrichment of the water, and nurturing of aquatic  creatures. The Singaporean government awarded KSP with a  Nature Heritage Tree* at a ceremony for promoting  beautification and greenery, in recognition of the  companys contribution to the greening of Singapore.    *Nature Heritage TreeThe 80-year old Rain Tree is planted close to the top of Fort Canning  Hill. At the base of the tree a plaque reads, The heritage tree is dedicated to Kikkoman in  appreciation of their support for the Garden City Fund.    Environmental Lecture for Persons of Malaysia Environmental Department KC  In September 2011, 20 people involved in environmental preservation in Malaysia visited  Kikkoman to hear an explanation about the Kikkoman Groups environmental preservation  policy and examples of its activities, to ask questions, and to take a tour of the site.   This event was part of a training course in technologies  for preventing environmental damage in Malaysia, organized  by the Environmental Personnel Development Center through  the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The  goal was to broaden participants perspectives by having  them learn about cases of environmental preservation in  Japan. Kikkoman agreed to provide a part of the schedule  for the visitors time in Japan at the request of the  Environmental Personnel Development Center.       19  Principal Environmental Risk Management              The Kikkoman Groups main approach to  environmental  management  includes  the  following components:    (1) Water Pollution Prevention  We establish voluntary standards and pay  particular attention to the maintenance of  wastewater quality and prevention of river  water pollution, as we use and discharge large  volumes of water in our manufacturing and  cleaning processes.    (2) Manual for the Proper Disposal of Industrial Wastes   We sort industrial waste before disposal, work  to reduce industrial waste as little as  possible, and pursue recycling. In Japan, we  contract the collection, transfer, processing,  and disposal of industrial waste to licensed  service providers. We compiled the Kikkoman  Manual for the Proper Disposal of Industrial  Wastes and strive to ensure that waste is  disposed of in an appropriate manner.    (3) Noise, Vibration, and Odor Prevention  In an effort to prevent noise, vibration, and  odors, we have been installing quieter  machines and soundproof/sound-absorbing walls  in our plants. Noise and vibration levels are  regularly monitored along the boundaries of  our plants to ensure that they do not exceed  the levels prescribed by local community  regulations.    (4) Air Pollution Prevention  In addition to observing regional regulations  on the concentrations and total amounts of  sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx),  and soot and particulate emissions, we seek to  control these emissions by establishing  voluntary standards at each of our plants.    (5) Black Mold Pollution Prevention  Trees, roofs, and walls of houses in the  vicinity of soy sauce and mirin factories could  become darkened due to the presence of Aureo  basidium, a microbe that propagates through  the intake of alcohol and whose presence can  generate a black pigment on material surfaces.  In  consideration  of  local  residents  potential reactions to such infestation,  Kikkoman Group hermetically seals the source  of emissions, installs cleaning devices on air  ducts, and recovers alcohol content from  discharged gases in order to prevent the  microbe from spreading to residential areas.                                                              EEEnnnvvviiirrrooonnnmmmeeennntttaaalll   RRRiiissskkk   MMMaaannnaaagggeeemmmeeennnttt    In addition to ensuring compliance with environmental laws and regulations, the Kikkoman Group strives  to reduce environmental risk as part of its daily operations by observing voluntary management  standards.    20       Case Studies       Wastewater Treatment at Gunma Plant  Nippon Del Monte Corp.  At Nippon Del Montes Gunma Plant, wastewater emitted from the manufacturing process is  treated using the active sludge method. In the process, high-temperature wastewater flowing  into the regulating tank caused a problem because the rising water temperature in the tank  reduced the ability of the system to treat wastewater. To lower the temperature of the  wastewater, the heat in the wastewater of the tank was exchanged with well-water.  In another initiative, the recovery fluid from the line that had been directly discarded as  wastewater was temporarily stored in Stock Tank and fed little by little to the wastewater  treatment process, thereby reducing fluctuations in the wastewater load.   These measures have improved the wastewater treatment system at the plant.    Stock Tank    Preventing Black Mold Pollution  Kikkoman Group  At Kikkoman Group brewing plants for manufacturing soy sauce, mirin , wine and other products,  alcohol is fermented from yeast. This alcohol can sometimes leak out during the process, giving  rise to microbes that live on it, and emit black pigment. While it has been shown that these  microbes do not affect human health, they can attach themselves to some of the buildings and  trees around a plant, making them black.   The Kikkoman Group has taken steps to control the causes of these microbes and is promoting  measures to prevent black pollution. Open fermentation tanks at each plant have been replaced  with sealed type, and alcohol is recovered from within the exhaust gas, and the Group monitors  the level of alcohol in the air around the plants.      Large Fermentation Tanks (Sealed type)  21  Environmental Products Lifecycle Management  The Kikkoman Group manufactures and sells an  assortment of products, including soy sauce,  soy sauce derivative products, beverages,  ketchup, wine, and soymilk, etc. to customers  both within and outside Japan. In the process  of manufacturing these products, we consume  not only raw materials but also energy, water,  and packaging materials; and we discharge  solid, liquid, and gas wastes.  The Kikkoman Group strives to minimize the  environmental loads of its manufacturing  activities by seeking to consume less energy,  water,  and  materials  in  manufacturing  processes;  improve  efficiency  in  manufacturing and energy use; and reduce  wastes. We also attempt to reduce the  environmental  loads  of  products  after  consumption by developing and using more  readily recyclable containers and packaging  materials such as glass and plastic bottles and  cartons.

Reporting Period  April 1, 2011 - March 31, 2012    23  FY2012 Review                Environmental preservation investments    Environmental preservation investments in  FY2012 totaled 503 million, a reduction of  142 million from FY2011. The decline was  primarily due to the completion of the higher  pollution mitigation investments associated  with addition of a new filling facility at  Kikkoman Food Products Noda Factory.    Environmental preservation expenses    Environmental preservation expenses in FY2012  totaled 2,253 million, an increase of 94  million from FY2011. The increase was  primarily due to an increase in resource  recycling expenses related to industrial waste  at Kikkoman Food Products.    Environmental preservation benefits     Environmental preservation benefits in FY2012  totaled 49 million, a reduction of 88 million  from FY2011.   The decline was primarily due to a fall of  market price of CO2 in the Nikkei-JBIC Carbon  Quotation Index, a decline from \1,471.5/t-CO2   in FY 2011 to 431.3 /t-CO2 in FY2012.  Ignoring the conversion to the monetary value,  the CO2 emissions of the environmental  preservation benefits in FY2012 totaled  131,799t-CO2, an increase of 37,902t-CO2 from  93,897t-CO2 in FY2011.

In order to supply safe  products to our customers, we rigorously  examine quality assurance based on corroborative  evidence in every process, from ingredient  selection to the final product stage, as part  of a robust food safety system.  At the same time, we emphasize providing  customers with products that inspire peace of  mind. At the Kikkoman Group, we believe that  peace of mind comes from building relationships  of deep trust by communicating the safety of  our products in an easy-to- understand manner.  In short, we strive to improve customer  satisfaction by assuring product safety and  customers peace of mind.     Quality Assurance for the Purpose of         Providing Safety and Peace of Mind          The Kikkoman Group pursues a range of quality  assurance activities conceived to provide  safety and peace of mind. Our quality assurance  examinations  extend  from  the  product  development stage to ingredient production  sites, processing, manufacturing, sterilization,  product packaging, and labeling based on Food  Sanitation Act and Act for Standardization and  Proper Labeling of Agricultural and Forestry  Products. We also examine product patentability  along with trademark and related regulations,  and the Quality Assurance Committee only  approves the manufacture of a new product after  it passes examination.     Systems for providing safety to customers    The Kikkoman Group Quality Assurance System    Following its October 2009 conversion to a  holding company based organization, the  Kikkoman Group has been pursuing quality  assurance activities under the direction of  the Kikkoman Corporation Quality Assurance  Department. Quality assurance departments  have been established at each Group company,  and we strive to provide safe products and  services that comply with all applicable laws  and reflect the principle of social fairness  through the activities of the Quality  Assurance  Committee  and  Group  Quality  Assurance Coordination Committee.     FFFooorrr   OOOuuurrr   CCCuuussstttooommmeeerrrsss    In addition to providing safe and high-quality products through product quality assurance  activities, we utilize feedback from customers in initiatives to improve customer satisfaction.    Kikkoman Groups Quality Assurance Flow    26  Quality Assurance Committee    Kikkoman established the Quality Assurance  Committee in 1986 with a membership consisting  primarily of department heads and top  management in order to spearhead efforts to  ensure the safety of the companys products.  The committee was reorganized in October 2009  to cut across the Group horizontally, with  participation from managers from research and  legal  affairs  departments;  production  administration,  sales,  and  product  development departments at Kikkoman Food  Products Company and Kikkoman Beverage  Company; ingredient procurement departments  and the Kikkoman Consumer Center at Kikkoman  Business Service Company; and quality  assurance departments at all Group companies.  We will continue to pursue Group-wide quality  assurance activities in an effort to enact  Group quality policies and guidelines;  address issues; and supply safe products and  services that comply with all applicable laws  and reflect the principle of social fairness.                                         Initiatives to Enhance the Groups Quality  Assurance System    In order to enhance our quality assurance  activities, the Kikkoman Group Quality  Assurance Liaison Committee was launched in  October, 2009. The Committee members strive to  improve their quality assurance system through  discussions such as: issues that each company  face, finding common problems among the group  companies as well as responses to the problems,  actions to the current events, responses to  revised  laws/regulations,  and  sharing  information about incidents. Also, the  committee further improves the network among  the group companies overseas to build better  global quality assurance system.         Group Quality Assurance System  27  Quality Assurance Department    In 1985, Kikkoman became one of the first food  industry companies in Japan to establish a  Quality Assurance Department. Since then, the  department has adopted the customers  perspective as it conducts rigorous quality  assurance reviews of all processes from  ingredient procurement to product sales from  the standpoint of assuring safety, legal  compliance, and social fairness. Products that  do not pass these reviews, which form the  lynchpin of Kikkomans quality assurance  program, are not brought to market. Kikkoman  Corporations Quality Assurance Department  also serves as the secretariat of the Quality  Assurance Committee. Working with individual  Group  companies  quality  assurance  departments, the department strives to provide  safe products and services that customers can  use with confidence and peace of mind.     Quality Assurance in the Product              Development Phase                                        At Kikkoman, using safe ingredients and  materials is a top priority in ensuring food  safety. We track country of origin information  on all of our ingredients and materials and  thoroughly examine them for safety and legal  compliance, covering the following areas:     Kikkomans Process for Verifying  Ingredient Specifications                    Investigating and Verifying Allergens    When any of the 7 ingredients legally required  by the Food Sanitation Act to be listed on  labels  as  known  to  cause  allergic  reactions or any of the 18 ingredients for  which listing is recommended are used in a  product,  we  specifically  list  those  ingredients on product packaging. We also work  to increase the reliability of our allergen  labeling by conducting voluntary inspections  of ingredients as necessary.     Ingredients legally required or  recommended to be listed on labels                  Checking the Safety of Ingredients and  Materials Made from Beef    To address the issue of BSE (bovine spongiform  encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow  disease), we use only ingredients and  materials made from beef that has been verified  as totally safe. Whenever possible, we  substitute ingredients and materials that are  not made from beef.    Screening for Residual Agricultural Chemicals     Kikkoman screens all domestic and imported  ingredients and materials for agricultural  chemicals. Since 2004, we have taken the  additional step of ensuring food safety by  conducting voluntary checks for residual  agricultural chemicals contained in farm  produce, such as grains, beans, vegetables,  28  and fruits, to verify that their usage is  properly controlled. In response to the  Positive List System for Agricultural Chemical  Residues in Foods under the revised Food  Sanitation Act, we developed efficient and  accurate analytical methods in 2007 to enable  about 300 commonly used agricultural chemicals  to be analyzed at once, facilitating more  effective and reliable testing for pesticide  residues.    Use of Non-GMO (Non-genetically Modified) Produce    Kikkoman uses IP-handled*1 non-GMO marudaizu*2  (soybeans), a raw ingredient for soy sauce.  Regular voluntary inspections ensure that such  raw ingredients and materials are non-GMO  products. We have also shifted to non-GMO  products for our defatted soybeans.    *1 Marudaizu: Soybeans that are not defatting  -processed.  *2 IP (identity preserved) handling: IP handling  controls the sorting of non-GMO produce and GMO produce  in each phase of production, distribution, and  processing so that the two types of produce are never  mixed. Documentation verifies the details of these  controls.    Microbial Treatment    In order to protect our products from microbes  and ensure safety, Kikkoman carefully develop  our products and give special consideration to  proper sterilization and filling conditions.  There are a variety of microbes that affect  food products and the range of microbe  resistance derives from food characteristics.  Therefore, it is very important to adopt  sterilization methods that have been optimized  to provide maximum safety on a product-by  -product basis.   We target bacteria for sterilization depending  on the salinity, water activity, pH level, and  other characteristics of specific food  products. In addition, we use indicator  bacteria to check if they grow in the target  products as well as measuring the heat  resistance  of  bacteria  targeted  for  sterilization in each food product.   After these examinations, we determine  sterilization conditions based on judgments  concerning  compatibility  with  the  manufacturing plant, containers, and other  aspects of production.    Container and Packaging Safety and Pursuit of  Better Designs    All containers and packaging that we use are  checked to ensure that their materials and  designs meet the standards of the Food  Sanitation Act as well as our own internal  safety guidelines. Also, based on the concept  of Universal Design, we continue improving  designs of our products.    Examples of the Improved Designs  Soy sauce caps.    The soy sauce plastic bottles have newly  designed easy-to-open cap.                Also, the seal inside the cap has a better  structure that allows users to hold it more  easily.          29  Plastic Labels   With improved perforations, it has become  easier to remove the plastic labels from  bottles.    500m Fresh Soy Sauce Package  The cap of 500m Fresh Soy Sauce has hexagonal  shape, so it is easier to hold and open the cap.    1.8 Bottle with Handle  The handle has a better shape, so it is easier  to hold.    Quality Assurance in the Production Phase                Quality Assurance in the Production Phase    In order to supply customers with safe,  high-quality products, the Kikkoman Group has  received certification under the ISO9001  international quality control standard for  most of its Japanese plants. Furthermore,  Kikkoman Food Products Company manages its  production activities in accordance with a  proprietary quality control system that  combines  (1)  an  ISO9001  system  (an  international model for quality control  systems for products and services), (2) GMP  standards (standards for equipment and work  procedures at facilities that produce food  products), and (3) the HACCP concept (a  mechanism for preventing food accidents). The  company also strives to manufacture safe  products by conducting quality inspections as  necessary during each production process.    Monitoring Quality Control    Kikkoman has put in place a system for  monitoring quality control to ensure that  customers can use Kikkoman brand products with  confidence and peace of mind no matter where  in the world they are. Managers with  specialized knowledge extending beyond the  plant in which they work provide comprehensive  and regular monitoring of food product hygiene,  equipment management, and other aspects of  operation at the Groups Japanese and  overseas manufacturing plants.    Original Equipment Manufacturers  OEM   manufacture a certain amount of the Kikkoman  products.  In order to assure quality of those  products, we monitor the OEM based on our OEM  assessment sheet that consists of 70 questions.   The questions cover the following categories:  administration,  building  /  facilities,  sanitation  in  general,  raw  materials,  production, foreign materials, examination,  and shipping.  Before conducting site audits,  the OEM are requested to implement self  assessments. By comparing results of audits  and self assessments, we strive to further  improve our quality assurance system.    Traceability    Traceability refers to a condition that  products and raw materials used for specific  products can be traced by their manufacturer.  Kikkoman pursues better traceability by  strictly  controlling  raw  materials,  production and shipping.   In order to achieve a faster tracing result,  major  production  facilities  conduct  simulation trainings and confirm procedures.    Radioactive Materials    Kikkoman developed the quality assurance  system from early on to deliver safe products  and services to our customers. Soon after the  Great East Japan Earthquake, the Kikkoman  Group deployed various group-wide efforts to  deal with radioactive materials.  We confirm safety of raw materials by  30  monitoring results of radioactive material  tests conducted by the Japanese government and  local governments. Also, we confirm safety of  our products by collecting and checking  information from our suppliers regarding place  of origin and control systems. When necessary,  we analyze raw materials and water through our  own analyzer or external institutions and  ensure safety.  As necessary, raw materials, water, and  products  are  examined  for  radioactive  contamination at Kikkoman facilities or at  external institutions to ensure safety.   At Kikkoman, Environment & Food Safety  Analysis Center and/or each plant undertake  the  examinations  by  using  germanium  semiconductor detectors or scintillation  spectrometers.     System for Providing Peace of Mind to Customers    Complying with laws concerning product  labeling and truth in advertising    Kikkoman rigorously checks the veracity of  product labeling and advertising to verify  compliance with the JAS (Japan Agricultural  Standard), the Food Sanitation Act, the Act  against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading  Representations, the Fair Competition Codes,  the Health Promotion Act, the Liquor Tax Act,  the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act, and industry  guidelines. If any problem is detected, we  immediately take corrective action before  products reach the market to ensure that our  product labeling complies with these laws and  regulations.    Ensuring Social Fairness    Working from the customers perspective,  Kikkoman verifies the absence of excessive or  inappropriate claims on product packaging and  in advertisements based on internal guidelines  and other guidance.

System to Deliver our Products in a Stable Manner         The Group believes that it is our social  responsibility to deliver our products in a  stable manner.  Our plants constantly update their facilities  for smooth productions and each plant works to  obviate any chance of the accidents, which  affects our production capabilities.   Also, Kikkoman works with Sobu Logistics Corp.  to review the Groups logistics on a  continuous basis to build a faster and more  stable logistic system.  The Great East Japan Earthquake affected our  32  production and logistics capabilities, and a  supply of some of our products temporarily  stopped. Both productions and logistics were  not seriously damaged, but the Group is  introducing the BCP (Business Continuity Plan)  in preparation for the future disasters. * See  also the Management Part.     Pursuing Customer Satisfaction            Basic Approach    The Kikkoman Group is working to improve  customer satisfaction through initiatives  designed to refl ect the consumers  perspective in order to put into practice the  tenets of Kikkomans Promise as adopted in  FY2009. In the same vein, Kikkoman is seeking  to develop a shared understanding of the  customers perspective companywide through  such means as the sharing of customer  information internally and employee training.  The overall goal is to make customer feedback  an even more integral part of the Companys  management.    For Better Food Lifestyles    The Kikkoman Group believes, as a food company,  it is an important social responsibility to  deliver products and serivices with new values  and help customers enjoy better food  lifestyles.    In Japan, Kikkoman Food Products introduced a  product with a new concept, Kikkoman Sakusaku  Taberu Koubashi Shoyu. This prudoct has a  distinctive feature of Umami from freeze-dried  soy sauce and rich aroma of garlics and sesami  oil.                       Kikkoman Sakusaku Taberu Koubashi Shoyu  33    Kikkoman Food Products also launched Kikkoman  Ishudemo Shinsen Shiboritate Nama Shoyu. All  Soy Sauce prudycts are heat-treated except  Nama Shoyu. Nama Shoyu has a rich aroma and a  bright color, but it needs to be refrigirated  for sotrage. This product, however, can be  stored at room temperature for 90 days. Another  feature of this product is its easy-to-squeeze  bottle. The bottle is squeezable, so it is  possbile to pour soy sauce drop by drop.                    Ishudemo Shinsen Shiboritate Nama Shoyu    In markets overseas, we introduced gluten-free  soy sauce in the U.S. and Europe for those who  are allegic to gluten.                        Gluten-Free Soy Sauce in the U.S.                Delivering new and healthy food experiences    The Kikkoman Group is undertaking product  developments and campaigns to promote health  of our customers through food.  In 2011, Kikkoman Food Products expanded its  Less Sodium Soy Sauce product line as well as  introducing healthy recipes through less salt  diet campaings. Kikkoman Soyfoods also  launched a campaign to introduce soy milk  recipes.  In markets overseas, as well as introducing  Japanese food, we also promote fusion recipes  that feature both soy sauce and local  ingredients. In many countries, Japanese food  continues to be popular and recognized as  delicious and healthy food. We hope to  contribute to our customers all over the world  by promoting Japanese food and soy sauce.    Kikkoman Consumer Center    Kikkoman has established the Kikkoman Consumer  Center(KCC) to serve as the primary channel  through which the Company communicates with  customers. The Center strives to provide  accurate, speedy, and heartfelt service to  customers in accordance with a basic policy of  Speed, Precision, and Sincerity.Questions  and comments received from customers are  stored in a database that is utilized  companywide in order to help provide speedy,  accurate service and to take full advantage of  customer feedback as a management resource.  Furthermore, customer feedback is summarized  and shared internally with executives,  managers, and supervisors nationwide in the  form of weekly reports. Participation of the  Kikkoman Consumer Center in the Quality  Assurance Committee helps bring customer  feedback to bear in our efforts to both improve  existing products and develop new ones.  34  CS Improvement Committee    Not all comments and suggestions received from  customers can be dealt with by the Kikkoman  Consumer  Center  alone.  The  Customer  Satisfaction (CS) Improvement Committee,  chaired by top management and counting  departmental officers as its members, takes  care of inquiries that fall beyond the scope  of the Centers responsibility in order to  improve the Companys products and services.                          CS      How Kikkoman Acts on Customer Feedback                            Customer inquiries at the KCC                 FY  Total  comments  inquiries  suggestions  2007  22,446  1,432  19,249  1,765  2008  24,343  1,234  20,958  2,151  2009  25,552  1,711  21,869  1,972  2010  25,839  1,665  21,271  2,903  2011  32,450  1,823  27,929  2,698    35   Basic Approach                                             The Kikkoman Group has a basic policy of  respecting every employees human rights  in the belief that a company can fare well  only when its employees lead healthy and happy  lives. Under this policy, we believe in  employees potential, avoid practicing or  condoning unlawful discrimination, ensure  equal opportunity, and pursue fair employment  practices.                                                                   Respect of Human Rights                 The Kikkoman Group Code of Conduct states, We  respect personalities and individualities,  foster mutual understanding, and stamp out  discriminations based on prejudices. We make  fair evaluations in the treatment of  employees. Managers at the Kikkoman Group  submit an annual promissory letters to the CEO  pledging their compliance with the Kikkoman  Group Code of Conduct.  In 2001, Kikkoman announced our participation  in the United Nations Global Compact(UNGC).  The ten principles of the UNGC set forth in the  Global Compacts Human Rights and Labor  Standards sections are fully compatible with  those stipulated in our Labor Agreement,  Working Regulations, and Labor-Management  Joint Declaration.    Training for the Managers  Every year, Kikkoman conducts a management  training program for all managers. This  training program focuses on roles and measures  as managers and helps managers to develop  further understanding of compliance including  human rights, employee management, and proper  performance reviews. In FY 2012, 177 managers  took this program.    Preventing Harassment  Kikkoman regards sexual harassment and abuse  of power (bossing) as human rights  violations and prohibits them in the  Companys  working  regulations.  Human  resources departments are responsible for  preventing and handling harassment issues, and  we have opened counseling offices at major  worksites. Furthermore, we continue to raise  employee awareness of this issue through  activities such as training programs for  managers and supervisors.    FFFooorrr   O OOuuurrr   EEEm m mpppllloooyyyeeeeeesss    In addition to respecting the diversity of employees and supporting their efforts to improve their   skills, we strive to create safe, pleasant workplaces that facilitate employee self-fulfillment.    The Number of Employees March, 2012  New hires (non-consolidated basis)  *Includes temporary employees.  36   Emphasizing Fairness and Employee                   Independence in Human Resources           Kikkomans human resources system employs an  ability based grading process that comprises  several subsystems, including human resources  utilization,  training  and  education,  performance reviews, and compensation. Each  employees individual performance is reviewed  under a goals-and-objectives system whereby  supervisors conduct interviews with their staff.  Prior to the interviews, all supervisors are  required to receive assessor training in order  to ensure the fairness of reviews. We strive to  support  employees  individual  career  objectives through self-assessment, a Career  Development Program (CDP), and a Career  Challenge Program, all of which allow employees  to develop their skills and make their own  decisions when applying for new positions within  the Company. Moreover, to ensure fairness across  the entire human resource management system, we  have created a Human Resource Management  Verification Committee comprising labor union  and management representatives, and the Human  Resources Department periodically conducts  interviews of individual employees in offices  and plants in Japan and overseas to monitor   implementation of the system. Human Resource Development for the Global Market    The Kikkoman Group is working to develop human  resource for the global market. This means to  help our employees develop skills that can be  displayed both in domestic and foreign markets.  The set of skills includes communication,  leadership,  intercultural  adjustments,  expertise, physical strength, and optimism.   As a part of our program, we have training at  overseas affiliates for a select group of  mid-career employees. We also employ foreign  staff to develop diversity. They nurtured as  candidates for managers.   Human Resource Management System      37  Nurturing Better Work Environment             Work-Life Balance    In order to support and encourage employee  efforts to achieve a healthy balance between  rewarding work and fulfilling private lives,  Kikkoman has implemented a set of Company  -developed support programs designed to create  an environment whereby employees can make the  most of their abilities in a healthy and vital  manner. We introduced childcare leave 10 years  before its enactment in law and family care  leave 20 years before its enactment in law.  In  2009,  Kikkoman  received  Kurumin  certification from the Ministry of Health,  Labour and Welfare, authorizing the companys  use of the Kurumin logo in accordance with the  Act on Advancement of Measures to Support  Raising  Next-generation  Children  and  recognizing it as a company that actively  works to support raising next-generation  children.                Flexible Work Arrangements (Kikkoman)                                                              38   Diversities                      Promoting Employment of People with  Disabilities    Kikkoman believes in creating a work  environment in which people with disabilities  can keep their jobs based on the principle of  normalization the concept of creating a  society in which able-bodied and disabled  people can live and work together on equal  terms. Accordingly, we are actively creating  barrier-free work environments for all  employees. In FY2012 the proportion of  employees with disabilities at Kikkoman  Corporation and Kikkoman Food Products Company  was 1.88 and 1.71 respectively.    Continued Employment System    In 2001, Kikkoman introduced the Senior  Employment System, which is available to those  who retire at age of 60. This system made it  possible to provide opportunities for the  object employees to exercise their skills as  well as passing on the skills of experienced  workers to younger workers.    Promoting Opportunities for Female Employees    Kikkoman promotes work environment that female  employees can work on a long-term basis and  expand opportunities for participation.  In order to help female employees come back to  their  work  after  childbirth,  Kikkoman  introduced the Childcare Leave 10 years before  its enactment in law. In FY 2012, 34 employees  including male workers applied for this  program. Since the program was introduced, 396  employees in total have applied.    Maintaining Sound Labor-Management Relationships    Under the Labor-Management Joint Declaration,  which was announced in 1998, Kikkoman has  established and maintained sound labor-  management relationships based on mutual trust  and respect. Additionally, the Company has  adopted a union shop labor agreement.    Socially Responsible Corporate Pension Management    Kikkoman has a contract-based defined-benefit  pension plan to ensure the stability of our  corporate pension fund in response to changes  in employees needs and employment conditions  in Japan.  In 2006, Kikkoman became a signatory to the  United Nations Principles of Responsible  Investment. The move marks the Companys  commitment  to  fulfilling  its  social  responsibility by incorporating environmental,  social, and corporate governance issues into  investment  decision-making  and  stock  ownership practices with respect to its  pension fund.              39   Improving Employee Skills and Fostering     Career Development                       The Human Resources Development Vision    In  keeping  with  the  Human  Resources  Development Vision, Kikkomans educational  programs are designed to offer support so that  individual employees take joy in learning,  work to strengthen their specialized skills,  and continue to grow through lifelong  learning.   The Human Resources Development Vision aims to  foster the development of professionals for  the 21st century by helping employees develop  skills and grow personally so that they can  participate in their jobs in an engaged and  energetic  manner  and  contribute  to  organization innovation.    Training Programs    Kikkoman offers tier-based training for groups  such as new employees and employees in  management positions. In order to enhance the  Groups  synergy,  collective  training  programs with affiliates have been taken place. Kikkoman offers a broad range of self-  improvement training programs for employees,  including courses at business schools; My  Challenge Training, which allows trainees to  select from several courses; correspondence  courses; and e-learning courses. Through these  educational and training opportunities, we  support employees autonomous skill-building  and career development efforts.

Accordingly, the Companys Safety and Health  Committee, made up of labor and management  representatives, plays a central role in  implementing its occupational safety and  health management system (OSHMS).    Promoting Safety and Health Activities  Kikkoman has set up the Central Safety and  Health Committee to review and determines  policies and key objectives for companywide  safety and health initiatives, and its  decisions are made known throughout the  Company. Daily safety and health activities  are undertaken through local safety and health  committees. In addition, monitoring teams  consisting  of  labor  and  management  representatives conduct periodic monitoring  inspections at both the central and local  levels, and the Company works to assess the  causes of safety and health risks and take  corrective action.  There were seven minor accidents and two  accidents resulting in work stoppages during  FY2012. We remain committed to strengthening  efforts to eliminate accidents by applying  risk assessment practices companywide.  In order to further improve the Groups  Safety and Health standards, the Group held two  joint meetings that the domestic affiliates  discuss and share safety and health issues.  Through these efforts, the Group is working to  prevent future accidents.

Safety and Health Management Organization (Kikkoman)  41  Efforts by the Affiliates Overseas    The Group is working on improving safety and  health system at our affiliates overseas. At  KFI, KFE, and KSP, each company forms their  Safety and Health Committee and strives to  improve effectiveness of the safety and health  system.   All of our affiliates overseas provide with the  lectures and/or trainings regarding safety and  health as well as using proper protections  while performing job functions. The affiliates  share accident reports with the Foreign  Operations Department at Kikkoman Corp. to  avoid repeating the similar accidents.                                              Encouraging Employee Physical and Mental Well-being    Kikkoman  provides  medical  supports  to  employees. Employees who need re-examination  following their medical check-ups can receive  advice from medical nurse. The employees can  also access a health databank to check their  records of health checkup.   Kikkoman has opened a 24-hour telephone  hotline for health and medical questions in  partnership with an outside institution as  part of its ongoing commitment to helping  employees maintain good physical and mental  health. In 2011, in addition to regular medical  checkups, Kikkoman offered dental checkups,  VDT check, and immunization against influenza  by Kikkoman General Hospital.  Kikkoman works with professional institutions  to run our mental health program for our  employees and their families. By introducing  the Kikkoman Mental Health Manual, we strive  to create an environment to prevent mental  health problems. Kikkoman also developed a  guideline that describes how to treat  employees when they return to work from a leave  for mental health reasons.       Future Subject                        The Groups employees are becoming more and  more diversified as we expand our business  fields and countries of operation. Recognizing  our business environment is changing rapidly,  the Group strives to create better work  environment based on the respect of human  rights as well as developing diversified human  resources.     TOPICS     KFI-Wisconsin, the main soy sauce factory in  the United States, holds monthly meetings of  the Safety and Health Committee. The plant  manager, the vice president in charge of human  resources, six production managers, eight  representatives of the respective corporate  organizations, and two representatives from  the secretariat are the members of this  committee. During the meetings, participants  report accidents including close calls and  promote awareness to avoid accidents. Queries  and opinions from employees are also discussed  and convey safety and health information from  the secretariat.   In FY 2012, KFI-Wisconsin began a weekly  viewing of videos related to risk prediction  training.                      the Safety and Health Committee at  KFI-Wisconsin    42   Timely and Appropriate Disclosure of Information                                  Kikkoman Corporation places importance on  information disclosure and investor relations  (IR) activities that focus on fairness,  timeliness, and expeditiousness. In addition  to holding IR meetings not only in Japan, but  also in the United States and Europe, we  promptly disclose a variety of IR information  on our website for the benefit of investors who  are unable to participate in the meetings.  In FY2012, we held three meetings with  management and seven factory tours for  analysts and institutional investors. We also  held three seminars introducing the Company  for individual investors.  Going forward, we remain committed to pursuing  activities designed to promote a better  understanding of our businesses while bringing  feedback from shareholders and investors to  bear.     Promoting Open General Shareholders Meetings                     To encourage higher attendance, Kikkoman  Corporation schedules the annual general  shareholders meeting to avoid clashing with  the most common dates for other companies  meetings. Moreover, we deliver the convocation  notice and related documents to shareholders  three weeks in advance in order to allow  careful review of the agenda. We also send an  English-language  convocation  notice  to  overseas shareholders.  Additionally, we allow shareholders to vote  online, and we participate in a voting platform  for institutional investors to make it more  convenient for shareholders to exercise their  voting rights.     Shareholder Return and Internal Reserve         Kikkoman Corporation considers the dividend  policy as one of our key management issues. In  this area, our basic policy is to reward  shareholders through consistent distribution  of profits backed by strong consolidated  financial performance, while using funds to  invest in strengthening its corporate  foundation and future businesses. As a result  of this approach, the dividend for FY2012 is  15 per share.  In addition, we have a special benefit plan  for shareholders aimed at deepening their  understanding of the Kikkoman Groups  products and encouraging their ongoing  support. From a long-range perspective, we  intend to deploy internal reserves in ways  that create robust corporate value. Future  plans include investments in expanding our  international  operations,  streamlining  production facilities, conducting research  and development for new businesses, opening  and expanding markets to cultivate new demand,  and pursuing strategic investment activities.  Composition of shareholders (as of March 30, 2012)                                                     FFFooorrr   OOOuuurrr   SSShhhaaarrreeehhhooollldddeeerrrsss   aaannnddd   IIInnnvvveeessstttooorrrsss    Kikkoman strives to enhance transparency in management through timely and appropriate   Information disclosure and to secure earnings through sustainable growth that enables  appropriate  distribution of profits.        43   Credit Ratings                     Credit ratings provided by rating agencies  serve as a means of better understanding  Kikkomans financial soundness. Kikkoman  gives credit ratings an important role in  financial strategy out of recognition that  they reflect the manner in which capital  markets evaluate the Companys performance  and creditworthiness. Kikkoman Corporation  was given a rating of A (single A stable) by  Rating and Investment Information, Inc., in  Japan as of March 30, 2012. We are striving to  maintain and further improve our ratings.  44   Conducting Fair Business Transactions                                   As outlined in our Code of Conduct, Kikkomans  selection of and transactions with suppliers  are fair and based solely on vendors ability  to provide good quality, prices, and services,  and not on the personal preferences or  considerations  of  employees.  Internal  Procurement Guidelines provide a basis for the  management system that ensures that this  policy is followed. We have in place a system  for reviewing proposed business with new  suppliers against evaluation criteria and for  reevaluating existing suppliers on a regular  basis. Both of these measures ensure fair  evaluation and provide opportunities for new  suppliers. To help minimize potential risks,  we procure ingredients and raw materials from  multiple suppliers.     Developing Good Working Partnerships with  Suppliers                 At Kikkoman, the Kikkoman Business Service  Company Purchasing Department plays a key role  in maintaining close communication with  suppliers in order to build and maintain fair  and good relationships. Whenever we enter into  basic contracts with suppliers for new  transactions, we explain our compliance  policies and share compliance concerns with  them. Moreover, we brief subcontractors on  Japans Act against Delay in Payment of  Subcontract Proceeds, Etc. to Subcontractors  each time an agreement is signed.     Centralized Group purchasing                     Kikkoman  Business  Service  Companys  Purchasing Department carries out centralized  purchasing by combining the purchasing  functions of domestic manufacturing companies  such as Takara Shoyu, Higeta Shoyu, Nippon Del  Monte, and Kikkoman Soyfoods. The Department  strives to carry out fair transactions with  suppliers while building mutually beneficial  partnerships.     Ensuring Ingredient Quality                Kikkoman works closely with suppliers to  ensure ingredient quality. For example, when  procuring raw farm produce, we track its  production history and conduct voluntary  checks for residual agricultural chemicals.  When procuring organic crops or non- GMO  produce as raw materials, we strive to maintain  and improve the quality of procured materials  through such measures as obtaining Certified  Organically  Grown  Food  Certificates,  investigating the country of origin, and  conducting joint inspections on IP handling.                                     Inspecting the Harvest in the U.S.     Environmental Considerations in Procurement    We also work closely with suppliers through  the container and packaging procurement  process to develop environmentally friendly  containers.  In  FY2008,  we  formulated  Guidelines for Containers and Packaging (see  page 25) to illustrate the Groups commitment  to reducing the environmental impact of  containers and packaging while improving  customer satisfaction. We ensure that our    W W Wooorrrkkkiiinnnggg   wwwiiittthhh   SSSuuuppppppllliiieeerrrsss    We strive to observe fair business practices and develop good working partnerships with   suppliers through a variety of means.      45  suppliers understand the Guidelines, and we  work with them to reduce the environmental  impact of their products.  In addition, we ask suppliers of ingredients  and raw materials to deliver them in packages  that generate less waste and require that  their delivery truck drivers shut down engines  while unloading at our facilities. In FY2012,  we made these requests of some 1179 suppliers.  When ordering ingredients and raw materials,  we work with suppliers and Sobu Logistics  Corporation to streamline truck deliveries  and reduce the environmental impact of our  operations, for example by using trucks  returning from product delivery runs to pick  up shipments from suppliers.  46   Basic Approach                                             Under the management principle of becoming  a company whose existence is meaningful to  global society, the Kikkoman Group promotes  a management that places a great value on our  relationship with local communities. We hope  to contribute to build a society that  corporations  and  communities  build  mutual-beneficial relationships.  The Group undertakes activities designed to  support society at large, primarily in the  field of food and health. We are also working  to foster an appreciation and a preservation  of Japanese food culture as well as maintaining  harmony with world food cultures.     Major Social Activities                           Supporting Employees Volunteer Activities    Kikkoman encourage our employees to engage in  volunteer activities. We have introduced  programs, such as the matching donation  program, the community service program, and  the volunteer leave programs,   Kikkoman  also  facilitates  nationwide  volunteer activities in which employees can  easily participate. They include collecting  ruined postcards and used books in support of  NGOs and NPOs, holding fund-raising drives for  charity, assisting with sales of charity  merchandise, and holding charity events to  promote interaction with NGOs.    Programs to Provide Hands-on Experiences    Kikkoman provide hands-on programs designed to  raise elementary school childrens and their  parents interest in food and nature, as well  as programs held in conjunction with NGOs and  NPOs to encourage participants to think about  international  cooperation.  Employee  volunteers help administer these programs.

Contributing to Develop Safe Communities  Kikkoman works to help communities develop  safer environments by supporting firefighting  operations and disaster-prevention activities  as well as conducting traffic safety  campaigns.    Community Outreach Programs  Kikkoman conducts community outreach programs,  including by holding events that highlight  local features, participating in traditional  community events, and opening our facilities  to the public.    Donations  Kikkoman donates in fields related to our  business activities, for example by providing  products to a Food Bank organization, offering  educational  support,  and  practicing  environmental preservation. We also donate to  a large-scale disaster relief fund.

Kikkoman General Hospital                          In Noda city, Chiba, the Kikkoman Group runs  a hospital, the Kikkoman General Hospital. The  hospital plays a significant role in providing  medical services in the local community.  Since the soy sauce brewing began in Noda city  in the 17th century, the soy sauce business had  a mutual-beneficial relationship with the  local community. The origin of the hospital  dates back to 1862 when a clinic was founded  for workers at the breweries and their families.  The  clinic  expanded  over  time  and  re-established as the Noda Hospital in 1914 in  Kami-Hanawa in Noda City.  Soon after Noda Shoyu Co., Ltd., a predecessor  of Kikkoman Corp., was formed in 1917, the Noda  Hospital became Kikkomans private hospital  in 1918. In 1973, the Noda Hospital was renamed  the Kikkoman General Hospital.  In order to further contribute to the society  and the local community through providing  medical services, Kikkoman Corp. began  construction of a new hospital in March, 2011.  The construction has completed in June, 2012,  and began operation in August, 2012.   the New Kikkoman General Hospital    49   Principal Social Activities Overseas                         North America    Kikkoman Foods Foundation Inc.  Kikkoman Foods Inc.(KFI), our soy sauce  manufacturer in the United States, established  a charitable foundation, Kikkoman Foods  Foundation  Inc.  KFI  has  donated  to  organizations such as local educational  institutions and disaster relief activities.  In 2010, KFI conveyed a portion of the plants  land to the local governmentâ€”the City of  Walworthâ€”free of charge for the purpose of  constructing a new city hall.                        Food bank initiatives in the United States  Kikkoman Sales U.S.A. (KSU), our sales company  in the United States, conducts a social  activity called Kikkoman Kares. Since 2010,  as part of this initiative, KSU has donated  food products to the food bank organizations  in the United States, contributing an  equivalent of about 200 tons in 2011.    Asia    Water purification project in Singapore  KIKKOMAN (S) PTE. LTD. (KSP), our soy sauce  manufacturer in Singapore, supports the  construction of Kingfisher Lake, located  inside Gardens by the Bay, a garden in  Singapore.  Kingfisher  Lake  has  an  environmentally friendly water purification  system that utilizes the nature within the park,  such as aquatic plants. The lake is expected  to contribute to solve water problems in  Singapore.                            Contributions to local communities by the Thai plant    Siam Del Monte Company Ltd. (SDM) produces  processed vegetable and fruit products. SDM  has provided seed for corn, which serves as a  stable source of income for farming households,  in order to support agricultural promotions in  the Trat Province of Thailand, where the plant  is located, and in the northeastern region of  Thailand. In order to have more households  participate in this program, farming trainings  were available to them as well.  When a serious flood occurred in 2011, more  than 2,000 cases of our products were donated  through local governments for people who were  affected by the disaster.    Europe    Water quality improvement project in the  Netherlands  Since 1997, Kikkoman Foods Europe B.V. (KFE),  our soy sauce manufacturer in the Netherlands,  has supported a water quality improvement  project  for  Zuidlaardermeer  (Lake  of    50  Zuidlaren) in Groningen, the Netherlands.   A unique aspect of this project is that the  water purification mechanism utilizes natural  resources. A vast water purification area is  located next to the lake, and water from the  lake is pumped to the designated area by a  windmill. After the water in the area becomes  purified by aquatic organisms and microbes,  the waster gradually returns to the late.  The windmill, which was installed by the  Kikkomans support, was named Kikkoman  Windmill.    Special lecture at Shanghai University  The Kikkoman Group opened an authentic  Japanese restaurant, Murasaki, in the  Japanese industry pavilion at Expo 2010  Shanghai China. Students from Shanghai  University participated in operating this  restaurant; eight students worked as service  staff, and five students served as cooking  assistants. These students significantly  contributed our smooth operation. In October  2010, the Kikkoman Murasaki fund was  established between the College of Foreign  Languages at Shanghai University and the  Kikkoman  Group.  This  fund  provides  scholarships and training programs in Japan  for students of high scholastic standing.  Kikkoman Special Lecture Presentations  were held twice in 2011 at the university; the  topics of the lectures were Interactions of  Food Culture and Security and Safety of  Food.   When our managing director in charge of  international business, Horikiri, presented  his lecture on April 15, 2011, at the beginning  of the lecture, messages of sympathy and  encouragement for the people affected by Great  East Japan Earthquake were given by the  students  through  an  official  of  the  university.   We will work to promote cultural interchange  between Japan and China through food.                                  Messages from students at   Shanghai University    Other regions:   The Kikkoman Group has conduced social  activities in the regions where we dont have  our affiliates or facilities. Those activities  include supporting an establishment of  elementary schools in Cambodia or supporting  activities to prevent AIDS in South Africa.        51   Basic Approach                           The Great East Japan Earthquake was an  unprecedented disaster. The people affected  by the earthquake were hurt physically and  mentally. Due to the great impact, it requires  a great investment of time for reconstruction.  The Group is supporting the restoration  efforts over the mid to long term especially  in the field of Food and Health.     Response Immediately After the Earthquake                          Employee Safety and Continuation of Operations    In the immediate aftermath of the Great East  Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011, the Group  worked to deal with the effects of the disaster  by forming a task force headquarters in  accordance with its Disaster Response Manual.  The task force determined that our priorities  were:     (1)  ensuring the safety of employees,  (2)  shipping products to the extent possible  (3)  Continuing corporate operations    In addition to assessing the status of  affiliates and related departments, the Group  undertook a series of measures.    Immediate Support Programs    Donations: Kikkoman donated 100 million to  the Japanese Red Cross Society and 10 million  to the city of Minamisoma in Fukushima  Prefecture.    Products: Working with the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, we  supplied aid in the form of about 350,000  products (worth 70 million), including canned  foods, beverages, and soy milk.  Fundraising: Funds contributed by officers and  employees at Group companies in Japan and  overseas were donated to the Japanese Red Cross  Society.     Reduction of Electricity Consumption during Summer  In response to the power shortage in the summer  2011,  Kikkoman  launched  Summer  Time  Electricity Saving Project headed by General  Manager of the Corporate Planning Division and  conducted a set of efforts.  At each production facility, nighttime  operation and staggered shifts were put in  place to avoid the peak time of electricity  consumption. R&D department worked a rotating  schedule and offices took electricity saving  measures such as setting the temperature of air  conditioners higher than usual, turning off  lights and computers.  As a result, all facilities subject to the  project successfully lowered the maximum  electricity consumption (during July 1st, 2011  to September 22nd, 2011 from 9am to 8pm week day)  by more than 15% in comparison to the same  period in the previous year.  Not only the facilities in the East Japan but  also Kikkoman Takasago Factory in Hyogo  Prefecture joined this project and lowered the  electricity consumption by more than 15% in the  same period.  In addition to these efforts at company,  considering 30% of the total power is consumed  at household, Kikkoman encouraged employees to  reduce electricity consumption at home.

In other words, we have to  respond to the trust and expectations of  society to ensure compliance.  As our business grows and operations become  more globalized, we are striving to strengthen  our compliance framework.     The Kikkoman Group Code of Conduct and        Compliance System                     The Kikkoman Group adopted the Kikkoman Group  Code of Conduct in August 2002 to codify  standards for the attitude and conduct  expected of Group employees. Since then, Group  companies have worked to ensure that the Code  is well understood and thoroughly practiced by  all personnel.  The Kikkoman Group Code of Conduct, which  commits Kikkoman employees to contribute to  the development of society by fulfilling their  work responsibilities with a sense of ethics  and mission, consists of six principles:  Securing of safety and symbiosis with global  environment, Business activities with fair and  free  competition,  Business  information  disclosure and promotion of communication,  Respect for human rights and establishment of  happy working environment , Observation of  laws and regulations in Japan and abroad and  maintenance of social orders, an Positive  social action program.

During FY2012, the Committee met a total of 11  times. Additionally, Committee members met  with standing auditors to exchange information  once in each half of the fiscal year.    The Group Corporate Ethics Hotline    The Kikkoman Group has established a Group  Corporate Ethics Hotline and made it available  for use by all employees of Group companies in  Japan. Employees are made aware of the hotline  through repeated notices in individual  companies  internal  notices,  Group  newsletters, and training sessions. We have  worked to expand the system by opening the  hotline up to use by part-time and temporary  employees starting in FY2008 and by all  domestic Group company employees following our  transition  to  a  holding  company-based  organization in October 2009.  The Group Corporate Ethics Hotline consists of  an external hotline that is managed by an  outside lawyer, a shared Group hotline that is  managed by Kikkoman Corporations Legal &  Compliance Department, and hotlines at  individual companies that are set up as needed.  Reports are received via dedicated phone line,  fax, email, and dedicated post office box. When  the office receives a report, an internal  investigation  is  conducted,  corrective  measures taken, and feedback provided to the  individual who initiated the report.

The Kikkoman Group Compliance Handbook    62   Basic Approach                                              We believe that responding effectively to the  changing business environment and maximizing  corporate value through the enhancement of  Kikkoman Group management form the true basis  for running a company with the mandate given  by shareholders. We also consider one of our  most important management priorities to be  executing sound governance in order to fulfill  our corporate responsibilities to all stakeholders.     Corporate Governance Framework                                   The Kikkoman Corporation employs a corporate  auditor system. We strive to improve and  enhance our corporate governance framework  with the aim of achieving greater management  transparency, clearly defined management  responsibility, speedy decision-making, and  stronger management oversight. In March 2001,  we introduced a corporate officer system and  transferred authority for business execution  to corporate officers in an effort to  streamline operational responsibilities and  speed decision-making and business execution.  In October 2009, we shifted the Groups  management system to a holding company  structure. Individual operational companies  will enhance their ability to create value in  line with their own areas of authority and  responsibility based on a Group management  strategy determined by the holding company,  thereby maximizing the Groups overall corporate value.     Enhancing the Corporate Governance System        Kikkoman Groups decision making standard is  specified in the Authorization Guidelines.  Through strict control of decision making  based on the guidelines, the Group ensures  proper decision makings.  In addition, through the Administrative Rules  and Regulations for Affiliated Companies,  Kikkoman  Corp.  monitors  financial  and  management conditions of its affiliates.  In order to ensure these systems are  effectively working, the Group conducts  internal audits. In FY 2012, 20 affiliates, 76  departments, and 168 offices were audited.    CCCooorrrpppooorrraaattteee   GGGooovvveeerrrnnnaaannnccceee    We continue to improve and enhance our corporate governance system while upgrading our internal  control system to ensure that operations are conducted in an appropriate manner.    Corporate Governance System (As of July, 2012)    63   Independent Outside Director and             Independent Corporate Auditor                   Appointment of Outside Directors and Outside  Corporate Auditors In June 2002, the Kikkoman  Corporation appointed outside directors and  established the Nominating Committee and  Remuneration Committee to achieve greater  management  transparency  and  strengthen  management oversight.  In fiscal 2012, three of eleven directors were  outside directors, and two of four corporate  auditors were outside auditors.  The role of the outside directors and outside  corporate auditors is to strengthen management  oversight from an objective perspective on the  basis of their wide-ranging experience and  deep insight. In addition, the outside  directors strive to increase management  transparency  by  participating  in  the  Nominating  Committee  and  Remuneration  Committee.

Accordingly, we have been making Group-wide  efforts to develop an enhanced framework for  ensuring effective and efficient operations as  well as compliance with laws and regulations.  We periodically review and update the basic  policy for Establishing an Internal Control  System that the Board of Directors adopted  in May 2006. In order to comply with the new  internal controls reporting system mandated by  the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act,  which went into effect in April 2008, we  established an Internal Control Committee and  Internal Control Department in November 2008.  To this same end, we have adopted a basic policy  concerning internal controls as they relate to  financial  reporting  and  established  a  structure for strengthening internal controls  related to financial reporting.    64   Framework to Promote Corporate Social          Responsibility                                               The Kikkoman Group believes that, in order to  promote corporate social responsibility, each  employee must understand the Groups policies  and do their tasks at their workplaces. Trough  such efforts, we work to fulfill our  responsibilities  to  stakeholders  by  practicing what we can do for society  through our business operations.  In 2005, we launched a Corporate Social  Responsibility Committee with members from  multiple departments to promote associated  initiatives. Following our transition to a  holding company-based organization in 2009, we  added representatives of domestic Group  companies (Nippon Del Monte Corporation, Manns  Wine Co., Ltd., FoodChemifa Co., Ltd., and Sobu  Logistics Corporation) to the committee.  The committee plays a central role in  communicating and promoting CSR policies and  initiatives internally, and in systematizing  the diverse CSR activities that the Kikkoman  Group has been carrying out with stakeholders.  It also works as a driving force to  continuously improve CSR-related activities  through  the  PDCA  (Plan-Do-Check-Act)  management cycle.    Framework to Promote Corporate Social  Responsibility                      In FY 2012, based on the discussions of this  committee, Kikkoman Corp. developed and  announced the Kikkoman Corporate Citizenship  Framework. The committee requested the major  affiliates in Japan to submit their targets to  achieve the three themes of the Framework. We  will work to follow up the implementations and  improve our activities.

We also have a Risk  Management Committee in place to establish an  effective risk management system and to  respond promptly to crises that could  negatively impact our business.  When a worldwide pandemic of novel H1N1  influenza struck in 2009, the Kikkoman Group  responded in accordance with a precompiled  manual. At the same time, the Risk Management  Committee  proposed  appropriate  countermeasures as events unfolded, and we  worked to minimize the effect on our business  execution by assessing employee health and  taking steps to prevent infection.  In October 2010, we adopted the Kikkoman  Group Risk Management Guideline. This is a  series of provisions addressing appropriate  management and implementations of various  risks affecting the Groups operations. We  also compiled a series of Crisis Management  Manuals as part of a larger effort crisis  management throughout the Group.

This plan involves  identifying key operations and documenting in  advance. The comprehensive efforts to maintain  and/or improve the BCP to respond to the  disasters and accidents are referred as the  Business Continuity Management (BCM).  At the Kikkoman Groups, the Corporate Planning  Department, Kikkoman Corp., is developing the  BCP, which consists of the Immediate Action  Plan headed by a task force headquarters and  the Operations Recovery Plan to continue and  restore key operations.

He has been a  recipient of the NSK Award (presented by the Japan Newspaper Publishers & Editors Association), and he was appointed  as a professor at Meiji Gakuin University in 2010. He also serves as the editor in chief of the Alterna Premium  newsletter, and in the past he has served on a social business-related committee at the Ministry of Economy, Trade  and Industry and on a BoP-related committee at the Japan International Cooperation Agency. He is the director of  the Social Business Network. His numerous published works include Striving to Be a Good CSR Company (published  by Nikkei Inc.) and Borderless CSR: Moving beyond the Boundaries of Companies and NPOs (published by Dobunkan Shuppan  Co., Ltd.).    There appears to be a strong tendency among  Japanese businesses to believe that those who do  good deeds unnoticed by others will most certainly  be rewarded with good fortune. This seems to be the  case with Kikkoman, a soy sauce manufacturer and  representative of Japanese food culture. Since its  foundation, Kikkoman has recognized that it is a  public entity and has acted accordingly.   However, my impression is that Kikkoman does not  trumpet its accomplishments. Although such a  humble attitude should, of course, be taken  positively, if a business wants to achieve a higher  level of awareness of its CSR activities, it must  communicate a certain amount of information.   Previous reports omitted some CSR information  entirely, as it was considered to be a basic part  of corporate functions. The latest report, on the  other hand, gives detailed information about  Kikkomans  initiatives  on  environmentally  friendly containers and packaging, traceability,  human rights, and work-life balance. This is a sign  of the times and reflects changes in Japanese  society.  Last year, I made some suggestions regarding  improvements to compliance education, raising  compliance awareness, and quality assurance of raw  materials. Responsive action was taken, and this  is described in detail in this years report.  Last year, I concentrated mostly on Kikkomans new  efforts on the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).  Kikkoman is known for being the first Japanese  signatory to the Compact. For this reason,  companies and the media have been watching  Kikkomans approach. It is my impression that  Kikkoman has, unfortunately, not publicized its  activities sufficiently.   Having said that, I do appreciate Kikkomans  decision to test the companys performance using  the official online Global Compact Self Assessment  Tool, which consists of 45 items based on the UN  Global Compact's ten principles. I trust this will  have a significant impact on other companies. Also,  Kikkoman has decided to have the UNGC logo on its  business cards. Although this is not described in  this years report, I recognize these as very  diligent efforts. I am interested in Kikkomans  other efforts to promote the UNGC and expect to see  this reported on in future.  I would now like to address two other issues.   Firstly, the reports Principal Activities of  FY 2011/Targets and Plans for FY 2012. This is  a good start, but I propose that Kikkoman goes a  step further. Medium-term targets should be set and  percentage attainment should be shown. I think that  setting specific targets can help break the status  quo  and  guide  employees  towards  more  forward-looking objectives.  Secondly, I would like to mention the ISO 26000  Guidance on Social Responsibility document that  was issued in November 2010 for the purpose of  facilitating sustainable progress. It was shaped  by a broad range of stakeholders from six  categories, comprising businesses, consumers,  labor  unions,  governments,  nonprofit  organizations, and experts. The economic community  in Japan believes that this will become a global  standard, and it is enhancing its activities in the  relevant areas. Using the document as a reference  and taking action accordingly: I see this as the  next item on the agenda for Kikkoman. Since this  is not a certification program and each company is  responsible for its own actions, it could be  considered a strict standard, as companies will  want to avoid having their commitment called into  question.
