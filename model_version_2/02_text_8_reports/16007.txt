The  results it achieved were largely due to a long process  of preparing for the future that involved adjustments  to its structure, staff renewal, revising its Statutes,  defining new means of governance and choosing its  leaders, while the active participation of the Board of  Trustees throughout must also be highlighted. The institution experienced the development of its  succession process smoothly and surely. In March,  the Board of Trustees adopted decisions that made  it possible to speed up and carry out this process,  thus guaranteeing the principle of gradual transition.  A Board Committee was set up and current Adminis- tration Process Leader Wagner Veloso was chosen as  the future Dean. The next step was for the current  Dean and the Executive Directors to work together  with the future Dean by sharing responsibilities and  defining new roles and functions, and so most of the  transition process had already been carried out by  December/2011. From a governance point of view,  therefore, the transition process can be pointed out  as the years main achievement. Another highlight: FDC posted its best economic-fi- nancial performance in its history. Operational reve- nues stood at R$ 159.4 million, which means a 20%  increase over the amount budgeted for the period  (R$ 132.8 million) and a 28.3% increase in relation to  2010. The budgeted surplus of R$ 8.246 million rea- ched R$ 11.487 million, and all educational solution  families surpassed their goals. The effort made to in- crease revenues by 20% did not lead to a significant  increase in administrative expenses, as they grew by  only 5% - less than the inflation rate for the period.  Furthermore, it should be stressed that the final net  result was achieved together with increased invest- ments in market development, in knowledge, and  mainly in people (from R$ 11.239 million in 2010 to  R$ 19.877 million in 2011), and despite having to ab- sorb the financial impact that stemmed from changes  made to employee registration procedures, as per  Brazilian labor laws.  It is also necessary to highlight some events that  happened along the year, such as the FDC 35-year  celebrations. A Mass in Thanksgiving was celebrated  at the Aloysio Faria Campus by Board of Trustees Pre- sident Cardinal Dom Serafim Fernandes de Araujo,  and about 1.2 thousand friends, clients and partners   Annual Report . Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 11 celebrated the institutions anniversary at Palcio das  Artes. On that occasion, a group of collaborators di- rected by local theater director Pedro Paulo Cava pre- sented a skit telling the FDC story, which showed the  inner soul, the feeling of belonging, and the capacity  to excel that can be found within the FDC organizatio- nal environment.  The year 2011 was also remarkable for advances  made in corporate responsibility actions, thus rein- forcing our commitment to contribute towards de- veloping society. Besides in-house actions that deal  with the environment, several other social actions  were taken to support various institutions. The Dig- nity Project was set up as an initiative that aims to re- duce social inequality by supporting businesses and  ideas that will help to break up the cycle of poverty  and generate income for underserved communities.  This projects conception represented the challenge  to find the correct formula to express the FDC will,  which is linked to its institutional mission, while  achieving a relevant degree of originality.  Still within the scope of social actions, it is important  to stress the actions carried out at Jardim Canad - a  community near the Aloysio Faria Campus -, the su- pport offered to Escola Municipal Dom Orione, in Ja- boticatubas (MG), the growth of the Partnership with  Social Organizations (POS) program, and the launch  of the 10,000 Women Program in Rio de Janeiro, whi- ch attests the trust the Goldman Sachs Bank places  in our performance. Furthermore, the Social Innova- tion Roots Project, which aims to develop and build  the skills of 16 to 18-year-old collaborators, brought  about relevant results for its young participants and  made the internal community proud to see those  boys and girls facing challenges, trying to develop  themselves, and building their own paths.  FDC still pays close attention to the internationaliza- tion process. We have carried on with the Brics on  Brics Program, in partnership with schools from Chi- na, India and Russia, and we hosted the 3rd Interna- tional Advisory Board Meeting together with the 3rd  International Conference. Participants from different  countries attended the event to discuss the develop- ment of emerging countries.    It is not easy to present a brief report on the main  facts that were important to an institution over the  previous 12 months, mainly because, just as it ha- ppens in Nature, what we are harvesting today was  planted long ago. When faced with such a challenge,  excellence is the best word we find to sum up FDC.  The 35-year cycle that ends in 2011 was crowned by  the valuation of the FDC brand, a feat achieved thanks  to the image of respect that was built in the market- place and by FDCs being recognized as an institution  that is relevant to society.  However, we should note that since the beginning of  its activities in 1976, when it was still at the Extension  Center of the Catholic University, up to the time it con- solidated itself as one of the main business schools in  Brazil and in the world, FDC has always taken a path  that expresses its conviction that the idea of building  a cathedral is a permanent one. It will never be fini- shed, because as Guimares Rosa taught us: All that  has gone before is but the beginning of what is yet to  come.

Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 19 INTRODUCTION The Annual Report publishes the main actions FDC has carried out and the results  it has achieved throughout 2011. It presents economic and management data as  well as initiatives undertaken as regards corporate responsibility actions. This report  was compiled from interviews and workgroup conversations with different leaders  within the institution, who highlighted the information that was relevant to their  respective areas during the year.  The first chapter of the report points out information related to the educational  solutions developed by FDC, the second one deals with knowledge generation, and  the third one displays the institutions economic-financial performance. The fourth  chapter aims to allow readers to learn about how FDC is managed, about its prin- ciples, and about the main activities it develops within its different areas such as  training, quality of life, infrastructure and marketing. The fifth chapter is reserved  for institutional issues, and it highlights corporate governance, internationalization,  events hosted during the year, FDCs presence in the media, and others. The sixth  and final chapter reports information about the FDC Sustainability Committee, an  institutional group that is directly linked to the FDC Presidents office, and about  social innovation and volunteering projects. It is important to highlight that the 2011 Annual Report expresses the commitment  FDC has undertaken as regards transparency, and it is part of its efforts to carry out  a dialogue with its different stakeholders. Furthermore, this material has become  an important management tool insofar as while it is being prepared it has allowed  the institution to identify the advances it has made and the challenges it has faced  through its actions.   20 PROFILE FDC is an autonomous, nonprofit business school created in 1976. It  dedicates itself to developing executives, companies and public ma- nagers, thus preparing them to face the constant challenges posed by  the corporate world. Based on shared experiences and on jointly-built  knowledge, FDC offers dynamic and differentiated educational solutions  that aim to develop managers who will act critically and strategically wi- thin organizations and who will also disseminate sustainable value to  their businesses and to society. FDC maintains alliances with interna- tional institutions that contribute to developing solutions and to identi- fying worldwide trends that can be incorporated into its business. Over  the last five years, more than 120 thousand executives and hundreds  of organizations have attended FDC programs. These programs can be  split into customized solutions, open and postgraduate programs, and  business partnerships. mISSION To contribute to societys sustainable development through the edu- cation, training and development of executives, business people and  public managers.

FDC is the best-placed Latin America institution among  the 50 that have been ranked by the English newspaper and remains  within the select group of renowned business schools such as HEC  Paris (France), Iese Business School (Spain), IMD (Switzerland) and  Harvard Business School (USA).   The Executive Education Ranking published by the Financial Times  every year consists of a combination of two listings: open programs  and customized programs. FDC customized programs were ranked in  3rd place in 2011, as they gained 5 positions in relation to the previous  year.  FDC open programs were ranked 10th, one place below their  position in 2010. { }  Annual Report . Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 23 America Economia Ranking  For the second year running FDC was ranked the best businesses school in Latin America according to the  AmericaEconoma magazine Executive Education ranking.    The ranking considered 4 main dimensions: the richness of the programs it offers, the quality of its faculty, the  scope of its clients and the institutions international network. ACCREDITATIONS The Association Of  Mbas - AMbA   The FDC Executive MBA focuses on business management and it has been accredited by The Association of  MBAs (Amba) since 2005. FDCs AMBA accreditation was renewed for a further 3 years in 2010 (up to 2013).  During this time, FDC must present 2 progress reports to AMBA. The first one was forwarded in December and  the next one will be delivered in May, 2013.  AMBA is an organization that is headquartered in London (England) and it accredits the best MBA programs in  the world through quality standards while encouraging the exchange of knowledge, ideas and good practices  among the important international business schools that make up its membership. { } { }  24 European Quality Improvement System - EQUIS   FDC is accredited by the European Quality Improvement System – Equis –, a renowned international  as- sessment and accreditation system for college-level institutions in the fields of company management and  administration. It is managed by the European Foundation for Management Development – EFMD -, which  confers recognition on international business schools. EQUIS re-accredited FDC for another 3 years in 2010, that is, up to 2013. During this time, FDC must present  2 reports to point out the improvements that are being implemented during this period. The first report was  forwarded in May, 2011. PARTICIPATION AND  COmmITmENT By following the guideline of its mission to contribute to the sustainable development of society by building  the skills of executives, FDC has signed the Global Compact, a UN initiative to engage the business world in the  building of a more stable, egalitarian and inclusive market, thus generating a prosperous society and ensuring  stable development.   There are 2 other UN proposals that speak directly to FDC as a business school that develops leaders for the  future: the Globally Responsible Leadership (GRLI) and the Principles for Responsible Management Educa- tion (PRME). These guiding documents were developed with the collaboration of FDC and of other business  schools. Such participation expresses a commitment to implement the Global Compact, but it would not be enough  if it were not translated into actions. FDC has worked to transform its internal processes, to engage its colla- borators and to give them a chance to develop themselves, and to complement its offer of programs while  constantly updating practices and concepts and aligning them to the needs put forth by society and by the  business world to business leaders. { }  26 PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE  mANAGEmENT EDUCATION  (PRmE) Principle 1  Purpose: We will develop the capabilities of students to be future generators of sustai- nable value for business and society at large and to work for an inclusive and sustaina- ble global economy.

The program is based on a differentiated and innovative methodology  and format in which an organizations management is observed and reviewed from different and  unusual points of view: the arts, biology, history, economics, anthropology, philosophy and cuisine.  The lectures and workshops brought together 380 senior executives from different fields who took  upon themselves to enhance their repertoires and innovate in the ways they look at business chal- lenges.  Lower paper usage, disposable cups replaced  by biodegradable ones, and the adoption of  sustainable management concepts in program  content. These are some of the actions that  have been implemented in the Open Progra- ms to conform to the institutions Sustainability  Committee guidelines.  The programs now use  electronic media by a making previous reading  and complementary reading material available  in flash drives. For example, each STC Program  participant received a tablet with the teaching  material, thus eliminating paper usage throu- ghout the program.  STC participants work with their iPads during the program. MARKET WG  32 1.1.1   INTERNATIONAL OPEN  PROGRAmS Six international executive open programs were hosted: Brics on Brics - Capturing Growth in New Realities,  in alliance with the Moscow School of Management – Skolkovo (Russia), the Indian School of Business – ISB  (India) and Fudan University (China); High Performance in Leadership: the person dimension, with Esade  (Spain); Integrated Business Strategies for Latin America Program, hosted with Itam (Mexico), Universidad de  San Andrs (Argentina) and Universidad Del Desarollo – UDD (Chile); the Advanced Management Program –  PGA and the Strategic People Management Program – GEP, with Insead; and the Skills, Tools & Competencies  – STC Program, with Kellogg. All told, 198 participants attended International Open Programs in 2011. 1.2 CUSTOmIzED PROGRAmS These are tailor-made educational solutions that take into account each organizations identity, its the levels of  competence, its plans and objectives. In 2011, FDC ran 25 international programs that hosted 16,608 executi- ves from 219 companies, 76 of them new clients. Throughout the year, FDC developed two projects to enhance these programs processes and delivery quality.  The Associates Project aims to value FDC associates who develop programs in several Brazilian States and to  BRICS on BRICS Program participants, managers and professors.  Annual Report .

The other  project created sustainability indicators that will be followed up on throughout the programs. These indicators  will lead to greater control as regards, among others, expenses with material, recycling, responsible leader- ship development and social responsibility initiatives that will align them to the sustainable principles and the  benefits to society that have already been adopted by FDC.  Furthermore, a satisfaction survey was carried out with clients who attended FDC Customized Programs. About  25 companies answered the questionnaires – which corresponds to approximately 10% of the projects de- veloped in 2011. Overall, the grades showed positive results as regards client satisfaction. The less positive  assessments are being studied and the results obtained will be used to guide project formulation for the  coming years. FDC Customized Programs are ranked the 3rd best in the world by the  Financial Times newspaper The 2011 executive education ranking published by the English newspaper Financial Times ranked  FDC Customized Programs in 3rd place among the best ones in the world. The newspaper highlighted  that FDC displays all the indicators pointed out by clients among the Top 10, including 2nd place as  regards the quality of its facilities, the level of follow-up offered to former program participants, and  the value-for-money indicator. Its Customized Programs represent the educational solution that offers the largest volume of parti- cipants and participation in financial results for the institution. The numbers available have shown  consistent and continuous growth as regards quality and the number of client companies for over three  years.   34 The 10,000 Women Program begins to train women  in Rio de Janeiro   FDC launched the first group of the 10,000 Women –Entrepreneurial Women program in Rio de Janei- ro. This Goldman Sachs Bank initiative will offer free business management training to 103 women in  the State of Rio de Janeiro. They are owners or partners in small companies who cannot afford training  in business management. The 10,000 Women – Entrepreneurial Women program will encompass concepts and practices on  marketing, finance, business strategy, people management and logistics while also contributing to- wards developing and consolidating the business plans presented by the participating companies. The  program is split into seven three-day modules. This Goldman Sachs Bank project aims to disseminate business management education to 10,000  women throughout the world. The objective is to increase the number of women who participate deci- sively in business and to contribute to improve the quality of education all over the world.

Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 37 1.3.2   mBA There were 12 MBA groups throughout the year for a total of 602 participants (315 in groups that were started  before 2011 and 287 in groups that were started in 2011) from 116 companies. These numbers prove the  growing demand for the MBA program, as the number of groups was double that of last years. The number of  candidates per vacancy available in the 2011 selection process is another indicator, as it is a record in relation  to the other periods (about 4 candidates/vacancy). A project that will deal with sustainability in programs as a Mainstream theme has been structured, and a  sustainability seal for the projects has been applied. This is an ongoing plan and it should be totally structured  by next year. Besides this initiative, the MBA program already uses oxy-biodegradable cups, and FDC aims to  introduce tablets when it delivers its products from 2012 onwards. 2009 474 558 602 2010 2011 N PARTICIPANTS  38 Revitalizing the  MbA The revitalization of the MBA curriculum has brought in new content and methodologies and a new  way to offer distance learning (DL) education. The revitalized structure has organized the program  into three large blocks: Organization and Society, Organization and Management, and Organization  and the Person, all of them distributed into six classroom modules. Each of the three blocks is wra- pped up by a Simulation and a Business Project. The five groups that began their studies in 2011  already follow this curriculum. 1.3.3   POST-mBA Post-MBA is a program run in alliance with the Kellogg School of Management to complement the FDC Cor- porate Executive MBA and it is only open to the latters former participants. The program is taught by Kellogg  professors in the United States and it lasts for six days during which advanced topics in Marketing, Leadership  and Negotiation are discussed. This alliance between FDC and Kellogg has made it possible for the Post-MBA  to be tailored to be the ideal complement to the FDC program. The program was carried out in November at  the Kellogg School of Management in Illinois, USA, and it was attended by a group of 54 participants. Besides that, FDC hosted 3 international Post-MBA groups for a total of 109 participants from Johns Hopkins  University, Skolkovo and ISB.

Gross operational  results increased by 16% over the forecast budget, as it rose from R$  48.21 million to R$ 57.82 million, which means a positive variation of  20.5% when compared to the margin achieved last year. 3  Annual Report . Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 59 The budgeted surplus of R$ 8,246 thousand reached the amount of R$ 11,48 thousand. Excellent real growth  in operational revenues was a determining factor in achieving such a result, as such revenues increased by  over 20% for the second year running. All educational solution families surpassed their goals as regards revenues and margins. Administration expenses expanded by only 5%, despite efforts to deliver revenues 20% above the amount  budgeted for the year. Thus, it was possible to lower the percentage of administration expenses from 26.12%  to 22.8%.  As regards expenses with the development of products, people and organizational knowledge, R$ 5,4 million  more than the amount that had been originally planned were invested. Such investment represents 38% over  the original amount, which came to R$ 14,4 million. The resources invested in granting scholarships and in social actions also surpassed the amounts that had  been planned, and they amounted to R$ 2,137 thousand. For the second year running, this number repre- sents an increase of over 40%. The 2011 economic-financial performance was carried out positively in all its items as regards planning, and  its objectives were met with an expressive gap (surplus).  60 OPERATIONAL SURPLUS   (R$ milions)  OPERATIONAL REVENUES   (R$ milions) 2009 95,4 mi 124 mi 159,4 mi 2010 2011 2009 7,3 mi 10 mi 11,5 mi 2010 2011  Annual Report .

The Internal Covenant spells out FDCs expectations  as regards its collaborators behavior and attitudes, thus guiding their  actions and interactions. The year 2011 was remarkable for actions that aimed to broaden and  strengthen the FDC team by hiring professors and project managers,  carrying out training sessions and holding technical meetings. It was  also the first time a customized program was prepared and offered to  the FDC team. Thus, it was possible to notice a positive and collabora- tive organizational climate throughout the year.   4  Annual Report .

The institutions Administrative Staff encompasses 220 collaborators while the  remaining 101 belong to the Technical Staff.  The FDC Faculty is divided into categories that reflect how often a professor works on FDC programs and pro- jects. There are professors who teach only at FDC (full time), associate professors (who teach part time), guest  professors (who teach at specific moments, according to program demand), and visiting professors who will  teach full time for a specified period, although they are linked to another institution.  The FDC Faculty includes  22 professors who have done postdoctoral research, 100 Doctors, and 242 Masters. A new category was created, assistant professors, who are researchers who work together with DL and the  Knowledge Development Centers, and who help develop new educational solutions while also teaching clas- ses. Four full-time professors were hired this year for the following fields: Sustainability, Marketing, Public Or- ganizations and Economics. Furthermore, two project managers and a pedagogue from the Pedagogic Center  moved to the faculty as full-time professors. Three faculty meetings brought together 131 participants. The meetings were attended by the directors, and  the fundamentals that support the FDC way of doing business were shared by all.   FDC strives to value diversity and offer equal opportunities by encouraging respect for human rights and diffe- rences, and its staff of collaborators seeks to express such concerns. As of December 2011, FDC employed five  handicapped collaborators, and the institution has made efforts to increase this number in conformance with  Law nbr. 8.213/911 , which sets out the percentage of jobs organizations must offer to handicapped people.  FDC has partnerships and agreements with entities that work to build the skills of handicapped people and  bring them into the labor market. Thus, FDC seeks to enhance its process to select and hire new collaborators.  Women hold 70% of the management positions available (management and supervision) – 59 out of 84. The- re is no salary differentiation by gender. The difference in the average salary between men and women can be  explained by the kinds of functions they perform and the average salary paid by the market. It is important to  stress that women have been increasingly holding more management positions at the institution.  66 Faculty present in 2011 Professor Category Total Full-time Professors  28 Full-time Assistant Professors 4 Associate Professors  127 Guest Professors  450 Visiting Professors  5 Professor-Managers 19 TOTAL 633 Collaborators per facility  Aloysio Faria Campus  274 85% So Paulo Office 16 5% Belo Horizonte Office 31 10% Total 321 100,0% Collaborators in numbers Level of Schooling   Administrative Staff Technical Staff Total 5th grade complete 1 0% 0 0% 1 0% Basic-level complete 3 1% 0 0% 3 1% High school complete 15 7% 0 0% 15 5% College-level complete  111 50% 8 8% 119 37% Postgraduate complete 40 18% 26 26% 66 21% Masters complete 1 0% 49 49% 50 16% Doctorate complete 0 0% 14 14% 14 4% Post Doctorate complete 0 0% 1 1% 1 0% Total 220 100% 101 100% 321 100% Gender  Administrative Staff Technical Staff Total Women 155 (70%) 57 (56%) 212 Men 65 (30%) 44 (44%) 109 Total 220 101 321  Annual Report .

The amount of R$ 4,180,413.70 was spent in 54 development  actions (shared among internal customized, open FDC and technical development) to benefit 322 people.  There are several different kinds of development opportunities and training for professors and collaborators: sharing activities that are oriented and promoted by the Pedagogic Staff  scholarship grants for the institutions programs; scholarship grants for language studies; participation in technical events, seminars and conferences, etc.  A specific program for the group of new project managers was run for the first time. It aimed to promote  integration between managers and leaders while also presenting educational solutions and methodologies as  well as the FDC mission, its business and its principles. Two training programs that were based on listening, services, and on identifying day-to-day gaps and needs  were developed exclusively for FDC Executive Coordinators and Supervisors. The first one was launched last  year and it was attended by 68 participants. The program was divided into seven modules that presented  themes such as the FDC Portfolio, explained the interface areas with coordination, and expounded on self- knowledge, business, strategy, organization and management. The Basic Program for Supervisors was atten- ded by 22 participants and it aimed to enhance these professionals skills by developing competencies such  as leadership, processes and results. The Technical Staff Basic Development Program hosted two groups for a total of 69 participants that included  project managers, coordinating managers and functional managers. There were three meetings, an Annual Technical Staff Meeting, and three general meetings in which the  institutions senior management shared results and perspectives. These training sessions and alignment activities that encompass all FDC collaborators show the principle of va- luing people in practice and makes it possible to identify gaps in activities and leadership while also promoting  the organizations development as a whole.   70 FDC creates the Administrative Staff basic Program The Administrative Staff Basic Program (PBNA) was created to build common knowledge - the same assump- tions, the same knowledge, the same language - based on the competencies, the challenges and the roles of  the Administrative Staff collaborators. The program was built on the journey metaphor, as its various modules  represent stops to refuel and to exchange experiences, the start is the moment each one stands at in ones  professional life, and the finish line is a place that is forever under construction. The Program developed two groups (37 participants in the first one and thirty-two in the second one) in two  modules: The FDC Way and its business and Enhancing thinking, creating and acting repertoires and it will  go on running in 2012.  The Mainstream Education at FDC: Sustainability Cycle program was  launched in August The Mainstream Education at FDC: Sustainability Cycle program was launched in August. This program is  aimed at full-time professors and project managers and it aims to bring about reflections, subsidies – material  and content - and to share ideas to bring sustainability into each discipline. The Sustainability Assessment Tool in Educational Solutions (IASSE) tool was presented during the Cycle. It is  a tool to measure the sustainability performance of FDC programs and it will base itself on assessing two cate- gories, which have been named FDC practicing and FDC educating. These categories encompass the following  themes: Social Innovation, the Environment, Suppliers, Content and Awareness and Communication. FDC holds the Mainstream Education Program, Sustainability Cycle. ADMINISTRATION WG ADMINISTRATION WG  Annual Report .

This is one of FDCs fundamental principles, as it aims to offer an appropriate and pleasant  work environment and to care for peoples health and well-being. It is based on an analysis of services  rendered, observations and listening, market research and expense forecasts that FDC defines the benefits  policy as regards its collaborators. APASS, the Employees Association, was created in 2005. It aims to contribute to the well-being of both colla- borators and their dependants offering and managing benefits through the Quality of Life Center. It is ma- naged by three collaborators appointed by FDC and by three elected ones, and elections are held every two  years. The institution contributes 3% of its revenues to the association and collaborators contribute with 1%  of their salaries.  The following benefits were offered this year: Incentives to education APASS encourages the development and education of collaborators and their dependants by refunding them  their school fees. In 2011, this benefit was increased to 50% of the monthly fees, with no ceiling set on the  amount refunded. Thus, the investment made in enrollment and monthly fees from grade school to college  graduation for dependants, and postgraduate courses for collaborators, amounted to R$ 471,055.66. The investment made in English and Spanish language courses reached R$ 232,166.45, and 125 collaborators  took advantage of it. Refunds for school material amounted to R$ 37,301.13.  72 Quality of Life Program APASS cares about FDC collaborators health and quality of life as well as that of their dependants, and so it  invests in actions that aim to guarantee its associates greater peace of mind and satisfaction. The investment made in refunds for medical appointments, medicaments, therapy and treatment amounted to  R$ 335,944.05. The benefit for psychotherapy support was increased by 75%, with no ceiling set on the amount  refunded. Benefits to encourage the practice of physical activities were also implemented this year. There are currently  67 collaborators drawing this benefit, for a total investment of R$ 34,105.90. The investment made in refunds for dental treatment amounted to R$ 358,762.58. Health Insurance  = R$ 2.030.388,52 (639 lives) Life Insurance  = R$ 350.071,81 (322 lives) Sick Leave Compensation Complement  = R$ 39.114,46 (8 people) Emergency Loans  = R$ 138.973,30 (20 people) The Quality of Life Center set up a partnership with Hospital Srio Libans and Laboratrio Fleury, in So Pau- lo, and new agreements: beauty parlors, a law firm, and golf classes. The other benefits that were created and enhanced in 2011 were as follows: all collaborators can take advan- tage of a babysitter allowance that supports mothers up to the time a child turns six years old (a 50% refund,  up to the minimum wage); the opportunity to include spouses in the benefits plan, and a food allowance for  infants up to one year of age. For 2011, the program that makes it possible to carry out annual checkup exams at Hospital Mater Dei is now  available for collaborators who are 38 years old or over, and not 40 years old or over as it was up to last year.  This change makes it possible for a larger number of collaborators to undergo the check. FDC is also supported by the Accident Prevention Internal Committee (CIPA), which is an annually-renewed  committee that consists of employer and employee representatives. Throughout the year, CIPA carried out  several projects to preserve the health and the physical wellbeing of FDC employees and of all the people  who interact with the institution. There was a campaign to encourage seat belt use, the smoking area – an  unhealthy venue at Centro Alfa - was eliminated, and the Fire Brigade carried out drills, among other actions.  73 Relatrio Anual .

Furthermore, 208 exams were carried out, including blood pressure, glucose, and eye tests.  A total of 385 people took part in nutritional assessments, relaxing massages, Yoga classes and power walks.  There were 1,081 participations during the event.

Work was carried out to engage the internal  audience in FDCs strategic issues and so maximize management efforts.  Annual Report . Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 75 Recognition Project  To honor the collaborators that have dedicated their work to FDC for years, Internal Communication launched  the Recognition Project. From this year on, the collaborators who complete 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 years  at FDC will be honored at the end of the year General Meeting.   SOS Rio FDC carried out a campaign to help the victims of the tragedy that happened in Rio de Janeiro at the  beginning of the year. The drive encouraged collaborators to donate food, personal care and cleaning  products, bottled water, and other emergency items to the population in that area. Overall, the drive  gathered over 2 tons of material, plus R$ 8,500.00 that were used to buy staples for the victims of the  catastrophe. bone Marrow Donation A Bone Marrow Donation drive was held this year to encourage the greatest possible number of collabora- tors to join the Hemominas bone marrow bank. The drive was based on the publication of teasers and on a  lecture by a representative from the institute. After that, 80 collaborators took part in a blood donation event  at the Aloysio Faria Campus so that they would be registered candidates for an analysis as regards donation  compatibility. SOCIAL   INNOVATION WG VOLUNTEER WG  76 At 1Pm Sharp The format of the At 1pm Sharp program was changed and four events were held under the new format.  On September 6, 8 and 14, BH Office, Aloysio Faria Campus and SP Office collaborators, respectively, were  invited to attend the movie Litter Extraordinaire. The telling of the story of the recyclable material pickers  from Jardim Gramacho and of plastic artist Vik Muniz moved everyone who watched the documentary.  Photographer Elmo Alves gives collaborators some tips and launches a photography  competition at FDC. Newsletter – Following Up On The GWs The first issue of the monthly Following up on the WGs newsletter was published last June. This publication  disseminates news related to the Work Groups (WGs) that make up the FDC Sustainability Committee. The  newsletter describes the actions developed by the WGs and publishes a message written by FDC Dean Emer- son de Almeida. There were six issues in 2011.  Photography Competition The photography competition Sustainability at FDC means... aimed to promote a different gaze on sustaina- bility at FDC and to mobilize collaborators around the theme. Seventeen people competed and ten of them  were chosen as finalists. The final stage saw collaborators from the three offices vote to choose the photogra- ph that best represented the theme. About 200 people, collaborators and participants, cast their votes at the  final stage.  77 Relatrio Anual . FDC . 2011 Pink Day FDC hosted Pink Day on May 27. Pink Day is an awareness drive to remind women to undergo routine exams  that can prevent diseases such as breast, uterus and skin cancer. To mark the date, the Aloysio Faria Campus  water fountain was lighted pink, folders with buttons were handed out to female collaborators and partici- pants, and a wall display was set up at the Vive Caf area showing information about the most common kinds  of diseases that afflict women. At the So Paulo and Belo Horizonte offices the folders and the buttons were  distributed to female collaborators and the internal wall displays showed material from the campaign.   Coffee And Sweets Nine thematic parties were held during the year at all FDC units to celebrate the birthdays of all FDC collabo- rators and of employees from its partner companies. On average, 200 people attended the events held at the  Aloysio Faria Campus, while 40 people attended them at the BH Office and 10 people were present at the SP  Office. In May, the Coffee and Sweets event launched the second stage of the FDC Aware Project, which is named  Aware Consumption. The event offered a buffet with sustainable options and FDC collaborators helped to  organize a fashion show with clothes produced from several kinds of recyclable material.    Collaborators celebrate September birthdays by dancing the Frevo.  78 Dates To Celebrate The dates that were celebrated throughout the year, such as Mothers Day, International Womens Day, Eas- ter, Education Day and Fathers Day were celebrated by sending a marketing e-mail to all FDC collaborators.      The FDC Solidarity Second Hand Clothing Fair At the end of the year, FDC organized the FDC  Solidarity Second Hand Clothing Fair. The event  accepted donations for Lar Tereza de Jesus,  an institution that helps underserved cancer  patients by supplying aid and food during the  treatment. Part of the money collected will be  spent on toys for underserved children who  take part in the Generous Tree project run by  Ponto Cultural NGO.   Awareness Drive An awareness drive as regards the risks of mixing alcohol and driving was carried out the week before Carnival.  FDC In The News The Internal Communication Staff published 45 issues of the weekly publication and averaged six subjects per  issue. Furthermore, the publication displayed banners with information about internal programs and events,  such as 10,000 Women, Healthcare Week, the celebrations of FDCs 35 years, and the FDC end of the year  party.  Solidarity Second Hand Clothing Fair gathered donations for Lar   Tereza  de  Jesus. Family Lunch The Family Lunch program involves a visit to the workplace, where collaborators have lunch with their fami- lies. Family members are brought to the Aloysio Faria Campus, where they are hosted for lunch and a tour,  thus helping to bring families and the institution closer. There were three events at the Aloysio Faria Campus  in 2011.  Annual Report . Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 79 2011 FDC Christmas bazaar The 2011 FDC Christmas Bazaar was held in December. The event brought together exhibitors who offered  their products to collaborators, FDC participants and the surrounding community for two days. The enrollment  fee for the exhibitors consisted of toys they donated for the Christmas party hosted for the children who are  supported by the Generous Tree project. End Of The Year Gathering On December 17, FDC collaborators attended an event that promoted a trip around the world by offering  typical dishes from several countries and cutouts of monuments from all over the world. Collaborators donate to A Family Gathering at Christmas  Makes for a  Merry Christmas and make underserved  communities happy. A Family Gathering At Christmas  Makes For A Merry Christmas  In partnership with Ser para Crescer, a project coordina- ted by Casa da Proviso NGO, FDC organized a solidarity  drive named A Family Gathering at Christmas Makes for a  Merry Christmas to encourage collaborators and partici- pants to distribute gifts to 140 children and their families.  On December 23, the NGO hosted a Christmas supper for  the families of the children supported by the organization  and distributed the gifts collected by FDC.   80 4.2  INFRASTRUCTURE FDC now occupies two floors at the So Paulo Office building, as it has rented the 10th floor. The space now  available makes it possible for FDC to expand its activities in the city of So Paulo, the main Brazilian business  hub and where a large number of its clients and partners are located. As regards the other Offices, mention should be made of the work carried out to improve and refurbish the  roofs at Centro Alfa and at the BH Office, as well as the changes made to the layouts at the offices to make  better use of the space available.  At the Aloysio Faria Campus, we should highlight the refurbishing of the  external areas and the gardens, as well as the acquisition of exotic birds and fish. These changes benefit the  well-being of both FDC participants and its collaborators. As per the guidelines set forth by the Sustainability Committee Administration WG, FDC has enhanced its sus- tainability actions in infrastructure by introducing sustainable concepts when hosting events.  One of the highlights in this area is the development carried out by the Document Publishing Center (Ced) as  regards digital books and digital material that will make printing unnecessary and so cut down on paper use.  FDC Aware  The FDC Aware program is an internal project about awareness and sustainability that aims to encoura- ge the engagement of collaborators and reduce the institutions impact on the environment.      It was created in 2010 and developed along that year, when the first stage was consolidated; the se- Waste Sorting at FDC MARKET WG  Annual Report . Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 81 cond stage was undertaken in 2011. The first stage implemented  waste sorting. Environmental blitzes are carried out every month to  check if waste disposal is being carried out correctly.  The launching of the Aware Consumption project, together with the  video Your consumption changes the world that was produced by  the Awareness Employees, made up the second stage of the pro- gram. Among its actions, we should mention the following ones:  Replacing all disposable plastic cups by oxo-biodegradable cups  at all FDC units; Reusing paper due to CEDs re-defining the layout of the mate- rials to cut down on the area used by paper; the adoption of front  and back printing as the norm at the institution; and reusing pa- per for note pads. Used paper is sent to the association of paper,  cardboard and recyclable material pickers (Asmare) so that it can  be recycled; Lower energy consumption by means of solar heating equipment  for kitchen water; Lower water consumption through changing pond maintenance  methods, as now it is not necessary to empty them out; The correct disposal of fluorescent lamps, as they are toxic and  damaging to the environment; Controlling food waste in partnership with Sodexo, whose results  are described on the chart below.

Leftovers Intake:   Leftovers-intake: this is the relationship between leftovers (skin, bones, fruit seeds) left on the trays by the  diners and the amount of food and food preparations on offer, expressed as a percentage; that is, any lefto- vers-intake analysis must take the amount produced into account. To set a goal for the leftovers-intake index  we took into account the practices adopted to cook the preparations, the complexity of the menus (number  of items served - there are currently 42 items), the distribution systems (buffet, a la carte, ready-made) used,  and the multiple services available.    Clean Leftovers: Clean leftovers: this encompasses all the food that was prepared and distributed but was not consumed, that  is, the food that was left over at the buffet or in the kitchen. Clean leftover analysis must take into account the  amount produced and the number of meals served. To set a goal for clean leftovers we must take into account  the same variables as for leftovers-intake (cooking method, menu complexity, distribution system and existing  services).  Annual Report . Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 83 A project was launched to accredit FDC suppliers and so guarantee sustainability throughout the FDC produc- tive chain. A partnership with the Petrobras Sustainability Center helped map all suppliers and rank them  according to their financial representativeness at FDC facilities. The stages of the project were also defined in  2011 and classified as follows: mapping, assessment, training and accreditation. The next step will be a ques- tionnaire to be answered by all suppliers so that FDC can understand the actions they are taking as regards  sustainability and the environment. The questionnaire will be prepared in accordance with ABNT NBR ISO  26000. As regards the Event Logistics Center, we should highlight the implementation of the self-booking system for the  ticketing system. Now that it has been implemented, users have a longer deadline to issue their tickets through  self booking with no change to the fares, which speeds the process up and raises the possibility of achieving lower  costs.

FDC already had a Microsoft  system, version 1.2, in place since 2005. A migration process to version 5.0 was carried out this year, and it is  now possible to access the system from within the MS Outlook program. Such access functionality makes it  possible to manage contacts more quickly, simply and effectively.  84 Still as regards growing ever closer to its audiences and maintaining a continuous relationship them, FDC  promotes a network of former program participants known as the Ampliar Community. The Community invol- ves over 18 thousand executives as it aims to discuss current management and leadership topics while also  promoting networking opportunities. Accordingly, it offers lectures, meetings, access to exclusive information  through the EBSCO database, a portal with debate forums between participants and professors, plus a subs- cription to DOM magazine.  Over 200 participants met this year at six meetings (four live meetings and two virtual ones) to discuss the  following themes: New Organizational Models and Leadership, with Professor Carmen Migueles. Web 2.0 and New Business Models, with Professor Lus Augusto Lobo and Professor Jos Cludio  Terra. - Brazil International Player, with Professor Paulo Resende. 2012 Scenarios and Trends, with Professor Jos Paschoal Rosseti. Virtual events: Coaching, with Professor Marta Campello. Personal Marketing, with Professor Edmour Saiani. Furthermore, in all its marketing events and actions FDC cares about good sustainability practices and takes  some important points into account: Certified wood is used to set up booths.  Plaster and paint are not used on the structures and walls of the booths. Cloth covers are used over  wood structures for built-up booths, as such covers can be reused and they cause less harm to the  environment.  The suppliers that are hired adopt good practices as regards labor laws and the correct use of residue  and waste disposal methods.  When coffee and buffet catering services are hired they must use china instead of disposable materials  and so keep from generating waste (plastic, Styrofoam cups, etc.)  Organic coffee is used at the coffee shops that are set up within FDC booths.  At smaller events, rented material is used to set up booths, as such material can be reused and can be  rented again for countless events for years on end.  The souvenirs handed out are linked to the environment concept and so they will encourage environ- mental awareness.  Annual Report .

INSTITUTIONAL 5.1 CORPORATE  GOVERNANCE The Board of Trustees approved two important decisions to guarantee  FDCs evolution. The current Dean, Professor Emerson de Almeida, will  become the president of a new governance level, the Board Commit- tee, and current Administrative Director Wagner Veloso will take over  as FDC Dean. Both will be inaugurated in April 2012. These changes  were announced by the President of the Board of Trustees, Cardinal  Dom Serafim Fernandes de Arajo, at the annual meeting that was  held in March. These changes, which were unanimously approved by the Board of  Trustees, represent the result of a long and careful process of reflec- tions that was guided by the principle of transition with continuity.  The process began in 2008 when Professor Emerson de Almeida an- nounced his decision that his current mandate would be his last one,  a decision that was also taken by Directors Mozart Pereira and Elson  Valim as regards their own mandates. 5 Prof. Emerson de Almeida congratulates Wagner  Veloso and comments on the changes approved by  the Board of Trustees.

Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 87 5.2 INTERNATIONALIzATION The 2011 FDC Annual Work Plan Two presented two strategic objectives to define this years internationaliza- tion actions: Alliances and associations to set up a global network that will facilitate FDCs internationalization  process and speed it up, and the expansion of the International Market to enable FDC to be recognized in all  executive education markets it is present in like we are in Brazil today. These guidelines have been developed  through setting up new networks, through actions taken by the International Advisory Council, and through  international programs.  5.2.1   INTERNATIONAL  ADVISORY COUNCIL The FDC International Advisory Council  was set up in 2009 to define the interna- tional strategies FDC will follow, suggest  action guidelines in several countries, and  enhance the institutions network. The  Council met for a three-day event for the  third year running, this time in So Paulo.  The opening dinner was held at the Hyatt  Hotel and was part of the FDC 35-year ce- lebrations.   The meeting of the International Advisory  Council focused on two main themes:  integration among BRIC countries and  discussing how FDC can become more  relevant within the global scenario. A to- tal of 48 out of 84 Council members were  present together with special guests such  as the ambassadors of India and China to  Brazil and Kellogg Dean Sally Blount. The   The 3rd International Advisory Board Meeting, in So Paulo Board members and their guests at the lunch that  opened the events at the Hyatt Hotel in So Paulo.  88 meeting was wrapped up by lectures that followed the same format as the previous ones, and they were pre- sented by Roberto Rodrigues (GV Agro Coordinator) and Roberto Teixeira da Costa (Member of the SulAmri- ca Board). The lecturers dealt with the Brazilian scenario and with what Brazil can do to improve its domestic  situation and become a global leader. After the meeting, all the members of the Council where invited to a dinner hosted at Palcio dos Bandeirantes  by the governor of the State of So Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin. The governor of the State of Minas Gerais, Antonio  Anastasia, Senator Acio Neves, former governor of the State of So Paulo, Jos Serra, the president of the IDB,  Luis Alberto Moreno, and others were present at the event. The International Advisory Council holds meetings abroad for the  first time In 2011, the International Advisory Council held meetings away from Brazil for the first time. One me- eting was held in New York and another one in France to bring FDC closer to its partners. The Paris  meeting happened at the same time as the Brics on Brics program was being wrapped up, and it was  attended by groups of councilors from these regions. The meeting in the US took place at the New York  Exchange, and it was attended by NYSE CEO and Chairman Duncan Niederauer and his team. 5.2.2   INTERNATIONAL  ALLIANCES  Alliances with international schools have been part of the FDC history since it was created. An alliance was set  up with Insead, France, in 1990, and another one with the Kellogg School of Management, in the USA, in 1993. The alliances have been renewed this year and FDC sees them as cooperations with multiple activities, faculty  exchanges, and research development within a preferential and bilateral relationship. The deans of the allied  schools also sit on the FDC International Advisory Council.  Annual Report . Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 89 5.2.3   INTERNATIONAL   NETWORKS AND COOPERA- TION AGREEmENTS FDC has set up the Latin America Business School Network (ENLACES) in partnership with Universidad de San  Andrs (Argentina), Universidad de los Andes (Colombia) and Universidad de Chile (Chile). The main objec- tive of this network is to develop joint knowledge creation among the institutions and so contribute to reduce  social inequality while also contributing to the regional development of companies, public organizations and  society.   The Latin America Business School Network integrates market professionals and scholars as well as executives  from both the private and the public sector and civil society representatives. Working together, they will deve- lop knowledge that can be useful for managing multi-Latin and multinational companies present in the region,  small and midsized company with great growth potential, public organizations and NGOs in Latin America. FDC also has agreements with business schools from the BRIC countries: the Moscow School of Management  – Skolkovo (Russia), the Indian School of Business – ISB (India) and Fudan University (China). This coope- ration led to the BRICs on BRICs program that aims to help multinational companies to invest and operate  successfully in these countries. The program began in 2010 and intermediate modules were held this year that  allowed participants to choose between two preferred countries. The modules took place in Belo Horizonte  and So Paulo, in Hyderabad (India), in Shanghai (China) and in Moscow (Russia), plus a wrap up module  in France.

GBSN is a nonprofit organization that integrates  business and management schools throughout the world. Its members commit themselves to offering high- quality executive education dedicated to responsible development and to collaborating to meet the challenges  executive education faces in emerging markets. As a new GBSN member, FDC can collaborate with other members within the network, with emerging markets  schools, social organizations and institutional partners, while also gaining access to the extensive knowledge  database and experience of its fellow members. Other benefits that accrue to FDC from joining GBSN are the  chance to develop leaders, to internationalize the Campus, and to align itself to the executive education model  of the future. FDC is a member of the following international organizations: The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business Executive MBA Council – AACSB Consejo Latinoamericano de Escuela de Administracin – Cladea European Foundation for Management Development – EFMD United Nations – UN (through the Global Compact and the Globally Responsible Leadership  Initiative – GRLI)  International Consortium for Executive Education – Unicon GBSN – Global Business Social Network  Annual Report .

It was held at the Grand Hyatt Hotel So  Paulo and it aimed for a deeper discussion about the factors that could halt the growth dynamics the BRIC  countries registered in the last decade, while also debating possible solutions to maintain this positive sce- nario in the coming years. The cooperation agreement to set up the ENLACES Network was signed during this  conference.  Among the panel members at the conference, we should mention New York Stock Exchange CEO Duncan  Niederauer, Luis Alberto Moreno, President of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and former Se- nator Marina Silva. The event was  split into three sessions: Economy  (macro) – the risks that involve  emerging economies; Enterprise  – the challenges that involve emer- ging economies; and Society – the  concerns of emerging economies  societies.  The leaders of Latin American schools sign the ENLACES agreement.

FDC was present at the EFMD Meeting for Deans & Directors General meeting at EMLyon Business School,  in Lyon, France. About 300 deans, functional directors and EFMD staff members took part. The main themes  that were discussed dealt with trends, change and innovation at business schools around the world, the chal- lenges posed by sustainability and the growth of social networks. The Annual EFM Conference, which was held  in Belgium, was also attended by an FDC representative. EFMD held the 3rd Global Peter Drucker Forum/ EFMD in Vienna, where FDC representatives discussed issues linked to sustainability and to the social aspects  involved in doing business. There was a meeting at Duke University, in the United States of America, that dealt with issues linked to exe- cutive education, healthcare, the environment and public policies. On that occasion, FDC hosted a lunch for  Brazilian students who are attending the Duke MBA program, and they talked about their experience with  executive education abroad. The agenda in the United States also involved meetings at the Kellogg School of  Management, especially with Dean Emeritus Don Jacobs, who is also the president of the FDC International  Advisory Council, meetings with members of the FDC International Advisory Council who live in the USA, and a  meeting with Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) President Luis Alberto Moreno. The international alliance with Insead was also dealt with through meetings at the French schools headquar- ters, where representatives from both schools assessed their joint programs and initiatives and identified  future alliances.  FDC attended IFERA – Family Business Forum in Colombia, where it presented the case study Laboratrio  Hermes Pardini: the professionalization of a family business from Minas Gerais. The institution was also pre- sent at the UNICON Directors Conference, East Meets West: Develop Local Talents with Global Perspective,  in China.

Celebrations at the Aloysio Faria Campus began with a Mass in Thanksgiving at Teatro Belgo that was said by  Cardinal Dom Serafim Fernandes de Arajo. By reflecting about the way FDC has grown and about its achie- vements, Dom Serafim highlighted how important each collaborator has been to the success achieved by FDC  throughout its 35-year existence. He highlighted the way FDC carries out its businesses, as it seeks to be rele- vant to society and grow together with its partners and clients while always maintaining a human perspective. The Mass was followed by the opening of the 35-year celebration exhibit named Brazilian Soul, a history  of the path taken by FDC. The guiding theme was based on the story and the life of orchestra conductor and  composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Afterwards, the members of the Board of Trustees sat down to lunch. A social event was held at Palcio das Artes in the evening, when collaborators, partners, company presidents  and vice presidents, and local government authorities were hosted. About 1,300 guests attended an event that  was facilitated by journalist Leila Ferreira, whose words highlighted the FDC trajectory, its values and princi- ples. A group of 17 FDC collaborators, the Mustachioed Choir, direct by Pedro Paulo Cava, performed the skit  Mapping Stakeholders The FDC Sustainability Committee Institutional GT mapped stakeholders and began to build the FDC  materiality matrix. Research was carried out with various FDC audiences to define the relevant subjects  the organization must deal with in its projects as well as in those that deal with sustainability, while  always taking into account the vision of the main stakeholders and the organizations internal vision.

The material published numbered 3,302 and  included notes, interviews, reports, articles, mentions and other editorial insertions. FDC occupied 33,580 cm  times column in the printed media, which represents 167,900 cm. This number amounts to approximately  103.6 newspaper pages in standard format, or 310.9 pages of a Veja standard magazine, which generates  spontaneous media returns equivalent to the amount of R$ 19,254,265.00.  Important efforts were made to disseminate the actions and the research efforts carried out by FDC. The  activities of these Knowledge Generation Centers, such as the Brazilian Transnational Ranking, the WEF Com- petitiveness Ranking in partnership with the World Economic Forum, the IMD Competitiveness Ranking, and  the study on the influence of driver behavior in accidents on Brazilian highways, which was carried out by the  FDC Infrastructure and Logistics Center, led to the institutions great presence in the media. Furthermore, important facts that took part during the year were broadly disseminated, such as the FDC In- ternational Conference in So Paulo, FDCs 35-year anniversary celebrations, the start of the 10,000 Women  program in Rio de Janeiro, the launch of the Dignity Project in Minas Gerais, and the Top Management Sum- mit, which was attended by Minister Fernando Pimentel. Books that were published by FDC professors were also mentioned in the media, which increased the  institutions visibility and the knowledge that was generated internally. Besides the printed, radio and television media, FDC has also been using social media to enhance its re- lationships with its audience since last year. In 2011, its presence on social networks was consolidated by  creating important channels for its brand. The FDC profile on LinkedIn was improved, its Facebook profile  migrated to fan page, Slideshare began to be used to share the knowledge the institution generates, and  Brandchannel – the Canal FDC Ideas – was set up on YouTube. FDC produces short videos to share the knowledge the institution generates and to contribute to knowledge  generation in general. These videos offer testimonials from professors, managers and experts who talk about  specific themes related to management, education, sustainability, and others. These videos are posted on the  YouTube Canal FDC Ideas, and over 20 programs were taped in 2011.

The award is offered  by Dirio do Comrcio, in partnership with FDC, and every  two years it honors managers and companies that have  stood out for relevant work they have carried out to develop  the local economy. This years event was opened by the pa- nel Responsible Competitiveness, which debated sustai- nability and its value to both companies and society. ECOLOGIC OSCAR   As an initiative undertaken by ECOLGICO magazine, the Hugo Werneck Award recognizes the merit of work  carried out in the social-environmental field and takes into account factors such as creativity, sensibility and  sustainability.  The award is based on the three main guidelines that direct the teachings of Hugo Eiras Furquim Werneck:  to know, to love and to take care of Nature. The following can compete for the award: case studies, projects,  successful experiments or initiatives by companies, citizens, public institutions (city halls, schools, etc.), entre- preneurs (hotel, resorts and ecological inns) and third-sector institutions (NGOs, foundations, etc.).  102 6 SUSTAINABILITY  AND SOCIAL  INCLUSION Sustainability at FDC is part of its business and its mission, as it takes into  account its action to contribute to the sustainable development of society  by means of educating, developing and building the skills of executives, en- trepreneurs and public managers. The development of responsible leaders  is one of the steps that must be undertaken so that capable managers can  disseminate and generate responsible value to business and to society. Intensive work is carried out at FDC to incorporate sustainable values  into the organizations day-to-day routine and so raise the awareness of  its stakeholders and engage them in a quest for solutions that will meet  their shared challenges. Sustainability at FDC corresponds not only to its  economic results but also to its social and environmental ones, and it is  linked to all its processes. Thus, its sustainable actions are mainstreamed  throughout this report and they are highlighted by the seals that corres- pond to each work group (WG).  The Social Innovation and Volunteer WGs are not linked to any specific FDC  project, and so their projects are described in this section.  The winning photograph of the Sustainability at FDC  means Photography Competition opens the chapter  on the FDC Sustainability Committee and was shot by  FDC employee Tatiana Senra.

Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 103 6.1 ThE SUSTAINABILITY  COmmITTEE The FDC Sustainability Committee underwent changes that aimed to enhance the influence of its actions  throughout FDCs fields of action. A new operational model was prepared and it created work groups (WGs)  that are guided by specific themes corresponding to the FDC shared challenges for sustainability. The creation of the Sustainability Committee carries the symbol of the oak tree. The image of this tree, strong  and full of branches, represents the FDC way and each part is a stage in the process. The roots represent the  principles that support FDC in its development. The trunk is the strong and solid part that represents the FDC  Mission and the path it should follow. The branches are the FDC shared challenges for sustainability. This year the Committee consolidated itself and advanced as regards the work groups, thus achieving internal  visibility and credibility. Based on an annual work plan, structuring projects were mapped out for each WG  according to the shared challenges that were set out. The main activities carried out by the WGs are described  throughout the report, and they surpass the limits of the plan.  104 ThE SUSTAINABILITY  COmmITTEES OPERATIONAL  mODEL Strategic Challenge: being Relevant to Society Shared Challenges Challenge 1 - Individual Responsibility (I) Encourage and support volunteer work as a citizenship practice performed by FDC collaborators;  (II) Prioritize actions whose focus is on people and organizational development through education.  Challenge 2 - Social Innovation / Opportunities for All (I) Raise awareness so that the processes, programs and partnerships come to be seen from a social innova- tion perspective; (II) Widen the scope of FDCs social actions within the community by focusing on social innovation projects.

The objective of this WG is to raise awareness so that  processes, programs and partnerships are looked at from a social innovation perspective and so that they can  enhance the social actions focused on social innovation projects that FDC carries out in the community. Among its other activities in 2011, FDC developed two very important structuring projects as regards its actions  vis--vis its strategic challenge to be relevant to society. The first one is related to the Dignity Project that launched in September, 2011, and which aims to encourage  and develop entrepreneurs who can offer innovative ideas or projects focused on reducing inequality through  their core activity but who cannot afford to pay for technical and management skills building. The project aims to reduce social inequality in Latin America, beginning by Brazil, through ideas or projects  that will generate social, environmental and economic benefits through either a product or a service. Once  such projects have been identified, they will be supported by FDC through its developing the entrepreneur  individually for one year. This year the project received 122 enrollments that were assessed according to the criteria set out. Entrepreneurs  must meet all the criteria below before they can enroll for the project: AAccess to basic needs and social impact: the final product or service  must meet the needs of the low-income population in at least one of  these strategic themes: Health, Education, Housing, Basic Sanitation,  Microcredit, Technology and/or the Environment.  Income Generation: Projects/ideas that can create jobs for low-inco- me people.  Market potential: Projects/ideas with the potential to cause great  social impact while also generating profit to entrepreneurs through  profitable models. Social Innovation: The capacity to innovate to meet needs and the low- income market.  Location: Belo Horizonte (MG) and its metropolitan area.  108 The Social Innovation Roots Project, which was also created  in 2011, aims to develop and build the skills of underserved  young people between the ages of 16 and 18. The project  seeks to broaden their view of the world, help to build and  strengthen their sense of citizenship, give them the security  they need to sail the uncertainties of the contemporary world,  and broaden their perception about the different roles they  play in society.   The project was attended by 14 ASSPROM and SELPE young  workers who are already working inside FDC. The program  consists of an 84-hour workload that is divided into six roots:  Philosophical, Brazilian, Sustainable, Scientific, Thinking and  Business. These stages happen along six weeks and each  one lasts for two days. The first day consists of classroom  activities, while the second one takes the students out to visit  museums in Belo Horizonte. The project sought to awaken their intellectual curiosity and give them access to human content and more  sophisticated fields of knowledge so that participants could learn and internalize the diversity of meanings in  the world that surrounds them. The idea was to allow them to carry out critical, ludic and creative experiments  and activities through methodologies that use art as a means to promote mainstream learning processes that  help them to carry out the activities of thinking and expressing themselves about the different content they  deal with (Sustainability, Science, Philosophy, Innovation, etc.).  Besides these actions, the Social Innovation WG has partnered the Volunteers WG to work towards the social  well-being of the Jardim Canad district residents. The district, which belongs to the county of Nova Lima-MG,  is a community near the Aloysio Faria Campus and it is indirectly influenced by FDC. The FDC Sustainability  Committee intends to unify and focus the actions undertaken by FDC in Jardim Canad and so make them  more efficient. Thus, it created the Opportunity Garden program in 2011. The program draws upon nine structuring projects  as a basis to develop the community. Young people attend the Social Innovation Roots Project at FDC.  Annual Report . Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 109 Jardim Canad Diagnostics Through structured diagnostics, FDC presented updated data about Jardim Canad demographics and social  reality in 2010 and 2011, mainly as regards the field of education. The data will be the basis for social reflec- tions about the new line of thinking for the actions FDC will undertake at Jardim Canad, and they will also  work as guidelines for other projects in the region. Opportunity Counter The Opportunity Counter is a FDC initiative in partnership with SENAC, ACH and AICJC – Jardim Canad Com- mercial and Industrial Chamber - that aims to set up a database of freelance professionals who work in the  region, such as plumbers, electricians, carpenters, masons and others. This will create a chance for these  professionals to be in contact with the dwellers, the companies and the institutions from Jardim Canad and  from the gated communities in the Nova Lima area. Professional Development Center The Opportunity Counter is an operational center for the Professional Development Center, whose objective  is to train and develop the skills of registered professionals who work in the region. This project is a partner- ship between FDC, Fundao VALE, SENAC and SENAI, and it is supported by the Jardim Canad Rotary Club.  The first training program deals with Automotive Mechanics and is being taught by the SESI/ SENAI itinerant  school. This school is a partnership between FDC and ACH – Association of Gated Communities - and it is  supported by the Nova Lima City Hall. There are 32 students attending two classes. The course workload adds  up to 160 hours (two months) and classes are being taught at Oficina Lder. PDEOS – Project To Develop Companies And Social Organizations PDEOS aims to encourage the sustainable development of the Jardim Canad district and it is based on pro- moting Responsible Management to local business and community leaders. The program aims to raise the  awareness of business leaders as regards sustainable local development by teaching them about the theme  and about the potential contributions their businesses can make, while also helping to enhance the knowled- ge and practice of responsible management within the context of social organizations.  110 A diagnosis was carried out to mobilize business leaders and to set out the projects guidelines. Two visits  to social organizations and to PAEX Jardim Canad companies were made in November to identify the main  management challenges these organizations face. The following activities were set out for the social organizations: Presenting alternatives so FDC can make management contributions vis--vis the survey that was car- ried out. Intermediating between the POS/FDC team and the community leaders who were identified as having  the potential to carry out joint actions. Following up on the assessment made by the POS/FDC team about concrete development possibilities  as regards the demands that were identified. The companies that belong to PAEX Jardim Canad were treated to an event for the associated companies  together with the Jardim Canad Commercial and Industrial Chamber. Furthermore, it was decided to bring  all the participating companies up to speed as regards the basic principles of Responsible Management and  of Local Development; to map out, by company, the potential contributions to develop the social organizations  present in the surroundings; and to follow up on the potential partnerships carried out by companies and  social organizations to assess the results of this pilot initiative. Up to December, 2011, the following organizations were enrolled in the PDEOS:   Companies: Sawae Canad Containers Prodomo Siteware  Link Preall RAD Social organizations: Casa do Jardim  Quick Cidadania  Associao Comunitria do Jardim Canad ACH / Centro de Leitura e Informao Quadrilha So Jururu  Projeto Primeiros Passos   Annual Report .

The course makes it possible for young people to work as assistants  to master restorers and thus enter the labor market. The Valor Social program is a social-cultural insertion  initiative developed in Minas Gerais, the Brazilian State where 60% of the countrys national heritage sites and  buildings can be found. Despite that, there is a great lack of specialized labor in the field of conservation/res- toration. FDC hosted 23 participants of the Qualification Course for Young People in the Field of Conservation  at the Aloysio Faria Campus, where they attended a lecture on sustainability.  Scholarship Project The Scholarship Project was launched in 2009 when it granted scholarship to an underserved participant  who lived in the Jardim Canad district. There are currently nine grantees enrolled in the FDC Specialization  programs, as four were selected in 2010 and five in 2011. FDC hosts Museu de Artes e Ofcios students.  112 Internet Access At Telecentro Max Magalhes In June, 2011, Internet access became available at Escola Municipal Dom Orione, and the launch was  attended by Board of Trustees President Cardinal Dom Serafim Fernandes de Arajo, by Professor  Emerson de Almeida, Jaboticatubas Mayor Luiz Mauro de Faria and several collaborators. Through its  Volunteers Committee, FDC supplied all the Internet structure to Telecentro Max Magalhes. This ac- tion is part of the project to support this school and it will benefit about 80 students and 200 residents  of the Capo Grosso community. Besides their now having Internet access, the 63 students from the  school who have finished the basic IT course received their diploma and also took part in a draw for  17 computers donated by FDC. My Childrens World At Fdc In 2011 Following up on the support project offered to Escola Municipal Dom Orione, from Capo Grosso, on  October 21st FDC hosted its students and teachers to celebrate Childrens Day. The event was supported  by over 30 volunteer collaborators and by five partner companies, and it offered a day of games for the  children and a study about educational issues for the schools teachers and managers. The agenda also  included workshops for the children and activities for the teachers, who worked on a plan to improve the  schools performance in the Basic Education Development Index (Ideb).  Escola Dom Orione students and teachers attend My Childrens World at FDC, together with Dom Serafim. SOCIAL   INNOVATION WG VOLUNTEER WG SOCIAL   INNOVATION WG VOLUNTEER WG  Annual Report . Fundao Dom Cabral. 2011 113 6.3 - VOLUNTEERING  FDC seeks to encourage and support volunteering as a citizenship practice by its collaborators and to prioritize  actions whose focus is on developing people and organizations through education. The Volunteers WG is  responsible for the Individual Responsibility Shared Challenge.  Thus, it supported the internal drive named SOS RIO, which offered support to the victims of the rain in that  State. In partnership with Fundao Fritz Mller, FDC organized the donation of 36 blankets and 50 pillows to  the victims of the floods in the Alto Vale do Itaja region in Santa Catarina. Furthermore, it collected and distributed books for innumerable school libraries in partnership with Lojas  Hudson, while also supporting the agenda of APAPE - The Association of Parents and Friends of People with  Special Needs by offering professionals to help teach its Course for Caregivers to People with Special Needs. FDC offered space for the team of the Providence Project to present their initiative to FDC collaborators at Vive  Caf. The project was created over 20 years ago in Belo Horizonte and it offers underserved young people two  daily meals, social/political, environmental and religious education, dental assistance, pedagogic support,  library access, leisure, singing, theater and sports. Volunteering Week Between November 28th and December 3rd the Jardim Canad community hosted the FDC Volunteering  Week activities. The agenda offered moments of interaction and exchanges of knowledge between local resi- dents and members of the FDC Volunteers Committee. As part of the Volunteering Week agenda, collaborator Alice Luttembarck tells  stories to children from the Jardim Canad community.  114 FDC Charity Thrift Shop FDC organized its charity thrift shop in 2011 and collected about R$5,000.00 that were donated to institutions  that work with underserved children in Belo Horizonte, such as Recanto do Menor, Jardim Canad, PPP - Pro- jeto Primeiros Passos, and also Lar Bela Vista, in Contagem. Besides that, a small part of the amount collected  will be used to buy material to make the layettes that Dona Maria do Carmo has sewn and distributed to  underserved people for over 40 years. 6.4  PROJECTS AND  PRINCIPLES The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was created to raise the practices of sustainability reports to a level of  quality equivalent to that of an organizations financial reports. The set of GRI guidelines and indicators leads  to information comparability, credibility, periodicity and legitimacy when communicating an organizations  social, environmental and economic performance. The Annual FDC Report is aligned to GRI guidelines and in compliance with the GRI-G3 model. A Content Index  is listed at the end of this report, and it associates the actions and initiatives developed by the institution that  correspond to the sustainability indicators suggested by GRI. Besides seeking to comply with the GRI indicators, FDC strives to align its actions to Global Compact and PRME  principles. The table below allows an overview of the initiatives developed by FDC and shows how they relate  to all these indicators and principles.  Relatrio Anual .
