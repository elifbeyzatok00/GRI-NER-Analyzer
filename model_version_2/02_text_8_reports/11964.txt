Two	of	his	 most	important	instruments	to	achieve	this	are	 continuous	improvement	and	health	promotion	 leadership.	The	term	"continuous	improvement"	 encompasses	a	number	of	measures	to	ensure	 that	Norway	Post	remains	a	robust	and	com- petitive	company.	It's	about	continuously	won- dering	how	we	can	do	things	better	and	more	 efficiently	-	being	ahead	of	the	game	and	 laying	the	foundation	for	customers	to	view	 Norway	Post	as	their	preferred	choice	in	 the	future.		 "Improvements	strengthen	profitability,	 which	again	allows	us	the	opportunity	to	re- alise	our	strategic	goals,"	says	Mejdell.	 He	emphasises	that	continuous	improve- ment	is	about	minor	and	major	improvements	 that	together	make	a	difference.			 10 11 at	the	forefront	of	health	promotion leaDership With	health	promotion	leadership	Ceo		 Dag	mejdell	wants	to	meet	both	his	own	and	others'	 requirements	for	continuous	improvement.	 01	Ceo Ceo	01  improvement:		 inCreaseD	effiCienCy The	South-East	Norway	terminal		 improved	production	efficiency	with		 a	new	internal	transport	system.			 The	system	has	contributed	to	an		 increase	in	production	of	up	to	15	000	 mail	cassettes	per	24-hour	period.		 It	is	estimated	that	the	system	will		 provide	annual	cost	savings	of		 NOK	12.9	million	and	has	been	shown		 to	have	significantly	improved		 operation	reliability. action:	Invested	in	a	new	internal	trans- port	system	that	processes	more	cas- settes	per	hour,	has	lower	operational	 risk	and	a	higher	degree	of	automation.

The	Spinnaker	programme	 is	the	biggest	and	most	important	improvement	 programme	the	Group	has	undertaken	in	recent	 years. "We	said	at	the	beginning	of	the	programme	 that	we	would	be	able	to	save	NOK	2.3	billion,	and	 the	ambition	was	three	billion.	I	believe	we	will	end	 up	somewhere	in	between.	This	is	an	unqualified	 success.	Without	Spinnaker	we	would	have	been	 unable	to	produce	the	financial	results	we	have	 achieved,"	says	Mejdell. Continuous	improvement	also	includes	a	toolbox	 used	with	great	success	in	other	industries:	Lean	 methodology.	It's	about	standardising	working	 methods	and	creating	procedures	for	how	tasks	 should	be	carried	out. "It	helps	us	think	more	systematically	about	 improvements	on	a	daily	basis,"	says	Mejdell,	who	 acknowledges	that	the	methodology	has	caused	 some	friction	in	the	Group.	 "Involving	employees	requires	their	views	to	be	 heard,	but	also	that	they	understand	that	not	all	 input	can	be	accepted,"	says	Mejdell. health promotion leadership.	In	2011	the	CEO	is	 raising	the	flag	for	"health	promotion	leadership".	 This	is	a	natural	continuation	of	his	major	focus	on	 HSE	in	his	years	as	CEO.	The	results	of	this	focus	 have	included	significantly	lower	sick	leave	rates	 and	a	constantly	falling	LTI-ratio.			 "If	you	believe	in	health	promotion	leadership,	 you	believe	that	employees	should	be	in	good	 health	-	both	mentally	and	physically.	We	shall	make	 use	of	their	competencies	and	at	the	same	time	 be	concerned	about	their	welfare.	Our	employees	 shall	know	that	as	an	employer	we	are	genuinely	 concerned	about	ensuring	that	they	are	happy	at	 work,	while	also	laying	down	specific	requirements. "As	employers	and	managers	we	must	under- stand	the	untapped	power	in	our	employees.	If	we	 make	use	of	this	,	we	can	succeed	in	many	ways,"	 believes	Mejdell.	 a good year.	In	order	to	succeed	in	the	future	it	 is	also	important	to	look	back.		In	the	CEOs	view	 2010	as	a	whole	was	a	good	year	for	Norway	Post.	 The	Group	managed	to	face	the	effects	of	the	fi- nancial	crisis.	This	was	achieved	through	actions	 including	cutting	costs	using	measures	that	were	 structural	and	long-term.	 "It	was	particularly	gratifying	that	the	market	 turned	around	half-way	through	the	year.	In	five	 of	the	last	six	months	of	the	year	we	had	higher	 revenue	than	during	the	same	period	in	the	previ- ous	year,"	says	Mejdell. The	opening	of	the	South-East	Norway	termi- nal	in	Lrenskog	marked	the	near-completion	of	 the	new	terminal	structure	which	began	in	2004.	 The	closure	of	terminals	in	Drammen	and	Hamar	 in	the	spring	of	2011	will	complete	the	restructur- ing	of	the	terminals	and	give	Norway	Post	a	good	 basis	to	meet	future	customer	requirements	and	 increased	competition. reorganisation.	Important	organisational	changes	 were	also	carried	out	in	2010.	At	the	same	time	as	 the	Logistics	segment	grew	to	become	the	big- gest	area	of	operations	and	demanded	increased	 attention,	there	was	a	need	to	strengthen	syn- ergies	across	the	organisation.	This	included	co- ordinating	transport	and	terminal	operations	for	 parcels	and	goods.	 "These	changes	make	it	much	easier	to	achieve	 a	joint	terminal	structure	and	more	coordination	 in	collecting	and	delivering	parcels	and	goods.	This	 will	produce	major	synergies	in	the	next	few	years,"	 says	Mejdell.	 Another	important	move	was	to	divide	the	Lo- gistics	segment	into	two	divisions:	Logistics	and	 Logistics	solutions.	 "The	logistics	area	became	so	large	that	it	 was	necessary	to	make	the	area	more	visible	by	 dividing	it	into	two	divisions	and	increasing	focus	 on	our	major	growth	areas,"	says	Mejdell. a demanding year.	There	were	also	some	aspects	 of	last	year	that	Mejdell	would	have	preferred	to	 have	been	different.	Despite	the	fact	that	five	 of	the	six	licence	requirements	were	met	by	a	 good	margin,	Norway	Post	was	unable	to	fulfil	the	 licence	requirement	for	A	mail. "We	are	not	satisfied	with	the	delivery	quality	 for	A	mail.	We	have	to	take	responsibility	our- selves,	but	it	was	a	demanding	year	for	postal	 delivery.	The	harsh	winter	caused	challenges	and	 we	were	also	hit	by	the	ash	cloud	from	Iceland	 and	airports	which	were	closed	at	night,"	says	 Mejdell.	 online shopping –  an important area.	Yet	despite	 the	challenges	of	last	year	Mejdell	is	not	afraid	 of	challenges	regarding	volume	or	quality	in	the	 coming	year,	because	he	has	several	cards	up	his	 sleeve.	Online	shopping	is	one	of	these.	 "The	consequences	of	increased	online	shop- ping	present	us	with	big	opportunities.	For	ex- ample,	in	November	last	year	a	record	for	parcels	 for	Norway	Post	was	set	with	an	increase	in	vol- ume	of	13	percent,"	he	explains.	 The potential is huge.	He	sees	growth	in	the	 home	delivery	of	goods	-	everything	from	small	 parcels	to	kitchens	from	IKEA.	 "I	believe	that	with	our	rising	living	standards	 we	will	find	that	more	and	more	people	are	will- ing	to	pay	for	these	types	of	services.	Norway	 Post	is	ready	to	catch	this	traffic.	We	are	a	clear	 leader	in	this	area,"	says	Mejdell. Studies	of	the	growing	online	shopping	mar- ket	have	also	led	to	the	Group	expanding	its	 range	of	services.

Mejdell	believes	the	time	is	right	for	such	a	solution	 and	that	the	potential	for	success	is	better	than	 it	was	just	a	few	years	ago.

After	a	period	 in	which	mergers	and	acquisitions	almost	came	 to	a	complete	halt	because	of	the	financial	crisis	 Mejdell	now	sees	a	change	taking	place.

We	 have	the	ability	to	carry	out	the	acquisitions	that	 are	right	for	Norway	Post,"	says	Mejdell.

Norway	Post	has	a	 clear	ambition	to	play	a	leading	role	in	environ- mental	issues	for	the	mail	and	logistics	industry.	 The	biggest	environmental	goal	the	Group	has	set	 itself	is	to	reduce	CO2	emissions	by	30	percent	 by	2015. "Due	to	the	nature	of	our	activities	we	emit	a	 lot	of	greenhouse	gases.	We	are	responsible	for	 almost	0.8	percent	of	Norway's	total	emissions.	So	 it	will	take	a	lot	of	work	but	I	am	certain	that	it's	 possible	to	reach	our	goal,"	says	Mejdell.	 He	points	to	developments	in	vehicle	and	fuel	 technology	which	will	give	Norway	Post	a	boost.	 "But	we	won't	be	able	to	achieve	more	than	we	 create	ourselves.

An	awareness	of	the	im- portance	of	corporate	social	responsibility,	with	 regard	to	both	the	environment	and	to	social	 issues,	has	led	Norway	Post	to	adopt	the	UN	Global	 Compact	initiative.	Here	large-scale,	leading	en- terprises	from	all	over	the	world	have	promised	 each	other	to	fight	for	human	rights,	workers'	 rights,	anti-corruption	and	the	environment.	In	the	 light	of	its	adoption	of	this	initiative	Norway	Post	is	 presenting		an	integrated	annual	and	sustainability	 report	for	the	first	time.

Continuous	improvements	which	 increase	customer	value	and	reduce	the	use	of	re- sources	is	a	common	denominator	for	the	devel- opment	of	the	Group's	processes,	products	and	 services. The	Group	achieved	significant	improvements	in	 profitability	in	all	divisions.	The	Spinnaker	efficiency	 programme	alone	has	helped	to	reduce	costs	by	 BNOK	1.9	since	the	program	we	started	in	2008. Operating	revenues	were	MNOK	22	451,	a	reduc- tion	of	MNOK	162,	or	0.7	percent,	from	2009.	The	 development	in	revenues	was	affected	by	falling	mail	 volumes,	the	economic	downturn	and	low	activity	in	 the	logistics	market	in	the	first	half	of	the	year,	while	 the	second	half	of	the	year	showed	signs	of	growth.	 The	Group's	focused	growth	and	development	 strategy	remains	the	same,	but	the	rate	of	expan- sion	has	been	adapted	to	the	economic	downturn	 and	this	is	why	no	new	acquisitions	were	made	in	 2010.	With	the	Spinnaker	efficiency	programme	the	 Group	has	emerged	stronger	from	the	financial	cri- sis	and	laid	the	foundations	for	further	growth	and	 new	acquisitions	in	the	future.

Norway	Post's	former	wholly-owned	subsidiary	 ErgoGroup	AS	merged	with	EDB	Business	Partner	 ASA	and	through	this	fusion	created	a	leading	Nordic	 IT	company.	The	merger	became	effective	30	Sep- tember	2010	and	Norway	Post	owns	40	percent	of	 the	new	company.		As	a	result	of	the	merger,	IT	is	 no	longer	a	separate	segment	in	the	Group,	and	for	 accounting	purposes	EDB	ErgoGroup	ASA	is	treated	 as	an	associated	company.	Pre-merger,	profits	after	 tax	for	ErgoGroup	AS,	together	with	losses	result- ing	from	the	merger,	are	treated	as	discontinued	 operations,	and	the	corresponding	figures	in	the	 income	statement	have	been	restated	accordingly.		 The	Group	structure	of	Norway	Post	was	changed	 in	2010	in	order	to	reflect	the	Group's	development.	 The	Logistics	segment,	which	is	the	largest	business	 area,	was	split	into	two	divisions,	while	the	Mail	seg- ment	was	combined	into	one	division	with	overall	re- sponsibility	for	the	market	and	operations.		 The	opening	of	Norway	Post's	new	South-East	 Norway	terminal	in	january	2010	will	contribute	to	 quicker	and	more	efficient	mail	production	through- out	 Norway.	 	 The	 South-East	 Norway	 terminal	 represents	the	best	advances	within	the	modern	 postal	industry	and	after	a	relocation	and	intro- ductory	period	operation	is	underway	as	planned.

Operating	revenues	were	MNOK	22	451	 which	was	a	reduction	of	MNOK	162,	or	0.7	percent,	 from	2009. The	Groups	operations	outside	of	Norway	had	 operating	revenues	of	MNOK	5	959	in	2010,	an	in- crease	of	1.8	percent	from	the	previous	year.		The	 proportion	of	revenues	from	foreign	operations	 represented	26.5	percent	of	revenues	for	the	 Group.	From	2003	to	2010	Norway	Post's	foreign	 operations	have	had	an	average	growth	in	revenues	 of	24.2	percent.			 The	logistics	segment	was	the	Group's	biggest	 segment	and	accounted	for	57	percent	of	external	 revenues	in	2010.	Total	revenues	from	the	logis- tics	segment	were	MNOK	13	459,	an	increase	of	 MNOK	131,	or	1.0	percent,	from	2009.	Reductions	 in	volumes	and	price	pressures	in	groupage/part	 load	and	thermo	services,	as	well	as	the	transport	 industry	strike	in	May/june,	contributed	to	the	fall	 in	revenues	in	the	first	half	of	the	year.		During	the	 second	half	of	the	year	this	trend	reversed	as	a	 result	of	increased	activity	and	a	more	positive	 market	development. The	parcels	area	had	the	biggest	growth	with	 long	distance/online	shopping	driving	development.	 Total	parcel	volume	grew	by	5.2	percent	in	2010	 compared	with	the	previous	year.		The	development	 in	volume	was	positive	for	both	cross-border	parcel	 distribution	and	B2C	and	B2B	parcels	in	Norway.		 Growth	in	online	Christmas	shopping	contributed	to	 record	parcel	volumes	in	November	and	December.		 The	Group	has	an	offensive	focus	on	growth	in	the	 parcels	area	for	the	Nordic	region	from	its	leading	 position	in	Norway	and	as	a	challenger	in	the	Nordic	 market.	Solutions	have	been	established	for	parcel	 distribution	in	Sweden	and	Denmark.		The	express	 area	achieved	increased	revenues	within	Home	 Delivery	in	Norway	and	Sweden.	Supply	service	and	 thermo	experienced	positive	developments	in	ac- tivities	in	the	second	half	of	the	year.	 In	 2010	 a	 new,	 modern	 logistics	 centre	 was	 opened	in	Berger	outside	Oslo	which	replaced	five	 smaller	warehouses	in	the	stland	area.	The	logis- tics	centre	offers	a	complete	service	to	customers	 and	shows	the	way	within	a	specialist	area	in	which	 Bring	Warehousing	is	the	leading	player	in	Norway.		 In	2011	Bring	Frigo	acquired	the	cold	storage	 operations	of	Coldsped	in	Sweden	in	order	to	sup- plement	its	range	of	logistics	services	for	the	food	 industry.		The	acquisition	expands	its	geographi- cal	presence	so	that	Bring	Frigo	gets	closer	to	its	 customers'	production	facilities	and	can	effectively	 join	together	warehousing	and	transport,	with	a	 single	point	of	contact	for	customers. The	mail	segment	accounted	for	43	percent	of	 external	revenues	in	2010.	Total	revenues	were	 MNOK	10	344,	a	decline	of	MNOK	316,	or	3.0	per- cent,	from	the	previous	year.	 Letter	volumes	fell	in	2010	as	a	result	of	the	 transition	to	electronic	alternatives	and	the	de- cline	was	strengthened	by	the	economic	down- turn.		A	and	B	mail	declined	by	7.2%	from	2009.	 This	was	partly	compensated	for	by	a	growth	in	 volume	of	unaddressed	mail	advertising	of	5.7%.		 Unaddressed	mail	advertising	accounted	for	52.3	 percent	of	letter	volumes	for	Norway	Post,	com- pared	with	49.6	percent	in	2009.	In	Sweden,	Bring	 Citymail	recorded	a	growth	in	volume	of	6	percent	 from	2009.	Bring	Citymail	Denmark	was	wound	up	 on	31.12.2009. In	2011	Norway	Post	will	launch	a	digital	post	 box,	Digipost,	which	will	be	offered	alongside	the	 traditional	post	box.		Digipost	will	make	it	easier	 to	send,	receive,	process	and	archive	mail	in	one	 digital	post	box.	 10 10 09 09 08 08 07 07 0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 Resultat etter skatt 2007 2008 2009 2010 i mill. kroner -200 0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 Resultat ett 2007 2 i mill. kroner -200 earnings	before		 interest	anD	taxes	 (ebit) in	mnoK 1630 social mission and position in Norway Through	its	business	activities	Norway	Post	is	a	 prominent	member	of	Norwegian	society.	Through	 its	licence	the	company	has	an	important	social	 responsibility	-	that	of	ensuring	the	nationwide	 operation	of	postal	services	in	a	proper	and	cost- effective	manner.	 Five	of	the	six	licence	requirements	for	delivery	 quality	were	met	in	2010.	A	harsh	winter,	ash	clouds,	 airports	that	were	closed	at	night	for	some	parts	 of	the	year	and	the	relocation	to	the	South-East	 Norway	terminal	affected	delivery	times	for	A	mail	 overnight	which	ended	at	83.5	percent	compared	 with	the	licence	requirement	of	85	percent.		 The	conversion	of	124	post	offices	to	Post	in	 Shops	which	began	in	2008	was	completed	in	2010.	 The	remaining	179	post	offices	have	also	been	 modernised	and	adapted	to	new	customer	require- ments	and	less	traffic.		 After	a	compulsory	competitive	tender	process	 Norway	Post	has	allocated	the	Post	in	Shops	ser- vice	to	1164	stores	for	the	next	three-year	period	 with	effect	from	01.07.2011.	The	new	agreements	 entail	that	just	under	10	percent	of	the	current	 Post	 in	 Shops	 will	 be	 moved	 to	 new	 stores	 by	 01.07.2011.		 Norway	Post's	reputation	continued	to	enjoy	 its	positive	trend	in	2010	and	the	Group	ended	in	 11th	place	in	Synovate's	annual	reputation	survey.		 Customer	satisfaction	also	showed	good	progress,	 particularly	for	Bring's	business	customers. Norway	Post	is	the	general	sponsor	for	Norges	 Hndballforbund	 (NHF).	 This	 collaboration	 rep- resents	an	important	activity	in	the	profiling	of	 Norway	Post	and	Bring	throughout	Norway,	while	 handball-related	activities	also	contribute	to	build	 internal	pride	and	unity	within	the	Group.	In	2010	 Norway	Post	extended	its	collaboration	with	NHF	 until	2014	to	the	tune	of	approximately	MNOK	10	 per	year.	The	Group	also	collaborates	with	the	 Swedish	handball	association	in	order	to	increase	 awareness	of	Bring	in	the	Swedish	market.	This	col- laboration	runs	until	the	end	of	2010	and	is	worth	 MNOK	1.5	per	year.	 Norway	Post's	historic	collections	and	exhibi- tions	at	the	Postmuseet	are	run	by	Maihaugen	at	 Lillehammer	in	accordance	with	an	operating	agree- ment	worth	approximately	MNOK	6	each	year. profitability The	Group's	operating	result	(EBIT)	before	non- recurring	items	and	write-downs	for	continued	 operations	came	to	MNOK	944	in	2010	which	was	 MNOK	172	more	than	in	2009,	mainly	due	to	the	ef- fects	of	cost-reducing	measures.		 The	Logistics	segment's	operating	result	was	 MNOK	400,	compared	with	MNOK	496	last	year.			 Profits	were	negatively	affected	by	the	decline	in	 volumes	in	the	first	half	of	the	year,	price	pres- sures,	the	commencement	of	operations	at	the	 new	logistics	centre	in	Berger,	delays	in	rail	delivery	 and	the	transport	strike.	However	the	effects	were	 partly	offset	by	volume	growth	for	parcels	and	 express	as	well	as	cost-reducing	measures.			Fur- ther	efficiency	measures	have	been	implemented	 to	exploit	economies	of	scale	and	ensure	improved	 profitability	in	the	future.		The	improvement	pro- gramme	includes	increased	synergies	between	the	 production	of	parcels	and	goods.	 The	mail	segment's	operating	result	was	MNOK	 786,	an	improvement	of	MNOK	188	from	the	previ- ous	year.	Profit	developments	were	positively	af- fected	by	the	comprehensive	efficiency	measures	 in	the	Spinnaker	programme.		 A	positive	effect	of	the	fact	that	Norway	Post	 has	improved	efficiency	more	than	anticipated	is	 that	the	need	for	government	procurements	of	 commercially	unprofitable	services	has	been	found	 to	be	less	than	previously	estimated.	In	accordance	 with	recalculations	for	2009	Norway	Post	repaid	 MNOK	307	to	the	Norwegian	government	in	2010.	 In	the	fiscal	budget	for	2010	MNOK	497	has	been	 allocated	for	government	procurements.	The	need	 for	government	procurements	will	be	recalculated	 10 09 08 07 01	report	of	the	boarD	of	DireCtors report	of	the	boarD	of	DireCtors	01  24 25 in	2011	to	ensure	that	compensation	is	in	line	with	 actual	costs	and	monopoly	area	profits.	 The	new	South-East	Norway	terminal	represents	 an	important	efficiency	measure.		In	2010	the	South- East	Norway	terminal	took	over	letter	production	 from	the	Letter	Terminal	in	Oslo	and	in	2011	letter	 production	from	Drammen	and	Hamar	will	be	trans- ferred	to	the	South-East	Norway	terminal.		In	this	 way	the	terminal	restructuring	process	which	began	 in	2004	will	be	complete	and	the	number	of	letter	 terminals	in	Norway	reduced	from	32	to	9	with	an	 estimated	annual	cost	saving	of	almost	half	a	bil- lion	kroner.	 For	Bring	Citymail	Sweden	the	financial	crisis	and	 geographical	expansion	in	recent	years	have	had	 negative	results.	The	company	has	carried	out	com- prehensive	profitability	measures	which	have	had	a	 positive	effect.		The	Swedish	parliaments	approval	 of	new	postal	regulations	in	2010	will	help	to	ensure	 equal	competition	in	the	Swedish	market.	 The	Group's	EBIT	margin	before	non-recurring	 items	and	write-downs	for	2010	was	4.2%	compared	 with	3.4%	in	2009.		 In	2010	the	Group	had	net	financial	expenses	of	 MNOK	139	compared	with	MNOK	226	in	2009.	This	 decline	was	primarily	due	to	lower	interest	expenses	 as	a	result	of	a	lower	interest	rate	level.	Earnings	 before	taxes	from	continued	operations	were	MNOK	 1	491	in	2010	compared	with	MNOK	22	in	2009.	The	 improvement	in	profits	was	due	to	an	improved	 operating	result,	significant	positive	non-recurring	 items	in	2010	compared	with	significant	negative	 non-recurring	items	in	2009	as	well	as	an	improved	 net	financial	situation.	The	most	important	non- recurring	item	in	2010	was	the	MNOK	759	taken	to	 income	due	to	the	transition	to	a	new	AFP	scheme	 with	effect	from	2011. In	connection	with	the	merger	between	Ergo- Group	AS	and	EDB	Business	Partner	ASA,	Norway	 Post's	ownership	share	was	valued	at	stock	market	 rates	for	the	shares	received	as	compensation	for	 the	merger.		This	led	to	an	accounting	loss	for	the	 Group	of	MNOK	817	which	is	included	in	the	entry	 for	discontinued	operations.	Profits	for	ErgoGroup	 are	included	in	the	entry	for	discontinued	operations	 for	the	period	1	january	to	30	September	2010,	and	 are	reclassified	in	the	same	way	in	the	corresponding	 figures	(see	note	26). The	Group	has	a	total	of	BNOK	2.3	in	the	balance	 sheet	related	to	goodwill	from	previous	acquisitions.	 An	evaluation	of	the	current	value	of	cash	flows	re- lated	to	the	acquired	units	in	relation	to	the	values	 recognised	in	the	balance	sheet	as	at	31.12.2010	re- sulted	in	a	total	of	MNOK	105	being	written	down	in	 2010.	MNOK	71	applied	to	the	Logistics	segment	and	 MNOK	34	to	the	Mail	segment. Total	investments	in	continued	operations	in	2010	 came	to	MNOK	651,	a	reduction	of	MNOK	417	com- pared	with	2009	as	a	result	of	the	completion	of	the	 South-East	Norway	terminal. The	return	on	invested	capital	before	non-recur- ring	items	and	write-downs	(ROIC)	was	15.8%	in	2010	 compared	with	12.4%	in	2009. The	cash	flow	from	operations	and	investment	 activities	came	to	MNOK	499	in	2010,	compared	with	 MNOK	814	in	2009.	This	change	is	mainly	due	to	vari- ations	in	accruals.	 Net	interest-bearing	liabilities	as	at	31.12.10	came	 to	MNOK	1	623	compared	with	MNOK	2	112	as	at	 31.12.2009.		As	at	31.12.2010	Norway	Post	had	a	li- quidity	reserve	that	consisted	of	invested	funds	and	 available	credit	facilities	of	MNOK	5	621	compared	 with	MNOK	4	796	in	the	previous	year.		 The	Board	of	Directors	confirms	that	the	annual	 financial	statements	are	presented	on	the	basis	of	 continued	operations	and	that	the	prerequisites	for	 continued	operations	exist.	 risk Risk	analysis	and	risk	management	are	key	aspects	 of	Norway	Posts'	corporate	governance.	In	develop- ing	strategies,	business	plans	and	goals	the	aim	is	to	 create	value	by	balancing	growth	against	profitability	 targets	and	other	risks	to	Norway	Post's	activities.	 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 Avkastning p egenkapital 2007 2008 2009 2010 25 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 Avkastning p egenkapital 2007 2008 2009 2010 25 return	on	 inVesteD	Capital in	% 	18% 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 Antall rsverk/heltidsstillinger Antall ansatte 2007 2008 2009 2010 *Antall rsverk inkl.

The	risk	analysis	is	carried	out	 as	a	comprehensive	process	in	which	all	divisions	 and	major	companies	in	the	Group	are	involved.	 Assessments	are	followed	up	with	actions	and	 recommendations	in	order	to	manage	and	control	 the	individual	risk	factors	and	avoid	events	that	 can	be	negative	for	the	Group's	operations	and	 reputation	in	the	market.	In	addition,	a	less	com- prehensive	half-yearly	follow-up	process	is	car- ried	out	to	see	the	effects	of	the	actions	taken	 and	whether	these	have	resulted	in	a	reduction	in	 Norway	Post's	risks.	Norway	Post	actively	follows	 up	the	company's	risk	exposure	with	a	focus	on	 areas	such	as	strategic	acquisitions	or	the	sale	 of	businesses,	regulatory	conditions,	competitive	 conditions,	operational	conditions,	the	implemen- tation	of	major	projects,	available	competence	and	 resources	as	well	as	developments	in	sick	leave	and	 incapacity	for	work. Risk	management	and	internal	control	process- es	are	described	in	more	detail	in	the	statement	 concerning	the	company's	principles	for	corporate	 governance,	pages	38-45. In	2010	Norway	Post	has	continued	the	meas- ures	started	in	2009	to	reduce	financial	risk	and	 increase	financial	freedom.	Discipline	in	the	use	of	 capital,	a	halt	to	acquisitions	and	a	focus	on	cost- reducing	measures	have	more	than	compensated	 for	reduced	income	in	2010.	This	has	resulted	in	 an	increase	in	equity	and	created	the	basis	for	 increased	headroom	to	implement	strategic	in- vestment.	In	2010	the	balance	sheet	was	further	 strengthened	due	to	strong	cash	flow,	limited	in- vestments	and	a	further	reduction	in	the	Group's	 receivables.	No	new	long-term	loans	were	taken	up	 during	the	period	and	surplus	profits	were	invested	 on	favourable	terms.		Credit	and	counterparty	risk	 is	deemed	to	be	limited	as	Norway	Post's	counter- parties	generally	have	high	ratings. Some	of	Norway	Post's	loan	agreements	con- tain	debt	covenants	that	limit	the	net	interest- bearing	liabilities/EBITDA	ratio	to	3.5	and	require	a	 minimum	equity	ratio	of	25	percent.		As	at	31.12.10	 net	 interest-bearing	 liabilities/EBITDA	 was	 1.0	 (down	from	1.1	in	2009)	and	the	equity	ratio	was	 34.9	percent	(up	from	28.3	percent	in	2009).	Nor- way	Post	has	also	followed	up	these	debt	cov- enants	in	2010	in	light	of	the	economic	downturn	 and	the	actions	implemented	have	resulted	in	a	 significant	increase	in	solidity	and	financial	head- room.				 Norway	Post	uses	financial	instruments	to	man- age	the	risk	associated	with	interest	rate	changes,	 exchange	rate	changes	and	changes	in	diesel	and	 aviation	fuel. The	European	Supervisory	Authority	(ESA)	has	 imposed	a	fine	of	12.89	million		Euros	(approximate- ly	MNOK	101)	on	Norway	Post.	In	addition	the	claim- ant	has	lodged	a	compensation	claim	in	connection	 with	previous	exclusivity	clauses	in	Post	in	Shops	 agreements	from	2000	-	2006.	Norway	Post	dis- putes	the	ESA	decision	and	has	brought	the	case	 before	the	EFTA	court	to	have	the	fine	ruled	invalid.	 A	bank	guarantee	has	been	given	for	the	fine. allocations In	2010	Norway	Post	recorded	a	post-tax	profit	 of	MNOK	799.			It	is	proposed	that	the	profits	be	 transferred	to	other	equity.	In	addition	it	is	pro- posed	that	a	total	of	MNOK	54.4	be	paid	as	a	group	 contribution	to	subsidiaries. Norway	Post	had	MNOK	847	in	distributable	 reserves	as	at	31.12.2010.	It	is	proposed	that	no	 dividend	be	paid	this	year.	 The	Norwegian	government	has	determined	a	 new	dividend	policy	for	Norway	Post	based	on	50	 percent	of	Group	post-tax	profits.	Before	the	 annual	dividend	is	determined	an	independent	as- sessment	of	the	Group's	financial	situation	and	fu- ture	prospects	shall	be	carried	out.	Norway	Post's	 general	meeting	is	not	bound	by	the	Board's	pro- posal	for	the	distribution	of	a	dividend. 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 2010 2009 2008 2007 01	report	of	the	boarD	of	DireCtors report	of	the	boarD	of	DireCtors	01  26 27 Corporate social responsibility Norway	Post	focuses	on	how	the	Group's	activities	 can	contribute	to	sustainable	development	in	line	 with	the	demands	of	customers	and	the	Govern- ment's	ownership	policy.	The	company's	corporate	 culture	is	characterised	by	an	active	attitude	to	 taking	social	responsibility.	A	good	reputation	will	 help	to	attract	and	motivate	employees,	strength- en	competitiveness	and	provide	increased	freedom	 to	develop	further	the	Group's	business.		Norway	 Post	became	a	member	of	the	UN's	Global	Compact	 in	March	2011.	As	a	participant	in	the	UN	initiative	 for	sustainable	development	Norway	Post	has	un- dertaken	to	integrate	ten	fundamental	sustain- ability	principles	in	its	strategy	and	operations,	as	 well	as	report	activities	and	improvements	related	 to	all	areas	with	a	social	impact,	i.e.:	the	economy,	 environment	and	social	conditions/HSE. social issues/hse Norway	 Post's	 operations	 are	 labour	 intensive.	 Health,	 Safety	 and	 the	 Environment	 (HSE)	 is	 therefore	a	high	priority	and	the	Group's	aim	is	for	 nobody	to	be	injured	or	become	sick	as	a	result	of	 their	employment.		Continuous	and	focused	work	 is	thus	underway	to	reduce	sick	leave,	the	number	 of	employees	who	are	incapacitated	for	work	and	 lost-time	injuries At	the	end	of	2010	the	Group	had	19	884	full- time	equivalent	positions	which	was	a	reduction	of	 671	full-time	equivalent	positions	compared	with	 2009,	of	which	450	full-time	equivalent	positions	 were	due	to	closed-down	operations.	Norway	Post	 reflects	the	diversity	of	today's	society	and	11%	 of	the	Group's	employees	have	immigrant	back- grounds.	The	goal	is	to	increase	the	proportion	 of	employees	with	immigrant	backgrounds	on	all	 levels.	Norway	Post	has	been	a	racism-free	zone	 since	2000	and	over	the	course	of	this	decade	has	 worked	actively	against	racism	in	collaboration	with	 Norsk	Folkehjelp	and	Postkom.	Initiatives	include	the	 marking	of	Norway	Post's	premises	with	"Racism- free	zone"	to	emphasise	that	everyone	is	welcome	 in	the	Group	regardless	of	skin	colour,	religion	or	 cultural	background.	 The	annual	organisation	survey	again	showed	 high	levels	of	satisfaction	amongst	employees	in	 2010.	For	the	last	three	years	the	employee	satis- faction	index	has	been	stable	at	75-76	points. The	Group's	sick	leave	was	7.8	percent	in	2010,	 a	decline	of	0.3	percentage	points	compared	with	 2009.	Sick	leave	was	higher	in	the	parent	company	 than	in	other	Group	companies.	The	proportion	of	 employees	who	were	incapacitated	for	work	was	1.5	 percent	in	2010	compared	with	1.1	percent	in	2009.	 To	a	large	extent	the	Group	has	directed	efforts	 towards	following	up	sick	leave	and	has	introduced	 a	good	system	and	structure	for	follow-up	on	an	 individual	basis.		 Norway	Post's	vision	is	that	nobody	shall	be	in- jured	at	work.		Efforts	to	reduce	lost-time	injuries	 have	been	concentrated	on	building	a	safety	cul- ture.		The	increased	reporting	of	near-accidents	 has	raised	awareness	of	risk	areas	and	contributed	 to	preventive	work.	26	747	near-accidents	were	 reported	in	2010	which	was	an	increase	of	32.5	 percent	from	2009.	Efforts	in	this	area	have	had	a	 positive	effect	on	the	LTI-ratio	for	the	Group.	As	a	 result	of	80	fewer	injuries	in	2010	the	LTI-ratio	was	 10	compared	with	11.6	for	the	previous	year.	The	 most	common	cause	of	injury	in	2010	was	"falling	 over"	which	represented	nearly	half	of	all	injuries	 and	these	mainly	occurred	during	the	winter	on	 slippery	surfaces. Salaries,	other	remuneration	and	accrued	pen- sions	for	executive	management	totalled	MNOK	27.7	 in	2010,	compared	with	MNOK	26.4	the	year	before. Norway	 Post's	 recruitment	 policy	 and	 tariff	 agreement	require	moderate	gender	quota	alloca- tions	to	increase	the	number	of	female	managers	 and	employees	in	male-dominated	job	categories.		 Norway	Post	is	concerned	about	equality	on	all	 levels.		This	is	why	the	company	has	examined	dif- ferences	in	pay	between	women	and	men	in	the	 75,0 77,5 80,0 82,5 85,0 87,5 90,0 Kvalitetskrav `01 `02 `03 `04 85% `05 `00 `06 `07 75,0 77,5 80,0 82,5 85,0 87,5 90,0 85% 05 06 07 09 08 04 03 02     75,0 77,5 80,0 82,5 85,0 87,5 90,0 Kvalitetskrav `01 `02 `03 `04 85% `05 `00 `06 `07 75,0 77,5 80,0 82,5 85,0 87,5 90,0 85% 05 06 07 09 08 04 03 02     Quality	of	a	mail		 in	norWay proportion	delivered	overnight	in	% 	83,5% Quality	requirement	in	accordance	with	licence 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 Norwegian	part	of	the	organisation.

The	proportion	of	women	among	 employees	in	the	Group	is	44	percent,	and	37	per- cent	among	managers.

These	 management	programmes	have	had	a	documented	 effect	in	the	form	of	greater	employee	satisfaction	 and	lower	sick	leave	in	the	units	where	the	man- ager	has	completed	a	management	development	 programme. Talent	and	employee	development	are	central	 aspects	of	the	talent	programme	and	online	train- ing.		A	new	e-learning	portal	has	been	developed	 and	includes	an	introduction	programme	for	new	 employees.	 A	common	ethical	standard	applies	to	all	Group	 employees	and	a	continuous	effort	is	underway	to	 make	this	standard	known.	The	Group	requires	its	 suppliers	and	business	partners	to	comply	with	the	 same	standard.	 In	order	to	follow	up	the	implementation	of	ethi- cal	guidelines	in	the	Group,	work	began	in	2010	on	 an	integrity	programme	which	will	continue	in	2011.	 The	programme	shall	help	to	ensure	a	high	ethical	 standard	(integrity	standard)	within	anti-corrup- tion,	 competitive	 practices,	 social	 dumping	 and	 processing	of	information. security In	2010	Norway	Post	was	the	victim	of	three	rob- beries	in	its	own	operations	and	three	robberies	 in	Post	in	Shops.	The	extent	of	other	crime	in	and	 against	Norway	Post	was	moderate	and	there	were	 no	serious	episodes	in	2010.	Norway	Post	has	good	 security	systems	and	routines	and	is	far	ahead	in	its	 use	of	modern	security	equipment.		These	security	 systems	are	maintained	and	developed	in	line	with	 developing	trends	and	the	overall	threat	picture. Although	crime	against	Norway	Post	is	moder- ate,	the	development	in	crime	in	society	in	general	 represents	a	growing	risk	for	violence	and	threats	 against	the	company's	employees	and	installations.		 ID	theft	and	post	box	theft	are	a	growing	challenge.		 Norway	Post	stays	continuously	up-to-date	re- garding	terrorist	threats	and	constantly	assesses	 the	need	for	action. Norway	Post's	contingency	plans	and	security	 work	in	the	organisation	are	continuously	improv- ing	-	particularly	in	training,	internal	inspections	and	 following	up	internal	fraud. The environment The	Group's	activities	involve	challenges	with	regard	 to	the	external	environment.	The	Board	of	Direc- tors	of	Norway	Post	therefore	emphasises	the	 importance	of	reducing	the	impact	on	the	external	 environment	and	has	decided	that	the	Group	is	to	 be	an	environmental	leader.		The	aim	is	to	reduce	 CO2	emissions	by	30	percent	between	2008	and	 2015.	(see	pages	74-81) Some	of	the	most	important	measures	to	re- duce	the	impact	on	the	climate	include	transport	 optimisation,	the	transfer	of	freight	from	air	to	the	 ground	and	from	road	to	rail,	the	use	of	alterna- tive	vehicles	and	fuel,	the	use	of	renewable	energy	 and	other	energy	efficiency	measures	as	well	as	 the	raising	of	competence	among	managers	and	 employees.	 In	2010	Norway	Post	reduced	its	CO2	emissions	 by	6	percent	and	energy	consumption	was	reduced	 by	7	percent	compared	with	the	zero-point	in	2008.		 An	increasing	volume	of	mail,	parcels	and	goods	 is	transported	by	rail	and	in	2010	Norway	Post	en- tered	into	new	agreements	for	the	purchase	of	 goods	transport	by	rail	for	approximately	2	billion	 Kroner	over	the	next	three	years.	 20 25 30 35 4 Totalt brevvolum 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 20 25 30 35 4 Totalt brevvolu 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 parCel	post	Volume million	units 	36,6 total	parcel	volume 0,7 0,9 1,1 1,3 1,5 1,7 1,9 2,1 2,3 2,5 2,7  2,9 A- og B-post Totalt brevvolum mill stk. 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 0,7 0,9 1,1 1,3 1,5 1,7 1,9 2,1 2,3 2,5 2,7  2,9 A- og B-pos Totalt brevv mill stk. 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 letter	post	Volume billion	units 	2,28 total	letter	volume total	a	and	b	mail 01	report	of	the	boarD	of	DireCtors report	of	the	boarD	of	DireCtors	01  28 29 In	Trondheim,	Norway	Post	has	switched	from	 delivery	vans	to	alternative	vehicles,	trolleys	and	 walking	routes	so	that	mail	can	be	delivered	with- out	CO2	emissions	in	the	city	centre.		This	initiative	 is	unique	in	a	European	perspective	and	equivalent	 measures	will	be	carried	out	in	additional	Norwe- gian	cities. Corporate governance The	composition	of	the	Board	was	changed	in	2010.	 New	owner-appointed	Board	members	are	Gril	 Hanns,	Randi	B.	Stershagen	and	Terje	Wold,	while	 Liv	Stette,	Terje	Christoffersen	and	Gry	Mlleskog	 left	the	Board.		Among	employee-appointed	Board	 members	Annemarie	Elstner	joined	as	a	new	Board	 member	while	Ingeborg	Anne	Stre	left	the	Board.	 In	2010	Norway	Post	established	a	Group-wide	 scheme	for	the	nomination	of	employee	represent- atives	to	the	Board	of	Directors.		Norway	Post's	 Board	is	50	percent	female. The	Board	carries	out	an	annual	evaluation	of	its	 work,	competence	and	its	working	methods	and	also	 evaluates	the	content	of	the	instructions	for	the	 Board	of	Directors	together	with	the	company's	 principles	for	corporate	governance.		In	addition	to	 being	a	decision-making	and	control	body,	the	Board	 wishes	to	be	a	valuable	discussion	partner	for	the	 company's	management	and	owner,	based	on	good	 insight	into	Norway	Post's	strategies,	value	chain	 and	processes,	combined	with	relevant	external	 competence.	 The	Board	of	Directors	emphasises	the	impor- tance	of	establishing	and	further	developing	a	high	 standard	for	corporate	governance,	equivalent	to	 Norwegian	standards	of	best	practice.	As	a	limited	 company	wholly	owned	by	the	Government,	the	 Group's	corporate	governance	is	based	on	Norwe- gian	law	and	the	Norwegian	Government's	owner- ship	policy	in	force	at	any	given	time.	 The	goal	of	this	declaration	is	to	give	those	with	 interests	in	Norway	Post	confidence	in	the	com- panys	leadership	systems.			In	2011	the	Board	has	 presented	a	statement	on	the	company's	corpo- rate	governance	which	is	available	on	the	internet:	 www.postennorge.no	(see	pages	38-39) Norway	Post	has	established	Group-wide	core	 values,	 governing	 principles	 for	 the	 Group	 and	 central	disciplines,	leadership	principles	and	ethical	 guidelines.	The	Warning	Institute	was	established	in	 2008	and	reports	to	the	Board's	audit	committee.	 No	serious	cases	were	received	in	2010.	 The	Board's	audit	committee	supports	the	Board	 in	carrying	out	its	responsibility	for	financial	report- ing,	risk	management,	internal	control	and	external	 auditing.	The	Committee	held	6	meetings	in	2010. The	Board's	remuneration	committee	holds	regu- lar	meetings	throughout	the	year	and	prepares	and	 recommends	proposals	to	the	Board	related	to	re- muneration	for	the	CEO,	and	otherwise	contributes	 to	the	thorough	and	independent	handling	of	remu- neration	issues	for	leading	employees. future prospects Both	the	Norwegian	and	Swedish	economies	are	 growing.	In	2011	the	Group	will	continue	with	its	 Nordic	growth	strategy	and	further	develop	and	 strengthen	its	market	positions	within	the	Mail	and	 Logistics	segments.	 Norway	Post	will	continue	to	have	a	major	focus	on	 improving	profitability	and	the	implementation	of	the	 Spinnaker	efficiency	programme	throughout	the	en- tire	Group.	The	development	of	a	joint	improvement	 and	performance	culture	is	a	vital	part	of	this	work. Even	though	the	market	now	seems	to	be	devel- oping	in	a	positive	manner,	the	Logistics	segment	is	 still	expected	to	be	affected	by	available	capacity	 and	increased	competition	which	will	continue	to	put	 pressure	on	margins	in	2011.	A	specific	improvement	 programme	is	underway	for	the	parcels	and	freight	 areas	in	order	to	increase	synergies	between	the	 production	of	parcels	and	freight. A	continued	drop	in	letter	volumes	is	expected	in	 the	Mail	segment,	with	increased	substitution	for	 industrial	mail	and	the	digitalisation	of	advertising.	 inCome	Distribution in	% A	and	B	mail 		Newspapers,	magazines,		 advertising	etc.	 	 (10%)	 	CityMail		 	 (4%)	 	Logistics	 	 (58%)	 	Bank		 	 (2%)	 	Government	procurements			 (0%)	 	Sale	of	goods		 	 (0%) 	Other	income		 	 (4%) i % Andre inntekter (5%) Varesalg (1%) Statlige kjp (2%) Bank (5%) Logistikk (39%) CityMail (3%) Aviser, blad, reklame mv (12%) A og B (26%) Andre inntekter (5%) Varesalg (1%) Statlige kjp (0%) Bank (2%) IT (17%) Logistikk (45%) CityMail (3%) Aviser, blad, reklame mv (9%) A og B (18%) i % i % Ikke ungroupet, riktig graf, feil tekst 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Utbytte Statlig kjp '08 '04 '05 '06 '07       '09 '10 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 04 05 07 09 08 06 03 Bruker denne til form 06 07 08 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Utbytte Statlig kjp '08 '04 '05 '06 '07       '09 '10 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 04 05 07 09 08 06 03 Bruker denne til form 06 07 08 goVernment	proCure- ments	anD	DiViDenD in	mnoK 	497 	Government	procurements			 	Dividend	(paid	for	previous	financial	year) 21% Norway	Post	is	focused	on	offering	services	which	 are	adapted	to	new	customer	and	user	require- ments.	In	this	regard	a	new	digital	postal	system,	 Digipost,	is	to	be	launched.		Everyone	over	15	years	 old	will	be	given	access	to	a	new	digital	mailbox	in	ad- dition	to	the	traditional,	physical	mailbox. In	the	Section	10	plan,	Norway	Post	has	presented	 the	Minister	of	Transport	and	Communication	with	 its	proposal	that	a	political	assessment	must	be	car- ried	out	as	to	whether	the	concession	requirements	 governing	Norway	Posts	services	are	in	line	with	the	 actual	requirements	of	Norwegian	society,	and	if	the	 benefits	to	society	are	in	proportion	to	the	costs.	 The	Board	of	Directors	expects	these	issues	to	be	 considered	before	the	presentation	of	the	next	par- liamentary	report	on	Norway	Post,	or	before	any	new	 postal	regulations	on	new	licence	for	Norway	Post		 take	effect	from	2012.	Independent	reviews	confirm	 that	there	are	grounds	to	carry	out	changes	to	the	 postal	service	and	remove	Norway	Post's	banking	 service	obligation	fully	or	in	part. With	its	new	40	percent	ownership	stake	in	EDB	 ErgoGroup,	Norway	Post	will	help	the	company	to	 succeed	in	its	ambition	to	become	a	leading	IT	service	 provider	in	the	Nordic	region.		 Oslo	Municipality's	development	plan	for	the	Alna- bru	area	allows	Norway	Post	to	plan	a	future-ori- ented,	efficient	and	environmentally-friendly	centre	 for	Norway	Posts	and	Brings'	logistics	operations	 in	the	Oslo	area.	 The	Group	shall	undertake	continuous,	long-term	 and	systematic	work	within	sustainability	with	a	par- ticular	focus	on	health,	safety	and	the	environment	 (HSE)	and	climate. Future	HSE	work	will	turn	to	preventive	work	for	 employees	who	are	at	work,	whether	they	are	healthy	 or	exposed	to	health	problems.		In	order	to	increase	 the	number	of	employees	at	work	and	reduce	ab- sence	the	Group	will	focus	on	groups	and	employ- ees'	contributions	to	a	workplace	that	promotes	 good	health. The	Board	would	like	to	thank	the	employees	for	 their	cooperation	and	joint	responsibility	for	Norway	 Posts	development. 5,0 6,0 7,0 8,0 9,0 10,0 11,0 *inkl.

Judith	olafsen Oslo,	24	March	2011 01	aCCounts aCCounts	01  Corporate	governance	 statement each	year	the	board	of	Directors	of	norway	post	group	 submit	a	statement	concerning	the	company's	principles	for	corporate	 governance,	including	whether	the	norwegian	Code	of	practice	for	 Corporate	governance	(nues	recommendation)	has	been	followed. 	 Below	is	a	statement	of	how	the	points	in	the	 NUES	 recommendation	 have	 been	 followed	 in	 Norway	Post.	This	includes	both	details	of	how	 the	principles	have	been	met	and,	if	applicable,	 the	reason	for	any	non-compliance	and/or	why	the	 principle	is	not	relevant	for	Norway	Post. Non-compliance	is	primarily	related	to	the	fact	 that	the	Norwegian	government	is	the	company's	 sole	owner.		As	a	result	of	this,	Norway	Post's	cor- porate	governance	deviates	from	the	following	 points	of	the	NUES	recommendation:	point	4	on	 the	equal	treatment	of	shareholders,	point	5	on	 the	free	sale	of	shares,	point	6	on	general	assem- blies,	point	7	on	nomination	committees	and	point	 14	on	company	takeovers.	 The	Board	of	Directors	of	Norway	Post	sup- ports	the	recommendation	and	believes	that	the	 recommendation	has	been	followed	by	the	Com- pany	in	2010	with	the	exeption	of	those	points	 mentioned	above. 1.	CorporATE	GovErNANCE	The	Board	of	 Directors	sees	the	importance	of	establish- ing	and	further	developing	a	high	standard	for	 corporate	governance,	equivalent	to	Norwegian	 standards	of	best	practice	including	the	NUES	 recommendation. As	a	limited	company	wholly	owned	by	the	Gov- ernment,	the	Group's	corporate	governance	is	 based	on	Norwegian	law	and	the	Norwegian	Gov- ernment's	ownership	policy	in	force	at	a	given	time.	 Good	corporate	governance	is	a	prerequisite	 for	a	commercial	and	powerful	company,	while	at	 the	same	time	the	requirements	and	expecta- tions	of	the	company's	owner	must	be	fulfilled.	 The	Board	of	Directors	of	Norway	Post	believes	 that	there	is	a	clear	connection	between	good	 corporate	governance	and	creating	value	for	the	 company's	owners.	 Through	its	business	activities	Norway	Post	 is	a	prominent	member	of	society	and	has	also	 been	given	an	important	social	responsibility	with	 its	licence	from	the	Ministry	of	Transport	and	 Communication	-	that	of	ensuring	the	nation- wide	operation	of	delivery	services	in	 a	proper	and	cost-effective	 38 39 01	Corporate	goVernanCe Corporate	goVernanCe	01  manner.	Being	given	such	a	social	task	also	entails	 a	particular	responsibility	with	regard	to	how	this	 task	is	carried	out	 The	Group's	common	core	values	thus	create	 an	important	premise	for	the	Group's	activities	-	 with	regard	to	employees	and	with	regard	to	the	 Group's	operating	environment:	customers,	our	 suppliers	and	business	partners.	The	Group's	val- ues	are	Honesty,	Respect,	Coperation,	Openness	 and	Courage.	In	addition	to	this	shared	value	plat- form,	Ethical	Guidelines	and	Leadership	Principles	 have	been	established.	Awareness	and	knowledge	 about	these	ethical	guidelines	is	measured	on	an	 annual	basis	in	order	to	be	able	to	discover	the	ex- tent	to	which	these	ethical	guidelines	are	familiar	 to	all	Group	employees.	Work	on	ensuring	a	good	 level	of	understanding	about	ethical	problems	is	 a	continuous	process. The	majority	of	relevant	ethical	challenges	are	 addressed	in	the	stated	documents,	but	as	part	 of	an	increasing	focus	on	avoiding	and	minimising	 the	consequences	of	ethical	dilemmas,	work	began	 in	2010	to	focus	on	how	Group	companies	shall	 make	even	clearer	demands	both	internally	and	 externally.	This	will	also	form	an	important	con- tribution	to	the	group's	responsibility	for	people,	 society	and	the	environment.	See	also	the	"Sus- tainability	Report",	in	which	Norway	Post	details	 its	work	on	human	rights,	anti-corruption,	working	 conditions,	HSE,	discrimination	and	environmental	 conditions.	 2.	BuSINESS Norway	Post's	social	responsibility	is	to	ensure	 the	nationwide	operation	of	delivery	services	in	 a	proper	and	cost-effective	manner.	The	Com- pany's	social	responsibility	is	described	in	Norway	 Post's	licence. Furthermore	the	Group	shall	run	postal	and	 logistic	operations	on	a	commercial	basis,	as	well	 as	other	activities	directly	related	to	this.	 All	of	these	conditions	are	now	clearly	stated	in	 section	3	of	Norway	Post's	articles	of	association.	 The	complete	articles	of	association	are	found	on	 www.postennorge.com.			 Norway	Post's	social	responsibility	is	further	 defined	through	specified	licence	requirements	 given	by	the	Ministry	of	Transport	and	Com- munications.	The	current	licence	applies	until	31	 December	2011. The	Board	of	Directors	determines	goals	and	 strategies,	both	on	a	Group-wide	level	and	for	 each	business	area,	which	support	the	Group's	 aims	 related	 to	 mail	 and	 logistics	 operations.	 These	documents	are	based	on	regular	assess- ments	and	decision	processes	which	shall	ensure	 that	the	Group	has	a	well-founded	and	opera- tional	strategy	at	all	times. A	central	premise	for	Norway	Post's	strategies	 and	activities	is	that	Norway	Post	shall	be	a	coun- try-wide	service	provider	focusing	on	competitive	 pricing,	high	quality	and	good	accessibility.	This	is	 also	a	driving	force	for	motivated	employees	and	 management	in	day-to-day	business	and	is	funda- mental	in	maintaining	Norway	Post's	reputation	as	 a	trusted	third	party. As	well	as	meeting	its	socially-defined	service	 requirements,	the	Group	shall	also	be	run	prof- itably	on	commercial	terms,	meet	its	owner's	 required	rate	of	return	and	adapt	its	activities	 to	the	structural	changes	that	take	place	in	the	 market. Over	the	last	decade	and	within	this	frame- work	Norway	Post	has	developed	into	an	indus- trial	group	operating	within	the	postal	services	 and	logistics	business	areas	with	the	Nordic	area	 as	its	local	market.	The	markets	in	which	the	Group	 operates	are	characterised	by	fierce	competition	 and	major	technological	and	structural	changes.	 These	changes	present	Norway	Post	with	signifi- cant	challenges	with	regard	to	the	economics	of	 the	statutory	services	under	its	licence,	compe- tiveness,	adapting	to	new	customer	requirements	 and	market	position. The	following	main	strategies	form		 the	basis	for	the	development	of	the	company:	 			Norway	Post	shall	undertake	its	social	duties	in	 accordance	with	the	adopted	licence	require- ments.	 			Norway	Post	shall	service	customers'	require- ments	and	be	available	where	the	customer	is	 located.	 			Norway	Post	shall	develop	independent	compet- itiveness	in	its	focus	areas	in	the	Nordic	area. 			Norway	Post	shall	increase	returns	from	invest- ments	made	in	its	traditional	core	business	and	 at	the	same	time	continue	to	invest	in	Nordic	 growth	areas	in	order	to	ensure	future	profit- ability	and	strength.	 			Norway	Post	shall	develop	strong,	profitable	and	 sustainable	positions	within	the	areas	in	which	 it	is	involved.	 			Norway	Post	shall	work	to	extract	cost	ben- efits	through	efficiency	measures,	cordination	 of	the	value	chain	and	the	implementation	of	a	 Group-wide	productivity	system.	 			Norway	Post	shall	have	a	well	balanced	port- folio	of	business	operations	that	strengthens	 its	ability	to	service	customers'	requirements.	 This	portfolio	shall	have	clearly	defined	com- mon	characteristics	for	the	Group's	role	as	a	 trusted	third	party,	the	way	in	which	it	appears	 to	its	customers,	its	operating	principles	as	well	 as	a	shared	culture	and	values.	 			Norway	Post	shall	provide	a	competitive	rate	 of	return	for	the	owner	through	profitability	 and	a		value	creation	in	line	with	the	best	in	the	 industry. 			Norway	Post	shall	develop	good	and	attractive	 workplaces. Continuous	improvement	is	an	important	common	 denominator	in	the	development	of	the	Group.	Im- provements	in	processes,	products	and	services	 to	increase	customer	value	and	reduce	unnec- essary	use	of	resources	are	to	be	implemented	 throughout	the	Group.	Furthermore	Norway	Post	 takes	social	responsibility	for	how	its	operations	 affect	people,	the	environment	and	society	by	 focusing	on	reducing	the	impact	of	its	activities	 on	the	external	environment	and	developing	the	 Group	as	an	attractive	workplace	with	a	diverse	 and	inclusive	working	environment.	It	is	the	opinion	 of	the	Board	that	by	taking	social	responsibility	 Norway	Post	contributes	to	a	good	reputation,	 a	reduction	in	risk,	and	long-term	expansion	for	 the	Group.		 Norway	Post's	operations	are	labour	intensive.	 In	total	the	Group's	workforce	consists	of	ap- proximately	20	000	full-time	equivalents.	Health,	 Safety	and	the	Environment	(HSE)	is	therefore	a	 high	priority	and	the	Group's	aim	is	for	nobody	to	 be	injured	or	become	sick	as	a	result	of	their	work.		 Continuous	and	focused	work	is	underway	to	re- duce	the	sick	leave	rate,	number	of	employees	who	 are	incapacitated	for	work	and	lost-time	injuries	 The	Group's	activities	entail	challenges	with	 regard	to	the	external	environment.	The	Board	 of	Directors	of	Norway	Post	therefore	empha- sises	the	importance	of	reducing	the	impact	on	 the	external	environment	and	it	has	been	decided	 that	the	Group	is	to	be	an	environmental	leader.	 Through	the	establishment	of	a	common	ethi- cal	standard	(integrity	standard)	the	Group	will	 work	to	prevent	corruption	and	contribute	to	re- spect	for	human	and	workers'	rights.	This	work	will	 intensify	in	2011,	and	will	entail	the	Group's	opera- tive	units	subjecting	the	parts	of	the	value	chain	 that	the	units	can	actually	influence	to	the	same	 requirements	as	they	use	internally.	In	this	way	 Norway	Post's	Board	wishes	to	focus	on	how	the	 Group's	operations	can	contribute	to	sustainable	 development.	See	also	the	Sustainability	Report. 3.	CoMpANyS	CApITAl		AND	DIvIDEND	 equity As	of	31.12.010	the	group's	equity	was	MNOK	 5	501	which	gives	an	equity	ratio	of	35	%	of	the	 Group's	total	assets.	This	level	is	deemed	ade- quate	with	regard	to	the	Group	having	sufficient	 solidity	to	implement	the	company's	goals	and	 strategies	within	an	acceptable	risk	profile. dividend Norway	Post's	General	Assembly	is	not	bound	by	 the	Board's	proposal	for	the	distribution	of	divi- dend,	cf.		20-4	(4)	of	the	Companies	Act	and	the	 company	is	thus	subject	to	the	Government	profit	 policy	in	force	at	any	given	time.	In	Government	 Resolution	no.	1	(2009-2010)	it	is	stated	that	"the	 profit	policy	for	Norway	Post	Group	shall	entail	an	 expected	dividend	of	50%	of	Group	post-tax	prof- its.	Before	the	annual	dividend	is	determined	an	 independent	assessment	of	the	Group's	financial	 situation	and	future	prospects	shall	be	carried	 out." 4.	EQuAl	TrEATMENT	oF	SHArEHolDErS		 AND	TrANSACTIoNS	WITH	rElATED	pArTIES Norway	Post	has	only	one	share	class.	The	Norwe- gian	government	is	the	sole	shareholder.	All	shares	 are	owned	by	the	Norwegian	state	and	managed	 by	the	Ministry	of	Transport	and	Communications.	 Contact	 between	 the	 Norwegian	 state	 as	 owner	and	Norway	Post	is	undertaken	via	regular	 ownership	meetings.	The	articles	of	association	 also	state	that	Norway	Post	is	obliged	to	present	 all	cases	deemed	to	be	of	major	social	or	funda- mental	significance. 40 41 01	Corporate	goVernanCe Corporate	goVernanCe	01  Due	to	government	ownership	the	NUES	rec- ommendation	on	share	issues	is	not	deemed	to	 be	relevant	for	Norway	Post.	 Information	regarding	transactions	with	re- lated	parties	is	provided	for	in	the	annual	report.	 See	note	30. 5.	FrEE	SAlE	oF	SHArES All	shares	are	owned	by	the	Norwegian	state	 and	managed	by	the	Ministry	of	Transport	and	 Communications.	In	accordance	with		3	of	the	 articles	of	association	Norway	Post	is	to	oper- ate	as	a	limited	company	wholly-owned	by	the	 Government.	Due	to	government	ownership	the	 NUES	recommendation	on	free	sale	of	shares	 is	not	deemed	to	be	relevant	for	Norway	Post.	 6.	GENErAl	MEETING The	Norwegian	Government,	through	the	Min- ister	of	Transport	and	Communications,	is	the	 company's	general	meeting.	 In	accordance	with	the	company's	articles	of	 association,	the	ordinary	general	meeting	is	to	 be	held	by	the	end	of	june	each	year.	 The	Companies	Act		20-5	(1)	states	that	 the	Ministry	of	Transport	and	Communications	 is	responsible	for	sending	notification	of	both	 ordinary	and	extraordinary	general	meetings	and	 for	deciding	the	method	of	notification. The	Board	of	Directors,	CEO,	company	audi- tor	and	the	Office	of	the	Auditor	General	are	 invited	to	the	general	meeting. The	minutes	from	the	ordinary	general	meet- ing	are	available	on	the	company's	website.	 	7.	ElECTIoN	CoMMITTEE As	the	Norwegian	Government,	through	the	Min- ister	of	Transport	and	Communications,	is	the	 only	shareholder,	the	company	does	not	have	an	 election	committee.	The	Board	of	Directors	is	 appointed	by	the	general	meeting	in	accordance	 with	the	Companies	Act		20-4	(1).	This	repre- sents	non-compliance	with	regard	to	point	7	of	 the	NUES	recommendation. Four	members	of	the	Board	of	Directors	are	 chosen	by	and	from	the	employees	in	Norway.	 In	2010	a	Group-wide	scheme	was	established	 for	the	nomination	of	employee	representatives	 to	the	Board	of	Directors	of	Norway	Post.	This	 entails	that	all	employees	in	the	Norwegian	part	 of	the	Group	can	be	nominated	and	have	vot- ing	rights.	 8.	CorporATE	ASSEMBly		 AND	BoArD	oF	DIrECTorS	 Corporate assembly In	principle	Norway	Post	is	subject	to	the	main	 rule	of	the	Companies	Act	that	a	corporate	 assembly	must	be	appointed	if	a	company	has	 more	than	200	employees.	However	the	com- pany	does	not	have	a	corporate	assembly	as	an	 agreement	has	been	entered	into	between	the	 employees	and	the	company	that	there	is	to	be	 no	corporate	assembly	in	Norway	Post	in	ac- cordance	with		6-35	of	the	Companies	Act.	The	 same	agreement	gives	the	right	to	an	increase	 in	employee	representation	on	the	Board	of	 Directors	from	three	to	four	representatives. The composition of the Board of directors In	accordance	with	the	articles	of	association	 the	Board	of	Directors	shall	consist	of	between	 seven	to	ten	members.	Up	to	six	of	these	are	 appointed	by	the	general	meeting	and	as	the	 sole	shareholder	the	Norwegian	state	repre- sented	by	the	Minister	of	Transport	and	Com- munications	 designates	 and	 selects	 all	 the	 shareholder-appointed	Board	members.		There	 are	currently	six	shareholder-appointed	Board	 members. By	virtue	of	the	agreement	mentioned	above,	 the	employees	have	the	right	to	nominate	up	to	 four	members	of	the	Board	of	Directors.	 There	are	no	deputies	for	the	shareholders	 representatives	on	the	Board	of	Directors.	 In	2010	five	of	the	members	of	the	Board	 were	women,	of	whom	three	were	shareholder- appointed	representatives	and	two	were	em- ployee	representatives.

THE	WorK	oF	THE	BoArD	oF	DIrECTorS The	Board	of	Directors	of	Norway	Post	Group	is	 responsible	for	the	overall	management	of	the	 Norway	Post	Group	and	supervises	the	Group's	 activities	in	general. This	overall	responsibility	is	described	in	de- tail	in	the	adopted	instructions	for	the	Board	 of	Directors	and	in	the	Board's	plan	for	its	own	 work.	Both	these	documents	are	revised	on	an	 annual	basis.	 The	guidelines	for	the	CEOs	work	form	part	 of	the	instructions	of	the	Board	of	Directors	 of	Norway	Post.	 Together	these	documents	clarify	the	tasks	 and	responsibilities	of	the	Board	of	Directors	 and	the	CEO,	including	which	cases	shall,	can	 and	should	be	handled	by	the	Board.	This	also	 includes	the	CEO's	authorisation	limits.	Cases	 that	 typically	 appear	 on	 the	 agenda	 of	 the	 Board	of	Directors	are	those	connected	with	 the	 preparation	 and	 implementation	 of	 the	 Group's	strategies,	the	processing	and	approval	 of	quarterly	and	annual	reports,	monthly	result	 reports,	HSE	issues,	investments	and	follow-up	 work	on	these,	evaluation	of	the	Group's	risks	 and	internal	control	as	well	as	HR	and	organi- sational	issues.	 The	Board	of	Directors	shall	also	ensure	that	 the	company	fulfils	its	corporate	social	respon- sibility	commitments.	The	Board's	responsibility	 for	reviewing	and	reporting	risk	management	 and	internal	control	is	described	in	more	detail	 under	point	10.	The	Board's	work	and	its	meet- ings	are	led	by	the	Chairman	of	the	Board	and	 based	 on	 cases	 presented	 by	 the	 CEO.	The	 Company	expects	such	case	presentation	to	 constitute	a	good	and	satisfactory	basis	for	 considering	the	case.	The	Board	has	appointed	 a	vice-chairman	who	functions	as	chairman	if	 the	Chairman	of	the	Board	cannot	or	ought	not	 to	lead	the	work	of	the	Board.	 The Board held 10 meetings in 2010 The	Board	carries	out	an	annual	evaluation	of	 its	work	and	its	competence.	The	Board	is	also	 evaluated	by	the	owner.	 The Board of directors' audit committee  The	Board	has	established	an	audit	committee	 consisting	of	two	Board	members.	The	audit	 committee	meets	at	least	five	times	per	year.

The	Board	emphasises	the	importance	of	a	 good	and	efficient	control	environment	in	addi- tion	to	good	control	processes.	The	company's	 governing	documentation	represents	a	good	ba- sis	for	this	type	of	environment	and	processes.	 The	Groups	governing	documentation	stipulates	 directions	for	the	management	and	control	of	 the	Group.	The	documentation	sets	out	Group- wide	requirements	with	regard	to	conduct	in	im- portant	areas	and	processes,	including	ethical	 behaviour	and	how	corporate	social	responsibil- ity	is	to	be	practiced	in	the	Group. Risk	management	and	internal	control	depend	 on	people.	Internal	control	cannot	only	focus	on	 guidelines,	manuals	and	forms,	but	must	also	 focus	on	the	individual's	efforts	at	all	levels	 in	the	organisation.	The	Board	of	Directors	is	 therefore	determined	that	risk	management	 and	internal	control	be	integrated	in	the	com- pany's	core	and	support	processes.	Managers	 on	all	levels	are	responsible	for	ensuring	that	risk	 management	and	good	internal	control	systems	 are	established	within	their	own	area,	that	these	 have	the	necessary	effect	and	that	they	are	put	 into	operation	in	an	expedient	manner.	 The	Board	ensures	that	an	overall	assess- ment	of	the	Groups	risk	is	conducted	each	 year.	The	process	is	based	on	a	specific	policy	 and	the	risk	analysis	is	based	on	all	Group	units'	 strategies,	business	plans	and	goals	and	is	car- ried	out	as	a	comprehensive	process	based	on	 COSO's	framework	for	risk	management.	The	 aim	is	to	evaluate	risks	affecting	strategy,	fi- nance,	operations	and	reputation.	The	results	 of	this	process	are	consolidated	to	form	an	as- sessment	of	the	main	risks	to	which	the	Group	is	 exposed,	and	are	followed	up	with	specific	meas- ures	for	managing	and	controlling	the	individual	 risk	factors	in	order	to	avoid	incidents	that	may	 negatively	impact	the	Groups	operations	and	 reputation	in	the	market. In	addition,	a	central	monitoring	process	for	 internal	control	has	been	established	which	will	 help	to	ensure	that	there	is	adequate	and	ef- fective	internal	control	for	specified	risk	areas.	 The	central	monitoring	process	for	internal	con- trol	makes	a	continuous	evaluation	of	internal	 control	within	specified	areas	and	proposes	spe- cific	measures	to	improve	this	for	these	areas.	 The	implementation	of	the	proposed	measure	 is	the	responsibility	of	line	management.	As	part	 of	the	central	monitoring	process	for	internal	 control	the	compliance	of	the	Group's	govern- ing	documentation	including	ethical	guidelines	is	 also	assessed.	During	the	last	year	the	Board	 has	worked	on	implementing	systems	to	ensure	 that	the	Group	also	carries	out	the	systematic	 reporting	of	corporate	social	responsibility. The	Group	has	established	an	advisory	invest- ment	committee	which	handles	all	cases	that	 entail	investment	and	sales	in	accordance	with	 specified	authorisation	limits.	 A	 common	 ethical	 standard	 applies	 to	 all	 Group	employees.	A	continuous	effort	is	under- way	to	make	this	standard	known.	Work	began	 on	an	integrity	programme	in	2010.	This	shall	help	 to	ensure	a	high	and	precise	ethical	standard	 within	anti-corruption,	competitive	practices,	 social	dumping	and	processing	of	information.	 It	is	a	requirement	that	the	Group's	suppliers	 and	business	partners	comply	with	the	same	 standard.	 Openness	is	one	of	the	Group's	core	values	 and	is	a	significant	element	in	the	company's	 general	risk	management	and	internal	control.	 With	regard	to	breaches	of	the	ethical	stand- ard	in	general	and	the	integrity	standard	in	 particular	openness	is	especially	important	in	 order	to	prevent	and	rectify	non-compliance.	 All	employees	and	business	partners	are	there- fore	encouraged	to	notify	any	censurable	and/ or	illegal	conditions	as	soon	as	possible.	This	is	a	 part	of	the	individual's	responsibility.	 A	warning	institute	has	been	established	to	 ensure	good	and	safe	receipt	and	follow-up	of	 warnings	given,	and	to	ensure	that	such	warn- ings	are	not	met	with	negative	reactions	or	 sanctions.		The	Board	of	Directors'	audit	com- mittee	reviews	the	report	from	the	Group's	 warning	institute	every	six	months. 11.

Many operators also expe- rienced a decline in revenue within their core  businesses in 2010. Yet as a consequence of  an intense focus on costs throughout the year,  earnings still improved for most of them. In  particular the Swedish market showed posi- tive signs in 2010 which intensified during the  course of the year. The decline in volume in the  traditional mail area continues as expected,  leading to major changes being put in place by  postal companies. Many European operators  have initiated necessary structural changes,  reduced the number of days mail is distributed  or sold parts of their operations. Consolida- tion is a natural consequence of changes in the  demands of our customers. International ser- vice requirements, combined with customers'  wishes to form relationships with total suppli- ers, result in acquisitions and alliances across  both industries and geographical areas. After  the almost complete standstill in this type of  activity in 2009, the number of mergers and  acquisitions began to grow once more towards  the end of 2010. There are many signs that both  buyers and sellers will be more willing to carry  out transactions in 2011. Liberalisation. From January 2011 the majority  of countries within the EU have liberalised their  postal markets. The European postal compa- nies have taken important steps on the way to  meeting a market in which their traditional core  operations are now fully open to competition.  Nevertheless there are several barriers to en- try that give the traditional postal companies  competitive advantages on which they can build.  The deep economic decline has helped acceler- ate the transition to digital postal services with  volumes also falling as a result of a lower level of  activity in the commercial sector. The combina- tion of barriers to entry and falling mail volumes  has reduced the appeal of establishing compet- ing enterprises in the majority of countries. In- vesting in markets with negative growth is not  considered attractive. These conditions have led  to may of the largest and most offensive postal  operators in Europe winding down or disposing  Cautious optimism  about growth  the aftermath of the financial crisis made 2010 a year   of uncertainty.

Several of the central logistics  operators in the Nordic region  have demonstrated an increased  focus through the construction  of new terminals as well as the  establishment of new transport  routes. This development is   particularly visible in Sweden. 1 2 3 "Changing markets create room   for innovation - the trend is towards more  products dictated by consumers and users.

The Dutch company TNT has dropped its opera- tions in Germany and Belgium and indeed spun  off its mail and logistics operations into two  different companies with the postal company  solely focusing on its home market. In a similar  manner Deutsche Post has sold its letter op- erations in the Netherlands. In the Nordic area  Sweden is the only country with two competing  mail operators. the changing logistics sector. Logistics is ex- periencing growth within most product areas.  As the economy improves demand for logistics  services increases and this trend is closely re- lated to the development of GNP. The volume of  goods transported out of and into Norway by  road in 2010 grew by approximately 10% com- pared with the previous year. Growth in the  logistics industry is also driven by new technol- ogy and new patterns of coperation between  companies and consumers. Competition has  intensified and the trend towards consolida- tion strengthened throughout 2010. The major  global players grew at the expense of smaller  local companies. In a transitional period the  smaller operators are becoming subcontrac- tors to the global logistics systems. Several of  the central logistics operators in the Nordic  region have demonstrated an increased focus  through the construction of new terminals as  well as the establishment of new transport  routes. This development is particularly notice- able in Sweden with the establishment of new  large-scale terminal facilities in Skne and in the  Stockholm area. There is also renewed activity  and an increased willingness to invest in port  facilities in the Nordic region and the Baltic  States which will have a major influence on the  development of logistics flows in coming years.  There is significant growth in goods volumes  transported into the Nordic region via the Bal- tic States. Foreign trucks carried 56 percent  of the goods passing the Norwegian border by  road in 2010. The proportion of cross-border  transport undertaken by Norwegian trucks  has fallen from 51% to 44% in 10 years, whilst  the Baltic States and other Eastern European  countries are increasing most. At the same time  new infrastructure is being built to integrate  transport services to be able to offer market- adapted and cost-effective solutions that also  allow further synergies to be exploited in op- erational terms. Many of these changes mean  that logistics partners are moving further into  customers' value chains – as a result of both  the breadth and depth of the products and  services offered. The dominant operators in the Nordic mar- ket have international networks and combine  this with local strength established through  their own infrastructure or partnerships. Alli- ances, networks and coperative constellations  are also being formed which help to erase the  boundaries between former competitors and  bring customers and suppliers closer together.  The financial crisis and its aftermath have cre- ated major financial pressures for many of the  logistics operators in the Nordic region. Many  of the large operators are restructuring their  activities and concentrating on their core busi- nesses. DHL is an example of this in 2010. The  profitability levels of a number of small and  medium-sized operators will lead to bankrupt- cy and structural changes. Internal unrest may  also result in central employees breaking out to  try to create new enterprises. The dynamics of  the market will create challenges and opportu- nities in the coming year. postal requirements are changing. Traditional  postal deliveries are being replaced by digital  information and communication over the inter- net and mobile networks. Economic decline and  an increased focus on environmental concerns  have only served to accelerate a trend that has  been underway over the last 10 years. Several  conditions suggest that this accelerated devel- opment will continue. If so it is not unrealistic to  expect mail volumes to be almost halved over  the next decade. But it is not only in connection  with information and messaging that custom- ers' requirements are changing. The transition  to online banking, ATMs and cash withdrawals  in stores reduces the demand for manual ba- sic banking services in a physical branch net- work. This gives a continuous reduction in the  customer base for the post office network.  The banks are now developing alternative and  cost-effective distribution solutions which in- clude the establishment of Banking in shops to  take over from the post office network. On the  other hand parcel volumes are growing rapidly  but customer requirements for their delivery  require different services than the traditional  post offices can provide. Post office stores all  over Europe are undergoing changes to adapt  to modern customer requirements. These are  some examples of the major changes affect- ing the post and communications market and  the pace of change will remain fast in coming  years. In order to meet this development the  post companies have to adapt their range of  products, production and networks to the de- mands of the market. New ways of thinking and  active innovation in the product and market ar- eas provide the basis for new business models  that create new growth and profitability. changing consumption patterns. While letter  volumes are falling, parcel volumes continue to  increase. Internet shopping now represents  over 50% of long-distance trade in Europe,  and important markets such as Germany and   50 51 "New digital services will partly replace the physical  sending of letters, but also create new opportunities  and provide new growth." market report 02 02 market report France are experiencing huge growth. Major  operators are therefore attempting to position  themselves as one-stop-shops for online busi- ness. Self-service solutions are gaining ground  and the market is increasingly expecting these  to be a part of the overall value proposal. That  which until recently were paid-for added value  services have now become integrated parts of  the standard service. The digital platform, which  is increasingly part of the service portfolio, also  provides access to new markets. This represents  an opportunity, but also allows competition from  new operators in our core markets. New opera- tors, as well as established operators who are  expanding, will aim for the most profitable seg- ments and create demanding competitive situ- ations for the existing operators.  adaptation through new products. In a world  of changing patterns of consumption and  technical advances one of the core questions  for the postal companies is how to remain  relevant and attractive to its customers.  2010 was the year in which digital postal  solutions moved from the drawing board  to the market for several European postal  operators – including Norway Post. This is a  new product category and a new way of thin- king. Postal companies in countries including  Finland, Denmark, Germany, France, the UK,  Italy and Switzerland have all launched digital  products. However, uncertainties about the  extent of demand and the business models  affect the various new services. A new mar- ket will be created with solutions that make  day-to-day life simpler for mail customers.  The postal operators' role as a trusted third  party also in a digital world is built upon a  100 year-old foundation of trust and com- petence. Major expectations ride on this new  development. A further focus on technology  as a basis for development and innovation  will be important in order to create a com- petitive advantage. Available solutions now  give the postal companies the opportunity to  create new added-value services. More opti- mised value chains will provide the foundation  for increased profitability. Changing markets create room for innovation  - the trend is towards more products dictated  by consumers and users. Within both mail and  logistics it will be vital to create solutions that  inspire customers and create increased and  more visible customer value.  the environment remains as important as ever.  Awareness and requirements regarding climate  and environmental development have not weak- ened as a result of the financial crisis. Despite a  strong focus on costs and improving profitability  the operators within mail and logistics continued  to work systematically on reducing their environ- mental impact. In the mail and logistics industry,  with its comprehensive transport requirements,  major parts of the vehicle fleets have been re- placed with environmentally-friendly alternatives  running on biofuel and electricity. Perhaps the  most important and valuable measure taken in  2010 was the simplification of the route system  and distribution solutions for the "last mile" along  with the introduction of electric vehicles and mo- peds in densely-populated areas. At the same  time new rail solutions were introduced that  made it possible to move large volumes of goods  off the road onto a more environmentally friendly  track. Even a financial crisis with its related focus  on costs was unable to divert attention from the  importance of reducing environmental impact.  Several operators have now launched "green"  products including the purchase of quotas,  without these yet having been a major market  success. While customers, suppliers and partners  now set stricter environmental requirements to  each other and develop more environmentally- friendly solutions together, it is also important  to make clear demands of the authorities to en- sure that the framework conditions exist for the  sustainable development of the business sector. Faith in the future. Signals about how markets  and general demand will develop point in differ- ent directions. There remains a great deal of un- certainty, but a cautious optimism prevails about  growth in 2011, while many expect new uncertain- ty to characterise developments in 2012. In the  Nordic region Sweden has demonstrated very  quick economic rejuvenation and strong market  growth in the logistics industry. Hopefully this de- velopment will continue and over time bring the  other Nordic countries with it. Development is  expected to be somewhat varied between busi- ness areas, also driven by other changes in de- mand. The record-high parcel volumes recorded  for Christmas 2010 show that the underlying  development in online business and other home  shopping will continue and drive growth within  parcel distribution both locally and across na- tional borders. Growth is also expected within  goods transport, and not least within warehous- ing services where the trend for outsourcing this  type of activity continues. We also see changes to  business models for traditional business whereby  home delivery direct to the end user from central  warehouses will replace stocks being held by the  local store. Traditional postal services will experi- ence a further reduction in demand. New digital  services will partly replace the physical sending  of letters, but also create new opportunities and  provide new growth. The sum total of all this will  be rising optimism and increased willingness to  invest in development.  52 53 02 maIl segmeNt faith in  the future Norway post's new south eastern Norway terminal is now  fully operational. Now work is underway on adaptations to  meet the challenge of ever smaller letter volumes.  maIl segmeNt 02 January 2010 saw the culmination of the struc- tural projects that were started in the early  2000s: the South Eastern Norway terminal at  Robsrud outside Oslo was opened. At the begin- ning of 2011 letter production in Drammen and  Hamar was moved to the South Eastern Norway  terminal.  "The closure is connected to the decline in mail  volumes and how to make processes as efficient  as possible. I can't see that there will now be any  further major changes to the structure unless  the government changes the licence require- ments.

The South Eastern Norway terminal  has modernised the industrial process. The design  of the premises is more efficient and allows the  opportunity for even more improvements, be- lieves Nilsen. Results exceeded all expectations  when the Christmas traffic was processed. "I was at South Eastern Norway terminal on  December 23. I met employees there who were  almost disappointed over the fact that things  weren't more chaotic. They missed the Christ- mas feeling!

Now it's all  about getting the humans and the machines to  get along and for us to make adjustments to re- ally get distribution to flow," says Nilsen. new organisation. Another milestone in 2010 has  also helped with the flow. The former Mail Division  and parts of the Distribution Network Division  were merged to form a new Mail Division in order  to achieve greater efficiency and increased prof- itability. Nilsen believes the merger has brought  customers and production closer together. In- creased and changed demands in the market can  be met faster and more precisely. "The methods that must be put into use in  order to tackle the decline in mail volumes have  become clearer for all who work with post. We  now have a leaner and more focused staff and or- ganisation that support the sales and operational  units to an even greater extent," says Nilsen. more post in shops. The post offices have also  undergone changes. An increasing number of post  offices have changed from being run by Norway  Post to being Post in Shops and a part of the  retail trade. This concept will be ten years old in  2011. "Post in Shops had a lukewarm reception and  met with protests in the beginning, but over time  the market has reacted positively. The key words  have been better accessibility and long opening  hours where Post in Shops are located. The fact  that the stores provide us with postal services  also represents a significant saving for us," says  Nilsen. new post office concept. Savings have been  made when traditional post offices have  become part of the new concept. The  premises have become more efficient and  rationally fitted.  maIl DIvIsIoN saLes anD cUstomer serVice is  responsible for all customer activities,   i.e. sales, marketing and customer service  for the Mail division in Norway and the  Nordic area.

One of the possibilities is alternative vehicles  in the form of trailers, bicycles, mopeds and cars  with no or minimal CO2 emissions. However the  absolute biggest effect on the environment  would be reduced air traffic. A condition of  Norway Post's licence is that A mail is delivered  overnight. As long as today's licence requirement  regarding delivery times continues to apply we  cannot do so much about the emissions for which  the current air network is responsible. Changes  could mean the use of rail transport instead of  air on many postal routes. exciting times ahead. Nilsen does not believe  that mail distribution will be based on the same  basic structure in 2015. If today's framework  conditions remain unchanged they will trigger a  significant need for government procurements.  This means the compensation paid by the govern- ment to Norway Post for commercially unprofit- able services. There is reason to believe that the  number of distribution days could be reduced.  Nor is he worried by the EU's third Postal Direc- tive which means free competition for all postal  services. Norway has yet to decide whether the  directive will be implemented. "We have a solid foundation for the operation  of postal services in Norway. Those who wish to  compete with us will need a great deal of vitality,  major self-belief and a lot of money. We view the  possibility of competition as less likely now than  when I came here three years ago. But unless  we continuously think about reducing costs, the  possibility increases that someone can take over  parts of our enterprise and see the potential for  profitable operation.  This is why continuous improvement is so vital.  We must be willing to take decitions which are  painful in the short-term, but which are impor- tant to achieving long-term competitiveness and  to being the preferred and dominant postal dis- tributor in Norway. In any case there will be a need  for a distribution network as far into the future  as I am able to see," concludes Tore K. Nilsen. "Now it's all about getting the humans and  the machines to get along and for us to make  adjustments to really get distribution to flow." Group Director Tore K.

The   ongoing aim is to get customers to pay  properly the first time. maIl segmeNt 02 U N E C E S S A R Y                                     C U S T O M E R   V A L U E                                   N E C E S S A R Y "Post offices should be located where there  is a lot of traffic. This also means that they are in  popular areas with high rental charges. We have  significantly reduced our office areas which has  resulted in significant savings," says the Group  Director. The modernisation of the post office network  has not affected the decline in the number of  visitors and the use of postal services. The fore- casts still point to letter volumes being halved in  ten years' time.  Digipost. Postal companies all over Europe want  to take part in digital conversion that can reduce  letter volumes even further: digital post. The same  applies to the Mail Division in Norway with its Digi- post project which will be offered to everyone (all  those 15 years old and above) in Norway in 2011. "A change in the usage pattern for postal  services has been forced upon us in any case. We  want to be a part of this, given Norway Post's  history, competence and position in the market.  The brand name and organisation are strong. This  gives us faith in our ability to succeed," says Nilsen. Nilsen does not believe that Digipost will do  much to compensate for the disappearance of  physical post in the short term. In particular it is  addressed mail that is the problem; so it is posi- tive that unaddressed mail increased in 2010. "We are not back to the volumes we once had,  but the market is recovering and the financial cri- sis is over. Nevertheless it is a constant source of  frustration that newspapers can use advertising  as inserts while we have to deal with customers  who say 'No thanks' to unaddressed mail. This  creates an unfair competitive situation," says  Nilsen.  clear environmental ambitions. The Group Direc- tor does not like the fact that unaddressed mail is  seen as environmentally damaging either. The Mail  Division has big environmental ambitions.

In November the Norway Post Group signed  framework agreements with five railway opera- tors for goods-train solutions. The agreements  cover requirements for goods transport by rail  in the Nordic region. For the first time the Nor- way Post Group had the opportunity to choose  between several good suppliers and competitive  bids. "The plan is to purchase goods transport by  rail for some two billion Kroner over the next  three years and become even more environ- mentally friendly," explains Group Director Arne  Bjrndahl. As well as parcels and goods the Division is re- sponsible for the Group's rail freight unit, Bring  Linehaul. The two biggest suppliers are CargoNet  AS and Cargolink AS.  green freight. During the last three years the  Norway Post Group has purchased rail transport  from CargoNet AS for more than BNOK 1.1. The  new agreements run until the end of 2013 and  can be extended for two more years. "We want to send more mail, parcels and  goods by train. This is in keeping with our environ- mental ambition to reduce CO2 emissions from  our activities by 30 percent by the end of 2015,"  notes Bjrndahl. Among other routes CargoNet AS runs a daily  Bring train on the lmhult–Jnkping–Oslo route.  On the 3rd of September Bring train number two  was in place between Oslo and Amsterdam. Now  there are two direct services between the two  cities. Each train service replaces 32 semitrailers  on the road. "Bring Nederland was declared logistics com- pany of the year by a leading Dutch industry body.  They won because they dared to focus on growth  and new services during a downturn," explains  Bjrndahl. He thinks it is worth noting that environmental  customers such as Norsk Resirk and Grnt Punkt  choose Bring precisely because of its good inter- national rail solutions.  irregularities.He admits that 2010 was more  demanding than expected. Heavy snowfalls dur- ing the first months of the year caused serious  disruption to delivery quality and contributed  to extra costs. During the spring there were  landslides, floods and many roads were closed  in Norway. The transport strike in Bring Cargo  in the early summer also had a negative impact  on operations. "We had no growth in the first half of the year.  After the summer we managed both to win new  customers and renegotiate agreements, even  though price competition was fierce. Things im- proved in the autumn.

A combined value chain will be important in  achieving the goal of being "the world's best in  the Nordic region". "Norway Post and Bring strengthen one an- other. We have to work together seamlessly. The  customer does not care which of us does the job.  If we are in front and develop good solutions we  will be difficult to beat," maintains Bjrndahl. Norway Post and Bring will move in together  in several locations this year. A completely new  shared terminal is planned in lesund in 2012.  Bring's new goods hub at Alnabru is on the draw- ing board and still some years away. Here too  parcels and goods will be side by side when the  building is finished. The first version of the epoch-making traffic  and load planning tool TDLP is round the corner.  This is a newly developed and powerful IT tool for  the planning of distribution and line haul traffic of  parcels and goods.  "This is pioneering work. We can plan all logistics  stages in advance from A to Z. Fully-loaded ve- hicles will be allocated the smartest routes. This is  profitable and creates less emissions. The tool en- ables more advanced logistics," claims Bjrndahl. A 24-hour-a-day monitoring centre for goods  in Norway is to be established. new services. The logistics area is subject to  intense competition. The trend is for fewer and  larger operators.  "We had record parcel volumes at the end  of last year and internet shopping contributed  to parcel growth. Bring arranges the Load on- line business seminar in September each year  and awards prizes to the best Norwegian online  stores. In 2010 Stormberg.no was crowned Inter- net Store of the Year," explains Bjrndahl. From the beginning of the year Bring has had  an office in Hong Kong.

Large-scale operations. Logistics' significance in  the Group was decisive in the creation of two lo- gistics divisions with effect from 2010. Production  and the transport of parcels and goods in Nor- way have combined into the Logistics Division. This  also entails more integration, standardisation and  economies of scale within transport and terminal  operations. The names of the Bring specialists  were amended to reflect the new business areas. "It has became easier and more logical for  customers to find what they need from Bring's  services. At the same time the names of the busi- ness areas correspond with those of the Bring  specialists," says Bjrndahl. Bring Logistics was split into three: Bring Car- go, Bring Parcels and Bring Warehousing. When  warehouse services and parcels were separated  from Logistics it was natural to change the name  of the goods operation from Logistics to Cargo. A new website with the name mybring with  details of the complete customer relationship  will be in place during 2011 and is one of several  measures to put the Group ahead. continuous improvement. Modelled on the  Group-wide Spinnaker programme, Logistics  Division has brought together all current  and new projects under a common umbrella.  These are important projects concerning in- tergration, the environment, cross-sales and  growth. "Spinnaker Logistics was launched as an over- all programme office for the division," explains  Bjrndahl. Heavy goods vehicle traffic on Norwegian roads  grew by 1.9 percent in 2010. Over the last 10 years  such traffic has grown by 18.6 percent. Norway  Post and Bring Cargo work closely together on the  terminal and transport side in Norway to utilise  employees, resources, competence and vehicles  efficiently and in an environmentally conscious  manner. shared facility.

"The new divisional structure helps the Bring  specialists cultivate their expertise within differ- ent logistics areas to an even greater extent,"  emphasizes Group Director Pl R. Amundsen.  He points out that the Group still meets the  market with a combined mail and logistics ser- vice. "With different specialists we are able to  offer complete logistics solutions adapted to  the individual customer's requirements," says  Amundsen.  intergration. Internal intergration is an impor- tant area for the Group Director, particularly  now that the Bring specialists have been split  into two divisions. Co-localisation, the cordina- tion of line-haul traffic and marketing and sales  work are examples of areas where the divisions  work closely together.  "We have concepts that cross the divisions,  for example within online shopping. There are  also a number of examples where we provide  solutions to the customers of specialists in both  divisions. I can also mention that we are working  on specific plans for co-localisation in Norway,  Sweden and Denmark," explains Amundsen. Bring Warehousing. Logistics Solutions has  also clarified two new specialist areas in 2010.  One of these is Bring Warehousing (previously  a part of Bring Logistics) which provides ware- house services/third party logistics. In June  Bring Warehousing opened one of Northern  Europe's most modern logistics centres within  warehouse services at Berger. The specialist is  focusing on more automated operation through  high-technology solutions. "Bring Warehousing has been separated into  an individual specialist because warehouse  services are one of our areas of focus. This  means that we can further cultivate our  expertise within third party logistics,"  says Amundsen. Bring supply services. The other  newly created specialist is Bring  Supply Services (previously a part of  Bring Frigo) which has fourth party lo- gistics as its specialist field. Bring Supply  Services has been separated into an individual  specialist in order to increase the Group's focus  on fourth party logistics. Activity in this market  segment is increasing.

This also results in a clearer environ- mental profile with a reduction in CO2  emissions of 400 tons. Action: Bring Frigo allowed Norway  Post in Oslo to use its thermo trail- ers to load mail for rail transport to  Trondheim, Fauske and Troms. On  an annual basis this entails that over  1000 semitrailers with mail will be  moved from road to rail and solved  the problem of unused capacity on  these routes.

This is vital in order to  realise our ambition to invest in further growth,"  notes the Group Director.  The goal for the period up to 2013 is increased  profitability within all areas. The most important  initiative in order to ensure this growth is an in- ternal improvement programme that will begin  in the spring of 2011. This will be achieved by fo- cusing on both minor and major improvements  throughout the whole organisation. The market  and customer perspective will be at the centre  of all improvement work.  "In order to achieve profitable growth we are  dependent on both satisfied and profitable cus- tomers," he says.  environmental initiative. The improvement pro- gramme will also include the division's contribu- tion to the environment. A number of environ- mental initiatives are founded on the Group's  environmental strategy that runs until 2015.  Initiatives underway in the division include train- ing drivers in environmentally efficient driving,  an e-training programme leading to an Environ- mental Diploma, energy saving methods used at  terminals and inter-modal rail solutions. "The Alnabru project in Norway and the co-lo- calisation of production units are also extremely  important to us. Together with the Logistics Divi- sion we want to establish ourselves in a logistics  centre like Alnabru. This is important for the en- vironment with regard both to being close to the  railway and energy-saving economies of scale,"  says Amundsen. Forward-looking. Amundsen emphasizes that  the Logistics Solutions Division is to be charac- terised by a high degree of flexibility, achievement  and accomplishment. The key to this is a large de- gree of responsibility and authority throughout  the organisation which allows the specialists to  be able to adapt quickly to changes in the market.  "We will be sprightly and forward-looking, with  a great willingness to make changes within the  organisation. This is reflected in our services  to the market which are solution-oriented and  flexible, and always based upon the customer's  requirements," notes Amundsen.  "We see that the market is on the way up  again and have equipped the organisation to  be able to take part in this growth. We will  earn money at the same time." Group Director Pl Amundsen fourth party logistics for foodstuffs can also be  used in other industries," says Amundsen. Last year the specialist in fourth party logis- tics established local offices in several countries  in order to secure optimum fourth party logis- tics for customers including IKEA Food Service,  and is now in place in Japan, Australia, the USA,  Canada, the UK, Switzerland, Germany and Rus- sia. A part of our strategy is to follow the Nor- dic-based customers out in the world," notes  Amundsen. Bring Frigo. The specialist in temperature-con- trolled logistics within foodstuffs, Bring Frigo, is  the market leader in its area in the Nordic region.  In 2010 Bring Frigo took over operation of the  meat giant Scan's national logistics centre in  Sweden.  The foodstuffs specialist has also recorded  an increase in volume in the delivery of food- stuffs by train to Europe and has gone from one  to two weekly departures on the route between  Denmark and Italy. Bring express. The specialist in delivery and  express services, Bring Express, is the market  leader within its areas in the Nordic region. Last  year the specialist entered into collaboration  with Blocket.se to offer courier deliveries for  sales and purchases between private individu- als. The specialist has strengthened its focus  on Home delivery by putting this in a separate  business area on a Nordic basis.  "We see a huge potential for Home delivery  in the market, not least because of the growth  in internet shopping, and we can offer a unique  concept to the market," says Amundsen. profitable growth. In 2010 all specialist areas  in Logistics Solutions recorded increased rev- enues but fierce competition affected profit- ability. Systematic improvement work to secure  increased profitability and strengthen customer  value are therefore the main areas of focus in  the division in the future.

In recent  years Norway Post has developed its business  to become a Nordic mail and logistics group  in order to meet new customer demands in a  market characterised by internationalisation  and increased competition.  Corporate Social Responsibility. Norway Post  emphasises the importance of corporate so- cial responsibility in how its operations affect  people, the environment and society. For the  Group, corporate social responsibility means  implementing voluntary measures that are not  mandatory legal or licence requirements, which  may not necessarily improve short-term prof- itability, but which have the potential to benefit  both the company and society. The main focus  is to reduce the impact of the  Groups activi- ties on the external environment as well as to  develop the Group as an attractive workplace  with a diverse and inclusive working environ- ment. Goal-oriented work. Norway Post has a good  tradition of reporting the measures taken and  results we have achieved through our work on  and enthusiasm for corporate social respon- sibility. We have done this with reports on the  environment and working environment in previ- ous annual reports. With a separate section on  sustainability in this year's report, we are able  to document our corporate social responsibility  initiatives to a greater extent than before while  also focusing on areas in which there is room for  improvement.

At the same  time it is important that the company has an  active attitude to corporate social responsi- bility in its management and its corporate cul- ture. These efforts will secure Norway Post's  strong position in society and strengthen its  reputation. This will then help to attract and  motivate employees, strengthen competitive- ness and provide increased freedom to de- velop the Group's business. Adopting a global  initiative such as the Global Compact is there- fore a natural extension of our focus on more  socially responsible operations.  Global ComPaCt Norway Post became a member of the UN  Global Compact in March 2011. Global Compact  is a UN initiative for coperation with business  on sustainable development. As a participant in  Global Compact, Norway Post promises to in- tegrate ten basic principles* into its strategy  and daily operations. The Group is also com- mitted to report activities and improvements  in this regard. The principles are divided into  four areas.  RePoRtinG ReQuiRementS As a member of Global Compact, Norway Post  is committed to providing social responsibility  reports once a year. We provide such reports  through our annual and sustainability report.  RePoRtinG GuidelineS:  Norway Post uses the globally recognised  guidelines, the Sustainability Reporting Guide- lines, from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  as the basis for its reporting. These guidelines  are recommended by Global Compact. The GRI framework consists of principles  and measurement indicators for the report- ing of sustainability and describe why, how and  what an organisation should report. The meas- urement indicators (hereafter called perfor- mance indicators) are continuously being de- veloped and improved.  There are currently 80 performance  indicators divided into three categories:  Economic, environmental and social.  the economic indicators address the direct  economic impacts of the organisations activi- ties on society and the economic value added  by these activities. These cover the report- ing of salaries, pensions and other benefits to  the company's management and employees,  payments received from customers and pay- ments made to subcontractors.  environmental performance indicators concern  an organisations impacts on living and non-living  natural systems, including ecosystems, land, air  and water. The indicators include environmental  impacts of the company's products and ser- vices, resource consumption, consumption of  hazardous substances and raw materials, emis- sions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants,  waste, the costs of environmental investments  and fines and penalties for violations of environ- mental legislation.  the social indicators are grouped into four  categories; issues related to labour, products,  human rights and to more general social issues  related to consumers, communities and other  stakeholders. Such information can be difficult  to quantify. This is why it is also possible to pro- vide qualitative descriptions.  wHat do we RePoRt?  In accordance with the requirements for appli- cation level C, we report within the following GRI  indicator categories: economic, environmental  and social. We report for the most relevant  indicators for our business, which we believe  provide the best picture of our continuous  work towards more socially responsible opera- tions. We report for the entire Group together,  including subsidiaries.  This year we are providing full reports for 11  indicators and partial reports for 2 indicators.  We thus qualify for level C in 2010 but eventu- ally aim to report at the highest level.  * these teN PriNCiPles are:  Human rights     Principle 1: Businesses should support and  respect the protection of internationally  proclaimed human rights; and    Principle 2: make sure that they are not  complicit in human rights abuses.  labour     Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the  freedom of association and the effec- tive recognition of the right to collective  bargaining;    Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of  forced and compulsory labour;    Principle 5: the effective abolition of child  labour; and    Principle 6: the elimination of discriminition  in respect of employment and occupation. environment    Principle 7: Businesses should support a  precautionary approach to environmental  challenges;   Principle 8: undertake initiatives to pro- mote greater environmental responsibility;  and    Principle 9: encourage the development  and diffusion of environmentally friendly  technologies.  anti-corruption     Principle 10: Businesses should work  against corruption in all its forms, including  extortion and bribery.  Norway Post aNd sustaiNability 03 03 Norway Post aNd sustaiNability * The sector supplement is a separate set of indicators adapted for different sectors. For example there is a sector supplement for Logistics and Transportation which will be relevant to Norway Post. We have not included indicators for this supplement in this year's report.  REPORTING LEVEL: GRI operates with three application levels: A, B and C, where A is the highest and C the lowest reporting level.

This is reflected both  in the sick leave statistics and the H-value for  2010. This provides a further incentive to work  on health and well-being in the workplace.  around the world. The continuous improve- ment of HSE work has been a common goal  throughout the entire Group. Last year Norway  Post arranged a get-in-shape campaign for  all employees in the Nordic region for the first  time. Around the world is an internet-based  activity where the units in the Group compete  against each other as teams. Employees reg- ister exercise activities such as running, cy- cling, weight-training or climbing stairs and are  awarded points. Altogether over 6200 employ- ees have taken part. on icy ground. Each winter employees are  injured by in falls due to snow and ice. An im- portant action to prevent such injuries is for  couriers and drivers to use shoe crampons. A  comprehensive campaign was implemented  to provide employees working outdoors with  spiked shoes and shoe crampons. During the  campaign the number of injuries through falls  fell by 31 percent compared with the same pe- riod last year.  Sick leave. A method has been put into use  for following up employees with repeated high  levels of sick leave. The 'It Helps' method has  brought significant improvements to the units  in which it has been used. This systematic work  on sick leave has helped to produce a record- low level of sick leave of 7.9 percent. This is  0.2 percent lower than in 2009.  fewer accidents. It is an important goal for the  Group to reduce the number of injuries at work  that lead to sick leave. The H-value (number of  injuries per million working hours) is rapidly fall- ing from an unsatisfactory level. The LTI-ratio  was 10 compared with 11.6 for the previous year.  The Group CEO rates managers on the report- ing of near-accidents. Last year the number of  registered near-accidents and undesirable in- cidents passed 26 750. Such reporting provides  valuable information for the implementation of  measures to prevent more serious accidents.  The proportion of employees incapacitated for  work in Norway Post is the same as in society  in general. Health promotion leadership. The Group CEO  has put HSE at the top of the agenda for many  years. All management and staff meetings be- gin with the subject of HSE and managers are  rated on their HSE results. In this year's organ- isational survey employees also scored high for  factors such as attractive workplaces, motiva- tion and working environments that promote  good health. The philosophy is health promotion  leadership, and the goal is a working environ- ment which promotes good health in which no- body is injured or sick as a result of their work.  improving managers. The Group works on the  continuous improvement of leadership through  the development of both management groups  and individuals. 120 managers completed indi- vidual programmes in 2010. Of these 74 took  part in the Group's Middle Management Pro- gramme while 46 took part in the Group's pro- gramme for first line managers "The Confident  Manager." In addition a pilot programme called  "Aspiring Managers" was implemented to mo- bilise more first line managers from among the  Group's own workforce (8 participants in 2010).  Two MBA dissertations that discuss the con- nection between following up managers and  employee satisfaction show that those who  have taken part in the Group's Middle Manage- ment Programme score higher in management  evaluations after completing the programme. Continuous change. A methodology has been  established for improvement work in Norway  Post that is based on the Lean philosophy.  The involvement of employee representa- tives in this regard was further strengthened  throughout last year. Norway Post changed the  Group structure in the first half of 2010. The  aim is to secure market positions in line with the  strategy of growth in the logistics area and the  expected further decline in volumes in the mail  segment. The reorganisation was carried out  with good dialogue with the unions and with- out layoffs. During the process managers were  improvement:   reduCed siCk leave Team 2 in Drammen distribution   reduced sick leave of 27 percent to   seven percent over seven months –   a relative reduction of 74 percent.   Sick leave costs were thus cut and  employee satisfaction surveys show  a great improvement in satisfaction  among the team. Productivity increased  by two percent. Action: Team 2 followed sick employees  using the Post model and the "It Helps"  programme. A new employee joined the  team, who together with the company  health service Synergi Helse worked  on attitudes and carried out individual  health checks. Employees with a  historically high rate of sick leave were  moved among other teams. "As a workplace the Group reflects the situation  in Norway. 11 percent of employees are immigrants  or have two immigrant parents." workiNG eNviroNmeNt 03 03 workiNG eNviroNmeNt most imPortaNt eveNts:  1 2 3 lti-ratio.

This systematic work on  sick leave has helped to  produce a record-low level  of sick leave of  7.9 percent.  This is 0.2 percent lower  than in 2009.  Get-in-shape campaign.   For the first time Norway  Post arranged a get in shape  campaign for all employees in  the Nordic region. Around the  world is an internet-based  activity where the units in the  Group compete against each  other as teams. Altogether  over 6200 employees have  taken part.

During the course of 2010 the  Group's workforce was reduced by 370 full time  equivalents. Security and predictability. Comprehensive  agreements and administrative guidelines cre- ate security, predictability and structure during  Norway Post's restructuring processes. Norway  Post has contractual internal framework condi- tions at the highest level for the implementation  of restructuring processes as well as specific  agreements for solving all issues through the in- ternal job market and voluntary solutions. These  agreements specify the rules for periods of no- tice and minimum periods for the provision of  information before reorganisations that result  in a reduction in the workforce of the parent  company. (GRI LA 5) attractive workplace. One of Norway Post's  main aims is to be an attractive workplace. The  annual employee satisfaction survey shows  that the Group has a stable and good working  environment. In 2010 the Group achieved a to- tal score of 76 which is the same as in 2009. If  we include the new companies which were not  included in the survey in 2009 the total score  for 2010 was 75. Participation in the employee  satisfaction survey was extremely high in 2010.  In all some 94 percent of employees completed  the survey.  better training. Through collaboration with the  Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research  and VOX, around 100 employees of the Group  completed a course in basis competence dur- ing 2010 (Norwegian, reading and writing, maths  and basic IT). Language tuition is one of the most  important ways to integrate employees with a  different cultural background into the Group. In  2010, 40 percent of the course participants had  immigrant backgrounds. Pensions and employee insurance. Employees of  Norway Post have favourable pension and em- ployee insurance schemes. In 2010 important  work was carried out which ensured that Nor- way Post's employees had their earned pensions  safeguarded in accordance with new pension  legislation introduced in 2010 in Norway.  talent and employee development. The further  development of the Group's talent programme  underscores the continued focus on talent and  employee development. The methods of find- ing and evaluating managers in the Group have  been improved. An annual process of manage- ment evaluation has been established for the  respective management groups (LeaderReview).  Despite the financial crisis the programmes for  trainees and summer internships were also car- ried out in 2010 with the recruitment of seven  trainees and four candidates for summer in- ternships. online training. The Group has a website for  courses and training – the Academy. This has  been developed further into a new e-learning  portal. As one of the first training courses in  the new e-learning portal, a Group-wide intro- duction programme for new employees will be  initiated in 2011. The Group continues its focus  on certificates of apprenticeship by making  arrangements for placement candidates and  bringing in apprentices. In addition, 42 grants  were given to employees in 2010 to raise their  formal competence. improvement award. As part of the Group's  focus on promoting a culture of continuous im- provement, a specific improvement award was  established in 2010 - in total four prizes have  been awarded internally for initiatives that have  made an excellent contribution to documentable  improvement. Colourful community. In 2010 Norway Post  marked the tenth anniversary of "Racism-free  Zone", a collaboration between Norwegian Peo- ples Aid, Postkom and Norway Post. By being a  declared racism-free zone the Group is obliged  to work actively against racism and treat all  incidences of discrimination seriously. No inci- dences of discrimination were recorded in 2010.  The Group's employee satisfaction survey which  measures employees' contentment at work has  contained the statement "Discrimination does  mot take place in my unit" since 2005. The re- sponse values have risen from 5.9 to 6.1 on a  scale of 1-7. This increase suggests that sev- eral more employees must have systematically  responded in a more positive manner for this  statement over the five year period. Neverthe- less Norway Post also sees room for improve- ment in this result which demands continued  focus. There is to be zero tolerance for discrimi- nation in the Norway Post Group. (GRI HR 4) mirroring society. As a workplace the Group  reflects the situation in Norway. 11 percent of  employees are immigrants or born to two immi- grant parents. (GRI LA13) It is a goal of the Group  to continue to reflect society in the future. The  Group has an ambitious target for the diversity  of employees in the corporate staff units and  management in order to ensure that the Group  works to reflect society at all levels. The propor- tion of immigrants and those born to two im- migrant parents working in the staff units and  management is currently 3.7 percent. The Group  aims for this to be 7.5 percent by the end of 2015.  As part of this work to increase the proportion  of employees with immigrant backgrounds in the  staff units and management positions, an in- ternal development programme "You make the  difference" will be initiated in 2011 for a handful  of employees with immigrant backgrounds who  want to develop their careers. "The continuous improvement of HSE   work has been a common goal throughout   the entire Group." workiNG eNviroNmeNt 03 03 workiNG eNviroNmeNt develoPmeNt iN   iNCaPaCity for work  (Parent company) in % 1,47% siCk leave   (group) in % 7,9% 10 09 08 07 06 05  74 75 a future-oriented  eNviroNmeNtal Push Norway Post has ambitious environmental goals  and wants   to take a leading environmental position in its market. 2010 prepared   the way for new efforts and even more environmentally   efficient and sustainable operation.  eNviroNmeNt 03 03 eNviroNmeNt 74 75  76 77 The environment is one of the Group's focus  areas within corporate social responsibility.  As one of the Nordic region's biggest trans- port operators the impact of CO2 emissions  in particular is significant. We are therefore  actively working to reduce the extent to  which we affect the environment throughout  the Group's value chains. (GRI EN 26) Norway  Post's environmental vision is to "work in a  goal oriented manner to achieve environ- mentally efficient operations and sustainable  development - leading to our becoming the  world's most future-oriented mail and logis- tics group." 2010 was characterised of the  continuing good progress made by Norway  Post in its environmental work.  Strategy and action plans. In the autumn of  2009 the Group adopted a new strategy for  environmental work with the ambitious goal  of reducing CO2 emissions by 30 percent by  the end of 2015 compared with the 2008 fig- ures. In line with this strategy the Group pre- pared detailed action plans in 2010 for the  environmental area for each business area  - Mail, Logistics and Logistics Solutions.. The  plans apply for the period 2010-2015 and de- tail the environmental work to be carried out  and the effects this work has on CO2 emis- sions.  organisation. A Group-wide network works  together to ensure focused environmental  practices. In addition, there is a corporate  environmental team that ensures a system- atic and intergrated approach to this work. Collaboration. To solve the major environmen- tal challenges the Group faces, interaction be- tween companies, organisations, and research  institutes is key. Norway Post takes part in the  secretariat of the Business Climate Panel and  has adopted a Climate Promise. We safeguard  industry collaboration through our repre- sentatives in the International Post Corpo- ration and Post Europ. Both fora include the  reporting of climate impact for sector bench- marking and sharing of best practice amongst  members.  In 2010 Norway Post also became a member  of the Swan Purchasers' Club, which will help  the Group make the most environmentally  conscious choices when purchasing products  and services. better city climate. As one of many actors  the Group wishes to contribute to a better  city climate. In August 2010 Norway Post's  Group CEO launched CO2-free postal delivery  in Trondheim - the first of its kind. In Decem- ber Norway Post, together with several other  companies, signed a Business for a Better En- vironment agreement under the auspices of  Oslo Municipality. This collaboration shall con- tribute to Oslo Municipality achieving its envi- ronmental goals. Norway Post also takes part  in Cities of the Future which is a collaboration  between the authorities and the 13 biggest  town in Norway to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions. Bring is represented in Clean Truck.  This is an EU initiated coperation between  transport companies, vehicle manufactur- ers, fuel suppliers and Stockholm Municipality.  In addition the Group is represented in the  Network for Transport and Environment  (NTM) that works on the development of  standardised emission calculation methods  for the transport industry.  environmental certification and iSo 14001 Environmental certification provides clear  documentation of the environmental work  carried out by the individual unit and is an im- portant contribution to building the culture  of continuous improvement in Norway Post.  Norway Post has a total of 11 units that have  Eco-Lighthouse certification, 8 of these  were certified in 2010 including four large  terminals. The Group plans to have more cer- tifications in 2011. During 2010 the Group ex- perienced a large number of enquiries from  units in Norway Post wanting to be certified  and trained 4 Eco-lighthouse consultants to  meet this demand. 7 units have been certi- fied in accordance with the ISO 14001 stand- ard. Bring Express certified its operations in  Stockholm in 2010 and plans to certify the  rest of the Swedish operations of Bring Ex- press in 2011. improving land-use efficiency. Norway Post's  South-East Norway terminal opened in Feb- ruary 2010 and processes more than 60%  of mail volumes in Norway. The South-East  Norway terminal has enabled Oslo Akershus  Region to achieve a net improvement in  land-use efficiency approximately 10 000 m2  in 2010. The terminal also has a geo-energy  plant (thermal energy) that provides a signif- icant reduction in environmental emissions.  This is the first time that this type of tech- nology has been used in an industrial project  of this size in Norway. District heating from  a nearby bioenergy plant can also be used as  peak heating. Rail initiative. To help reduce the impact on  the environment the Group has long fo- cused on moving freight from air to road  and from road to rail. Norway Post achieved  an 80 percent share for rail in 2010 on those  Norwegian routes where it is possible to  replace trucks with trains. We are continu- ously working with customers to identify rail  transport solutions instead of road. "As one of many actors the Group wishes   to contribute to a better city climate." improvement:   iNCreased eNviroNmeN- tal ComPeteNCe The environmental competence of the  employees at Norway Post's Goods  Centre was greatly improved after an  increased focus on pre-sorting waste at  source and the environmental impact of  the centre was reduced significantly. Action: All managers took the Environ- mental Diploma, and a '5-S system' was  introduced which entailed standardising,  structuring, scrubbing, systemising and  sorting. A waste sorting poster consist- ing of 12 sorting fractions was created  and the centre followed up with monthly  audits of the 5-S system.  eNerGy CoNsumPtioN   (Gri eN 3 aNd 4)  (GigaJoules) source energy carrier  2010     Direct  Indirect vehicles1  diesel  1 660 574   Petrol  15 667   biodiesel (b100)  4 061   biodiesel (b30)  4 061 buildings  electricity    63 256   district heating    8 631   fuel oil  17 900   Gas  2 444 total    1 704 707  71 887 1 Only includes vehicles owned by the Group emissioNs to air (Gri eN 20)   in tonnes source  so2  No NmvoC  Co  Pm own vehicles  2,3  741,6  221,2  852,5  37,3 buildings  0.4  1.4  0.2  0.9  0.1 subcontractors1  45.2  4 704  508.2  1 310.5  161.5 total  47.9  5 446.9  729.6  2 163.9  199 1 includes leased vehicles and air, sea and rail freight.   owN vehiCles Parent company   2008  2 009  2 010 vans > 7.5 t  4755  4 601  4 876 euro 2  55  14  3 euro 3  263  272  124 euro 4  249  141  249 euro 5  51  105  83 mopeds  120  123  234 electric mopeds  3  47  100 electric jeeps      10 electric trolleys      80 biogas cars      1 other (electric cars)  2  2  total  5576  5 351  5 760 eNviroNmeNt 03 03 eNviroNmeNt U N E C E S S A R Y                                     C U S T O M E R   V A L U E                                   N E C E S S A R Y  78 79 emissioN rePortiNG iN aCCordaNCe with the GreeNhouse Gas  ProtoCol alternative vehicle strategy. The Group is ac- tively working to make use of vehicles and fuel  that emit less greenhouse gases. Norway Post  is focused on the continuous upgrading of its  vehicle fleet, a measure that helps to reduce  emissions. With regard to the age of the total  vehicle fleet, in the Group 18 percent of our  own vehicles are from 2009 and 2010 while 24  percent of leased vehicles are from 2009 and  2010. The Group collaborates with suppliers on  the development and testing of new and more  environmentally efficient vehicles. The plan is  for Norway Post to replace the car with alter- native means of transport on 1300 routes by  the end of 2015. This work has progressed well  in 2010 with the introduction of 80 electric  trolleys and 100 electric mopeds. In addition  10 electric jeeps, an electric van and a biogas  distribution vehicle are being tested to evalu- ate expanded use in other areas. Bring Express in the Nordic area uses bi- cycles for express deliveries in cities and has  a total of 63 bicycle couriers; 30 in Denmark,  15 in Sweden, 13 in Norway and 5 in Finland.  In Sweden Bring also has 35 biogas-fuelled  cars. In addition Bring Frigo is taking part in  the testing of a Volvo biogas/diesel hybrid in  Skne.  Co2. In 2010 the Group has worked to improve  data capture and reporting methods. This  primarily applies to foreign companies, sub- contractors and more precise vehicle distri- bution. This means that the carbon footprint  now includes emissions from all* operations  and that we report higher CO2 emissions than  in previous years. Nevertheless there is an  underlying reduction in CO2 emissions within  the areas we have previously reported. Using  the same reporting scope and methods as  in 2008, emissions were reduced by 6% up to  the end of 2010. As a result of the increased  reporting scope and improved methods, the  Group has established a new baseline based  on a total of 723 649 tonnes of CO2 in 2010*.  This forms the basis for further work on goals  and initiatives. The majority of emissions from  the Group come from transport subcontrac- tors. The Group has therefore worked to im- prove coperation with subcontractors  which entails environmental requirements  for purchasing and follow-up work during  contract periods.  energy. The Group recorded a 7 percent  reduction in electricity consumption from  2008. The proportion of district heating is  rising and is now 12 percent of total ener- gy consumption. This is based on the same  reporting scope as in 2008. Large parts of  the Group record their energy consump- tion through the EOS log which provides  a detailed picture of electricity consump- tion even as far as on an hourly basis. This  makes it possible to compare consumption  for terminals and in the coming year will help  to put a greater focus on energy efficiency  measures including the use of competitions  in connection with saving electricity. Nor- way Post has signed a contract with LOS  AS to guarantee that 100 per cent of the  electricity supplied to all Group companies  in Norway, Sweden and Denmark is renew- able energy.  Bring Frigo is testing LED lighting in its  cold store in Helsingborg – this has a double  positive effect as LED technology uses less  electricity and generates less heat in the  cold store. LED lighting will also be tested in  the Mail Division.

In 2010 the Group produced around  11 000 tonnes of waste. 88% of waste is recy- cled, either through material recycling or en- ergy recovery. Pre-sorting waste both saves  and earns the Group money and helps to re- duce environmental impact. The goal is to in- crease the proportion of pre-sorted waste to  91 percent by 2015. The Group is affiliated with  Green Dot which shall contribute to increased  recycling of packaging. Raising competence. Norway Post's employ- ees are the most important factor in reduc- ing our environmental impact. In 2010 the  Group continued its systematic work to give  all employees training in the environment, in- cluding through the Environmental Diploma.  The Environmental Diploma is an e-learning  programme that provides a fundamental in- troduction to different environmental issues.  In 2010 the number of people who completed  the Environmental Diploma grew by 2000, and  3500 employees are currently taking part in  the programme. Plans have been established  to complete the programme throughout the  entire organisation. The Group emphasises the importance of  training drivers in environmentally efficient  driving and this is undertaken on a continuous  basis. This has resulted in an average reduc- tion of fuel consumption of 5 percent. Other  training measures have also been created to  make it easier for managers to focus on the  environment in day-to-day work.  The Group has continuously drawn atten- tion to local environmental measures car- ried out throughout the entire organisation  through our intranet and Group staff news- paper. We have also entered into collaboration  with Cicero through which the informational  magazine Klima is available to all employees.  Environmental issues also created great en- thusiasm when this was a topic at one of the  Group Director's online meetings for all em- ployees. waste (Gri eN 22)  in tonnes  2 008  2 009  2 010 total waste volume  11 138  10 605 10 879 strategy and action plans.  3 747  4 110  4 914 wood  2 932  2 627  2 127 Plastic  334  295  409 Glass    2  6 metal    281  284 food waste    879  515 other (recovered)  1 657  435  564 residual waste (energy recovered)      701 residual waste (not recovered) 2 468  1 976  1 358 *waste data not available for parts of the Group waste (Gri eN 22)  in percent  2 008  2 009  2 010 total waste volume  100%  100%  100% strategy and action plans.  34%  39%  45% wood  26%  25%  20% Plastic  3%  3%  4% Glass      metal    3%  3% food waste    8%  5% other (recovered)  15%  4%  5% residual waste (energy recovered)      6% residual waste (not recovered) 22%  19%  12% *waste data not available for parts of the Group "Norway Post's employees are the most important   factor in reducing our environmental impact." eNviroNmeNt 03 03 eNviroNmeNt CLIMATE ACCOUNT AUDIT 2010 PoSten noRGe aS We have audited the climate accounts for Posten Norge AS for 2010. The HS&E director and Environment senior  management have the overall responsibility for the ongoing work with the climate accounts, and for creating system  boundaries, reporting platforms and consolidating figures in accordance with current standards. We have carried  out an overall review of the methods used and procedures for gathering figures, the use of factors, sources and  core rules, and have based our statement on these. The climate accounts have been prepared in accordance with the principles of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol,  and consist of Scopes 1, 2 and 3. The calculations take into account the most important greenhouse gases, in addi- tion to other significant emissions to the air. The accounts include figures for the Norway Post group in total, figures  for the individual divisions, business areas and companies, as well as other environmental statistics such as waste,  and a list of the vehicle fleet. Norway Post has carried out emission calculations for the divisions Post (including the business areas Distribution,  Chain Operations, Dialog, Bring Citymail Sweden and Administration), logistics (including the business areas Cargo,  Parcels (formerly PNL), Ptt, Supply Chain and Administration), logistic Solutions (including the business areas  Express, Frigo, Warehousing, Denmark, Supply Services and Administration) and Posten norge aS with the Group  Administration. We have carried out the audit in such a way as to ensure to a reasonable level of confidence that the accounts do  not containing any significant misinformation. Our examination includeed checks of selected parts of the internal  and external documentation that support the information given in the accounts, and an assessment of compliance  with the methods and sources used. our assessment: the climate accounts have been prepared in accordance with the GHG protocols principles and, in our opinion,  provide a realistic description of the companies activities and emission sources. Calculation model: Norway Post has developed a customised solution for data collection from each unit, summaris- ing and linking to sources and factors. The calculation model and solution in its entirety appears clear, efficient and  transparent. There is space to include more items and companies in the accounts in the future. Quality: Norway Post has given a subjective quality assessment of all of the collected figures, and each unit has been  given the task of assessing data quality on a tripartite scale. A clear division of responsibility has been developed for  overall quality assurance in the process. In our opinion, this result is in agreement with our assessment of the source  material. Sources: Selection of sources and factors has been made on a conservative basis. To the extent that they are  available, national emission factors have been used. In cases where emissions are not country-specific, acknowled- ged international factors, with references to sources, have been used. The system permits factors to be updated as  required. In our opinion, our audit provides an adequate basis for our statement.

One of the aims in creating the  integrity programme was to be able to com- municate clearer to all employees the demands  for integrity and responsible behaviour made  of each individual employee. Specific examples  are also given in the programme of typical ethi- cal dilemmas related to integrity as well as how  these can be handled. An important part of the  programme is also to formalise the demands  Norway Post makes of its suppliers and busi- ness partners with regard to ethical standards/ integrity.  1. ComPetenCe  e-learning course. The integrity programme will  include an interactive e-learning programme for  employees in the Group that will help to ensure  the employees' competence in important areas.  The programme builds on and takes as its basis  the issues covered by Norway Post's integrity  handbook (see below), including corruption and  conflicts of interest. The e-learning course will,  together with the handbook, make a further  contribution to making the individual aware  of specific and relevant dilemmas. The course  shall be interactive and interesting, and invite  reflection and discussion on typical dilemmas  related to the specific integrity issues. The e- learning course will be available in Norwegian,  Swedish and English, and its implementation  is planned for the second half of 2011 (GRI SO  3 and HR 3 – partial reporting). In addition to  the e-learning programme other forms of  relevant training will be given on an ongoing  basis in the individual units within the Group,  and this will be more aimed at the specific re- quirements of the individual unit. Handbook. An important part of integrity work  is the creation of a handbook with which the  Group's employees will be obliged to become  familiar. The integrity handbook shall be a tool  and basis for managers and employees in the  continuous work to ensure a high level of integ- rity in all parts of the Group. The handbook will  also provide guidance on the demands made of  the Group's suppliers and business partners.  The handbook contains a number of topics re- lated to integrity, such as for example corrup- tion (including facilitation payments, gifts and  representational costs), conflicts of interest,  fair competition and social dumping. The hand- book will be available in Norwegian, Swedish and  English, and its completion and implementa- tion is expected in the second quarter of 2011   (GRI SO 3 and HR 3 – partial reporting) 2. SuPPlieR manaGement ethical standard for suppliers. Ensuring a  standard for integrity in the Group also entails  demands being made of the Group's suppliers  and business partners. As a part of the integ- rity programme Norway Post has therefore  formalised an ethical standard for the Group's  suppliers and business partners. The standard  builds upon Norway Post's integrity standard  and is conditional upon compliance with funda- mental ethical standards regarding corruption,  human rights, workers' rights, fair competition  and the environment. The aim is to contrib- ute to Norway Post's suppliers and business  partners meeting Norway Post's own ethical  standard.  Suppliers must submit a declaration that  gives Norway Post the right to check that they  comply with the ethical standard, including the  right to request the necessary documentation  and the right to carry out announced or unan- nounced checks. The declaration will be used for  all supplier and cooperation agreements en- tered into in the future (GRI HR 2).  the Group's standard for  iNteGrity in 2010 Norway Post began work on an  'integrity Programme' to increase awareness of the  Group's standard for integrity. deClaratioN of suPPort 03 03 iNteGrity Norway Post became  a member of Global  Compact in March  2010. The application  letter sent to Ban Ki- moon underlines Nor- way Post's support of  Global Compact.

Gri iNdex 03 03 Gri iNdex 86 87  88 89 notes 04 GENERAL norway Post was established as a company on 1 De- cember 1996 and is today a limited liability company  that is 100 percent owned by the state through the  norwegian Ministry of transport.  DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROUP since it was formed the Group has strengthened its  position by making acquisitions in all segments.  From  2008 to 2010 the following changes have been made  to the Group's structure: Separation of operations from Norway Post from  2008 - 2010 In 2008 Posten norge As further established two  new subsidiary companies, Posten eiendom Alnabru  As and Posten eiendom storbyer As with the pur- pose of developing and investing in property. During  september these companies took over the proper- ties Postens Godssenter, Postens transportsenter  and Postens Verksteder in oslo and the properties  Post terminal in stavanger and Post terminal in  trondheim respectively in a group demerger-merger  from Posten eiendom Reorganisering II As, which had  previously been demerged from Posten norge As. From 2008 -  until the present day in 2011 the fol- lowing companies were established, merged, bought  or sold in the groups various segments Mail Segment:  2008: During the second quarter Posten norge As  and the Finnish company Itella established a new  company within the information logistics market. the  Itella Information As company is 51% owned by Itella  and 49% by Posten norge As. 2009: During the fourth quarter of 2009 it was  decided that the operations of Bring Citymail Den- mark A/s would be wound up. As part of efforts to  reorganise the ownership structure Posten norge  As in november 2009 acquired all the shares of Bring  City Mail sweden AB and Bring Mail nordic AB from  Bring Citymail AB. 2010: In February 2010, the company Posten eiendom  espehaugen As was sold to tine BA. the 49% stake  in Itella Information As was sold in september 2010. Logistics Segment: 2008: During the first quarter Bring Logistics  solutions sold the company Grenland transport  & Industriservice As.  During the second quarter  Posten norge As bought all the shares in the swed- ish logistics group Combitrans and Bring Cargo As  (formerly Bring Logistics As) bought all the shares  in the norwegian logistics company Bring Logistics  sunnmre As (formerly emdal transport & spedisjon  As). During the third quarter Bring express suomi oy  bought the Finnish logistics company Lhettiryhm.   Posten norge As also bought the remaining 50%  of shares in Bring Parcels As (formerly Pan nordic  Logistics AB) which thus became a wholly-owned  subsidiary.  In the fourth quarter Bring Cargo As  (formerly Bring Logistics As) bought all the shares in  the British logistics company Bring Logistics UK Ltd. 2009: In December 2009 Posten norge As Group  acquired the remaining shares in the four companies  Bring Cargo stockholm AB, Bring Cargo Gteborg AB,  Bring Cargo Linkping AB and Bring Cargo Jnkping  AB (formerly Bring Logistics stockholm AB, Bring  Logistics Gteborg AB, Bring Logistics Linkping  AB and Bring Logistics Jnkping AB) from Bring  Cargo Halmstad AB and Bring Cargo Jnkping ABI  (formerly Bring Logistics Halmstad AB and Bring  Logistics Jnkping AB). As a further simplification  of the group structure Posten norge As subsidi- ary Cetei AB was, during the year, merged into its  wholly-owned subsidiary Combitrans AB which is  now directly owned by Posten norge As. Bring Cargo  sweden AB (formerly Bring Logistics sverige AB) was  sold by Bring Logistics Denmark A/s to Combitrans  AB in December 2009. In addition FsD HoldCo AB and  FsD newCo AB became part of Bring Frigoscandia  AB through a downstream merger, and the company  is now directly owned by Posten norge As. Bring  Logistics Linehaul As was established in 2009 to  develop competitive solutions for line haul for the  business areas of Bring and external customers. 2010: In March Bring Logistics Linehaul As estab- lished two new subsidiaries in sweden and Germany,  Bring Logistics Linehaul AB and Bring Logistics Line- haul GMBH. Bring Cargo As (formerly Bring Logistics  As) sold the wholly-owned subsidiary Breivika Indus- triveg 33A As in July 2010. the Group established the  company Bring Denmark A/s in november 2010. As  part of the simplification of the Group's structure  Bring express Helsinki oY was merged into Bring  express suomi oY and Bring express Jnkping AB  and Bring express rebro AB were both merged into  Bring express sweden AB. 2011:  Bring Frigo (formerly Bring Frigoscandia)  will take over Coldsped's cold storage business in  sweden with effect from 01.04.2011. the acquisi- tion covers the facilities in rebro, Jordbro, Kalmar,  Kristanstad, eslv and Malm.  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES the consolidated financial statements and financial  statements of norway Post As have been prepared  in accordance with prevailing International Financial  Reporting standards (IFRs), which have been deter- mined by the International Accounting standards  Board and approved by the eU.  the financial statements have been prepared on  the basis of historical costs. Financial instruments  that are classified as fair value through profit or  loss or available for sale are assessed at their fair  value. 1. Changes in accounting principles  and note disclosures the accounting policies applied are consistent  with previous years, with the exception of changes  resulting from implementing the following revised  standards from the IAsB which has taken effect and  been adopted by the eU:   IAs 27 (revised) - Consolidated and separate  Financial statements: the standard provides  clarifications and further guidelines relating to  accounting for the disposal of an investment in a  subsidiary. If the group loses control over a subsidi- ary, any remaining ownership share in the former  subsidiary shall be measured at fair value, and the  profit or loss must be recognised in the income  statement. the standard also requires any losses  to be distributed between the controlling and the  non-controlling party so that a deficit be charged  to the non-controlling party (minority shareholder)  even if this results in the non-controlling interest  having a deficit balance. In addition, the adoption of the following standards  in 2010 did not impact the accounts in the period  of initial implementation but will affect the Group's  financial statements in the future: - IFRs 3 (revised) - Business Combinations: the  changes in this standard will affect the calculation of  goodwill and contingent compensation for acquisi- tions, the recognition of expenses related to acquisi- tions and changes in ownership shares in a subsidiary.  the standard has not been applied retrospectively to  previous acquisitions. the following new standards and clarifications have  been applied by the Group with effect from 2010  without significant impact on the financial state- ments:   Changes to IAs 39 Financial instruments – recogni- tion and measurement – eligible hedged Items   IFRIC 16 - Hedging of net investment in foreign  operations   IFRIC 17 - Distribution of non-cash assets to  owners    Annual improvement project (April 2009) - IAs 7  regarding Financial instruments - clarification that  only expenses that are capitalised shall be included  in the cash flow from investment activities.  2. Adopted standards that are not yet effective or  lacked approval by EU  the following standards and statements that are  relevant to norway Post have been issued but have  yet to take effect or lack approval by the eU for the  2010 financial year:   IAs 24 - Related party disclosures  IFRs 9  - Financial instruments (new)   Annual improvement project (May 2010) - IAs 1 –  Presentation of Financial statements these standards are not used by norway Post in this  year's financial statements.  3. Estimates the financial statements have been prepared    in accordance with IFRs. this means   that management has used estimates and   assumptions that have affected assets,  liabilities, incomes, expenses and information on  potential liabilities. Areas in which such   estimates are significant include pensions, goodwill,  trademarks, other intangible assets, tangible fixed  assets, restructuring provisions and other provi- sions.  there is uncertainty linked to the assessment of  the recorded values for goodwill and other intangi- ble assets. this applies in particular to assumptions  and parameters in connection with the estimation  of future cash flows when evaluating write-down  amounts and the choice of discount rate when cal- culating the present value of the cash flows. other  intangible assets mainly comprise It development  and It projects under development. there is also uncertainty related to the estimation  of pension obligations, and uncertainty especially  related to a defined benefit scheme including the  AFP schemes for norway Post and norwegian  subsidiaries. this uncertainty is related to any  discrepancy between actuary estimates, including  demographic assumptions used as the basis in  calculating pensions and final outcomes.  Future  events may lead to the estimates changing. the  changes will be recognised when a new estimate is  determined. the same applies to write-down   assessments for tangible fixed assets.  Restructuring provisions and other provisions are  inherently uncertain with regard to the liability's  settlement date and settlement value. 4. Presentation currency  the groups presentation currency is noK, which  is also the parent companys functional currency.  For consolidation purposes, balance sheet figures  for subsidiaries that use a different currency  have been translated at the rate applicable on  NOTES 04  90 91 notes 04 04 notes the balance-sheet date and subsidiaries income  statements have been translated at the average  exchange rate for each month. translation dif- ferences are included as other income or costs  directly included in equity. translation differences  are included in the translation differences fund  (see note 19). If a foreign subsidiary is sold, the  accumulated translation differences linked to the  subsidiary are recognised in the income statement.  5. Consolidation principles the consolidated financial statements show the  total financial results and financial position of the  parent company, norway Post, and the companies  in which norway Post has a controlling influence. A  controlling influence is normally achieved when the  group owns, either directly or indirectly, more than  50 per cent of the shares in the company or is able  to exercise actual control over the company.  the consolidated financial statements have been  prepared using uniform accounting principles for  similar transactions and other events provided  the circumstances are otherwise the same. Items  in the income statement and balance sheet have  been classified according to uniform definitions.  All significant intercompany transactions and  balances, including internal profits and unrealised  gains and losses, have been eliminated. 5.1 Consolidation principles Subsidiaries Companies in which the Group has control (sub- sidiaries) are fully consolidated line by line in the  consolidated financial statements. the acquisition  method has been used for recognising acquired  enterprises. Companies bought during the year are  incorporated in the financial statements from their  acquisition date, while companies that are sold are  included in the financial statements until the date  when they are sold.  In the event of the sale of a  stake in a subsidiary leading to a loss of control and  thus the disposal of the subsidiary the remaining  investment is measured at fair value at the time  of the transaction. Any change in the value of the  part not realised is also recognised in the income  statement. the fair value of the remaining stake is  considered to be the new acquisition cost for this  investment. Added value on the purchase of enterprises is allo- cated to identifiable asset and liability items on the  acquisition date. Added value that is not allocated  to asset and liability items is classified as goodwill  in the balance sheet. should negative goodwill arise  from the transfer of operations, the identifica- tion and measurement of identifiable assets and  liability items is reassessed. Any negative goodwill  that arises following this reassessment is taken to  income immediately.  When agreements for additional compensation  are entered into when companies are acquired the  amount of additional compensation is measured  at fair value and included in the acquisition costs  at the time of acquisition. the change in value of  the additional compensation is only recognised  as goodwill if the change is within a "12 month  window" and is a result of new or changed facts  and circumstances that did not exist at the time of  acquisition.  other changes in value of the additional  compensation are recognised in the income state- ment. Adjustments are assessed at the exchange  rate on the balance sheet date or alternatively at  the rate when determined if this differs from the  balance sheet date.  the minority interests share of the equity is shown  in a separate line in the groups equity. the minority  interests include the minority interests' share of  the balance sheet value of subsidiaries, including  their share of the identified added values on the  date when a subsidiary is acquired. the Group did  not acquire any subsidiaries in 2010 and the use of  alternative valuation methods for minority interests  in accordance with IFRs 3R has therefore not yet  been appropriate. the minority interests share of  the net income is shown in the income statement  after tax costs and total profit.   the principle changes in IAs 27 and IFRs 3 are of  little significance with regard to understanding the  Group's corresponding figures as there were only  minor transactions in the Group in 2008 and 2009.    5.2 Consolidation principles Associated companies An associated company is defined as a company  in which the group has a considerable influence. A  considerable influence normally exists when the  group owns 20-50 per cent of the voting capital.   shares in associated companies are recognised  according to the equity method. the principle for  classifying the Group's share of the associated  company's net income has changed. this share was  previously classified as a financial entry, but with ef- fect from 2010 is classified as an operational entry.  the corresponding figures have been adapted  accordingly. 5.3 Consolidation principles   Discontinued operations the post-tax profits for a discontinued operation  that represent a separate and significant opera- tion are presented on a separate line in the income  statement together with the gains or loss after  taxes from the sale of the operation. the cor- responding figures for earnings have been restated  in the same way, while the corresponding figures for  the balance sheet and cash flow statment have not  been restated. 5.4 Consolidation principles   Held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale when they  have been designated for sale, are expected to be  sold within a period of one year and an active sales  process has begun. If the Group has committed to a plan for sale which  entails the loss of control over a subsidiary, all as- sets and obligations of the subsidiary are classified  as held for sale regardless of whether or not the  company will maintain a non-controlling interest in  its former subsidiary following the sale. Assets which meet the criteria to be classified as  held for sale are valued at whichever is the lower of  their balance sheet value and their fair value after  deducting sales costs. such assets are no longer  amortised.  Assets which meet the criteria to be classified as  held for sale are presented separately in the bal- ance sheet and the results of discontinued opera- tions are presented separately in the statement of  comprehensive income. 6. Segment reporting Reporting segments are aggregated from un- derlying operating segments on the basis of an  assessment of the risks and yields relating to the  types of products, services, production processes,  customer groups, distribution channels and statu- tory or other requirements, as well as management  reporting. the division of reporting segments has  been prepared in accordance with areas whose  operating results are reviewed regularly by norway  Post's board so that the board can decide which  resources will be allocated to the segment and  assess its earnings.  the segments accounting principles are the same  as those used to prepare and present the consoli- dated financial statements.  7. Revenues Revenues are recognised once they have been  earned. this means that there are transactions or  other factors which will generate financial benefits  that can be measured reliably. sales revenues are  presented net of value added tax and discounts.  In all segments revenues from the sale of goods  and services are recognised on the date when the  products or services are delivered to the customer,  and when the risk has been transferred and an  account receivable has been established in relation  to the customer. 7.1. Revenues Mail Segment the segment's revenues are generated from the  sale of letter products, small packages, post- age stamps, banking services, product sales and  dialogue services:      the sale of stamps is considered advance pay   ment for the sale of postal services, and recog      nised when the service delivery occurs.    Franking machines (pre-paid   franking)  are taken to income on the basis of   the customer's postage consumption   other sales of postage are billed and taken to     income when letter products are delivered   Fees for banking services are recognised on the                basis of performed banking services    International mail within ordinary   terminal charge agreements are taken to income  based on the calculation of volumes and current  prices, and adjusted the following year when the  final prices are received from the International  Post Cooperation.    Dialogue services, including precise target        groups, addresses, outsourcing services within    sales, customer service and customer-oriented    marketing, are taken to income at the time the    service is delivered and the risk is transferred to      the customer.    Revenue for parcels is recognised   when the package is delivered     sales of goods are taken to income when the  goods are delivered and the risk transferred to  the customer     According to norway Post's license, additional  costs incurred as a result of the licensing require- ments are covered by exclusive rights and/ or  profits and/or government purchases of commer- cially unprofitable services. Government payment  for unprofitable operations are recognised when  the allocated funds are received, limited to an  amount equal to this year's estimated additional  costs regarding licensing requirements reduced  by income from exclusive profit.  7.2. Revenues Logistics Segment the segment's revenues are generated by trans- portation and warehouse services:  - transport services cover courier and express  services and the transportation of letters, packages,  goods and temperature-controlled deliveries and  are taken to income at the time the service is deliv- ered and the risk is transferred to the customer. - Warehouse services cover storage, handling and  picking-up services in addition to the unloading  of vehicles, sealing of pallets, installation/repair of  equipment and construction of sales pallets, and are  taken to income at the time the service is delivered  and the risk is transferred to the customer. 8. Pensions the group has both defined contribution and  defined benefit pension schemes. the net pension  expenses for the defined benefit pension schemes  comprise the pension contributions during the  period, including future salary increases and the  interest expense on the estimated pension liability,  less the contributions from employees and estimat- ed yield on the pension assets. the premium for the  defined contribution pension schemes is charged to  expenses as incurred. Prepaid pensions correspond to the difference be- tween the estimated pension fund and the present  value of estimated pension liabilities, minus changes  in estimates and pension schemes not recognised in  the income statement. Prepaid pensions are classi- fied as a long-term asset in the balance sheet if it is  likely that the excess value can be utilised or repaid.  similarly, when pension liabilities exceed pension  assets, the difference is classified as a long-term  liability. the recognition of pension funds is limited  to its present value of all financial benefits that  materialise in terms of refunds from the scheme or  reductions in future contributions to the scheme. the net pension expenses are classified as payroll  expenses in the income statement except from  the interest element, which is classified as financial  income/financial expenses. Changes in the pension  liabilities that are due to pension plan changes are  amortised in a straight line over the estimated  average remaining accrual period apart from rights  accrued on the change date, which are immediately  charged to expenses. Changes in pension liabilities  and pension assets, which are due to changes in,  and deviations from, the calculation assumptions  (deviations from estimates), and which exceed 10  per cent of whichever is the greater of the pension  liabilities and pension assets at the beginning of the  year, are amortised in a straight line over the aver- age expected remaining service lives of the current  employees (corridor solution). non-amortised de- viations in estimates and pension scheme changes  are stated in note 3.  For the transition to new pension schemes the  effect of the settlement of former schemes is pre- sented on a separate line in the income statement.  If the transitions is due to an amendment to the law  the effect is measured at the time of the adoption  of the amended law.  9. Taxes taxes include taxes payable for the period and  changes in deferred taxes/tax assets. taxes pay- able are calculated on the basis of the earnings  before tax. the net deferred tax/tax asset is  calculated on the basis of temporary differences  between accounting and tax values and tax losses  carried forward at the end of the financial year, with  the exception of:    deferred tax which arises as a result of goodwill  impairments that are not tax deductible   temporary differences relating to investments  in subsidiaries or associates because the group  management itself decides when the temporary  differences will be reversed, and it is assumed that  this will not take place in the foreseeable future tax-increasing and tax-reducing temporary differ- ences that are reversed or can be reversed are off- set against each other. taxes are not offset across  national borders. A deferred tax asset is recognised  when it is probable that the company will have suf- ficient earnings before tax to utilise the tax asset.  Deferred tax and deferred tax assets that can be  capitalised are recognised at their nominal value  and netted in the balance sheet. taxes payable and  deferred tax are directly included in comprehensive  income or recognised directly in equity to the extent  that they relate to factors that have been included  or recognised in this way.  10. Tangible fixed assets  tangible fixed assets are recognised in the balance  sheet at their acquisition cost after deducting ac- cumulated depreciation and write-downs. the cost  price of fixed assets is their purchase price, including  duties/taxes and direct acquisition costs related  to making the fixed asset ready for use. For larger  investments involving a long manufacturing period,  interest is capitalised as a part of the acquisition  cost. the cost price of fixed assets is broken down  when the fixed asset consists of components that  have different economic lives. Costs relating to  normal maintenance and repairs are charged to  expenses when incurred. Costs relating to replace- ments and renewals which significantly increase the  economic life of the fixed assets are recognised in  the balance sheet. Facilities under construction are classified as fixed  assets and recognised at the accrued costs relating  to the fixed asset. tangible fixed assets are depreciated in a straight  line over their estimated economic life. Depreciation  starts from the date when the tangible fixed asset  is put into ordinary operations. Depreciation takes  the fixed assets scrap value into account. Both the  remaining economic life and the scrap value are  assessed annually. Facilities under construction are  not depreciated. 11. Investment property Investment property is defined as land and build- ings that are rented out, investment objects only,  or whose future use has not yet been determined.  these assets are not used in the company's  operations. In accordance with IAs 40 Investment  Property, investment assets are assessed according  to the cost model and valued in accordance with the   requirements stated in IAs 16 Property, Plant and  equipment.  12. Intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised in the balance  sheet if probable future economic benefits can be   92 93 notes 04 04 notes proven and attributed to the asset and the assets  cost price can be reliably estimated. Intangible  assets with a specific economic life are recog- nised in the balance sheet at their acquisition cost  after deducting accumulated amortisation and  impairments. Acquisition costs also include salary  expenses if the recognition criteria are fulfilled.  Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefi- nite lifetime are not amortised but are assessed for  impairment each year. Refer to the more detailed  description under impairments Intangible assets  that have not been taken into use are also tested  for impairment. 12.1. Intangible assets Development costs  the groups development costs mainly relate to the  development of It systems intended for use in the  groups services and, to some extent, for sales and  licensing. Development costs are recognised in the  balance sheet if all of the following criteria are met:   the product or process is clearly defined and cost     elements can be identified and measured reliably   the products technical solution has been dem- onstrated    the product or process will be sold or used in the    operations    the asset will generate future economic benefits    sufficient technical, financial and other resources  are available for completing the project If all the criteria are met, the expenses relating to  development work will be recognised in the balance  sheet. otherwise, the costs will be expensed as they  arise.  12.2 Intangible assets Trademarks  Costs relating to proprietary intangible assets  in the form of trademarks are expensed as they  are incurred because they cannot be identified  and separated from the total cost relating to the  development of the company as a whole. Identified  trademarks at the time of acquisition of a company  are recognised in the balance sheet. trademarks  with a specific economic life are amortised over this  economic life, while trademarks with an indefinite  economic life are tested for impairment annually  but are not amortised. 12.3. Intangible assets Goodwill Added value on the acquisition of an enterprise  that cannot be allocated to asset or liability items  on the acquisition date is classified as goodwill in  the balance sheet. With investments in associated  companies, goodwill is included in the cost price of  the investment.  13. Shares in subsidiaries norway Posts annual financial statements apply the  cost method to shares in subsidiaries. transac- tion costs relating to acquisitions made before  01.01.2010 are also included in the cost price.  Following the introduction of IFRs 3R on 1.1.2010,  transaction costs relating to future acquisitions will  be expenses and this not be included in the share  value for such acquisitions. 14. Financial instruments the initial valuation of financial instruments is based  on their fair value on the settlement date, normally  the transaction price. Financial assets are catego- rised as fair value through profit or loss, available  for sale, or loans/receivables. Financial obligations  are categorized as fair value through profit or loss  or other obligations.       Financial assets and liabilities that are held with  the intention of making money on short-term  fluctuations in price (held for trading purposes)  or which are recognised according to the fair  value option are classified as fair value through  profit or loss.     All other financial assets apart from loans and  receivables originally issued by the company are  classified as available for sale.   All other financial liabilities are classified as other  liabilities and recognised at their amortised cost. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair  value of financial investments classified as available  for sale are recognised directly in equity until the  investment has actually been sold. the accumu- lated gain or loss on the financial instrument that  was previously recognised in equity will then be  reversed and the gain or loss will be recognised in  the income statement.    Changes in the fair value of financial instruments  classified as fair value through profit or loss (held  for trading purposes or a fair value option) are  recognised and presented in the financial income/ expenses.  Financial instruments are recognised in the bal- ance sheet when the group has become a party  to the instrument's contractual terms. Financial  instruments are removed from the balance sheet  when the contractual rights or obligations have  been fulfilled, cancelled, expired or transferred.  Financial instruments are classified as long-term  when their expected realisation date is more than  12 months after the balance sheet date. other  financial instruments are classified as short-term.   14.1. Financial instruments Hedging Before a hedging transaction is carried out, it is  assessed whether a derivative is to be used to a)  hedge the fair value of an asset or liability, b) hedge  a future cash flow from an investment, debt pay- ment or future identified transaction, or c) hedge a  net investment in a foreign entity. the groups criteria for classifying a derivative  as a hedging instrument are as follows: (1) the  hedge is expected to be very effective in that it  counteracts changes in the fair value of or cash  flows from an identified asset or liability, and a  hedging effect that is within a range of 80-125%  is expected, (2) the effectiveness of the hedge can  be measured reliably, (3) there is adequate docu- mentation at the time when the hedge is entered  into showing that the hedge is very effective, (4)  for cash flow hedges, the forthcoming transac- tion must be very likely, (5) the hedge is evaluated  regularly and has proven to be effective during  the reporting periods when the hedge has been  intended to exist. 14.1.1. Hedging Fair value Derivatives that form part of fair value assess- ments are assessed at their fair value and changes  in the fair value are recognised in the income  statement. Changes in the fair value of the hedged  object are similarly recognised in the income state- ment. the hedge is no longer recognised when: (a) the hedging instrument falls due or is sold,  terminated or exercised, or (b) the hedge does not meet the above-mentioned  requirements for hedges    14.1.2.Hedging Cash flows Changes in the fair value of a hedging instrument  in a qualifying cash flow hedges are recognised  as other income or expense directly in equity. the  ineffective part of the hedge instrument is recog- nised directly in the income statement.    If the hedged cash flow results in an asset or liabil- ity being recognised, all relevant gains and losses  in equity are transferred from the equity and  included in the initial measurement of the asset  or liability.  In the case of other cash flow hedges,  gains and losses that were directly recognised in  equity are transferred to the income statement in  the same period as the cash flow that comprises  the hedged object is recognised. When a hedging  instrument ceases to be very effective, the hedge  ceases to be recognised in the accounts. In such  a case, the accumulated gain or loss on a hedging  instrument in equity will not be reversed until the  hedged transaction actually takes place. If the  hedged transaction is no longer expected to take  place, formerly accumulated gains or losses on the  hedging instrument in equity will be reversed and  recognised in the income statement.   14.1.3. Hedging   Hedging of a net investment in a foreign entity the company takes positions in various currencies  in order to hedge its net investment in foreign  entities. Changes in the currency derivatives  that are decided on for hedging purposes are  reported together with translation differences in  the groups equity until any sale of the investment,  following which the accumulated translation differ- ences relating to the investment are recognised in  the income statement. that part of the hedge which is not effective is  expensed directly. 14.2. Financial instruments   Derivatives that are not hedging instruments Derivatives that are not classified as hedging  instruments are classified as held for trading  purposes and assessed at their fair value. Changes  in the fair value of such derivatives are recognised  in the income statement. A derivative that is embedded into other contracts  will be separated from the original contract and  recognised as a derivative if the following condi- tions are met:   the underlying financial reality and risk relating  to the built-in derivative are not closely related  to the financial reality and risk relating to the  original contract   there is a separate instrument with the same  conditions as the built-in derivative that meets  the criteria for a derivative   the combined instrument (main contract and       built-in derivative) is not measured at its fair  value with changes in value recognised in the  income statement. 15. Impairments  A need to write-down exists if the carrying amount   of an assessment entity exceeds the units re- coverable amount. the recoverable amount is the  higher of the fair value less sales costs and the  value in use, where the value in use is the present  value of estimated cash flows relating to future  use. If the cash flows relating to the individual  asset are independent of cash flows relating to  other assets, the individual asset comprises the  assessment entity. If not, an assessment entity is  created at a higher level and called a cash-gener- ating unit. A cash-generating unit can also include  goodwill and a share of common assets, and is to  be consistently applied over time.  the group calculates future cash flows based on  estimated results (budgets and forecasts) over a  five-year forecast period adjusted for deprecia- tion, amortisation, investments and changes in  working capital. the extrapolation period contains  an extrapolation of the cash flows after the  forecast period, using a constant growth rate. the  present value of the cash flow is calculated using  a weighted required rate of return on the total  assets and is a pre-tax rate.  With the exception of goodwill, impairment losses  recognised in income statements for previous  periods are reversed if there is information that  the need to write-down no longer exists or is no  longer as great. However, reversal will not take  place if the reversal leads to the recognised value  exceeding what the recognised value would have  been if normal depreciation/amortisation periods  had been used.  15.1. Impairments Goodwill and other   assets with an indefinite life For goodwill, intangible fixed assets   with an indefinite economic life and intangible  assets that are currently being developed are  subject to an annual impairment test, irrespective  of whether or not there are any indications of a fall  in value. 15.2. Impairments Financial instruments Financial assets which are assessed at their am- ortised cost are written down when it is probable  that the company will not collect all the amounts   due to contractual factors relating to loans  and receivables. the impairment is recognised in  the income statement. Any reversal of previous  impairment is recognised if a decline in the need  to recognise an impairment can be related to an  event which took place after the impairment took  place. such a reversal is presented as an income.  However, an increase in  the balance sheet value  is only recognised to the extent that it does not  exceed what the amortised cost would have been if  no impairment had taken place. In the case of financial assets classified as  available for sale, the accumulated gain   or loss that has previously been recognised directly  in equity is recognised in the income statement for  the period when there is objective information on  the fall in value. A reversal of a former write-down is  recognised when there is new objective information  on an event related to the previous write-down.  the reversal of a previous write-down is recognised  in comprehensive income and directly in equity if it  relates to shares classified as available for sale, but  is recognised in the income statement if it relates  other financial assets.  15.3. Impairments   Other assets with a specific economic life the write-down of other assets with a specific  economic life will be considered when there are  indications of a fall in value.  16. Inventories Inventories are recognised at the lower of cost and  net sales price. the net sales price is assessed as  being the market price in the case of normal opera- tions less the costs of completion/sale, marketing  and distribution. Cost price is determined using the  FIFo method. obsolescent inventories are written  down to their estimated sales value. 17. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recognised at their nomi- nal value, which equals their amortised cost due to  their short economic life, taking bad debts into ac- count. should there be any objective evidence of a  fall in value, the difference between the recognised  value and the present value of future cash flows is  charged to expenses. 18. Cash and cash equivalents Cash includes cash in hand and at the bank. Cash  equivalents are short-term liquid investments that  can be converted into cash within three months  and at a known amount and which contain insignifi- cant risk elements.   19. Other equity In accordance with IAs 1(R) norway Post has cho- sen to present this year's total profit as a   separate statement. 19.1. Equity  Translation differences translation differences arise in connection with  exchange-rate differences when foreign entities  accounts are being consolidated. exchange-rate  differences relating to monetary items (debts or  receivables if settlements are neither planned nor  likely to occur within a short period of time) which  in reality are part of a companys net investment in  a foreign entity are treated as translation differ- ences. should a foreign entity be sold, the accumu- lated translation difference linked to the entity is  reversed and recognised in the income statement  in the same period as the gain or loss on the sale is  recognised.   19.2. Equity Hedging reserves the hedging reserve includes the total net change  in the fair value of the cash-flow hedges until the  hedged cash flow arises or is no longer expected to  arise. the hedging reserve is restricted equity. 19.3. Equity Fair value reserve the fair value reserve includes the total net  changes in the fair value of financial instruments  classified as available for sale until the investment  is sold or it is ascertained that the investment is of  no value. the fair value reserve is restricted equity. 19.4. Equity   Costs relating to equity transactions transaction costs linked to an equity transac- tion are recognised directly in equity after making  deductions for tax. other transaction costs are  recognised in the income statement.   20. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has  a prevailing liability (legal or assumed) as a result of   94 95 notes 04 04 notes an event that has taken place and it can be proven  probable (more probable than not) that there will  be a financial settlement as a result of the liability  and when the amount can be measured reliably.  Provisions are reviewed on each balance sheet date  and their level reflects the best estimate of the  liability. In the case of a considerable time delay, the  liability is recognised at the present value of future  cash flows. Uncertain liabilities assumed through  the acquisition of a company are recorded at their  fair value even if it is less than 50% likely that the  liability materialises. Probability and fair value is  assessed on an ongoing basis. Changes in fair value  are recognised in the income statement. 20.1. Provisions Restructuring Restructuring is defined as a planned programme  that considerably changes the scope of the opera- tions or the way in which the operations are carried  out, as well as severance pay in connection with  reorganisation. Provisions set aside for restructur- ing are expensed when the programme is decided  on and announced and the costs are identifiable,  quantifiable and not covered by corresponding  revenues. the restructuring costs include costs  relating to both personnel measures and vacated  premises. 21. Leasing  Leases are dealt with as either operational leases  or financial leases, based on a review of the actual  content of each individual lease.  A financial lease is  an agreement which transfers substantially all the  risks and rewards incident to ownership of the   underlying asset to the Group the group presents financial leases in the financial  statements as assets and liabilities, equal to the  cost price of the asset or, if lower, the present  value of the cash flow due in the lease. When cal- culating the present value of the lease, the implicit  interest rate in the lease is used when this can be  determined. Alternatively, the company's marginal  borrowing rate is used. the asset is depreciated in  the same way as the corresponding working capital.  the monthly rent is divided into an interest rate  element and a repayment element. In the case of operational leases, rents are classi- fied as an operating expense and recognised in the  income statement over the term of the lease. 22. Loans Loans are recognised as the net funds received  after deducting transaction costs. the loans are  then recognised at their amortised cost using the  effective interest method. Amortised cost means  the amount the financial obligation is valued at  when purchased, less repayments (for example  principal payment, interest and service charges),  plus effective interest and less any impairments.  23. Public subsidies subsidies from public authorities are not recog- nised until it is reasonably certain that the company  will meet the conditions set for receiving the  subsidies, and that the subsidies will be received.  Accounting for grants are subjected and amortized  over the same period as the cost of the subsidy is  intended to cover. subsidies are recognised as a  reduction in cost when they cover a specific cost.    24. Currency  transactions in foreign currencies are translated at  the exchange rate on the transaction date. on the  balance sheet date, financial assets and liabilities in  foreign currencies are translated at the exchange  rate applicable on the balance sheet date. the  income statement effects of changes in exchange  rates are presented as financial income or expense.  25. Contingent liabilities and assets Contingent liabilities include:     possible liabilities resulting from previous events  where the liabilitys existence depends on future  events    liabilities that have not been recognised because it  is not probable that they will lead to payment    liabilities that cannot be measured with sufficient  reliability Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the  annual financial statements unless they have been  acquired in a business acquisition. such obligations  are allocated for. significant contingent liabilities are  stated, apart from contingent liabilities where the  likelihood of the liability arising is slight. A contingent asset is not recognised in the annual  financial statements, but information on this is  provided if it is probable that a benefit will accrue  to the group. 26. Events occurring after the balance sheet date new information on the companys positions on  the balance sheet date is taken into account in the  annual financial statements. events taking place  after the balance sheet date that do not affect  the companys position on the balance sheet date  but which will affect the companys position in the  future are disclosed if significant. 27. Cash flow statement  the cash flow statement has been prepared on the  basis of the indirect model. Cash and cash equiva- lents consist of liquid assets, including liquid assets  linked to the sales network. (All figures described in the notes are presented in  noK millions if not otherwise stated). NOTE 1    SEGMENTS the division of reporting segments has been prepared in accordance with areas  whose operating results are reviewed regularly by Posten norge As board so  that the board can decide which resources will be allocated to the segment and  assess its earnings. Revenues, assets and investments are also reported on a  geographical basis, split between norway and Abroad depending on where the  revenue is generated/localised.  the Group had three segments in 2008 and 2009; Mail, Logistics and It. As a re- sult of the merger between ergoGroup As and eDB Business Partner AsA that  became effective on 30 september 2010 the Group no longer has an It segment  with effect from 2010. earnings figures are presented for continued segments  and corresponding figures for 2009 and 2008 have been restated accordingly.  Corresponding figures for the balance sheet and investments have not been  restated but area specified as discontinued operations.  The various segments contain the following:: Mail; letter products, banking services and dialogue services. the segment is  made up of the Mail Division including its subsidiaries Bring Citymail, Bring Mail  and Bring Dialog. Logistics; bulk and part load, parcels, warehousing, thermo and express. the  segment corresponds to the parent companys Logistics and Logistics solu- tions Divisions as the subsidiaries operating in these areas - Bring Cargo, Bring  Warehousing, Bring Frigo, Bring express, Bring Parcels, Combitrans and Bring  supply services. Group administration and common costs that are not defined as owner- related costs are allocated to the segments. owner-related costs include costs  relating to the Ceo/Board, accounting and finance, organisational development,  contact with the authorities, strategy and group information.

NOTE 2    PAyROLL EXPENSES AND OTHER REMUNERATION  (continued) Remuneration and fees  (all amounts in NOK excluding payroll tax)  External Board members do not have pension schemes or other benefits  other than board remuneration. Employee representatives only have pensions  schemes related to their employment by Posten Norge AS.  The General  Meeting determines the remuneration to the Board of Directors of Posten  Norge AS. Fees paid to the Board of Directors for 2010 were approved by the  General Meeting on 25.06.2010 and the members of the Board received the  following remuneration in 2010 Guidelines have been established for executive pay  in Norway Post and these have been presented to  the General Meeting. Norway Post aims to have a  competitive salary level without leading the field for  the equivalent types of positions.   Posten Norge AS has a bonus programme for the  CEO and Group management. The scheme has  two parts, one element based on the consolidated  results and the individual results. Achieved bonuses  can be up to 25 % of the salary. The final decision  regarding a bonus is determined by the board (the  CEO for Group management). Bonuses are only  paid to persons who are in their positions as of 31  December.  With regard to severance pay, reduction after 3  months has been agreed in the event of alternative  salary for the CEO. For other members of Group  management, a reduction of severance pay in the  event of an alternative salary has been agreed. No  key personnel have received share-based pay or  other long-term benefits. According to the CEOs pension contract his  retirement age is 65 years, and the total pension is  to be 66 per cent of his salary. Other members of  Group management before 1 January 2007 have a  defined benefit pension scheme financed through  normal operations with a retirement age of 64  years. The scheme was closed on 31 December  2006. Members of Group management after 1  January 2007 have a defined contribution plan fi- nanced by normal operations covering early retire- ment from 65 years. The other pension schemes  are described in more detail in note 3. In addition, Posten Norge AS has a bonus  programme for divisional management, regional  management, other key personnel and sales staff.

During wage negotiations  in 2008 a new AFP scheme was agreed from  2011. The scheme will be funded by the employ- ers by the payment of a charge per employee to  be determined by the Board of Directors for the  new pension scheme.  The Norwegian Account- ing Standards Board has produced a statement  regarding the handling of the transition to the  new AFP scheme for accounting purposes.  The  main effect of the recommendation was that AFP  obligations should be measured again at the time  the amendment to the law is adopted.  The new  pension scheme was passed by the Norwegian  parliament on 19 February 2010. On the basis of  the recommendation of the Norwegian Account- ing Standards Board settlement of the old AFP  scheme was carried out.  The settlement resulted  in a significant reduction in pension obligations,  lower pension costs due to only 2 months of pen- sion earnings in 2010 and a non-recurring income  of MNOK 759.  Employees who remain members  of the Norwegian Public Service Fund have kept  their rights in accordance with the AFP scheme  in the public sector.  This obligation together with  the shortfall in the LO/NHO scheme constitutes  the remaining obligations related to the old AFP  scheme as at 31.12.2010. The new AFP scheme is a multiple company  scheme which is considered a defined benefit  scheme. However, there is currently insufficient  information to measure the pension obligation in  a reliable way so the scheme must be treated as a  defined contribution scheme for accounting pur- poses until further notice. Pension costs for this  scheme are expected to be higher in the future.  The merger between Posten Norge AS wholly- owned subsidiary ErgoGroup AS and EDB Business  Partner ASA (EDB) was completed on 14.10.2010  and recognised in the accounts as of 30.09.2010.  In the same way as the settlement of the AFP  scheme the loss of ErgoGroup as a subsidiary  resulted in a reduction in the Group's pension ob- ligations of MNOK 200 as well as reduced pension  costs.  Pension costs for 2010 have been reclassi- fied in the Post-tax profit entry from discontinued  operations and corresponding figures for 2008  and 2009 have been restated in the same way. Posten Norge AS has a defined contribution  pension scheme for the majority of employees in  Norway, Sweden and Denmark under which the  premiums are charged as an expense when they  occur  NOTE 3     PENSIONS  (continued) In the parent company Posten Norge AS  contribution rates for 2010 were 5.0% for salaries  of between 1 and 6 times the National Insurance  basic amount (G) and 8% for salaries of between  6 and 12 times G.    A private disability pension has  been introduced which provides benefits equal to  66% of the employee's pay without paid-up policy  accrual. Posten Norge AS also has obligations con- nected to salaried employees above 12 G. Pension  obligations connected to salaried employees above  12 G and agreements on early retirement pensions  are financed by the company's operations.    The defined contribution pension schemes in  Sweden and Denmark had variable contribution  rates based on different calculation bases and  rate ranges. For example in Sweden the calculation  basis for some employees was a so-called "income  basis amount" (IBB) which was SEK 52 100 in 2010.   Contributions were calculated with a high and low  rate of 4.5% and 30% respectively for earnings  below and above 7.5 times IBB.   The parent company and some subsidiaries have  different defined pension schemes rather than the  early retirement pension scheme  For the parent  company these pension benefits were agreed with  the employee organisations in connection with the  transition to a new pension scheme to replace  Norwegian Public Service Fund scheme.  The  subsidiaries have mainly used the same long-term  financial premises as the parent company, but with  an adjustment for country-specific macroeconom- ic conditions.  The Group's pension liabilities relate  mainly to Bring Cargo's defined pension schemes. Some companies in the Group's Swedish opera- tions have pension schemes which, according to  IAS 19, do not qualify for recognition in the balance  sheet. In accordance with Swedish rules the pen- sion liabilities are covered through a capital insur- ance policy. In the company accounts the amount  was registered as a liability with the equivalent  amount as a receivable against the capital  insurance company. In the consolidated financial  statements, these amounts are netted, so that  the criteria stipulated in IAS 19 are met. A secured  occupational pension programme in a Norwegian  company is set off pension assets in accordance  with IAS 19.

Posten Norge AS has  lodged an appeal against the decision with the  EFTA court. Refer also to note 31.  The reduction in other costs in the parent com- pany compared with 2009 is due to the inclusion  of MNOK 503 is losses on receivables concerning  loans to Bring Citymail AB related to the financing  of Bring Citymail Denmark A/S.  In 2009 and 2010 the costs of other external  services were significantly lower than in 2008,  partly as a result of the effects of the Groups  profitability programme Spinnaker. In 2008, Norway Post Group launched a new, joint  trademark called Bring, for the Scandinavian mail  and logistics operations. At the same time Posten  Norge AS logo was changed to show that Posten  Norge AS and Bring are part of the same group.  The total cost for the trademark for the Group in  2010 was MNOK 42 (MNOK 62 in 2009 and MNOK  221 in 2008).

Projects in progress of a total of MnoK 259 for facilities under con- struction as at 31.12.2010, MnoK 113 was for a  solution for planning and managing transport activi- ties in the Group on the most appropriate manner  possible. the solution shall enable the planning of  an order across the different types of transport,  right from the sender to the recipient, and thereby  result in the most cost-effective goods transpor- tation. the development of the system is somewhat  delayed in relation to the original plan as a result  of requirements identified during later phases of  development, the system will be gradually put into  operation in certain logistics companies in the  Group until the end of 2012.  Furthermore MnoK 68 was for a new data ware- house and reporting solution for the production  and distribution apparatus to replace the current  non-standardised systems. A common manage- ment portal will enable the efficient management  and planning of staffing levels, transport and  distribution and is a prerequisite for the continu- ous improvement of operations and to meet the  expected decline in volumes in the future.  The write-down of projects under development  with a definite useful life Write-down costs are presented in the income  statement in the line for write-downs.  In 2010 a total of MnoK 21 was written down for  intangible assets other than goodwill (MnoK 75 in  2009 and MnoK 4 in 2008) of which MnoK 19 was  for the Logistics segment and MnoK 2 for the  other segment. Write downs in 2010 included the It  system in the automated package collection points  which was written down by MnoK 8 as a result of  the project being cancelled. Furthermore a total of  MnoK 13 was written down for various It systems  for which the book value exceeded the utility value. Additions and disposals - goodwill the acquisition and sale of companies is described  in more detail in note 29. the disposal of MnoK 2 698 relates to the merger  between Posten norge As wholly-owned subsidiary  ergoGroup As and eDB Business Partner AsA (eDB)  that was completed on 14.10.2010 and recognised in  the accounts as of 30.09.2010. Refer to note 26. write-downs of intangible assets   with an indefinite useful life Write-downs are presented on a separate line in  the income statement. A continuous assessment is made for indications  of a fall in the value of intangible assets and if such  indications exist the asset's recoverable value is  estimated. Intangible assets with an indeterminate  life, intangible assets under development and good- will are tested annually, or more often if there are  indications of a decline in value during the year. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units in  order to assess the need to write it down. Alloca- tion is based on an assessment of the cash flows  linked to the business group (operating segment)  to which the goodwill pertains. If the cash flows are  independent of cash flows linked to other entities,  the individual operations comprise the assessment  entity, and if not, goodwill is allocated to an assess- ment entity at a higher level.  A need to write-down exists if the capitalised value  of an assessment entity including goodwill exceeds  the units recoverable amount. the recoverable  amount is whichever is the higher of the fair value  minus sales costs and the utility value, where the  utility value is the present value of estimated cash  flows relating to future use. Posten norge As has calculated the future cash  flows based on the estimated results (budgets  and forecasts) that reflect the financial business  plans approved by management and which cover  a five-year period. the estimated results have  been adjusted to take into account depreciation,  amortisation, investments and changes in the  working capital. the extrapolation period contains  a mechanical extrapolation of the cash flows after  the forecast period, using a constant growth rate.

Based on these criteria, in 2010 a total of MnoK  105 of write-downs were made related to goodwill  of which MnoK 71 was for the Logistics segment  and MnoK 34 was for the Mail segment (a total of  MnoK 246 in 2009 and MnoK 26 in 2008). In the  Logistics segment, MnoK 50 was for Bring Frigo  norway (formerly Bring Frigoscandia norway) which  operates in the market for thermally-regulated  transport. the total value of goodwill of MnoK 208  assumed a development in profits that cannot  be deemed probable in the current market and  with existing customer contracts. Furthermore,  the entire goodwill of MnoK 20 related to Bring  Cargo's (formerly Bring Logistics) subsidiary in  slovakia, Blomquist trucking slovakia, was written  down.  A number of measures have been taken in  the company to improve profitability which have  had a positive effect, but not sufficient to justify  the margin assumptions that formed the basis for  the value of the goodwill.  In the Mail segment the  entire goodwill of MnoK 34 in Bring Dialog sverige  (formerly Bring Dialog sweden) was written down  due to the financial development of the company  and future prospects in the market.   Goodwill related to Bring Frigo norway (formerly  Bring Frigoscandia norway) (MnoK 158), Bring  Logistics sunnmre (formerly emdal transport  & spedisjon As) (MnoK 40) and Bring express  Denmark (MnoK 34 ) is sensitive to adjustments to  the margins and required rate of return, which are  the key assumptions. the estimates of the value  of goodwill assume a significant improvement in  future profitability. the cash-flows and required  rate of return used when making the estimates are  all based on the management's best estimates and  various measures to improve profitability have been  implemented in the companies.  Goodwill related to Bring Dialog norway (MnoK  45) and Bring Logistics solutions (MnoK 85) is  considered uncertain as the performance of  the cash-generating units has not reached the  budgeted levels, but the development in the most  recent period has been positive and supports the  assumptions for future margins used as the basis  for evaluating write-downs.  Where the acquired units have not achieved  budgeted margins, an assessment has been carried  out of the background for the deviation from the  budget and measures implemented in the earnings  and cost sides are deemed sufficient to maintain  the quality of future cash flow estimates. the  assumptions concerning margins have also been  assessed with regard to the industry and future  prospects.  Further sensitivity calculations have  been carried out for the units particularly affected  by the economic decline and market developments.  Goodwill related to Bring Logistics sweden (MnoK  234) and Bring Mail nordic (MnoK 23) are also sen- sitive to adjustments to the margins and required  rate of return, but the units currently produce  margins in accordance with the budget.  the table below shows general information about  sensitivity in the assumptions used as the basis for  impairment tests for the respective cash-generat- ing units per segment.

In order to ensure sufficient equity in the subsidiary  Bring Citymail sweden AB, Posten norge As invest- ed MseK 70 in June which resulted in an increase in  the cost price of the shares of MseK 58. the cost price of the shares in Posten eiendom  storbyer As, Posten eiendom Alnabru As, Posten  eiendom Robsrud As and Bring Dialogue nor- way As was regulated as a result of the group  contributions recognised in 2010. Posten eiendom  Robsrud As and Bring Dialogue As have received  group contributions from Posten norge As which  increased the costs price by MnoK 129 and MnoK  1 respectively. At the same time part of the group  contributions from Posten eiendom storbyer As  and Posten eiendom Alnabru As to Posten norge  As was classified as repayment of previous paid-in  equity, and Posten norge As's cost price for the  shares in these companies was reduced accordingly.  this totalled MnoK 199 for Posten eiendom stor- byer As and MnoK 21 for Posten eiendom Alnabru  As. Posten eiendom Robsrud As also received  additional capital of MnoK 240 from Posten norge  As in December. As a result of the book value of the shares in Bring  Dialogue sverige AB (formerly Bring Dialogue  sweden AB) exceeding the recoverable value of the  company the shares were written down by MnoK  27 in 2010.

Insurance the Group has secured significant parts of its op- erations and intangible assets through traditional  insurance coverage. the Group insures its vehicles  at the minimum allowable level. the Group is a self- insurer for comprehensive coverage.  As a policy holder, the company has the opportunity  to manage agreed upon areas of the operation's  risk exposure within the insurance companies'  insurance licence. this insurance activity is man- aged independently, both from a financial and risk  standpoint, from the other activities performed by  the insurance companies.this is accomplished by  using a separate account to manage these risks.  the account solution applies for selected cover- ages and is limited to coverage for liability only. the  cost associated with this solution has been lower  than the premium paid, hence the account is in sur- plus. Posten norge As insurance account scheme  accounted for MnoK 15 of other non-current  receivables (MnoK 30 million in 2009 and MnoK 27  million in 2008).  the Group has directors' and officers' liability  insurance coverage. the Group's employees are  covered for injuries and death through personnel  insurance coverage.

Restructuring costs are primarily connected  to the establishment of the new post office  concept and changes to the terminal structure in  relation to the establishment of the new south- east norway terminal at Robsrud. In addition to Posten norge As, Group provisions  totalled MnoK 7 million as at 31.12.2010. these pro- visions were split as follows: MnoK 3 for personnel- related measures, MnoK 3 for empty premises and  MnoK 1 for other measures.  It is expected that  MnoK 6 will be paid in 2011 and MnoK 1 in 2012. the  liabilities have been discounted. Severance pay severance pay is payable to employees of the  norwegian state who have been made redundant,  and is payable for the period until they obtain new  employment. For employees of Posten norge As  the scheme applies to redundancies made up to  31.12.2004 inclusive. When Posten norge As was  established on 01.07.2002, the norwegian state  decided that the company itself would have to pay  the severance pay costs relating to redundancies  made between 01.07.2002 and 31.12.2004 inclusive.  In 2010, the amount disbursed was MnoK 14 and  provisions totalled MnoK 37 as at 31.12.2010. the disbursements will take place up to 10 years  into the future and depend on such factors as to  what extent those receiving severance pay obtain  new permanent or temporary jobs. there is there- fore some uncertainty linked to the size of the  provision, which has been determined on the basis  of experience of such payments from 2003-2010.  the provision is discounted. Pensions Pensions are described in further detail in note 3. Other Long-term provisions for liabilities include noK 13  million for cleaning-up obligations linked to the plot  of land at Alnabru.   122 123 notes 04 04 notes NOTE 21    INTEREST-BEARING NON-CURRENT AND CURRENT LIABILITIES POSTEN NORGE AS GROUP Fixed interest rate loans Liabilities to credit institutions Total fixed interest rate loans Floating interest rate loans Liabilities to credit institutions Bond Loans Financial lease obligations other non-current liabilities Total non-current floating interest rate liabilities Interest-bearing non-current liabilities Repayments 2012 Repayments 2013 Repayments 2014 Repayments 2015 thereafter Non-current liabilities Liabilities to credit institutions other non-current liabilities Liabilities maturing after 5 years First year repayments on non-current liabilities First year repayments on financial lease obligations Debts to group companies other current liabilities Interest-bearing short-term liabilities 2010  898 898 599  65  174  838  1 736  32  410  1  1  1 292  1 736  1 075  217  1 292  2 058  28  33  2 119  2008 1 048 1 048 1 697  1 497  15  270  3 479  4 527  4  924  928  2009 1 298 1 298 1 029  1 498  136  53  2 716  4 014  32  32  2009 1 298 1 298 1 029  1 498  11  53  2 591  3 889  4 792  796  2008 1 048 1 048 1 718  1 497  162  276  3 653  4 701  2  52  8  62 2010  898 898 599  7  174  780  1 678  4  403  1 271  1 678  1 075  196  1 271  2 058 4  851  32  2 945  the effective interest rate on Posten norges  floating interest rate loan is 3.53%. the effective  interest rate is a calculated, weighted average. As  of 31.12.2010, fixed interest rate agreements had  been entered into for loans of MnoK 806 at an av- erage interest rate of 4.5%, valid until 2018 - 2020 Debt to credit institutions in 2009 included a  certificate loan of MseK 200 which was within the  framework of established overdraft facilities and  was thus classified as long-term financing. the loan  was repaid in 2010. Liabilities linked to financial leases are reduced by  regular payments of loan instalments. the weighted  average effective interest rate on these loans was  4.6% for Posten norge and 4.5% for the Group.  Refer also to note 28.  Posten norge had four private placement loans  totalling MnoK 1063 as at 31.12.2010; the most  recent loan was taken out in september 2008. A  loan of MnoK 185 is due for repayment in 2011 and  has been reclassified as a short-term interest- bearing liability. the value of the long-term private  placement loans and associated interest/currency  swaps is the estimated market value of the instru- ments. Posten norge has an obligation to pay a  fixed interest rate in JPY on the loans and, through  the swaps, receives a fixed interest rate in JPY and  pays a floating interest rate (3 months nIBoR) in  noK. the market values are calculated by the fixed  cash flows in JPY being discounted by the current  JPY interest-rate level and converted into noK  at the current exchange rate (JPY/noK). Posten  norge utilises the 'fair value option' when recording  these loans - refer also to note 23. other long- term liabilities included interest/currency swaps  linked to a private placement loan.  Posten norge has not entered into any new loan  agreements in 2009 or 2010. In 2008 Posten norge  entered into loan agreements with terms from  3 to 12 years, of which MnoK 1 500 was in the  norwegian bond market (amortised cost as at  31.12.2009 was MnoK 1 498 and as MnoK 1 497 as  at 31.12.2008), MnoK 750 in the nordic Investment  Bank (nIB) and MnoK 148 in private placement.  the fair value of long-term debt is estimated using  interest terms for debt with corresponding terms  and credit risk, and equates to book value. Financial  debt is booked at amortised cost, which equates  to actual value calculated as the present value of  estimated cash flows utilising the interest rate  applicable for equivalent debt on the balance-sheet  date.  other short-term liabilities in 2010 in Posten norge included a provision for the esA fine of MnoK 101 (MeUR 12.89 that was imposed on Posten norge in 2010.  Refer to  note 31. other current liabilities in 2009 included provisions for the mandatory purchase of minority shares in subsidiaries that were formerly classified as  other non-current liabilities. other current liabilities in 2008 included provisions related to earn-out agreements in connection with the acquisition of Cetei AB and  Bring Dialog sverige AB (formerly Bring Dialogue sweden AB) that were paid in 2009.

For other shares classified as held for sale in the Group totalling MnoK 2 fair value is estimated to equal cost price. 2. Fair value through profit or loss financial obligations: Posten norge has made use of the opportunity to  utilise the fair value option (FVo) in the revised IAs  39 for loans with associated derivatives that have  previously been recognised as a real value hedge.  Posten norge has three loans which are classified  as fair value through profit or loss under the 'fair  value option' as at 31.12.10. In 2003 and 2004,  Posten norge took out three long-term loans  with three different Japanese annuity companies  for JPY 6.4 billion, JPY 5.0 billion and JPY 3.0 billion.  In 2008 Posten norge entered into a new loan  agreement for JPY 3.0 billion. these loans have  fixed interest rates, so their value in noK depends  on exchange rate developments and changes to  the Japanese and norwegian long-term interest- rate levels. At the same time these loan agree- ments were entered into, combined currency and  interest-rate swap agreements were entered into  which, combined with the loans, effectively provided  loans in noK with the interest rates set every third  month. one of the loans for JPY 3.0 billion with re- lated currency and interest rate swaps is classified  as short-term as at 31.12.2010. the values of the loans in noK when the agree- ments were entered into were MnoK 400, MnoK  330, MnoK 185 and MnoK 148 respectively - a  total of MnoK 1 063. As at 31.12.2010, these loans  were recognised at a total value of MnoK 806  (MnoK 1 014 million as at 31.12.2009 and MnoK 773  as at 31.12.2008) and the interest-rate and cur- rency swap agreements were recognised at MnoK  257 (MnoK 49 as at 31.12.2009 and MnoK 190 as  at 31 December 2008).  the change in the swap  agreements fair value in 2010 totalled MnoK 208  (MnoK -241 in 2009 and MnoK 48 in 2009). the to- tal change in the fair value of the swap agreements  since the implementation of IFRs on 01.01.2005 is  MnoK 168.  Changes in interest rates or exchange rates  that lead to changes in the value of the JPY loans  measured in noK are counteracted by changes in  the value of the combined currency and interest- rate swaps.  the swap counterparty's and loan  counterparty's risk are virtually the same.

Under the agreement, Posten norge receives  the percentage change in the norwegian consumer price index over the coupon period (annually) as well as a fixed spread of the inflation index in return for paying three  months' nIBoR each quarter.  In 2009 parts of the agreement were cancelled, and the principal amount covered by the agreement was MnoK 700 as at 31.12.2009. In 2009  an agreement was also entered into with Debtor for a real interest rate bond where the cash flows are counteracted by the cash flows from the remaining inflation indexed  interest rate exchange agreement. As a consequence the inflation swap is eliminated provided that the consumer price index is greater than or equal to 0.  total contractual amount (MnoK) for interest-rate swaps and forward contracts capitalised as at 31.12.10:        Cash flow hedges Interest-rate hedges– non-current loans Posten norge has two loans with nordiska Invest- eringsbanken (nordic Investment Bank) for MnoK  400 (taken out in 2005) and MnoK 750 (taken out  in 2008) on which the interest is determined every  six months. In order to ensure fixed interest-rate  conditions, interest-rate swaps for MnoK 1 150  have been entered into so that Posten norge  pays a fixed net interest rate on the hedged loans.  the hedged loans and interest-rate swaps have  the same main conditions and the cash-flows are  expected to continue until 2011 for the loan taken  out in 2005 and until 2016 for the loan taken out in  2008. In 2010 MnoK 19 million was taken through  the income statement. (MnoK 12 in 2009 and  MnoK 10 in 2008) .  As at 31.12.2010 the loan of  MnoK 400 with related interest-rate swaps was  classified as short-term. Currency hedges – EUR revenues Posten norge had revenues of approximately  MeUR 29 for distributing post from abroad in  2010 and expects revenues of approximately  MeUR 32 in 2011. some of the exchange-rate risk  is hedged by selling forward exchange contracts  in eUR. the change in value of forward exchange  contracts that are effective hedging instruments  is recognised in equity. the cash flows in the form  of earned euro revenues are charged to the  income statement each month. I 2010 MnoK 17  was transferred from equity to operating revenues  as a reduction in income (MnoK 17 as a reduction  in income in 2009 and MnoK 3,8 as an increase in  income in 2008) due to realised eUR revenues. In  addition MnoK noK 1.0 was transferred to financial  expenses (MnoK 2.6 in 2009 and MnoK 1.5 million  in 2008) due to exchange rate differences.  As at  31.12.2010 sales forwards have been entered into  of MeUR 20 for 2010, and an unrealised loss of  approximately MnoK 7 has been capitalised as a  result of the weakness of the noK against the eUR.

As at  31.12.2009 the final eUR purchase had been com- pleted and the fair value of the forward contracts  recognised in the balance-sheet and the unrealised  gains/losses on the purchase contract were 0. this  was the equivalent of a change in 2009 of MnoK  26 (MnoK 24 in 2008) and MnoK 33.7 (MnoK 34.2).  In 2009 the accumulated realised net gain for the  instalments of a total of MnoK 9.7 was recognised  as a reduction in the acquisition cost of machinery.  Bond Loans Posten norge issued bond loans to the equivalent  of MnoK 1 500 in 2008 where MnoK 1 100 million  was on floating terms and MnoK 400 was on fixed  terms. Posten norge entered into an interest-rate  swap from fixed to floating interest so that the  entire loan is on floating terms. the change in value  for the interest-rate swap will be recognised in the  balance sheet until the loan is due for repayment in  2011. As at 31.12.10 the fair value of the interest- rate swap recognised in the balance sheet was  MnoK 5. the value of the interest-rate swap is ad- justed for gains/losses if rolled over, but no rollover  occurred in 2010 (this constituted a gain of MnoK  2.8 in 2009). As at 31.12.2010 the loans with related  interest-rate swaps was classified as current. since 2005 Posten norge has used forward  exchange contracts in swedish kroner (seK) to  hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries. Posten  norge has entered into a total of MseK 1 399 in  revolving forward exchange contracts, of which  MseK 65 relates to Bring express AB, MseK 675  relates to Bring Frigoscandia AB, MseK 60 relates  to Bring Mail nordic AB, MseK 374 relates to Bring  Cargo sverige (formerly Bring Logistics sverige)  companies and MseK 225 relates to Combitrans  AB.  the decline from 2009 mainly relates to hedg- ing concerning one of ergoGroup's subsidiaries in  sweden, sYsteam. Refer to note 26. the changes  in the value of the instalments are offset in the  Group against the translation differences from the  investments recognised in equity until the invest- ments are sold. should the hedges be ineffective,  the change in value is recognised in the income  statement.  of the total movement of MnoK -8 in the hedging reserve in 2010 (MnoK 69 in 2009 and MnoK -106  in 2008), all was related to Posten norge.

ORGANISATION AND AUTHORISATION STRUCTURE The Board of Directors: A risk analysis is presented  to Posten norge's Board of Directors on an annual  basis. the Board discusses the administration's  evaluation of the total corporate risk picture  related to the areas of strategic risk, financial risk,  operational risk, and corporate reputation risk.  Authorisation: Authorisations are required for  appropriations and investments. overall limits are  determined by the Board and can be delegated in  the organisation.Follow up is by Management. FOLLOw UP AND APPLICATION Accountability: All managers are responsible within  their area of responsibility and shall have complete  insight and understanding of the risk picture at all  times. Risk reporting: the risk reporting in the Group shall  ensure that all managers have necessary informa- tion about the level of risk and risk development.  the Board receives a yearly risk analysis and a  yearly analysis of corrective measures. Utilisation of risk information: Risk management is  incorporated in Divisional management. USE OF FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES Financial derivatives are agreements used to deter- mine financial values through interest terms, cur- rency exchange rates, and values of equity instru- ments for specific Derivatives include swaps and  fixed-price agreements (forward contracts). Posten  norge utilises financial derivatives to handle market  risks that arise due to the Group's regular opera- tions, and to ensure the value in the balance sheet  of foreign enterprises (translation differences). the  Group's counterparties and issuers have low credit  risk (see the table for credit risk below) THE FOLLOwING DERIVATIVES ARE UTILISED   By THE GROUP FOR HEDGING PURPOSES: Futures: An agreement to purchase or sell foreign  exchange in the future at a pre-determined price.  Posten norge primarily uses currency futures to  secure revenues in eUR and to secure investments  in foreign currency.                  Swaps: transactions where two parties exchange  cash flows for an agreed amount over an agreed  period. the majority of swaps are tailor-made and  trades occur outside an official exchange.  the most important forms of swaps utilised by  Posten norge are: swaps Interest-rate swaps  - exchange of cash flows for an agreed period  where one party in the swap pays fixed interest  and the other floating interest swaps Currency swaps  - an agreement between two parties to exchange  one currency with another, with an agreement to  exchange these back again at a future point in time  at an agreed rate. the exchange rate is determined  from the current spot rate and the interest rate  difference between the two respective currency's  countries  swaps Combined interest-rate and currency  swaps  - the parties exchange both currency and interest  rate terms  CATEGORIES OF RISk            For risk management purposes Posten norge  separates the following forms of risk: Strategic risk is the risk of loss due to changes in  external factors such as the economic situation or  government regulations. Financial risk includes among other factors: Credit risk: Risk of loss caused by a counterparty/ customer who fails to fulfil its payment obligations  to the Group.  Credit risk concerns all financial assets from the  counterparty/customer, mainly interest-bearing  securities, but also responsibilities pursuant to  other issued credits, guaranties, leasing, approved credits  not utilised, as well as counterparty risk from  derivatives and currency contracts.  Financial market risk: occurs due to the Group's  open positions in currency, interest-rate, and  energy instruments and the risk is related to        variations in earnings due to changes in market  prices or exchange rates.  Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group is unable to  meet its financial obligations.           Operational risk: the risk of loss caused by process  or system weaknesses or errors, errors committed  by employees, or external events.           Corporate reputation risk: Risk of reduction  in revenues and access to capital due to falling  confidence and reputation in the market, with  respect to customers, counterparties, owners or  authorities. Risk management is a specialist area in the Group  that is continuously developing, and measurement  methods and tools are constantly being improved. Financial risk Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a party to a financial  instrument will cause a financial loss for the other  party by not fulfilling its obligations. Responsibil- ity pursuant to other issued credits, guarantees,  interest-bearing securities, approved credits not  utilised and counterparty risk occurring through  derivatives and currency contracts also carries  credit risk. since the contracting party in a deriva- tive trade is normally a bank, the credit risk relating  to derivatives is considered slight. the financial  turbulence in 2008 has resulted in the Group more  often choosing counterparts with less credit  risk. the table below shows the credit risk for the  Group's most important business partners where  all have an A- rating or better.   standard & Poor  Moodys   DnB noR Bank AsA  A+  Aa3 nordea Bank norge AsA  AA-  Aa2 Fokus Bank  A  A1 WestLB AG  A-  A2 BnP Paribas oslo Branch  AA  Aa2 svenska Handelsbanken  AA-  Aa2 Intesa sanpaolo Group  AA-  Aa1 Commerzbank europe (Ireland)  A+  Aa3 skandinaviske enskilda Banken AB  A+  A1 societe Generale oslo  A+  Aa2 Fortis International Finance (Dublin)  A  A1 InG Bank n.V., Dublin Branch  A  A1 Credit risk associated with financial assets: the Group has no significant credit risk relat- ing to one individual contracting party, or several  contracting parties, that can be regarded as one  group due to similarities in credit risk. the Group  has guidelines to ensure that sales are only made  to customers that have not had any significant  payment problems earlier on and that outstanding  amounts do not exceed stipulated credit limits. since the Group has no financial assets outside the  balance sheet, the maximum risk exposure is rep- resented by the balance sheet value of the financial  assets, including derivatives, in the balance sheet.  the Group therefore regards its maximum risk  exposure to be the balance sheet value of its ac- counts receivable and other current assets.

Interest rate:         Posten norge's interest rate risk is mainly linked to  the Group's debt portfolio. this type of risk is man- aged at the corporate level.              the Group's goal is that the interest costs shall  follow the general development in the money  market, but fixed interest rate loans and fixed  rate agreements can be entered into to a certain  degree               when there is risk for abnormally high money mar- ket interest rates, and financial advantages can be  expected from fixed interest rate terms.     As at 31.12.2010, 23% of the Group's interest- bearing liabilities had an interest term of more than  one year.  As at 31.12.2010 Posten norge had  MnoK 898 in fixed interest rate loans. A change in  the interest rate of +/- 1% on these loans would  affect equity by a total of +/- MnoK 9.  the interest rate sensitivity (+/- 1%) linked to the  net interest bearing debt (floating interest rate  only) as at 31.12.2009 was MnoK 3.3 where net  interest bearing debt with a floating                interest rate was MnoK 325. Interest rate risk  arises when there is an imbalance between interest  bearing debt and interest bearing liquid assets, and  where the average weighted time to maturity for  assets and debt is unequal.               Inflation indexed interest rate swaps: In 2006, Posten norge entered into an inflation  indexed interest rate exchange agreement of  MnoK 1 000 to protect the Group's competitive- ness by hedging against costs that are positively  correlated to inflation. Under the agreement,  Posten norge receives the percentage change  in the norwegian consumer price index over the  coupon period (annually) as well as a fixed spread  of the inflation index in return for paying three  months' nIBoR each quarter. the agreement has a  duration of 10 years.      In 2009 MnoK 300 of the principal was cancelled  through an agreement with the counterparty. In  addition, agreements were entered into for the re- maining noK 700 million for the issue of real inter- est rate bonds providing cash flows approximately  equal to the original agreement. Financial risk Liquidity risk   (related to financial instruments): to ensure the Group's financial freedom, there are  a defined goals for both liquidity and loan reserves.  the liquidity reserve, consisting of bank deposits  and unused credits, shall be a minimum of 15 per  cent of the Group's operating revenues. the debt  reserves consisting of unused credits less loans  that expire within 360 days shall be a minimum of  10 per cent of the Group's operating revenues. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable  meet its financial obligations when they mature,  resulting in a default.

Posten norge enters into forward  contracts to eliminate translation differences in  the books on a monthly basis as much as possible.  this is done by entering into forward contracts  equal to the purchase sum, which revolve until  there is a decision either to sell the acquired com- pany, or to follow another strategy related to risk  elimination, for example loans in foreign currency.  Posten norge utilises hedge accounting for the  majority of hedges of future transactions, either  cash flow hedging or value hedging.  For example,  Posten norge is a net importer of mail to norway,  which results in receivables against foreign postal  operators. net terminal income from foreign postal  operators amounts to approximately MnoK 400  where the revenue flow is principally in eUR but  also UsD and sDR. Posten norge has currently  hedged only the revenues in eUR, which amount to  approximately MnoK 20 per year.  Financial risk Market risk Market risk is due to the Group's open positions in currency, interest rate, and energy instruments. the risk is linked to variations in earnings due to changes in market prices or exchange rates. norway Post's objective is to secure the risk linked to both cash flows and the balance sheet (as a consequence of exchange rates and interest rate changes).  132 133 notes 04 04 notes NOTE 24    FINANCIAL RISk  (continued) Maturity structure of the Group's loans/financial liabilities MnoK Balance  31.12.2010 Liabilities to credit institutions 1) Bond Loans Financial derivatives  Financial lease Total Posten Norge AS Financial lease other interest-bearing liabilities Total Group      Balance  31.12.2009 Liabilities to credit institutions 1) Bond Loans Financial derivatives  Financial lease Total Posten Norge AS Financial lease Total Group Balance 31.12.2008 Liabilities to credit institutions 1) Bond Loans Financial derivatives  Financial lease other interest-bearing liabilities Total Posten Norge AS Financial lease Liabilities to credit institutions  other interest-bearing liabilities Total Group Total 2 033 1 500 228 11 3 772 82 1 3 855 Total 2 326 1 498 54 15 3 893 153 4 046 Total 2 723 1 518 269 19 2 4 531 195 23 15 4 763 Over 5 years 806 135 941 20 961 Over 5 years 1 191 37 1 228 51 1 279 Over 5 years 1 072 156 2 1 230 1 14 2 1 247 years 2 to 5 669 61 7 737 38 775 years 2 to 5 973 1 498 17 11 2 499 74 2 573 years 2 to 5 1 101 1 518 113 15 2 747 146 7 5 2 905 year 1 558 1 500 32 4 2 094 24 1 2 119 year 1 162 4 166 28 194 year 1 550 4 554 48 2 8 612 Average interest rate 3,53 % Average interest rate 4,12 % Average interest rate 6,50 % 1) Certificate loans that are rolled over annually, and which are within the limits of established draw-down facilities, are classified as long-term financing under debt to  credit institutions, even if the maturity date is up to one year.  As at 31.12.2010 the Group's eUR 500 million facility had not been used. the Group also has running fixed and floating contractually stipulated interest rate payments, cf. the Group's  interest rate management principles which are explained in more detail in the sector on market risk/interest.                       Managing capital  the Group has a goal to ensure maximum acces- sibility, flexibility, and return on the Group's liquid  assets at the same time as limiting its credit  risk. this is achieved by concentrating all available  liquidity in the Group's corporate account system,  and by having a conservative administrative profile  with significant emphasis on liquid placements.  the Group has centralised overall responsibility for  liquidity management and measures that promote  effective utilisation of the companys capital.  the Group manages the capital structure where  the objective is to have the financial strength to  resist commercial changes.  the Group has long- term draw-down facilities which constitute a signif- icant capital buffer against unexpected financial  needs. the draw-down facilities have been taken up  with a bank syndicate where all participants have  an A- rating or better (see the table above), which  also limits counterparty risk. the Group measures capital utilisation by using the  liability ratio, which is net interest-bearing liabilities  divided by equity. net interest-bearing liabilities  consist of interest-bearing short and long-term  liabilities less liquid assets in the forms of cash,  bank balances, and short-term placements. In  addition, net interest-bearing liabilities divided by  eBItDA are used to measure whether operat- ing earnings are sufficient to service the Group's  external debt. the goal is that net interest-bearing  liabilities shall not exceed 3.5 times eBItDA. there  were no changes to the Group's goals, principles or  processes related to capital management during  2008, 2009 or 2010. Debt covenants  norway Post has debt covenants. the   company's biggest loan facility contains a   clause stipulating that investments shall not  increase the Group's net interest-bearing debt to  more than 3.5 x eBItDA, where eBItDA is measured  for a period of the last 12 months on the balance  sheet day of each quarter. As at 31.12.2010 this  was 1.0 x eBItDA (1.1 as at 31.12.2009 and 1.8 x as  at 31.12.2008). two loan agreements also include a covenant  for a minimum of 25% equity.  As at 31.12.2010 the  equity ratio was 34.7% (28.3% as at 31.12.2009,  26.4% as at 31.12.2008).  In addition the following covenants apply   to the majority of loan agreements:    Change of control covenant: 51% Government  ownership   Ban on pledging assets (negative pledge)   Cross default, default in one agreement  leads to  all agreements being deemed to be in default  In the agreements with the nordic Investment  Bank there are also restrictions regarding entering  into new financial lease transactions. Breaching the terms of covenants results in  a demand to repay all interest-bearing debt or  potentially the renegotiation of loan agreements. there are no restrictions on the annual regula- tion of the levels of debt covenants in the loan  agreements.  the level of the financial key figures in  the covenants is followed up closely and reported  to management on a regular basis.  In 2010, Posten norge As has continued the  measures started in 2009 to reduce financial risk  and increase financial freedom. Discipline in the use  of capital, a halt to acquisitions and a particular  focus on cost-reducing measures have more  than compensated for reduced income due to the  lower sales volume in 2010. this has resulted in an  increase in profits and equity and created the basis  for increased headroom to implement strategic  investment. In 2010 the balance sheet was further  strengthened due to strong cash flow, limited  investments and a further reduction in the Group's  receivables. no new long-term loans were taken up  during the period and surplus profits were invested  on favourable terms.

For unlisted assets the fair value is evaluated as  not being significantly different from the historical  cost.   Fair values of forward currency contracts are  determined by utilising the forward rate at the  balance sheet date. Fair values of currency swaps  are determined by calculating the present value  of future cash flows. For all derivatives, fair values  are confirmed by the financial institution with  which the company has made arrangements.    the following of the company's financial instru- ments have a fair value approximately equal to  book value: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts  receivable, other short-term receivables, other  long-term interest-bearing liabilities, overdraft  financing, parts of long-term liabilities, supplier  liabilities and other short-term liabilities.   Capitalised values of cash, cash equivalents and  overdraft financing are approximately equal to  fair value as these instruments have short matu- rity. Capitalised values of accounts receivable and  supplier liabilities are approximately equal to fair  value since they also have short maturity.   Fair value of long-term liabilities is calculated  using listed market prices, or  interest rate terms  for liabilities with an approximate maturity period  and credit risk   For financial assets and liabilities   booked at amortised cost,    fair value is approximately equal to amortised  cost when it is calculated as the present value of  estimated discounted cash flows using an inter- est rate from equivalent debt and assets on the  balance sheet date. Fair value of derivatives designated as   hedging instruments is booked   as other short-term receivables/other   short-term debt, or other long-term   receivables/other long-term debt depending   on the maturity date of the corresponding   hedged object.

Posten norge acquired 47% of the combined  company on completion of the merger. ergoGroup  As was wound up and assets, rights and liabilities  were transferred to eDB Business Partner. Upon  completion of the merger eDB Business Partner  AsA changed its name to eDB ergoGroup AsA and  issued 81 064 078 new shares to Posten norge  Group as compensation.   For accounting purposes, Posten norges owner- ship interest in the new combined company is  treated as an associated company. the value of the  associated company at the time of the merger was  MnoK 1 297, based on the market value at the time  the implementation of the merger was recognized  as being completed under company law. the share  of the combined companys profits is classified  under operation and for the fourth quarter of 2010  an expense of MnoK 30 equivalent to the Group's  share of post-tax profits during its period of own- ership in 2010 was included.   In connection with the merger a shareholder  agreement was entered into between Posten  norge and telenor, as the other major owner of  the combined company.   In accordance with the agreement Posten norges  ownership stake   was to be reduced to 40% over a two-year period,  which was carried out in november 2010. In ad- dition the agreement contains restrictions with  Fair value hierarchy As at 31.12.10 the Group had the following financial  assets and liabilities measured at fair value: the Group uses the following hierarchy to define  fair value per valuation method:   Level 1:  Listed prices (non-adjusted) in active mar- kets for identical assets or liabilities  Level 2:  other input than listed prices included on  level 1 that are observable for the asset or  liability, either directly (such as prices) or  indirectly (derived from prices)    Level 3:  Input for the asset or liability that is not  based on observable market data (non- observable input)  NOTE 25    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  (continued) no financial assets have been re-classified in such a way that the valuation method has been changed from amortised cost to actual cost, or  vice versa. there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements in 2009, and no recording of financial assets in or out of level 3.  2009    5 214   239   176   43   132     132 2009   415  474  (200) (152) 123  521    644  2010*     3 772   229   192   54   138  (817) (8)  (686) 2010*   374  119  (212) (206) (299) 644    345  2008    5 689   369   247   69   178     178 2008   522  533  (271) (144) 118  403    521  * Post-tax profits for ergoGroup in 2010 apply to the period 01.01.2010 - 30.09.2010 ** eBIt for 2010 deviates from ergoGroup's reported figures as a result of the different methods of recording a provision for restructuring.  * net cash flows for ergoGroup in 2010 apply to the period 01.01.2010 - 30.09.2010 Balance for discontinued operations / ErgoGroup: A summary of ergoGroup's outgoing balance as at 30.09.2010 is shown in note 29.   Profits for discontinued operations / ErgoGroup: Fair value measurement per level regard to the transfer of shares to third parties  for a two-year period without the approval of the  other party. Following the end of the two-year  period a party can initiate processes to evaluate  alternative ownership models and the indus- trial development of the company, which after a  minimum of five years from the time of the merger  can result in the other party having to participate  in a transaction that is also supported by the  Board of Directors and the majority of the other  shareholders. the parties have also agreed that  both are to be represented on the Board, in line  with market practice and norwegian law.  In accordance with the shareholder agreement  Posten norge sold 7% of its shares in november  for a total of MnoK 181 resulting in a loss of MnoK  12. In connection with a share issue in the company  in December 2010 Posten norge purchased the  number of shares required in order to maintain the  agreed ownership stake of 40% which was equiva- lent to an investment of MnoK 359.  the value  in the balance sheet as at 31.12.2010 after the  recognition of Posten norge's share of the profits  for 2010 was MnoK 1 432. see note 12. In connection with the completion of the merger  on 14.10.2010 a long-term loan from Posten norge  group to ergoGroup of approximately MnoK 1 400  was partly settled with the repayment of MnoK  1000. the conditions for the remaining MnoK 400  of the loan were renegotiated and the loan falls  due in 2011 months time. see note 13.  136 137 notes 04 04 notes NOTE 27    GUARANTEES/ MORTGAGES Posten norge As and its subsidiaries have provided various forms of guarantees, including contract guarantees, loan guarantees and other payment guarantees.  Guarantees (not recognised in the balance sheet as at 31.12): In connection with the merger between eDB Busi- ness Partner AsA and ergoGroup As an agreement  was entered into regarding the treatment of the  parent company guarantees from Posten norge to  ergoGroup As. these guarantees were moved from  the respective entries to other guarantees. the  previous year's figures have been restated accord- ingly. the guarantees expire between 2012 and 2015.  the reduction in the guarantees for the Group's  debt was mainly due to the guarantees given for  the subsidiary Posten eiendom Robsrud As to fulfil  its commitments for the completion of the south  eastern norway terminal being reduced as a result  of the project being completed, and the closure of  guarantees resulting from the merger in the Bring  Frigoscandia sverige Group.   the Group's subsidiaries provided assets with  a total book value of noK 86 million as security.

Sales in 2010 In 2009 it was decided that the   wholly-owned subsidiary Posten eiendom   espehaugen As would not be used by Posten  norge. the shares in the company were reclassified  as held for sale in Posten norge and assets in the  company were reclassified as separate held   for sale entries in the Group accounts.  the com- pany was sold in February 2010 for MnoK 87.  this produced a gain of MnoK 24 in the parent  company and MnoK 25 in the Group.    Bring Cargo As (formerly Bring Logistics As) sold  the wholly-owned subsidiary Breivika Industriveg  33As, a property in lesund, in July 2010, which re- sulted in a profit of MnoK 10. the sale was a stage  in the planned co-localisation with Posten norge in  a new terminal. Acquisitions and sales after balance sheet date  (unaudited figures): Bring Frigo (previously Bring Frigoscandia) will take  over Coldsped's cold storage business in sweden  with effect from 01.04.2011. the acquisition covers  the facilities in rebro, Jordbro, Kalmar, Kristan- stad, eslv and Malm. in 2010 the business had  revenues of MseK 84 and 57 employees. the  acquisition strengthens Bring's position as a com- plete logistics operator for the food industry and  increases its geographical presence so that Bring  Frigo gets closer to its customers' production  facilities. Furthermore storage and transport are  efficiently linked together and offer customers a  single contact point for all logistics connected with  the food industry.

Branding project  In september 2008, Posten norge  launched a new,  joint trademark called Bring, for its nordic mail  and logistics operations.

Posten norge's launch of the new brand  and changing of the logo cost MnoK 221 in 2008,  MnoK 62 in 2009 and MnoK 42 in 2010.  Restructuring provisions In 2010, the Group made a total provision of MnoK  27 for restructuring and reversed provisions for  previous years by MnoK 58.

REGULATORy FACTORS Posten Norge's licence  In accordance with 4 of the Postal Act the Minis- try of transport and Communication has granted  Posten norge As a licence to offer mandatory  postal services within a monopoly area. the licence  gives Posten norge the exclusive right to manage  sealed and addressed letter mail within a specific  weight and price range. As of 1 January 2006 the  range is from 50 grams and 2.5 times the basic  price for domestic priority mail.  At the same time  the licence also entails that Posten norge  must  carry out socially defined duties in the form of  requirements to the services offered as well   as requirements for cost-based prices and  geographical unit postage charges within the  monopoly.  The socially defined duties cover:   - Available product requirements (statutory postal  services and basic banking services).   - Requirement for the availability of the statutory  postal services   -Delivery time requirements   - Requirement for cost-based prices and  geographical unit postage charges within the  monopoly In point 4.2 of the licence it is proposed that  Posten norge 's extra costs related to the socially  defined duties are covered by the monopoly profits  from the monopoly area and government procure- ment granted through the fiscal budget. In 2008 no  funds were granted for government procurement.   With effect from 2009 the annual grant of funds in  advance for government procurement is adjusted  the following year based on a recalculation of  requirements in connection with the product  accounts for the licence. this arrangement shall  prevent overcompensation. After adjustment for  recalculation government procurement for 2009  was MnoK 211. In the 2010 fiscal budget MnoK 497  was allocated in advance and MnoK 345 in the 2011  fiscal budget.   the licence stipulates that Posten norge As must  document that there are no illegal cross subsidies  between the monopoly area and the services that  are subject to competition. this documentation is  to be submitted to the norwegian Post and tel- ecommunications Authority in the form of separate  product accounts. the auditor conducts annual  audits in accordance with the licence. the product  accounts for 2010 will be presented at the latest  three months after the financial statements for  2010 have been approved. the Ministry of transport and Communication has  extended Posten norge s licence from its original  expiry date of 31.12.2010 until 31.12.2011.    EU's Postal Directive  the eU's Postal Directive includes the stipulation  of certain minimum requirements for mandatory  postal services, principles on cost-based prices and  government compensation for extra costs related  to mandatory postal services, as well as the limita- tion on the national postal companies' monopolies  to the processing of letter mail by postal compa- nies that carry out mandatory postal services.  In accordance with the eU's third Postal Directive,  the majority of member countries liberalised their  postal markets (withdrawn national monopolies  on the processing of letter mail) with effect from  01.01.2011, while certain countries have been grant- After the merger between eDB Business Partner AsA and ergoGroup As the new company eDB ergoGroup AsA is treated as an associated company All transactions in 2010  between the Group and ergoGroup As/eDB ergoGroup AsA are classified in the entry for associated companies.

The Board of Directors and Group Chief Executive Officers responsibility for the financial statements the Board of Directors and Group Chief executive officer are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements  in accordance with the International Financial Reporting standards as adopted by the eU and for such internal control as the Board of Directors  and Group Chief executive officer determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstate- ment, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors responsibility our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regula- tions, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in norway, including International standards on Auditing.  those standards require  that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements  are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. the proce- dures selected depend on the auditors judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,  whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation and fair  presentation of the financial statements. the aim is to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose  of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control.  An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial  statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial   statements for the Parent Company and the Group.  Conclusion In our opinion, the financial statements of norway Post have been prepared in accordance with laws and regulations and present fairly, in all material  respects, the financial position of the Company and the Group as of 31 December 2010 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year  then ended in accordance  in accordance with the International Financial Reporting standards as adopted by the eU. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements  Opinion on the Board of Directors reportBased on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information  presented in the Directors report concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption and the proposal for the allocation of the  result is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations. Opinion on registration and documentation Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with   the international standard on assurance engagements (IsAe) 3000, "Assurance engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial  Information", it is our opinion that the Board of Directors and Group Chief executive officer have fulfilled their duty to properly record and   document the Companys accounting information as required by law and generally accepted bookkeeping practice in norway.  (this translation from norwegian has been made for information purposes only) oslo, 24 March 2011  eRnst & YoUnG As Jan Wellum svensen Certified Public Accountant  ed a postponement until 01.01.2013. the extent to  which norway will introduce or resist the eU's third  Postal Directive is a matter for the government  to decide. 85% of the Group's revenues currently  arises from business that is subject to competition  and Posten norge is also preparing to meet direct  competition for letter mail of less than 50 grams.  Yet, regardless of any liberalisation the strongest  competition for Posten norge's letter distribution  comes from electronic communications solutions.    Government ownership  In the owner's statement about Posten norge (st. meld. nr 12 (2007-2008), presented on 01.02.2008)  the Ministry of transport and Communications  concluded that Posten norge's statutory and  licence requirement to offer basic banking services  should not be changed or withdrawn.  In a review undertaken on behalf of the Ministry of  transport and Communication in 2011, Copenha- gen economics concluded that Posten norge's  statutory requirement to offer banking services  throughout its sales network could be repealed or  limited to its rural delivery service area. Furthermore approval was also given to convert a  further 124 post offices to Post in shops (PiB)  by the end of 2010. Approval was also given to  Posten norge's scandinavian growth strategy. the  government will consider Posten norge's foreign  operations in connection with the next owner's  statement about Posten norge's operations. The Post office network  During 2010 Posten norge completed the transla- tion of 124 post offices to Post in shops (PiB)  within the framework stated in st.meld. no. 12  (2007-2008). During 2010 Posten norge converted  29 post offices to PiB. Furthermore Posten norge  completed an open competitive tender for the  future operation of the PiB concept in 2010. Agree- ments have been signed for the operation of 1  164 PiBs. the agreements will be implemented by  01.07.2011 with a duration of 3 years, and an option  to extend for a further 2 years. During the course  of 2011 a competitive tender will be carried out for  the operation of a further PiBs and the agreed ex- tension of operating agreements with the current  operators of 21 PiBs.  At the end of 2010 the Post  office network consisted of 179 Post offices, 1 255  Post in shops and 19 Business centres.      Banking and payment services  Posten norge's statutory and licence requirement  to offer basic banking services is fulfilled through a  cooperation agreement with DnB noR. the agree- ment runs until 31.12.2017. If changes should occur to Posten norge's statu- tory and licence requirement to offer basic banking  services during this period, special provisions  have been agreed if Posten norge decides to  fully or partly wind up the services covered by the  cooperation agreement or carry out a competitive  tender for the services.    DISPUTES  eFtA's surveillance authority (esA) stated in  December 2008 that they will levy a fine on Posten  norge. Posten norge is accused of having breached  competition rules with agreements with grocery  stores etc. on the establishment of Post in shops  ("PiB"). on 01.07.2010 a fine of MeUR 12.89 (ap- proximately MnoK 101) was imposed on Posten  norge. Posten norge disputes the decision and  has brought the case before the eFtA court with  a plea for the fine to be ruled invalid.   the claimant,  the German logistics company schencker, lodged  a summons in 2010 requiring Posten norge to pay  compensation with an upper limit of MnoK 460. the  case has been adjourned until eFtA has handled  the appeal from Posten norge on the esA fine.  Posten norge maintains that there are no grounds  for compensation. no disputes that involve any significant risk   exposure to the Group have been registered   in the subsidiaries.  We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge, that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with approved accounting standards and give a  true and fair view of the Group and the parent companys consolidated assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations. We also confirm that that the  Report of the Board of Directors provides a true and fair view of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and the parent  company together with a description of the key risks and uncertainties that the company is facing.
