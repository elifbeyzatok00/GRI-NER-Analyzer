Response:   Others  Implantation  Since 2009, VCSA, member of the Basque Companies Association for the  Sustainability and Managerial Social Responsibility IZAITE, is adopting certain  elements of the Model of Traction over the Supply Chain proposed by this  association.  Significant improvements have been achieved in the implantation of the  Managerial Social Responsibility in VCSA, applying IZAITEs methodology and  other relevant considerations that VCSA gets by other ways.  VCSA has evaluated in 2009 the performance, in a wide sense of the term, of  suppliers and subcontractors in order to check the degree of conformity in the  fulfilment of VCSA's requirements.  During these evaluations the Integrated System of Management is taken into  account, giving special importance to Health and Safety and Environmental  protection.  The selection of products and services has been carried out using the list of  approved suppliers, and this documentation is used for planning visits and  audits, having in target the traction of our suppliers.         23                                                      Human Rights        Principle 2  Targets  Standardizing approaches and development of activity and management with  significant suppliers and subcontractors.

Also, and for the first time, the CSR has been included  as an aspect to audit in the most advanced companies VCSA works with.  The difficult situation that unfortunately almost all of our groups of interest are  living, and in special way some of our subcontractors, due to the crisis, has  persuaded to attempt an additional sensibility in order to make an equitable  distribution of orders, trying to favour the continuity and viability of these  organizations.  Experience exchange with other organizations has been kept, being  sustainability and CSR the subjects that have devoted more attention and effort  to the Managing Director and the Integrated Management System Process.  Beyond its influence capability, VCSA has supported the implantation of  Integrated Management Systems, principally Health and Safety at work and  Environmental Protection systems, demanding the fulfilment of certain basic  Human Rights such as labour risk prevention and environmental protection to  companies whose dimension or capability has made difficult to approach this  fundamental aim         24                                                     Human Rights        Principle 2    VCSA has kept incorporating to personnel of subcontracted companies of  frequent presence in VCSA in training activities to extend good work practices.

Target  Improve a 10 % the satisfaction of the employees    Actions  Describe the actions carried out related to this principle during the last  year, indicating the group of interest which it is focused.  Implantation   VCSA strictly fulfils the current legislation that guarantees the affiliation  freedom and the effective recognition of the right to the collective  negotiation.  Having the Biscay Metal Agreement as reference frame about labour  legislation, VCSA has an internal social agreement, better adapted for the  necessities of company and employees. These internal social agreements  are negotiated with the workers representatives, who have the right to  represent all the employees of VCSA.  There are Union elections every four years, and VCSA Management and the  former worker representatives guarantee that the elections are carried out in  a clean and regulated way.  VCSA management team agrees with the workers representatives subjects  such as the annual working calendar, economical agreements and ad hoc  agreements about other subjects that could affect to any part.          31                                                          Labour           Principle 3    The most relevant agreement in 2009 was the 2009 and 2010 flexibility  agreement. Due to the world financial situation, VCSA activity has  suffered strong demand changes that have required a quick adaptation of  the industrial organization to customers request.   The workers representatives highly value the VCSA commitment for  keeping and increasing the employment, despite the crisis.  Likewise, and in order to provide the workers representatives with  information enough about the company situation for taking decisions and  fulfilling their functions:  1. VCSA Management organizes three-monthly meetings to give  information relative to turnovers, order book, sale forecast, etc.  2. The president of the workers representatives is invited every month to  the discussion forums of the Management team so he is reported at all  time on the relevant facts of the company.  3.

External speakers of  relevant companies, associations, etc, usually take part in these meetings  in order to share their experience.         33                                                          Labour             Principle 3     5. MRF meetings (Marco de Relaciones Futuras, future relationships  framework). The management team organizes interviews with two  employees each time, and the target is to measure the satisfaction rate of  the employees about subjects related to the work, such as Health &  Safety, quality, productivity and recognition. These interviews last about  one hour, depending of the employees.  6. Second Satisfaction Survey, made in December of 2009.

This agreement has been  managed without relevant discrepancies, allowing new approaches to collective  bargaining.  This agreement meant an improvement comparing to the sectors conditions,  and a clear attempt to introduce improvements related to organization,  remuneration and flexibility.       38                                                              Labour        Principle 4  Target:   Establish the guidelines of agreement necessary for a stability in the relations  during the pened (2006-10) making it easier to attain the strategic aims of the  company, paying special attention to the sustainability of the company.

Target   1. To determine and to control the working hour modalities.  2. Fulfilment of the working hours  3. Minimization up to the elimination of overtime              40 Implantation Summary Principle 4  Principle 4  Diagnosis  Policy  Actions  Follow-up and Impact  Measurement  Employees    A:  Plan  the  work  with  the  adequate  staff.

Diagnosis  Indicate if the child labour is a risk factor in the entity, in view of the type  of activity it develops.  Response:   No    Implantation     VCSA continues without detecting child labour among its risk factors, as we  clearly assured in the last report. Although VCSA understands that it could be  possible in any of the groups of interest that identifies, there is not evidence  anywhere of this unwanted activity. VCSA identifies suppliers, NGOs, Local  communities and Society as its groups of interest, but the knowledge, influence  and control over them are logically limited.  VCSA is part of the managerial group Vicinay Marine, that also possesses  factories in Brazil and China. There is total evidence of not child labour in these  factories, and does not even have news that it could take place in its chain of  supply.  VCSA, in its CSR policy, has an special sensitivity to the infantile world,  orientating a part of its sponsorship to activities for children    Policy  Has the entity a clear written policy, where child labour is forbidden, and  communicate it?  Response: No       43                                                            Labour         Principle 5  Implantation    VCSA, as it has been told in the last section, does not have child labour as a risk  factor in its factories and surrounding groups of interest, and also has total evidence  that there is no child labour at all in the China and Brazil plants, where management  is comparable to the Basque Country plants management.    Actions  Describe the actions carried out related to this principle during the last year,  indicating the group of interest which it is focused.    Implantation    VCSA has shared with the other companies in the Vicinay Marine Group the best  practices in daily activities, exchanging experience and knowledge regarded to this  important principle.  VCSA has learned from the experience of the Brazil and China plants, and has  communicated that it is interested in both plants developing CSR, although VCSA is  aware that the problematic is very different due to the geographical and cultural  distance. Management systems implementation, certified by prestigious societies  and related to prestigious international standards is a reality in both centers (and  very advanced in Brazil), so understanding and good communication in relation to  this subject is satisfactory.        44  Implantation Summary Principle 5  Principle 5  Diagnosis  Policy  Actions  Follow-up and Impact  Measurement  Employees      A: Child Labour    A: Child Labour      T: Influence in  order that it is  not admitted  T: Eradicate 100  % in the  influence area    Suppliers  A: Child Labour        T: Influence in  order that it is  not admitted        NGO and  Corporative  Social  Responsibility  with the  Community  A: Child Labour        T: Influence in  order that it is  not admitted        Local  communities  A: Child Labour        T: Influence in  order that it is  not admitted        Society  A: Child Labour        T: Influence in  order that it is  not admitted            A:  Answer               T:    Target    No apply for this Principle          45        Principle 6  Businesses should uphold the  elimination of discrimination in  respect of employment and  occupation.       46                                                                 Labour         Principle 6  Businesses  should  uphold  the  elimination  of  discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.    Diagnosis  Indicate the direct or indirect risks identified for each group of interest in  your entity related to this Principle.  Implantation    VCSA gives equal treatment and does not practise any type of discrimination  among the different interested parts in relation to the above mentioned groups  of interest.  During 2009 VCSA has continued reducing the subcontracted and temporary  staff, incorporating them as steady workers.  The equal policy in the remuneration (same work and performance, same  salary) has naturally been maintained.  The contracting of the necessary staff has been done following the policy of  equality.  The relation with suppliers and subcontractors has been established on the  basis of the competitiveness and searching an equal distribution to favour all  the interested parties; it has had a special relevancy in 2009 due to the crisis  situation that affects part of our chain of supply. VCSA concern is not only the  viability of these companies, but also adequate work conditions.  There has been no breach of law related to employment policy.  Equality of opportunities has been promoted, allowing the access of any  qualified and competent person to responsibility positions.  Functions and relation have been decided inside the processes and among the  processes of the organization.   The stability of the staff has been a priority for VCSA.       47                                                             Labour         Principle 6  Policy  Has the entity formulated policies, plans and / or programs of integration  and not discrimination of disadvantaged groups such as persons with  disability, young people searching their first employment, unemployed  major of 45 years, immigrant persons or people in risk of exclusion?  Response:   Others    Implantation  VCSA has continued improving during 2009 its plan of rejuvenation of the staff  in those work positions where the physical condition can suppose problem for  the most veteran workers, reducing subcontracted employees and giving priority  to the contracting of young unemployed people and / or searching their first  employment; this plan has been applied although this year the production has  gone under almost 30 % due to the lack of demand in the markets.  As far as people with a disability is concerned, VCSA fulfils the current  legislation.    Target   Rejuvenating the staff by a retirement plant that fully satisfies those who  finishes their working life.  Offering their first job to qualified young people.    Actions  Describe the actions carried out related to this principle during the last  year, indicating the group of interest which it is focused.       48                                                               Labour        Principle 6  Implantation     The permanent staff has been increased in 15 people, reducing the  subcontracted and temporary staff.  VCSA has continued the policy of  contracting young people demanding their first job.    Does the entity promotes the effective equality of opportunities between  men and women in all aspects, including the access to senior-level  management position? Indicate what way.  Response:  Yes    Implantation  Due to the industrial activity of a metal company like VCSA, which manufacture  mooring lines, a product that demands certain physical strength in several  points of the production process, VCSA has continued developing the equality  between men and women in all those functions in which the physical qualities  do not fully condition the personnel selection .  Related to company management, women have been incorporated to all  different positions, even process direction and coordination.  The company organization in 2009, as shown in the attached document  Process map VCSA rev. 18, is an evidence of the effectiveness of VCSA  equal policy.  The internal social agreement grants that the maternity leave is two weeks  longer for the mother and one week longer for the father what the law states.    Target  Perfecting equality of opportunities for blue collar workers.        49                                                         Labour         Principle 6    Follow-up and Impact Measurement  Does the entity publish the composition of the Management team and rest  of the employees by category, sex, age and other diversity indicators?

VCSA has developed a brand new installation to coat chain with Thermal  Sprayed Aluminium, so the sprayed chain is much more resistant to corrosion.   a)  The environmental behaviour of the chain during its lifecycle is improved  because the corrosion is much smaller.  b)  Raw material consumption is lower, because it is not necessary to oversize  the chain to offset corrosion damage. The new installation includes both the  application system and the soundproof insulation.  c)  The installation also includes a vacuum system to avoid the emission of  aluminium particles, and makes it possible to recycle them. The cost has  been 90.000 euros.    2. VCSA has improved the technology of its gas and electricity meters, for a  better energetic management (13.000 euros).  a)  Gas and electricity consumptions are limited in real time depending on  production, helping consumptions sustainability and optimizing the production  process.    Trying to increase Environmental Awareness, VCSA takes active part in IZAITE  (Basque Country Companies Association for the Sustainability) sharing  environmentally friendly practices, technologies and experiences with other  members of the organization.       64                                                 Environment        Principle 9    VCSA is VIP member of the Stop CO2 Basque Country government project,  which consists in the measuring of the company CO2 emission, and prepare an  annual plan to reduce them.

This includes minimizing the consumption of resources necessary to get the  laminated bar, our raw material, manufacture of the chain, its service life,  dismantling and final recycling. The amount of the investment in these high  quality chains was 3% more than in 2008.  Soundproof insulation of the TSA application tower with a cost of 10.000 euros.  The vacuum system and gas treatment for the TSA tower with a cost of 90.000  euros.  The new gas and electricity meters with a cost of 13.000 euros.  The improvement of the lighting of workshops with a cost of 12.980 euros.  The total these four concepts sum is 125.980 euros.  VCSA, in an effort to reduce the CO2 emissions is replacing the gas powered  furnaces with electric heaters. The light chain furnaces have been already  replaced, and the heavy chain furnaces replacement will be reported in the next  global compact report.         66  Implantation Summary Principle 9  Principle 9  Diagnosis  Policy  Actions  Follow-up and Impact  Measurement    Several groups  of interest          A: Environmentally  friendly technology        T: Energy efficiency  and  environmentally  friendly      A:  Answer               T:    Target    No apply for this Principle       68      Principle 10  Businesses should work against  corruption in all its forms,  including extortion   and bribery.       69                                        Anti-corruption          Principle 10  Businesses should work against corruption in all its  forms, including extortion and bribery.
