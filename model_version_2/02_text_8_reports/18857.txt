These two reports have been integrated  into a single report entitled Integrated Report 2012.  In addition to bolstering non-financial information, we have taken steps to illustrate the connection between  financial and non-financial information. Rather than simply explaining the Omron Principles and the policy  of risk management, corporate governance, and internal control systems, we have endeavored to further  illuminate our efforts in these areas by providing concrete examples of initiatives whenever possible. For  example, this report contains statements from site managers explaining in detail how Omrons business  continuity plan functioned in response to the unprecedented Great East Japan Earthquake, which devastated  Japan on March 11, 2011, and how the Company conducted supply chain management to fulfill its supply  responsibility as a component manufacturer.  The goal of this report is to provide all Omron stakeholders, whether inside or outside of the Company, with  an overview of its management and to be the best possible report and the only one necessary for this  purpose. We hope that you will use this, Omrons first integrated report, to develop an understanding of the  various business activities of the Company, which it will employ in targeting enhanced corporate value over  the long term, and its business activities that aim to prove its value to society. Omrons integrated reports  will be published once a year.  I would like to ask all our stakeholders for their continued support and understanding.  In creating this report, we incorporated several items raised during a forum investigating how non-financial  data can contribute to ongoing corporate value, which was held by an industry and trade research section of  the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. This forum was held over the period from November 2011 to  March 2012, and as a member of this research section I attended this forum myself. I would like to express  my sincere appreciation to the members of the Ministry research team for providing us with this valuable  opportunity.

Message from the President A Look Back at My First Year as President More than one year has passed since I assumed the  position of president in June 2011. This year has been  one plagued with adversity as we were faced with the  lingering impacts of the Great East Japan Earthquake,  the severe flooding in Thailand, and the strong yen. These  difficulties tested our ability to adapt to drastic changes.  On the other hand, I believe we made considerable  strides during the year. Endeavoring to overcome these  trials helped unify Omrons management team and  inspired all members of the Omron Group to take the  initiative in standing up to these difficulties. Also during  this year, we developed new products and reinforced our  network targeting emerging markets. At the same time,  we pushed forward with measures to improve profitabil- ity. These efforts have reaffirmed my confidence in our  capacity to meet the goals defined in VG2020. Fiscal 2011 Performance and  Shareholder Returns First, I would like to report on our fiscal 2011 performance.  Our efforts to develop businesses and introduce new  products targeting emerging markets contributed to  sales, and net sales edged up 0.3% year on year, to  619.5 billion, accordingly. However, the impacts of  the strong yen and rising raw material prices resulted  in a 16.4% drop in operating income, to 40.1 billion.  Regardless of this performance, I feel our efforts  during the year to respond to the changing operating  environment enabled us to establish foundations for  profitable growth and enhance our ability to respond to  such changes.  In regard to shareholder returns, in fiscal 2011, we paid  annual cash dividends of 28.00 per share, down from  30.00 in fiscal 2010, resulting in a dividend payout ratio  of 37.6% and a dividend on equity (DOE) ratio of 1.9%.  We will continue to target a dividend payout ratio of at  least 20% and DOE ratio of 1.9%. After securing capital  required for investments in future growth and sufficient  internal reserves, we will distribute the surplus to our  shareholders. What Must be and Must Not be Changed During the year, dramatic changes have taken place in the  global economy. As the operating environment places  increasingly heavy pressure on corporate management,  Omrons responsiveness to such changes is being chal- lenged. Amidst rapidly transforming market conditions,  sudden natural disasters, and intensified competition, it is  clear we must respond more quickly, flexibly, and proac- tively than before. Our employees, products, and solutions  must evolve constantly in response to changing conditions.  We are thus working to ensure management can make the  necessary changes, such as those related to global  human resources systems or investment policies, in a  quick and decisive manner whenever needed.  However, the central aspects of our operations will not  be changed: these central aspects are embodied by the  Omron Principles that form the heart of our corporate  philosophy. Omron regards having a corporate philosophy  as something that is highly important, and we are proud  of the fact that we faithfully implement our principles.  The corporate core value defined by these principles is  Working for the benefit of society, and our corporate  motto is At work for a better life, a better world for all.  I believe this motto, originally coined over 50 years ago by  founder Kazuma Tateishi as a simple way of expressing our  philosophy, serves a purpose to the Company similar to  that of the spine for humans. Even if we are not aware of  it, our spine supports us and allows us to stand properly.  If we practice management based on the spirit of this  motto, which embodies the belief that companies should  not only pursue profit but also act as responsible corporate  citizens by giving back to the society in which they  operate, I am convinced that Omron will continue to grow  and that this growth will drive the development of society.  Our experience with the Great East Japan Earthquake,  which devastated Japan in 2011, proved these principles  are firmly entrenched throughout the Company. Following  this disaster, many Omron employees voluntarily con tributed  to reconstruction efforts at the stricken regions, providing  support in the healthcare field and in social infrastructure  areas such as transportation and the maintenance of  financial systems. In addition, the entire Group came  together to fulfill its responsibility of supplying products  to customers, an endeavor I think was successful.  The spirit of Working for the benefit of society was  naturally and voluntarily practiced by employees, not  imposed on them.  As we accelerate the globalization of our operations,  it is my hope this philosophy will become further rooted  throughout our operations. In hopes of accomplishing  this, in May 2012, we dubbed the anniversary of Omrons  founding as OMRON Group FOUNDERS DAY, which is  positioned as a day for us to reconfirm our purpose  together with all Omron employees across the globe.  In times of adversity, it is even more important to look  back at our founding and renew our intrepid spirit to  continue taking on challenges into the future. To Achieve Stronger Growth Fiscal 2012 will be devoted to advancing the new VG2020  long-term vision based on the three pillars of reinforce- ment of the Industrial Automation (IA) Business, sales  expansion in emerging markets, and focus on the environ- mental solutions business. I am confident that this is the  best course of action for us. To achieve higher levels of  growth in the future, we will maximize our efforts geared  toward meeting the goals outlined in VG2020 by creating  new value and operating our business in a speedy man- ner. I would like to ask for the continued support of all our  stakeholders, and I hope you will look forward to the  future of the Omron Group with anticipation.

Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information  14 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 15 We will not change the main strategies of VG2020.  We will accelerate the plan. Q1  The new long-term vision, VG2020, was announced in July 2011. Later, in April 2012,  you revised your targets for the GLOBE STAGE (FY2011–2013), the first phase  of this vision, to reflect the drastic changes in the market environment. In what  specific ways were the targets revised? Drastic changes in the market environment, such as the strong yen and the instability of financial systems in Europe,  forced us to revise our targets for the GLOBE STAGE of VG2020. Regardless, I saw no need to adjust the five basic  tasks: (1) reinforcement of the Industrial Automation (IA) Business (IAB & EMC), (2) sales expansion in emerging mar- kets, (3) focus on the environmental solutions business, (4) profit structure reform, and (5) strengthening global human  resources. Of these tasks, I feel the reinforcement of the IA Business, one of Omrons clear areas of strength, and  sales expansion in emerging markets are the most important.  This is because of the rising demand for factory automation in manufacturing industries in emerging markets.  In China, for example, soaring personnel expenses, or in other words, fixed costs, are becoming a burden for manage- ment, which has subsequently become a serious issue. For these reasons, it is growing increasingly difficult to conduct  successful production operations simply by employing a large number of employees. This situation is boosting the  demand for factory automation and is also creating a highly favorable environment for Omrons business. Aiming to  take advantage of this environment, we increased the number of sales bases in China from approximately 30 to 50 in  Interview with  the President Yoshihito Yamada President and CEO fiscal 2011. We also established Automation Centers in Japan, China, and Europe to strengthen our customer support  network. Through these centers, we will provide manufacturers around the world with products and services that  optimally meet their needs. One of the key strengths of Omron lies in the utilization of its vast expertise in relation to  production lines. This strength enables the Company to offer customers solutions that not only employ its own prod- ucts, but also effectively combine these products with those of other companies, allowing the Company to provide  customers with optimal value. Omron will further accelerate the development of Automation Centers around the  world, in emerging countries as well as in the United States and other developed nations.  I am certain that the strategies defined by VG2020, such as sales expansion in emerging markets and the reinforcement  of the IA Business, will lead the Company in the right direction.

The changes in the environmental solutions business, one of the key businesses in VG2020, are particularly beneficial.  After the Great East Japan Earthquake, serious electricity shortages occurred, and their persistence has become a  social issue that must be urgently addressed. The ongoing limited electricity supplies are forcing companies and  individuals to think of ways to conserve electricity and reduce usage during peak hours.  One of the responses to this issue has been the rapid expansion in the usage of solar power. In July 2012, the  Government of Japan launched a system for purchasing electricity generated using renewable energy sources, which is  anticipated to greatly stimulate the growth of the solar power market. We are already witnessing the benefits of growth  in this market, as solar power conditioners, which are used to convert power from solar cells from DC to AC, have  experienced a substantial increase in sales, rising 20% year on year  in fiscal 2011. We are also developing a wide range of solar power- related businesses, including the provision of an integrated system  for monitoring the operation of solar power systems and managing  on-site maintenance by utilizing remote monitoring.  Further, in order to effectively utilize limited electricity supplies, there  is a rising need for a means to control maximum electricity demand  through the usage of energy consumption monitoring  systems. The Omron Group has introduced such systems  and is already seeing impressive results. Also, several  customers have introduced these systems and are experi- encing favorable results. These market changes represent  significant opportunities for Omron. Q3  Focusing on the IA Business will be one of your key strategies. What are your plans  for other business areas? That is a question often asked by people from both inside and outside the Company. Other businesses, too, are  important to Omron.  Currently, our Automotive Electronic Components Business (AEC), Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business  (SSB), and Healthcare Business (HCB) are run as independent (spin-off) companies, each of which has established  its own unique position in its respective business domains. We believe it is important to target growth for these  businesses that matches their individual characteristics. Faced with harsh market conditions, we implemented  initiatives in these three businesses to accelerate business development through faster decision making. Targeting  further acceleration, we delegated responsibility for these businesses in an appropriate manner to enable more-optimal  business operation. The effects are beginning to appear in various areas. The previously unprofitable AEC saw significant  improvements, and in fiscal 2011, it had an operating income margin of 3.2%, despite the impact of the severe flooding  in Thailand. In fiscal 2012, we anticipate this business will become stronger and will record a margin of 5.3% (forecasts  released on July 30, 2012), which is an exceptionally high level for the automotive industry. The HCB, meanwhile, will  be operated in a manner prioritizing speed and close connections with the sites where our products are used. Through  such management, we will work to meet our ambitious goals for fiscal 2012 of improving sales by approximately 15%  Forging stronger team relations among business lines (vertical) and  between corporate headquarters and business divisions (horizontal)  will allow us to fully demonstrate the power of the Omron Group. Free blood pressure testing provided in Delhi, India Power conditioner for solar power  generation system in China, 75% in India, and 30% in other emerging markets. We will utilize the unique strengths of each business and  conduct management with the aim of further cementing the positions these businesses have already established.  The SSB is also an important business to us, and we will strengthen it by promoting coordination between this  business and the Environmental Solutions Business HQ and IAB. The goal of these initiatives will be to create new  environmental solutions businesses for factories and public facilities. I believe this will enable us to generate business  synergies that are characteristic of Omron into the future.  Also, we will forge stronger vertical team relations down business lines and horizontal relations between them and  create new value through the strategic allocation of management resources, including products,  technologies, human resources, and capital. This is an important management strategy that will enable us to fully utilize  the power of the Omron Group. Q4  You mentioned forging stronger vertical and horizontal team relations. Specifically,  what initiatives are being implemented? One example is our efforts to expand operations in emerging countries. Omron established regional headquarters in  Japan, the United States, the Netherlands, China, and Singapore to develop a unique global network and services  systems closely linked to each geographical area.  Recently, we have identified India as a key emerging country in growth strategies and for the reinforcement of the  IA business. To enable business divisions in this country to better focus on business operations, we established a new  regional headquarters in India in fiscal 2011. In addition, we established a regional headquarters in Brazil in fiscal 2012. Now,  with seven regional headquarters, we are ready for the full-fledged advancement of operations in emerging countries. In  accelerating our approach toward emerging countries, it will be vitally important to raise the recognition of the Omron brand.

Currently, Omron has defined 167 core positions, 59 of which are based overseas. Forty of these positions  are currently filled with Japanese people, with only 19 held by people from other countries. Looking ahead, we realize  that strengthening local management will be essential to continuing our operations as we progressively globalize. For  this reason, I aim to reverse this ratio in the near future.  Accordingly, we will develop an in-house environment conducive to providing such opportunities. I hope employees  will take advantage of these opportunities, and from such motivated employees, the executive management team at  headquarters will be able to find candidates for the next generation of management. Q6  Lastly, how do you plan to demonstrate your own strengths into Omrons future  management initiatives? What do you think is most important in management? I think my own strengths lie in my ability to encourage team building and my management background in international  operations. In the past, I served as president of the Omron Healthcare Europe. During this period, I came to realize the  importance of respecting diversity in team building efforts. The management team consisted of 11 people from six  different countries, three of whom were women. A startling number of opinions were raised and discussions were  grueling but very fruitful. Together, we undertook many challenges, including expansion into the Russian market, and  we were able to succeed thanks to our strong sense of unity. These experiences help me in promoting team building  today. Developing a mutual understanding between all members is of the utmost importance in raising team spirit. This  requires substantial discussion. In this practice, I am always sure to thoroughly listen to others. Drawing on my own  strengths, I will actively gather information from both internal and external sources, be decisive, and work to make  Omrons management more ever dynamic.  We are working to strengthen intergroup bonds of Team Omron, with the aim of guaranteeing even firmer growth  into the future. The management team are leading these efforts as a core part of Team Omron.  At the same time, each business division has their own version of Team Omron. Team Omron holds open discussions  without fear of opposition, and all members work hard together to accomplish the same shared goal. I compare this  type of team work to a shinkansen bullet train. A shinkansen cannot head toward its goal at full speed if all its cars are not  securely connected. Likewise, it is not sufficient for the organization to only be connected within divisions, and this is  why we place such a strong emphasis on promoting connections between business divisions and corporate headquarters  divisions. Going forward, Team Omron will keep running at full speed, heading toward the achievement of the goals  outlined in VG2020. In pursuing stronger growth, we will strengthen intergroup connections  under the mantra of Team Omron. Interview with the President The HCB currently operates in more than 110 countries. The business-to-consumer (B2C) business is playing an integral  role in raising awareness of the Omron brand. To make Omron known, people must first see our products and under- stand our technological superiority. Our Omron brand healthcare products embody our philosophies and technological  capabilities. Accordingly, marketing these products and promoting their use in new markets enables us to establish a  bridgehead that will facilitate the introduction of our IAB, AEC, or other business-to-business (B2B) businesses in these  countries.  These brand strategies targeting emerging countries will be conducted by promoting coordination between business  lines and the corporate communications department in headquarters, and through these strategies we will work to raise  brand recognition among consumers in these countries. It has been said, that if brand recognition* among consumers  exceeds 40%, it will represent a significant advantage for expanding operations in these countries. By targeting this goal  of 40%, we have succeeded in raising brand recognition in India from 24% in fiscal 2011 to 45% today. Enhanced brand  recognition has proven to be incredibly beneficial in accelerating the development of our various businesses in the Indian  market. In Brazil, where we started full-fledged brand marketing one year  after doing so in India, we have already  achieved brand recognition of approximately 20%. This is an example of the success of coordination between the HCB  and corporate headquarters divisions in establishing a superior position in emerging countries. * Brand recognition is calculated as the percentage of people that recognize Omrons logo and have an understanding of Omrons business activities. Q5  How about human resources strategies?   What specific measures are you considering? VG2020 defines developing human resources as an important  management strategy for ensuring future growth. If we are able  to develop a strong team of superior personnel, the growth of  our business will become even stronger. We therefore aim to  grow our human resources in conjunction with our business  growth. In other words, we want to provide new and challenging  opportunities for employees who do exemplary work, and we  want to grow as a company that can continue to provide such  opportunities. For us to grow as such a company, it is important  to emphasize the development of human resources in manage- ment, and for this reason we have defined the task of strength- ening global human resources in VG2020.  At the same time, it is important for all employees to establish  their own visions for their future career path. I do not doubt we  will have to compete on the global stage in the future. For this  reason, I hope every employee will have a clear picture of what  work they wish to do in what part of the world.  One specific human resources strategy we have developed is  the Global Core Position Strategy, which was born out of our  desire to actively provide opportunities to non-Japanese employ- ees by allowing them to participate in management. We have  defined management positions critical to advancing the VG2020  strategies as core positions. We intend to discover, promote,  and educate human resources that can take over these positions  CONTENTS Interview with the President Special Feature 1: Global Vertical-Horizontal Matrix Management Special Feature 2: Omrons Supply Responsibility and Business Continuity To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information P.24 Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information  20 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 21 Competition is growing more intense in global markets, particularly in emerging economies.   To more firmly establish its competitive advantage, the Omron Group is forging stronger vertical  team relations down its business lines and horizontal linkages between corporate headquarters and  business divisions with the aim of accelerating management. This section looks at the strengths  and strategies of each of our businesses through the lens of matrix management and introduces the  roles of our head office divisions.  (Interviewer: Satoshi Ando, Executive Officer, Senior General Manager, Investor Relations  Headquarters) Industrial Automation Business (IAB) ——  Further Reinforcing Operations on the  Basis of Three Core Strategies —— To begin, could you please outline IABs  strengths and competitive advantages? Fujimoto: We are working to boost competitiveness  through three core strategies: No. 1 in control, No. 1 in  product lineup, and No. 1 in the future.  For our No. 1 in control strategy, the key is changing  the culture of controls. Under this strategy, we are pro- moting machine controls that are faster, more precise,  and safe. Our strength in this area is robust machine- focused engineering. The No. 1 in product lineup  strategy emphasizes extending our product lines by  reducing costs on general-purpose products and through  radical changes on a variety of fronts. Our No. 1 in the  future strategy refers to anticipating customer needs  and offering proposals that meet those latent demands,  such as by addressing the issue of conserving energy.  Demand for power-saving solutions is increasing through- out the manufacturing sector, and we have specific  expertise in this area.  —— What are IABs core products? Fujimoto: Last year, we launched Sysmac NJ Series  controllers that are based on an automation platform for  connecting ultrahigh-speed, high-precision machinery and  controlling them via a single software program. In the  current fiscal year, we expect to expand this series  further as one of our No. 1 in control products. Global  standard products are the concept behind our No. 1 in  product lineup strategy. In line with this approach, we  plan to steadily roll out products that match the needs of  emerging and other world markets. We are also cultivating  environment-related equipment, such as electricity sensors  and their controllers, as No. 1 in the future products. —— Could you describe IABs core technologies? Fujimoto: Our core technologies provide functionality  that competitors are unable to match. These technologies  effectively utilize general-purpose products and elements  and take advantage of the capabilities of software, and  are the product of countless development processes  conducted in the pursuit of higher levels of functionality.  Moreover, these technologies enable us to create prod- ucts more inexpensively, holding down costs without  sacrificing quality.  Aiming to Heighten Our Engineering  Prowess through Means such as M&A and  Collaboration —— What are the issues you face in enhancing  competitiveness further? Fujimoto: Strengthening our ability to provide proposals  related to sophisticated control products is extremely  difficult, and we face the issue of how to cultivate sales  engineers (SEs) who are well versed in various equip- ment in a short period of time. Another important issue  lies in being responsive cost-wise in global markets  across our product portfolio. We are working to hold  down development costs by standardizing product  development and creating system platforms that utilize  our products in a standard manner.  —— To bolster your engineering and strengthen  your ability to provide higher added-value  proposals, do you intend to continue pursuing  a strategy of increasing the number of SEs and  acquiring companies in China? Fujimoto: In the previous fiscal year, we increased the  number of SEs in emerging markets by approximately  50%; the question now is how to enhance their capabili- ties further. We will also continue looking at M&A and  collaboration opportunities in fields that we are unable to  develop on our own.  —— Please explain more specifically what is  meant by Omrons ability to connect in ways  that other companies cannot. Fujimoto: One good example is to connect all the highly  sophisticated products on the same network. Through  our Sysmac NJ Series, which I described earlier, we aim  to change the culture of controllers. Going forward, we  also plan to connect to an increasing number of safety- related products that could not be connected in the past.  Electronic and Mechanical  Components Business (EMC) ——  Monozukuri (Product Creation) Is a  Competitive Advantage That Other  Companies Cannot Emulate 1 Global Vertical-Horizontal Matrix Management Striving to Create New Value through  Linkages down Business Lines (Vertical)  and between Corporate Headquarters and  Business Divisions (Horizontal) Special Feature  Industrial  Automation  Business (IAB) Shigeki Fujimoto Senior Managing Officer President, Industrial Automation  Company The above-mentioned title  is as of the date of this  dialogue (June 20, 2012). CONTENTS Interview with the President Special Feature 1: Global Vertical-Horizontal Matrix Management Special Feature 2: Omrons Supply Responsibility and Business Continuity To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information P.36  22 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 23 —— Next, please outline the strengths and  business strategies of EMC. Tada: In fiscal 2012, we plan to aggressively develop our  business in components for industrial equipment, cen- tered on rapidly growing emerging markets, thereby  recovering our growth and profitability. We will also  concentrate initiatives in the energy and environment  field. In particular, electric vehicles and solar power  generation systems. We intend to enhance competitive- ness by taking advantage of the broad and finely gauged  global sales network that Omron has built to date and  utilize our manufacturing capabilities, including propri- etary product design capabilities, materials technologies,  and optimizing technologies based on monozukuri.  Targeting an unshakeable Lead in  Global Market Share —— What are the core technologies that sup- port the mainstay relay component segment? Tada: We hold the top share of the global market for  relay components. Our market share in this area was  more than 20% in the previous fiscal year,* but we are  the leader by only a small margin.* We will work at  increasing our lead. * Based on Omrons estimates  In EMC, most of our products endup inside our  customers products, so prices are heavily influenced by  fluctuations in the market prices of final products. The  key therefore becomes how to meet our customers  needs as reasonably as possible. Furthermore, we must  ensure stable product quality. In the past, half of the  relay products that we manufactured in China and other  Asian countries were labor-intensive, which means they  were variable in quality. Now, we are introducing  automated equipment to handle this production in a bid  to make quality more consistent. ——You have described the Companys  competitiveness and sales and technological  capabilities in key product areas. What are  your thoughts on the business environment? Tada: The current business environment is tight, but at  the same time it offers opportunities. For example, in  Asia, social security expenses are expected to rise in the  neighborhood of 15% to 25% per year, on average. From  a manufacturing viewpoint, this means higher labor  costs. However, if customers further automated their  operations to counter these labor costs, this presents a  business opportunity for our industrial automation and  electronic components businesses. It is important to take  advantage of the opportunities created by demand trends  driven by changing business environments in China and  other Asian countries. Healthcare Business (HCB)  ——  Expanding Four Core Categories through  an Extensive Sales Network —— Next, would you explain the Companys  strengths and competitiveness in HCB? Miyata:  Our sales network is made up of some 300,000  pharmacies throughout the world. In the field of home  healthcare instruments, no other company has a network  that can match ours. We are utilizing this strength to  expand our business in four core categories: blood pres- sure monitors, thermometers, blood glucose monitors,  and nebulizers. We are also developing new technologies  that allow bio data to be measured at home, formerly a  procedure that could only be done at medical institutions.  The key is to make the best use of our competitive edge  in sales and R&D. —— Global competition seems to be less  pronounced in HCB than in the IAB and EMC.  What will be the keys to winning out against  local competition? Miyata:  The other day, I went to India, where some 50  competitors provide blood pressure monitors. This situa- tion brought home to me anew the importance of Omrons  brand penetration. In addition to measurement precision,  we will work aggressively to disseminate other informa- tion on product quality that is only available through Om- ron, thereby ensuring the reliability of our brand. —— One of your core products is blood pres- sure monitors, and according to your own esti- mates you have shares of around 50% of the  global market, approximately 60% in Japan, and  more than 60% in China. What is the core tech- nology that supports this strength? Also, what  are your strategies for further increasing this  market share? Miyata:  For blood pressure monitors, on the hardware  front measurement precision and ease of use are para- mount. For example, to reduce the impact that such  conditions as arm thickness and softness have on mea- sured results, we have developed a sensing and control  technology that responds to individual differences. We  also continue to pursue efforts that improve ease of use,  such as narrower cuffs that are easier to wrap around the  arm. Based on the concept of providing products that are  easy for anybody to use to provide accurate measure- ments, we are accelerating the popularization of the  Medical Link system for providing blood pressure data  measured at home to healthcare institutions, where it  can be assessed by physicians and other specialists. In  this way, we are building up an unassailable business  base from the perspectives of products as well as ser- vices and systems. —— HCB is driving one of the VG2020  strategies, growth in emerging markets. Have  horizontal and vertical relationships in this busi- ness changed? Miyata: Operational speed has picked up through proac- tive contributions on the horizontal axis from corporate  headquarters. Nowadays, we are able to make effective  use of information on other business lines products and  technologies, whereas we were unaware of this informa- tion in the past. For example, we are moving forward  with production line automation at a rate that develop- ment personnel in the healthcare sector would have  been unable to handle in the past by taking advantage  of the production technologies of the Electronic and  Mechanical Components Business. Forging links such as  this have been extremely effective. Also, the corporate  headquarters public relations division has supported  efforts to boost our brand recognition on a global level,  which has made our activities easier. Global Strategy Headquarters ——  Maximizing Management Resources  by Combining Vertical and Horizontal  Elements —— Please explain the Global Strategy Head- quarters mission and role in implementing  vertical and horizontal strategies. Miyanaga: We adopted a system of business companies  more than 10 years ago, making our business divisions  autonomous. The goal behind this move was to acceler- ate business operations. This move has been successful  to some extent, but VG2020 calls for us to make greater  leaps forward. To achieve this, we will need to utilize the  strengths of our global businesses through connections  that go beyond the vertical and horizontal barriers.   The Global Strategy Headquarters carries out the  following three roles in attaining this goal.

Miyanaga: One element is prioritizing investment. We  are earmarking investment for the further development  of existing businesses, such as industrial automation and  businesses in emerging markets, as well as environmen- tal businesses and other new businesses. We are also  thinking of expanding our manufacturing structure to  achieve global growth, centered on Asia. By making  capital investments that outpace depreciation and amorti- zation, we will augment our growth potential and cost- competitiveness. We are also planning around 10 billion  in strategic investment, centered on IA. Furthermore, we  will overhaul our manage ment council by creating a  structure that brings together the heads of our business  divisions and head office divisions to enable swifter  decision making.   In the previous fiscal year, we set up a regional head- quarters in India. This year, we set up a headquarters in  Brazil. Whereas in the past each business line had its  own human resources and administrative functions, the  new structure will provide a package that offers support  for these infrastructure and brand strategy development  functions. Initiatives involving these horizontal functions  are another major change. Global Resource Management  Headquarters (GRM) ——  Human Resource Strategy to Cultivate  Global Management Resources —— In closing, could you please outline the  major initiatives of GRM? Nitto: Our most important initiatives concern human  resources strategy. In addition to rejuvenating our  management team, our initiatives will take a birds-eye  view toward the next decade. We will build a structure to  cultivate management resources on a global basis for the  next generation and the generation after that. We have  identified 167 global core positions. We will fill these  positions through both internal training and external  recruiting by determining who is most suitable for these  positions, during what span, and based on what level of  experience. Also, the Company plans to move  aggressively toward assigning locally hired personnel to  core positions. —— What are your other points of focus? Nitto: My missions include strategic cash management  and risk management. In the past, the allocation of funds  and real estate tended to be on the basis of vertical  management. We will shift to a more centralized financial  strategy that includes making more-effective use of  management resources. Globally, the risks that we face  are growing, including sudden fluctuations in the eco- nomic environment and the risk of natural disasters. We  will strive to create structures and systems that avoid  these risks and minimize the damage they cause to  ensure our business divisions can move ahead securely. Cultivating New Markets That Engender  Synergies between Businesses —— Please provide some examples of efforts  you are making to foster ties between business  lines. Fujimoto: Let us look at relays for solar batteries. These  are manufactured by EMC and sold by IAB, so we natu- rally need to pursue a joint strategy. EMC excels at manu- facturing products, while IAB has marketing expertise. By  combining these two strengths, we can move into en- tirely new markets.   As another example, when IAB aims to move into  emerging markets, the division can benefit from the solid  expertise of HCB, which was an early entrant into these  markets, working to firmly established the Omron brand  there. This situation is extremely favorable. —— What will be the focuses for the  Global Strategy Headquarters going forward? Miyanaga: When making decisions, I believe we will need  to strike a balance between stable, incremental improve- ment and rapid, drastic progress.  From the standpoint of stable, incremental improve- ment, from our manufacturing processes to the manage- ment of our global operating performance, it is important  to make ongoing improvements in various business  processes based on the knowledge we gain through our  everyday activities. Conversely, in achieving rapid, drastic  progress, innovation is needed when delving into alto- gether new products and businesses and developing the  unparalleled cost structures that will be necessary to  succeed in global markets and achive a competitive  advantage. —— What will be focuses for the Global  Resource Management Headquarters? Nitto: We need to embrace diversity wholeheartedly. In  addition to promoting non-Japanese personnel, the key  to our current strategy lies in how to make Japanese  people, as well as Japan itself, more global.   At the same time, there is no point in pursuing diver- sity if this simply results in fragmentation. It will be  important to maintain the binding force of our corporate  principles. I believe the Company excels in remaining true  to its corporate principles, but this is because we have  management strategies that are fully based on our corpo- rate principles. Promoting diversity will be a major chal- lenge, but I believe we can achieve this goal as long as  we rely on our corporate principles as the binding force. —— We hope these interviews have assisted in  deepening the readers understanding of the  Omron Groups efforts to realize the goals of  VG2020 as well as the possibilities of vertical- horizontal matrix management. Global Strategy  Headquarters Yutaka Miyanaga Executive Officer Senior General Manager,  Global Strategy Headquarters Global Resource  Management Headquarters (GRM) Koji Nitto Executive Officer Senior General Manager,  Global Resource  Management Headquarters 01 Global Vertical-Horizontal Matrix Management Satoshi Ando Executive Officer, Senior General Manager,  Investor Relations Headquarters  Interviewer CONTENTS Interview with the President Special Feature 1: Global Vertical-Horizontal Matrix Management Special Feature 2: Omrons Supply Responsibility and Business Continuity To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information  26 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 27 Amid the Great East Japan Earthquake and the flooding in Thailand, we moved forward on  initiatives to minimize risks. To this end, we sought to decentralize parts procurement risk   and standardize equipment and information systems. —— Please describe the roles and objectives of  the Global Process Innovation Headquarters. At Omron, each business division conducts planning,  development, production, and sales in a vertical line, but  the Global Process Innovation Headquarters takes a  horizontal, Companywide approach and has the role of  improving all steps of business processes on a global  basis. Its objective is to improve development, produc- tion, purchasing, and quality management and further  strengthen each of these processes. To provide total  optimization, the unit functions as a corporate headquar- ters division and is involved in logistics, IT, and other infra- structure activities. —— These major disasters were of course  unexpected. Could you please describe their  impact on the Omron Group and responses of  the Global Process Innovation Headquarters? The Great East Japan Earthquake, which struck in March  2011, directly affected our sales, maintenance, and  service functions in the Tohoku region. Our production  functions were not directly affected, partly because we  do not have any factories in the Tohoku region. However,  many semiconductor and electronic components manu- facturers are clustered in Tohoku, and more than 100 of  the suppliers upon which the Omron Group relies were  affected by the disaster. This situation affected our sup- plies of more than 16,000 parts, so the damage to our  parts procurement network was extensive.  Following the earthquake, we quickly set up a Compa- nywide disaster response headquarters, centered on  President Yamada, who was head of the Group strategy  department at the time. We launched a Procurement Task  Force, and the Global Process Innovation Headquarters  took on the role of promoting its measures throughout  the organization. We formed project teams comprising  the heads of purchasing from each business division to  pursue the task forces initiatives.   First, we worked to meet our responsibility for supply- ing products and services to our customers. To this  extent, we determined which products were at risk in  terms of procurement and developed measures to mini- mize these risks. We soon recognized that in addition to  the general-purpose items used in semiconductors and  electronic components, Omrons proprietary, custom- made products were subject to substantial risk. Even  though we gathered information from our suppliers on a  daily basis, it was difficult to judge exactly when produc- tion could recommence. Therefore, we made a Group- wide decision to place bulk orders for these items,  particularly semi conductors and custom electronic com- ponents, which entailed exposure to risks as these items  were not returnable.  —— What sort of initiatives did you enact as  next steps? At an early stage, the disaster response headquarters  recognized it would be difficult to continue production on our  previous scale for a certain length of time. We made the  management decision to give the highest weighting to  business in the medical sector and involving social infrastruc- ture, followed by businesses of high strategic importance,  and we prioritized products for each business division.   Next, we introduced design changes and alternatives  for key parts for which suppliers did not have inventories  or were unable to supply. We presented delivery time  recovery plans to our customers and asked them to  accept postponed deliveries for orders that were not  urgent or to accept delivery of alternative products. Our  salespeople pulled together to work out adjustments  with customers around the world. —— I understand these initiatives ultimately  evolved into structural reforms. Can you offer  specific examples of their results? Afterward, we adopted a strategic and continuous approach  to management, identifying the social responsibility of  each of our businesses, prioritizing business strategies,  and clarifying which products could be discontinued and  replaced with new items. We also promoted the transi- tion to new generations of products due to business  continuity concerns in the aftermath of the earthquake.  This switching from older products to newer alternatives  was a move that in some cases we had been unable to  accomplish beforehand. At the same time, when revising  designs we encouraged an approach toward product  standardization. —— After that point, faced with the flooding in  Thailand you were able to procure parts and turn  to alternative sources of production in a rela- tively short time. Was putting these fundamental  measures into action a case of applying the  lessons the Company had learned as a result of  the Great East Japan Earthquake? The factory of the Automotive Electronic Components  (AEC) Business was hit directly and severely by the  flooding in Thailand. Some 25 suppliers were affected,  many of them companies that provide us with general- purpose  electronic components, so we felt the effects  over a broad range of businesses. Ultimately, we esti- mated the impact to have been on a similar scale to that  of the earthquake. However, because we had a complete  list of which parts were used for which products that we  could utilize in the aftermath of the earthquake, we were  able to respond in around two-thirds of the amount of  time that was needed following the earthquake. —— I understand AEC was the main focus of  recovery and restoration work at your plants in  Thailand. What support did the Global Process  Innovation Headquarters provide? Business divisions handled the on-site reconstruction and  recovery work themselves; as in the case of the earth- quake, we took the lead on parts supply measures. We  also provided logistical support as well as support on the  equipment production front when it was urgently need- ed. The Global Process Innovation Headquarters dis- patched personnel to China and other parts of Asia with  the aim of facilitating adjustments on a global basis,  including the sourcing of alternative parts and communi- cation with individual plants. 2 Omrons Supply Responsibility and Business Continuity We will fulfill our social responsibility by creating a business structure that is resilient  to changes in the external environment and  strong in the face of risks. Special Feature  Kiyoshi Yoshikawa Executive Officer Senior General Manager,   Global Process Innovation  Headquarters CONTENTS Interview with the President Special Feature 1: Global Vertical-Horizontal Matrix Management Special Feature 2: Omrons Supply Responsibility and Business Continuity To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information  28 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 29 —— It seems that you are enacting Company- wide initiatives, including risk response, stan- dardizing production, and utilizing universal  product coding. As a measure to quickly restore the production of key  products, under which, in the event that existing facilities  are hit by a major disaster, other manufacturing bases  compensate for this loss in production capacity. In this  sense, standardizing facilities and information systems is  important. In other words, we need to pursue initiatives  that step up our ability to shift to alternative production  given a variety of scenarios. We can postulate a variety of  disasters that may occur in the future, but I believe we  have created a structure that will allow us to respond  flexibly. I consider this readiness to be a major source of  Omrons competitiveness. —— Please describe the status of the Omron  energy-saving measures and systems that the  Environmental Solutions Business HQ intro- duced to address electricity supply shortages  and encourage energy-saving measures. We responded to the need for electricity-saving mea- sures in the summer of 2011 by introducing our energy  savings monitoring system*1 at all 21 of our locations  throughout Japan, allowing us to monitor electricity use  at multiple locations. These systems went into operation  on July 1, 2011. We were able to visualize, in real time,  the total amount of power being used at our facilities by  individual power company service area by our three  facilities in the Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd.s service  area, for example, or by the six facilities in the Kansai  Electric Power Co., Inc.s service area. By making this  information visible, the system enabled us to implement  measures to reduce peak power consumption.This year,  we continued these initiatives, which we dubbed Smart  Power Savings.* In the summer of 2011, Smart Power  Savings activities led us to reduce peak electricity con- sumption in the Kansai Electric service area by 22%  compared with fiscal 2010 levels. Reinforcing our own  power generation systems accounted for 6 percentage  points of this amount and eco-monozukuri (eco-product  creation)*2 for the remaining 16 percentage points.  These measures had the effect of curtailing the amount  of power used at production sites. In the summer of  2012, we will continue with Smart Power Savings initia- tives, combined with advanced eco-monozukuri. Through  these endeavors, we expect to reduce power consump- tion by more than 25% compared with fiscal 2010. *  Smart Power Savings: Omrons name for proprietary energy-saving measures  being pursued throughout the Company, comprising the following two initiatives: *1  Energy savings monitoring system: This is a system for monitoring and reducing  peak electricity consumption throughout a specific area. *2  Eco-monozukuri: Reducing electricity used in manufacturing by improving  production facility operations Details of our business continuity plan (BCP) and business involving energy-saving  measures are available on our website. http://www.omron.co.jp/green-automation/trend/bcp/ —— Updating the BCP must certainly have  been a management priority following the  Great East Japan Earthquake and the flooding  in Thailand. Could you outline some specific  BCP-related initiatives? Omrons fundamental BCP policy has three main thrusts:  protecting the safety of people, cooperating across the  board in maintaining and restoring social infrastructure,  and minimizing any impact on our customers and Omrons  businesses. In developing disaster response plans, it is not  sufficient to merely focus on short-term reconstruction  after a disaster, concluding efforts after a sufficient level of  reconstruction is achieved. Rather, we must work vigilantly  on an ongoing basis to ensure that we can minimize the  risks of any future disasters that may occur. Accordingly,  after having experienced last years earthquake and flood- ing in Thailand, I believe we need to conduct a full review  of our initiatives, addressing additional issues and creating  a business structure that is more resilient to changes in  the external environment and stronger in the face of risks. —— In closing, what was it that inspired you  to go to such lengths to fulfill your supply  responsibility as a manufacturer? If our business divisions and headquarters networks  function smoothly on a daily basis, the moment we  detect an issue that could have a major impact on our  business we can pull together to respond quickly on a  Companywide basis. In the face of the crises that we  have recently experienced, I believe that each employee  has gained a greater recognition of their responsibility to  our businesses. The back ground for this realization is one  of the Omron Principles, of contributing to society  through business. Even if recovery measures cause prof- its to drop temporarily, as a manufacturer we must focus  on meeting the important responsibility of continuing to  supply products and services to our customers. Our core  thinking is that meeting this responsibility ultimately  leads to enhanced corporate value. Going forward, as we  continue to prepare against risks, we need to redouble  our efforts to meet our responsibilities as a company and  realize growth. Optimizing CO2 reductions by making waste and inefficiencies visible  02 Omrons Supply Responsibility and Business Continuity We recognize that supply  responsibility is a management priority  for a manufacturer and understand that  fulfilling this responsibility leads to  enhanced corporate value.

IAB net sales declined 0.4% year on year, to 270.8 billion, and  operating income decreased 12.8%, to 33.3 billion, in fiscal 2011.  In Japan, sales were down 0.6% year on year, to 123.1 billion. In  the first quarter, there was concern regarding the impact of delayed  capital investment in the automobile and semiconductor industries  as well as the difficulty in procuring parts, both of which resulted  from the Great East Japan Earthquake. Faced with such adversity,  we prioritized product supply, leading to significant increases in net  sales, particularly in regard to sensors and programmable logic  controllers, which reflected customers efforts to secure inventories.  Starting in the second quarter, performance was impacted by  continued sluggish capital investment and inventory adjustment  trends in industries related to semiconductors and electronic  components, but strong capital investment demand in the automo- bile and machine tool industries helped keep net sales in line with  levels in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The third quarter was  marked by the appearance of post-earthquake reconstruction  demand as well as elevated demand from Japanese companies  following the severe flooding in Thailand, and as a result capital  investment demand held firm in the automobile and machine tool  industries. The cumulative effect of these factors was sales levels in  fiscal 2011 remaining in line with those in fiscal 2010.  Overseas, sales slipped 0.2%, to 147.7 billion, due to the impact  of the strong yen and other factors. Operations in Europe were  adversely affected by the strong yen and financial instability; however,  demand showed a gradual trend toward recovery, and accordingly  sales were relatively unchanged year on year. Sales levels were  maintained in China as well, where increased demand for automo- biles and consumer electronics as well as higher internal demand  for social infrastructure development compensated for the impacts  of the inventory adjustment trend that stemmed from monetary  tightening measures. In other areas of Asia, net sales proved solid  thanks to demand created by reconstruction efforts following the  floods in Thailand. In North America, sales of control equipment for  oil- and gas-related businesses rose considerably, resulting in  favorable overall sales figures. Due to the above, sales in fiscal 2011  were relatively unchanged from levels in fiscal 2010. Business Strategy and Outlook for Fiscal 2012 We will maintain our standing as the best partner for  manufacturers worldwide. In the IAB segment, in fiscal 2012 we are forecasting a year-on- year rise in net sales of 1.2%, to 274.0 billion, and a 5.0%  increase, to 35.0 billion, in operating income.  Conditions both in Japan and overseas are expected to make  a full-fledged recovery starting in the second half of fiscal 2012,  and consequently full-year net sales are anticipated to be in line  with fiscal 2011. While the strong yen and financial instability in  Europe will continue to represent uncertainty regarding the  future of the operating environment, we are forecasting higher  capital investment in the automobile and machine tool industries  in Japan, North America, and emerging countries, such as China.  The IAB segment aims to respond to the automation needs of  rapidly growing emerging countries as well as the increasingly  more sophisticated and complex needs of developed countries in  the area of controls and in the areas of safety, the environment,  and energy. To facilitate this endeavor, we are reinforcing sales  systems and fortifying global customer support systems. In addi- tion, we are bolstering our lineup of competitive products by  quickly introducing equipment that boasts industry-leading levels  of new ultra high-speed and high-precision products to beat out  the competitors in emerging markets, which are rapidly gaining  force. Through these efforts, we aim to further strengthen our  robust product lineup, which we believe to be No. 1 in the world.  Further, we are enhancing our lineup of products that assist  manufacturing sites, which use massive amounts of electricity,  in realizing energy savings. These products include our electricity  usage monitoring equipment and our equipment that measures  the humidity, pressure, and electricity flow levels of production  facilities.

EMC net sales were up 2.2% year on year, to 83.0 billion, and  operating income was down 39.2%, to 7.2 billion, in fiscal 2011.  Domestic sales edged up 1.3%, to 25.3 billion. Net sales  initially dropped as demand for automotive-use relays and  switches fell in the first quarter in conjunction with the reduced  production of automobiles following the Great East Japan  Earthquake. In July, recovery trends were evident in the automo- bile and amusement industries, and sales to consumer-related  industries, such as those related to consumer electronics, were  strong due to post-earthquake recovery demand. These factors  encouraged a recovery in second quarter results from the  declines experienced in the first quarter. A strong performance  continued for the remainder of the year, and as a result sales in  Japan were in line with fiscal 2010s level.  Overseas sales rose 2.6% year on year, to 57.7 billion, despite  the impacts of the strong yen, monetary tightening measures in  China, and financial instability in Europe. In China, the monetary  tightening measures implemented during the first half of the  year drove consumer-related industries, such as those related to  consumer electronics, into an inventory adjustment phase with  regard to certain products. However, the impacts of these trends  were outweighed by the benefits of customers working to  procure parts in advance due to concerns for possible supply  shortages after the earthquake. China and other emerging  countries were adversely affected by the global decline in  automobile production as well as the impact on Asian automotive  parts markets of the floods in Thailand that occurred during the  second half of the fiscal year. Nevertheless, sales of automotive  parts and mobile telephone components were strong throughout  fiscal 2011. As a consequence, overseas sales were up. Business Strategy and Outlook for Fiscal 2012 utilizing our monozukuri capabilities, we will focus  on the Greater China region, other parts of Asia, and  environmental fields. We plan to raise EMC net sales 7.2% year on year, to 89.0  billion, and operating income 10.5%, to 8.0 billion, in fiscal 2012.  The operating environment for electronic components is  expected to remain harsh overall due to the financial instability in  Europe, the deceleration of growth in the Greater China region,  and the persistence of the strong yen.  Conversely, in China and other parts of Asia, a geographic  segment that accounts for 65% of the worlds population,  markets are expanding rapidly, and we are steadily pushing  forward with initiatives to address this market growth. Our  sophisticated monozukuri capabilities, which enable us to  conduct production in an integrated manner spanning from  product design and material procurement to molding, parts  processing, and assembly, will play a key role in undertaking  these efforts. Utilizing these capabilities, we will improve the  quality, reduce the costs, and stabilize the supplies of relays,  switches, and connectors for industrial machinery, as these are  the characteristics our target industries seek out in products.  In addition, as markets related to the environmental and energy  fields are expanding, we will create components that contribute  to the advancement of environmental fields and target sales  growth for such components. Specifically, we have high  expectations for the future performance of smart meters, which  are electricity meters equipped with communications functions, in  markets in China and other parts of Asia. For this reason, we are  enhancing our power latching relay operations. Power latching  relays are used to control the flow of electricity into smart meters.  We are also taking steps to improve the competitiveness of our  DC power relays for use in electric and hybrid-electric vehicles  with the aim of advancing their use among automobile  manufacturers worldwide. Strengthening Smart Meter—Related  Power Latching Relay Operations Aiming to strengthen its relay operations, Omron acquired Shanghai Best  Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (BST), a manufacturer of power latching relays, which are used  in smart meters.   Smart meters are expected to become a mainstay device in smart grids, which are projected to  experience a rapid increase in demand as an interface for connecting power grids with commercial  buildings or individual homes. Demand is expected to be particularly strong in China and other parts of  Asia. Power latching relays are employed in the load switching units used for directly controlling the supply  of power to these smart meters.   BST commands the leading position in the Chinese market for power latching relays. The company has gained a competitive advantage  through its high-mix, low-volume production system and by enhancing productivity through the use of modular parts.   By incorporating BSTs strengths, Omron will further expand its power latching relay business. Remote Reset Rocker Switch: A8GS  The A8GS remote reset rocker switch is  among the smallest rocker switches in the  industry. This switch is primarily used as the  main power switch for office automation  (OA), audio video (AV), and other equipment.  Featuring a solenoid, this switch can be  operated manually and possesses a remote  reset function that allows the switch to be  turned off by outside signals. This function  reduces standby electricity consumption to  zero, thus contributing to energy savings. Dust-Proof ultra Subminiature Basic  Switch: D2FD Based on the design specifications of a  popular preceding model, D2FD switches  feature rubber sealing, which means they  can be used in dust-proof environments  (IEC IP6X). Equipped with this high-demand  feature, D2FD switches are the optimal  switches for use in the position sensors of  washing machine lids and refrigerator doors  as well as for use in industrial equipment,  office equipment, telecommunications  equipment, and other  equipment requiring  dust-proof switches. Hand Gesture Recognition  Technologies Hand gesture recognition technologies are  used to simultaneously identify the position,  contour, and movement of hands or fingers  from camera-recorded videos. These  technologies enable televisions to be  operated with hand signs, cameras to be  programmed to automatically take pictures  in response to the peace sign, and other  motion-based equipment control schemes  to be realized.

AEC net sales edged up 0.9% year on year, to 85.0 billion, and  operating income declined 35.3%, to 2.7 billion, in fiscal 2011.  Domestic sales were 28.9 billion, up 1.8%, from the previous year.  Automobile production by principal customers fell immediately  after the Great East Japan Earthquake, resulting in a sharp drop  in sales during the first quarter of the year. However, in conjunc- tion with the recovery of automobile and parts manufacturers,  automobile production gradually recovered starting in the latter  half of the first quarter. In addition, certain automobile manufac- turers accelerated production to return inventories of completed  vehicles to a certain level. In the second half of the fiscal year,  the recovered production among manufacturers led to a come- back in demand for the companys products. The severe flooding  in Thailand that occurred in October damaged our Thai manufac- turing base, and the issues with procuring electronic compo- nents after the floods adversely impacted sales in this segment  and in the automobile industry as a whole. Later in the year,  when parts supplies were able to be secured, production by  automobile manufacturers rallied once again. Thanks to the  above, sales were solid on a full-year basis.  Overseas sales rose 0.5%, to 56.1 billion, despite the impacts  of the strong yen, the monetary tightening measures in China,  and the financial instability in Europe. During the first half of the  fiscal year, sales to China and other emerging countries as well  as South Korea were strong. In North America, demand from  U.S. automobile manufacturers held firm, but reduced production  among Japanese automobile manufacturers resulted in signifi- cant declines in sales. The favorable sales trends in China, other  emerging countries, and South Korea continued into the second  half of the fiscal year, thus helping to offset the impacts of the  less-than-ideal exchange rates and the floods in Thailand. As a  result of these factors, overseas sales were overall relatively  unchanged from the previous fiscal year. Business Strategy and Outlook for Fiscal 2012 Automobile market growth is expected to center on  emerging countries. For AEC, we are forecasting a year-on-year increase of 11.7%, to  95.0 billion, in net sales, with an 85.8% jump in operating  income, to 5.0 billion, in fiscal 2012.   In Japan, strong sales are projected as a result of the demand  stimulated by government subsidies for the purchase of eco- friendly automobiles as well as favorable conditions in the market  for small vehicles. Strong sales are also projected overseas.  Factors expected to support sales growth include the recovering  North American market, expansion in the emerging markets of  China and Southeast Asia, the start of full-fledged production of  globally strategic vehicles by automotive manufacturers in  Thailand and other countries, and the start of production of  new-model vehicles that incorporate Omrons new products.  Further, the automobile market is expected to continue  growing centered on emerging countries. Against this backdrop,  competition between manufacturers is intensifying and the  globalization of production is accelerating. Aiming to respond to  such market changes, AEC will employ the One Global Team  management strategy, under which global expansion will be  pursued by leveraging the Group's accumulated technologies  and techniques and installing high-quality development,  production, sales, and services functions in each major region of  the world. The resulting system will be used to further advance  us in our quest to uncover the social needs inherent to each  different area and quickly and efficiently introduce products that  meet these needs. Automobile Parts Production in Mexico  In February 2012, a new AEC production base was established in  Guanajuato, Mexico. This base has begun the production of automotive electronic components.  As automobile manufacturers are progressively developing and expanding operations in Mexico  and as the production of completed automobiles in this country rises in the future, this new  production base will come to play a central role in developing our own operations thanks to its  convenient access to the automobile markets in the Americas and Europe. In addition, as this is  the Omron Groups first production base in Mexico, we will utilize it to facilitate social contribution  efforts in this country. Electric Power Steering Controllers AEC anticipates that a growing number of  automobile models will utilize its electric power  steering controllers, which enable smooth  steering wheel operation and save energy.  AECs long track record has made the business  a highly trusted supplier, and AEC began the  full-fledged mass production of controllers at its  plant in China last year. Transmitter Key and Engine  Start Systems AEC is carrying out the development and  production of various devices integrating its  abundant wireless, miniaturization, and  weight-reducing technologies. These  systems provide added convenience for  users and greater ease in locking and  unlocking doors and starting the engine. Components for Eco-Friendly Vehicles AEC conducts the mass production of cell  monitoring units, electricity leakage  sensors, and other devices for use in  electric vehicles (EVs). This segment will  continue to develop products that contribute  to higher levels of energy and fuel efficiency  while creating technologies and products for  EVs in the power management and power  conversion fields.

In fiscal 2011, SSB net sales were down 10.4% year on year, to  57.2 billion, and operating income was 0.1 billion, compared  with 1.7 billion in fiscal 2010.  In the railway infrastructure business, demand weakened  during the first half of the fiscal year as a result of the curtailing  of capital investment among railway companies that were  heavily impacted by the Great East Japan Earthquake. While  sales of safety and security solutions centered on remote  monitoring systems increased during the second half of the  fiscal year, capital investment demand from railway companies  failed to recover to pre-earthquake levels. As a result, full-year  sales dropped in this business significantly.  The traffic control and road control systems business benefited  from income from the deliveries and related installation of   products scheduled for the end of fiscal 2010 that were delayed  due to the Great East Japan Earthquake. However, the  stagnancy in the domestic economy led to sluggish sales overall.  The Environmental Solutions Business HQ marked the smooth  launches of energy-saving, creating, and storing businesses. In  the related maintenance business, strong sales continued, as  demand for solar power generation products increased and  related installation expanded substantially. Business Strategy and Outlook for Fiscal 2012 Profit structure reforms and accelerated growth in  business development will generate increases in sales  and income. In fiscal 2012, we are projecting a 4.9% year-on-year gain in SSB  net sales, to 60.0 billion, and a 0.9 billion rise in operating  income, to 1.0 billion. Existing businesses, such as those related  to stations, railways, traffic control, and road control, will face the  continued curtailment of capital investment. In this environment,  we will advance the profit structure reforms undertaken in fiscal  2011, striving to generate income to be reinvested in growth  areas. Going forward, we will further accelerate growth by  investing this income in environment-related businesses and  reinforcing our strong engineering capabilities as well as by  bolstering our lineup of unique solutions that meet market needs.  In developing environment-related businesses, we will focus on  the following three growth drivers. Working together with the  Environmental Solutions Business HQ, SSB will expand its  business operations in this area centered on engineering fields,  such as system design, installation, and maintenance. 1.  Energy creation: We will introduce remote monitoring services  for solar power generation systems that bundle design and  installation services together with maintenance and inspection  and establish a business model for providing one-stop service  for solar power solutions. 2.  Energy storage: Focused on electricity storage systems, we will  realize optimal energy systems that link energy creation with  energy saving to manage peak-hour energy usage and realize  other benefits. 3.  Energy saving: We will provide services related to the  construction, operation, and maintenance of systems that  monitor and automatically control electricity usage.

HCB net sales rose 3.0% year on year, to 62.4 billion, while  operating income decreased 28.4%, to 2.9 billion in fiscal 2011.  Domestic sales were up 1.3%, to 27.2 billion. The market for  home-use healthcare devices contracted notably during the first  half of the fiscal year as a result of the electricity-saving efforts  and the declines in consumer spending that were inspired by the  impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake, and consequently  sales were sluggish. In the second half of fiscal 2011, sales of  new home-use healthcare devices, such as thermometers, body  composition monitors, and activity monitors, proved to be  favorable and we were able to expand our market share. In  equipment for use in medical institutions, the worlds first  visceral fat monitor to employ Omrons dual impedance analysis  method posted sales growth. Conversely, capital investment  was limited in the hospital market due to the influences of the  earthquake, which resulted in weak sales of physiological  monitors, a core product. As a result of the above, overall sales  in Japan were relatively unchanged in fiscal 2011.   Overseas sales were up 4.4%, to 35.2 billion. Rising  healthcare awareness contributed to brisk demand for healthcare  devices, and performance in the first half of fiscal 2011 was  consequently strong. Sales were particularly impressive in China,  Central and South America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.  In the second half of the year, economic slowdown in China and  North America adversely affected sales, but full-year sales still  showed an increase. Business Strategy and Outlook for Fiscal 2012 Markets in emerging countries are expected to  continue expanding. For HCB, we forecast a gain of 8.1% year on year in net sales,  to 67.5 billion, accompanied by a 37.1% increase in operating  income, to 4.0 billion, in fiscal 2012.  Improved standards of living, the adoption of Western diets,  and other lifestyle changes in emerging countries, such as China  and India, as well as those in Central and South America, have  resulted in growing trends in lifestyle diseases. We anticipate  these trends will result in the continued expansion of healthcare  device markets in these countries. To capture this demand, we  are strengthening sales systems on a global basis and enhancing  our network of distributors, pharmacies, drugstores, and other  sales channels. Also, we will introduce into these emerging  countries new products that meet the individual needs of  specific countries. Through these efforts, we will work to  accelerate sales growth.  In developed countries, sluggish consumer spending and  limited capital investment among medical institutions is  forecasted. Regardless, we will work to develop new markets  in Japan. To this end, we will introduce sleep sensors and  WellnessLink-compatible products in the home-use healthcare  device market and launch the Medical LINK blood pressure  management service for the medical devices market. Start of Sleep Sensor Business  In April 2012, the HSL-001 sleep duration tracker, a device that helps users correct  their internal body rhythms, was released. This was subsequently followed by the May launch of the HSL-101  sleep sensor, which measures sleep conditions when placed bedside, marking the full-fledged start of our sleep  sensor business.   The HSL-001 sleep duration tracker determines when users drift into sleep and then records their sleep time.  By transferring the recorded data to a specialized sleep rhythm recording application for Android smartphones,  users can easily track data and confirm variances in their sleeping and waking times.   The HSL-101 sleep sensor can be used simply by placing it next to ones bed. The built-in radio wave sensor  tracks the users movements in bed, including that of their chest, and determines whether they are asleep or  awake. This is the first device in Japan to allow sleep conditions to be measured with zero contact and zero  restraint. Further, data can be transmitted to the WellnessLink health management service, which will display  sleep trends classified into three categories of sleep depth and provide reports analyzing sleep trends. In these  ways, this device helps improve sleep quality.   Together with exercise and diet, sleep is a factor that must be considered for  preventing and improving lifestyle diseases. By evolving our lineup of products and  services in this area, we will assist customers in improving sleep quality and comfort  into the future. Omrons Visceral Fat Monitor System:  HDS-2000 DuALSCAN HDS-2000 DUALSCAN is the worlds first  visceral fat monitor to employ Omrons  proprietary dual impedance analysis method.  This system enables medical institutions to  safely and easily measure visceral fat  volumes. As X-ray or CT scans used to be  necessary to measure visceral fat, this  monitor is a safer  option because it does  not involve exposure to  radiation. Also, it is  faster than  conventional methods. Omron Body Composition Monitor:  HBF-214 This glass body composition monitor  features a slim design with a width of only  28mm, indicating it can safely be stored  even in tight spaces. Equipped with such  basic features as body fat percentage and  visceral fat level measurements, this device  is optimal for household health  management. Omron Activity Monitor Calorie Scan:  HJA-311 The HJA-311 is more than just a pedometer; it  is an advanced activity monitor equipped with  communications functions that enable it to  measure the total amount of calories burned  throughout a day. When linked with a  specialized application, Yurupika Diet, for  Android smartphones, this device can provide  more comprehensive  support in achieving monthly  weight loss goals. Moreover,  the HJA-311 indicates to  users when they have  earned the right to reward  themselves with sweets or  some other diet deviation,  thus helping raise motivation.

In the Other segment, net sales increased 7.8% year on year,  to 53.5 billion, and operating loss improved, from 4.7 billion in  fiscal 2010, to 3.6 billion in fiscal 2011.  The Environmental Solutions Business HQ registered low sales  during the first half of the year due to the impact of component  procurement difficulties following the Great East Japan Earth- quake. In the second half of the year, the energy-saving compo- nents and services business grew thanks to a rise in sales of  systems for monitoring electricity usage in response to the  requests for electricity conservation posed by the government  and power companies in light of the impact of the earthquake.  Sales volumes of solar power conditioners (energy-creation  business) also expanded, as we actively introduced new prod- ucts in this line, a move taken in consideration of the growing  attention for solar power as an alternative power source. As a  result, full-year sales were strong.  In the Electronic Systems & Equipments Business HQ, sales of  industrial-use computers and contract manufacturing and the  development of electronic devices were weak, as customers  modified or scaled back investment plans due to the earthquake.  However, demand for uninterruptible power supply units to  manage power supply concerns continued to increase. As a  result, overall sales remained essentially unchanged from the  previous fiscal year.  The Micro Devices Business HQ experienced weak sales due  to a decline in demand for contract semiconductor manufactur- ing and custom integrated circuits for consumer products and  industrial use.  In the Backlight Business, we actively addressed demand in  the firmly established smartphone market, while automotive-use  LED backlights experienced stable demand. Accordingly, sales  were solid throughout the year. Business Strategy and Outlook for Fiscal 2012 The smartphone market will continue to expand and  conditions will be favorable for environment-related  businesses. In the Other segment, in fiscal 2012 we are forecasting a 10.2%  year-on-year rise in net sales, to 59.0 billion, and a decrease in  operating loss, from 3.6 billion, to 2.0 billion.  Conditions will be favorable for the Environmental Solutions  Business HQ in fiscal 2012 as a result of the July 2012 launch of a  government system under which all electricity generated using  renewable energy sources will be purchased and a related  subsidy system. Taking advantage of these conditions, we will  target higher domestic sales of solar power conditioners and a  larger share of this market. Also, we anticipate growth in the  energy-saving components and services business thanks to this  businesss ability to provide the type of electricity-saving solu- tions for which demand has been growing since 2011. In addition,  we will further expand the scale of operations by developing  comprehensive energy solutions businesses that combine  energy saving, creation, and storage to respond to demand for  business continuity plans and other social needs.  The Electronic Systems & Equipments Business HQ will work  to expand sales of industrial-use computers and contract manu- facturing and the development of electronic devices. At the  same time, with the aim of boosting sales, we will bolster our  lineup of uninterruptible power supply units, which are register- ing increases in demand due to concerns regarding electricity  shortages.   In the Micro Devices Business HQ, demand for custom  integrated circuits and other existing products will likely remain  at the same level as in fiscal 2011. However, we will target sales  expansion in the growing market for micro electrical mechanical  systems (MEMS) microphones and sensors.  In the Backlight Business, we will continue to focus develop- ment on making slimmer and brighter products for use in the  high-resolution liquid-crystal displays of smartphones and are  thus forecasting higher sales in this business. Moreover, we will  advance the automation and boost the productivity of production  lines for mass-produced products while simultaneously reducing  costs in the pursuit of improved profitability. Helping Solar Power Systems Stabilize Generation Volumes and Supporting Maintenance with  Monitoring Services Solar power continues to gain attention as a means of preventing global warming and as an alternative source of  electricity that can be used to combat electricity shortages, such as those that occurred in Japan during 2011. As such, the solar power market  is expanding with each coming year. Further market growth is anticipated following the July 2012 launch of a government system under which  all electricity generated using renewable energy sources will be purchased and the resulting rise in demand for methods of realizing local  production and consumption of electricity.   In July 2012, Omron launched a new service that supports this market by utilizing remote monitoring to provide an integrated system for  monitoring the operation of solar power systems and managing on-site maintenance. The remote  monitoring of solar power systems allows generation efficiency and malfunctions to be tracked in real  time; should a malfunction occur, the details of this disturbance can be quickly confirmed, thus enabling  the speedy procurement of necessary parts and facilitating timely repairs, replacement, and other  maintenance procedures. This consequently limits generation losses while helping solar power systems  operate stably for longer periods of time. Backlights Business Four-Inch Backlight for High-End  Smartphones Our four-inch backlights realize higher levels  of brightness and efficiency while providing  more uniform lighting and enabling slimmer  bodies of smartphones and narrower frames. Electronic Systems and Equipment Business uninterruptible Power Supply units:  BY-S Series The BY-S Series of sine wave output  uninterruptible power supply units features  units that are both compact and affordable  and can be used safely with PCs and  servers. By introducing a lineup of products  with maximum capacities ranging from 350VA  to 1200VA,  we will further  invigorate the  uninterruptible  power supply  unit market. Micro Devices Business MEMS Absolute Pressure Sensor Omron has developed an absolute pressure  sensor capable of accurately detecting 50cm  altitudinal variations through highly precise  sensing of air pressure fluctuations. The  Company will promote the usage of this  sensor, which is among the worlds most  accurate and power  efficient, in  smartphones and  activity monitors. Other Businesses Several other business incubation operations under the direct control of the  Company president The main objective of operations in the Other segment is to undertake incubation activities for future  business expansion.

We have translated these two guidelines into 25 languages so  that they can be put into practice on a global basis.   Activities to Instill the Corporate Philosophy Omron conducts activities to instill its corporate philosophy in  Japan and overseas.  Between 2011 and 2012, Omrons chairman and vice chairman  are visiting the sites of each of the Companys global operations,  in turn, spending more than three hours at each location explain- ing to local executives the concepts behind the Omron Principles  and their implementation. These meetings, which include involved  discussions on the content of the Omron Principles, assist in con- firming mutual understanding. The meetings are being held at 30  overseas and three domestic locations and involve approximately  300 participants. The managers who attend these meetings  subsequently discuss this content with their subordinates to  instill the Omron Principles throughout the Group.   To deepen employees understanding of the Omron Principles  that have carried on for half a century, we have created a comic  book, the Kazuma Tateishi Story, introducing our founders  personal background and his struggles to create new business- es. We distribute the book to employees at overseas locations.  The story has already been  translated into English, Malay, Thai,  Vietnamese, Indonesian, Hindi,  and Chinese. We added Korean to  this list in 2011. The comic book  has proved to be an effective tool  for helping overseas employees  understand the Omron spirit.  Integrating CSR Promotion under Our Management Strategy In fiscal 2011, Omron formulated a new long-term strategy, VG2020, centered on a CSR perspective, thereby integrating CSR and over- all strategies. At this time, we transferred the main functions of the Group CSR Committee to the Executive Council, integrating them  with the councils other responsibilities. The committee was subsequently dissolved on March 29, 2012. Supervisory departments and  the CSR-related committees that formerly operated under the Group CSR Committee will continue to take primary charge of individual  CSR issues, which we will work to resolve on a Groupwide basis. Basic CSR Policy While remaining true to the basic spirit of our corporate motto and corporate  core value, as expressed in our Management Commitments we manage our  business in a way that emphasizes the importance of honest dialogue with  shareholders to forge relationships of trust.

The  new principles were established to respond to  the change in values society requires from  companies as well as Omrons drive to promote  business globally. According to the Omron  Principles, working for the benefit of society  is positioned as the corporate core value that  describes the true purpose of the Omron Groups  existence.    The underlying philosophy of these principles is  that a companys reason for existence is to serve  society, and only companies that add value and  meet social needs can earn trust and confidence  from society as good corporate citizens and thus  successfully continue to survive as businesses.  The core value reemphasizes the Companys  commitment to offering benefits for society while  also clearly stating Omrons determination to  promote business management that emphasizes  value for stakeholders that comprise society.

In 2008,  Omron declared its support for the 10 Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), which  are universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor standards, the environment, and  anti-corruption. Accordingly, Omron joined the Global Compact Japan Network (GC-JN), a local Global  Compact network. In 2011, Omron dispatched its representative to GC-JN to serve as the chief secre- tariat and support the networks administration. Omron will continue to uphold the UNGCs 10 principles  and sincerely implement them to meet the expectations of stakeholders.

Sakuta: Why did you decide to establish IntegreX Inc.? Akiyama: I had previously worked at a securities com- pany. It was then that I first encountered the concept of  socially responsible investment (SRI), which entails  investing in companies that practice socially responsible  management. I was deeply inspired by this concept,  even to the point of holding in-house workshops. How- ever, I realized that developing SRI fund products would  require a more unbiased standpoint from which to evaluate  companies. Therefore, I decided to establish a company  that investigates and evaluates companies based on  corporate social responsibility (CSR). This was the birth  of IntegreX.  Conducting SRI means investing in companies from a  long-term perspective. Economic factors are naturally of  importance, but SRI requires more emphasis on social  factors, such as whether or not the company displays  integrity to its stakeholders and fulfills its responsibilities  to society. SRI is centered on the belief that if companies  do not properly address such social concerns, they will  not be able to grow and develop in a sustainable manner. Sakuta: I believe corporate value comprises two ele- ments: economic factors, such as sales and income, and  social factors, including ethics, morals, and just actions. It  is easy to become overly focused on the economic  factors, which can be dangerous. No matter how high the  economic value of a company may be, if it takes actions  that damage its social value, the overall corporate value  of that company will deteriorate, and it will eventually go  out of business. Akiyama: Earning the trust of stakeholders is vitally  important for companies. When I first started this busi- ness, I pondered considerably on the subject of a com- panys responsibility to society. Through this process, I  came to realize the importance of having a corporate  philosophy. Omron has defined its corporate philosophy  as Working for the benefit of society. I understand that  you, Chairman Sakuta, have traveled to Omron Group  sites around the world to spread awareness regarding this  philosophy. These efforts were highly evaluated and  Omron was awarded the 2012 Integrity Award Grand  Prize from Japans Integrity Award Council. A balance between binding and propelling  forces is critical to global expansion. Sakuta: We were honored to receive this award. At  Omron, we view making the corporate philosophy known  throughout the organization as one of the most important  duties of management. Our corporate philosophy is  based on the Omron Principles, which were revised in  2006. At the time, the task of communicating these new  principles was delegated among the Companys execu- tives, and we held meetings at sites both inside and  outside of Japan. These efforts have been ongoing, and  since 2011, Vice Chairman Tateishi and I have held nearly  40 discussions to facilitate the understanding and imple- mentation of the principles in Greater China, Southeast  Asia, North America, Europe, and Japan. We talk face to  face with site managers for more than three hours. The  Omron Principles represent our shared values and consti- tute the binding force of the Company. As we continue to  grow on a global scale, balancing this binding force with  a propelling force will become increasingly important.  Currently, one-half of the Omron Groups total net sales  derive from overseas, and two-thirds of its employees  are at overseas sites. Looking ahead, our new long-term  vision, Value Generation 2020 (VG2020), calls on us to  pursue growth through further globalization. In this  pursuit, we have to promote diversity across country and  regional borders as well as across religious and ethnic  boundaries. However, if we are not careful in developing  this diversity, we run the risk of losing the sense of unity  within the Company. Thats what the Omron principles  are for: serving as a minimal but strong force that keeps  us together.  I keep reminding managers of the importance of  bringing out their subordinates creativity in making sure  that Omron can continue to be a collection of freethink- ing and free-acting individuals that exercise creativity by  sharing a set of values. A corporate philosophy should be a   platform rather than a set of rules. Akiyama: It is of the utmost importance for a company  to practice its corporate philosophy through its business  activities and reaffirm the value of its existence. For this  reason, the corporate philosophy must be understood by  and shared among employees, and the philosophy must  resonate with employees. When employees feel the  corporate philosophy resonates with them, they are able  to understand the meaning of their work and take pride  in it. Sakuta: In discussions with managers, we start with  how they see Omrons corporate core value of Working  for the benefit of society and how they are exercising  this philosophy in their daily work. Using our strengths in  sensing and control technology, we aim to provide solu- tions to social issues relating to safety and security, the  environment, and health by realizing the best matching  of machines to people. We see this as Omrons respon- sibility to society and our way of Working for the benefit  of society.  Of course, there are differences between how such  concepts are viewed by each individual employee and  how they are viewed by the Company. Therefore, it is  best if we perceive the values promoted by Omron as a  broad platform rather than as specific rules. If we are  able to make our own values resonate with the platform  created through the philosophy of Working for the benefit  of society, then we can become happy. There may be  some people who do not entirely agree with Omrons  values. It is important to try to understand what other  people are thinking. Akiyama: Employees feel great joy in their work when  the Company shares the same goals as them. Also, a  corporate philosophy cannot serve its true purpose if it is  Hisao Sakuta Chairman of the Board of  Directors Omron Corporation One Akiyama President IntegreX Inc. 2012 Integrity Award 3 Special Feature  Dialogue: The Importance of having a Corporate Philosophy Earning Stakeholder Trust by Exercising  the Omron Principles CONTENTS To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information The Omron Principles and CSR Management Special Feature 3: Dialogue: The Importance of having a Corporate Philosophy Special Feature 5: Resolving Environmental Issues Special Feature 6: Resolving Health Issues Creating Value for Employees Creating Value for Customers WEB  Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information Corporate Governance, Internal Control, Compliance, and Risk Management Directors, Corporate Auditors, and Executive Officers Special Feature 4: Corporate Governance Creating Value for Shareholders and Investors Creating Value for Local Communities Omron: Advancing Sensing and Control Technology  58 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 59 not put into practice. Rather, the true value of a corporate  philosophy comes into effect when employees begin  considering how the philosophy relates to their own work.  I am very impressed with the fact that Omron actively  practices its corporate philosophy. Borrowings should be returned with interest. Sakuta: Once or twice a month, I visit overseas sites to  talk with site managers. I truly enjoy these face-to-face  interactions with employees and find them to be very  informative.  It could be said that all the resources needed to operate  a business are borrowed from society. For this reason, at  Omron, our basic belief is that the Company belongs to  society. The employees, capital, and social infrastructure  used in our business are all borrowed from society, thus our  responsibility is to return these borrowings with interest.  For example, our semiconductor plant in Yasu City,  Shiga Prefecture, uses a substantial amount of ground- water. We employ refined water processing techniques  to return this water cleaner than what we borrowed.  Another example of these efforts can be found at a site  in China located in an area with a relatively high rate of  employee turnover. The manager of this site told me that  even if they knew an employee was going to quit the  following day, they would still give the employee the  training he or she needed for that day. This manager  believed that as a manager of a local subsidiary of   Omron, which places an emphasis on Working for the  benefit of society, it was their responsibility to make  sure that everyone who entered the Group left it as a  stronger individual. I was very proud to hear this. Akiyama: It is imperative for companies to fulfill their  responsibility to todays society, but they must also work  for the society of the future. The future health of a society  requires the contributions of the companies that help  make up that society. Therefore, the sustainability of  society is a key issue. In a similar manner, when cultivating  human resources, companies need to take a long-term  perspective and work to nurture these individuals in a way  that will enable them to benefit the society of the future.  Therefore, the sustainability of society is a key issue. In a  similar manner, when cultivating human resources, com- panies need to take a long-term perspective and work to  nurture these individuals in a way that will enable them to  benefit the society of the future. For a company to be respected by society,  a company must respect society. Akiyama: As you know, the R in CSR stands for  responsibility. However, responsibility can sound like  something that is forced upon a company or that it is  made to do. I feel it would be better to look at R as  standing for respect. A company must pay attention to  the various needs and trends in society, respect them,  and act accordingly. Respecting society in this manner  will ultimately lead to society respecting the company.   I believe building this type of relationship is the true goal  of CSR. Sakuta: At a European subsidiary, I had a discussion with  managers about the type of company they envisioned for  Omron. After extensive discussion, they concluded that  they wanted Omron to be a trustworthy company. How- ever, there are cases in which we are unable to come  through on our promises to customers due to quality  defects or other issues. In these cases, it is important we  do not simply let the agreements end in broken promises  but rather work diligently as a team to make things right.  Even in our daily interactions, our response in such situa- tions can have a significant impact on how we are thought  of thereafter, which may be the line between being  judged as unreliable or proving our reliability. I feel the  discussion of such issues by Company representatives at  the general manager level in this manner will facilitate  Omrons growth into an even more sound company. Akiyama: Whether in Japan or overseas, there must be  consistency between what a company says and what it  does. Based on what I have heard so far, it is clear that  managers are constantly pondering the proper course for  the Company to take and that this process is forming the  core of Omrons strength. Company employees need excitement  and anticipation. Sakuta: People have a tendency to turn their attention to  things that can be seen. However, there are some,  people such as musicians and poets, who try to convey  messages to the world by expressing their thoughts  through intangible mediums. In a company, how we work  can greatly influence output. In other words, output is  determined by whether or not a companys employees  enjoy their working environment. Akiyama:  I call such types of enjoyment excitement  and anticipation. I also feel it is crucial for companies to  exercise the three Is: Integrity, Innovation, and Ichien- yugo (or, circle of interdependence). Ichien-yugo is a  term coined by Japanese philosopher Sontoku Ninomiya  and refers to the belief that everything in the world is  interdependent, as if contained within a circle. In this  way, two things that appear to be in opposition may  actually be supporting each other. There are some prob- lems that can only be resolved by combining the unique  strengths of employees and companies or of companies  and society. While Sontoku is often thought to be a  person that spent his life toiling down a scholarly path, it  seems that he actually placed great importance on  enjoyment. Likewise, if ones work lacks excitement  and anticipation, innovation will not arise and the indi- vidual will not grow. Sakuta: I agree. In fact, Omron used excitement and  anticipation for its long-term visions in the 1990s. We  are therefore well aware of the importance of excitement  and anticipation. You also mentioned innovation, which  has a special meaning for us as well. Omron founder  Kazuma Tateishis favorite words were innovation and  creativity. We at Omron will strive to continue being a  company at which all employees can fully exercise their  creativity and feel excitement and anticipation. 03 Dialogue: The Importance of having a Corporate Philosophy Discussion in Chicago, the United States At Omron, we believe  the Company  belongs to society.

In line with this basic policy, Omron has adopted an executive  officer system and clearly separates management oversight and  business execution. Under an internal company system, Omron  is realizing faster decision making and efficient business opera- tions by delegating substantial authority to the president of each  internal company. Moreover, autonomous individual business  units that can specialize in creating value for customers take the  initiative in conducting business. At the same time, through  commitment-based management, we clarify roles and responsi- bilities and practice corporate value management based on  shareholder value. Management and Oversight Frameworks Omron is a Company with Board of Corporate Auditors.  The  corporate governance regime has a supervisory and observational  function pertaining to the actions of the Board of Directors and also  involves auditing carried out by the Board of Corporate Auditors.  Omron has set the number of members of its Board of Directors at  seven to encourage efficient and meaningful discussion. The only  members of the Board of Directors who are also involved in  business execution activities are the president and CEO as well as  the representative director and executive vice president. Furthermore,  the business operation monitoring function of the Board of Directors  has been strengthened.  To increase objectivity in management, the positions of chair- man and president and CEO are separated. At the same time,  every effort is made to bolster management oversight functions.  The chairman of the Board of Directors monitors business execu- tion activities as a representative of the Companys stakeholders.  Chaired by outside directors, Omron has established the Person- nel Advisory Committee, the President & CEO Selection Advisory  Committee, the Compensation Advisory Committee, and the  Corporate Governance Committee. In this manner, the Company  is working to increase the transparency and objectivity of man- agements decision-making process.   By incorporating the best aspects of the Companies with Com- mittees system, we have created a type of hybrid corporate gover- nance regime that we feel is the most appropriate for the Company. Auditing Functions The Board of Corporate Auditors, composed of four corporate  auditors, audits governance practices and monitors the everyday  management activities of the Board of Directors and other  management staff as well as the nature and operational condi- tions of the corporate governance regime. The Global Internal  Auditing Headquarters, which reports directly to the president  and CEO, periodically conducts internal audits of accounting,  administration, business risks, and compliance in each headquar- ters division and in each business company as part of its internal  auditing function. Moreover, the Internal Auditing HQ offers  specific advice for improving business functions. Appointment of Outside Executives To allow the Board of Directors to monitor business execution as  a representative of the Companys stakeholders, two of the  seven directors are outside directors and two of the four corpo- rate auditors are outside corporate auditors.  Emphasizing the independence of outside executives, Omron  has formulated its own original Outside Executive Eligibility  Criteria in addition to the requirements under Japans Corporate  Law. Outside executives are selected using these eligibility  criteria as our standard. In specific terms to be considered for  the position of outside executive, candidates themselves and  the companies or organizations they belong to must comply  with the seven items that serve as Omrons selection criteria.  Among these seven items, candidates must not have assumed  the role of representative or employee of an independent auditor  for the Omron Group for five years prior to being nominated and  cannot be a major Omron Group shareholder (holding shares  that provide 10% or more of total voting rights) or a director,  auditor, executive officer, or employee of any legal entity that the  Omron Group is a major shareholder of; or a director, auditor,  executive officer, or employee of any principal partner or supplier  of the Omron Group.  The Corporate Governance Committee takes steps to confirm  the aforementioned Outside Executive Eligibility Criteria do not  pose any problem with respect to determination criteria con- cerning independence formulated by the appropriate securities  exchange. After obtaining a resolution of the Board of Directors,  notifications are submitted with the appropriate securities  exchange for all outside executives as independent officers. Director and Corporate Auditor Remuneration To increase objectivity and transparency, the Compensation  Advisory Committee, chaired by an outside director, is consulted  on the compensation of directors. This committee discusses the  compensation of each individual and makes recommendations.  After receiving these recommendations, the amount of compen- sation for each director is determined by a resolution of the  Board of Directors, and the amount of compensation for each  corporate auditor is determined by discussions among the  corporate auditors (resolution of the Board of Corporate Audi- tors). These amounts are within the scope of the aggregate  compensation amounts for all directors and all corporate audi- tors, as each has been set by a resolution of the General Meet- ing of Shareholders. Board of Directors (BOD) The BOD oversees business activities  and decides important business matters  such as management objectives and  strategies. Board of Corporate Auditors This board oversees the corporate  governance system and its implementa- tion and audits the day-to-day  operations of directors and other  executives. Personnel Advisory Committee This committee, chaired by an outside  director, sets election standards for  directors and executive officers, selects  candidates, and evaluates current  executives.  CEO Selection Advisory Committee This committee, chaired by an external  director, is dedicated to the nomination  of presidents and deliberates on the  selection of the new president for the  upcoming term and on preparing contin- gency succession plans.

To firmly establish a high standard of corporate ethics, we will continue to enhance our compliance system   and strengthen the risk management framework that supports ongoing improvement in corporate value. 1999 2003 2011 1987–    President Yoshio Tateishi  1996– Management Personnel    Advisory Committee Omron Principles  formulated in 1990 Revised in 1998 Revised in 2006 2000– Personnel Advisory Committee 2003–  Compensation Advisory Committee 2006–  President & CEO Selection Advisory Committee 2008–  Corporate Governance Committee 2003– President Hisao Sakuta  2003– Two members (seven directors) 2011– President Yoshihito Yamada  Chairman of the Board  of Directors/CEO President serves as Board of Directors  Chairman and CEO Chairman serves as Board of Directors Chairman/President  serves as CEO Separation of  management oversight  and business execution 30 directors 1999~ Number of directors reduced to seven 1999~ Introduction of executive officer system 1999~  Two members 1999 1998 2001 Advisory board Advisory Board One member 2003– Three members (four auditors) 2011–  Two members (four auditors) Outside directors Outside corporate auditors Advisory committees Corporate philosophy Corporate motto formulated in 1959 President One member Chairman: Chairman of the BOD Executive Organization Shareholders Meeting CSR-Related Committees*  Internal Auditing HQ CEO Selection Advisory Committee Compensation Advisory Committee Corporate Governance Committee Personnel Advisory Committee Board of Corporate Auditors Board of Directors Board of Directors Office Corporate Auditors Office Accounting Auditor President & CEO Executive Council Head office divisions Business companies (Internal companies) Corporate Governance Initiatives Corporate Governance Structure CONTENTS To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information The Omron Principles and CSR Management Special Feature 3: Dialogue: The Importance of having a Corporate Philosophy Special Feature 5: Resolving Environmental Issues Special Feature 6: Resolving Health Issues Creating Value for Employees Creating Value for Customers WEB  WEB  Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information Corporate Governance, Internal Control, Compliance, and Risk Management Directors, Corporate Auditors, and Executive Officers Special Feature 4: Corporate Governance Creating Value for Shareholders and Investors Creating Value for Local Communities Omron: Advancing Sensing and Control Technology WEB   62 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 63 Position Name Board of Directors Personnel Advisory  Committee President & CEO  Selection Advisory  Committee Compensation   Advisory   Committee Corporate   Governance  Committee Internal  Directors and  Auditors Outside  Directors and  Auditors Chairman of the BOD Hisao Sakuta Director and Executive  Vice Chairman Fumio Tateishi Representative Director  and President and CEO Yoshihito Yamada Representative Director  and Executive Vice  President Yoshinobu Morishita Senior Managing  Director Akio Sakumiya Director Kazuhiko Toyama Director Masamitsu Sakurai Full-time Corporate  Auditor Soichi Yukawa Full-time Corporate  Auditor Tokio Kawashima Corporate Auditor Hidero Chimori Corporate Auditor Eisuke Nagatomo Note:  is the chairman Maintaining and operating an internal control system to  ensure healthy and effective organizational operations Omron has established the Basic Policy on the Maintenance of an  Internal Control System to ensure the healthy and effective opera- tion of its organization. This policy provides the basis for the mainte- nance and operation of an internal control system throughout the  Omron Group to ensure the controls are functioning effectively in  each of the four objective areas of financial report accuracy, legal  compliance, operating efficiency, and asset safeguarding.  Omron maintains a monitoring system undertaken by the  internal audit department after each division and affiliated  company conducts its own review of the maintenance and  operation of business processes in accordance with the Internal  Control Reporting System (J-SOX) requirements of Japans  Financial Instruments and Exchange Act promulgated in June  2006. The reviews enable each division and affiliated company to  deepen their understanding of the internal controls associated  with financial reporting and thereby serve as a system for  promoting self-governing controls. Two types of internal audits to ensure healthy and  effective organizational operations Omron conducts two types of internal audits to ensure the  healthy and effective operation of its organization.  The Internal Control Audit is conducted to ensure the internal  controls are functioning effectively in each of the four objective  areas of financial report accuracy, legal compliance, operating  efficiency, and asset safeguarding. The Management Audit  examines the solutions and improvement measures implement- ed for specific management issues. In the event the result of  these audits includes items recommended for improvement, the  Company supports measures to carry out the improvements.  In addition, the Omron Group has established a Corporate  Auditor Office and placed full-time auditors in each of its four  regions of global business (the Americas, Europe, Greater China,*  and Asia Pacific) to implement internal audits based on local  practices and legal systems at its business sites worldwide. * Greater China includes China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Strengthening global risk management systems Aiming to promote legal and regulatory compliance across the  Group, Omron set up a Group Corporate Ethical Conduct Promo- tion Committee. In recent years, the committee has expanded  its activities from the promotion of compliance to quick detec- tion and sharing of risks associated with changes in laws and  regulations and other external environment factors as well as  such changing internal conditions as the launching of new  businesses and entering emerging markets. The committee  members consist of corporate ethics officers from each busi- ness company and corporate headquarters division in charge of  human resources, general administration, and legal affairs.  In fiscal 2011, the Company formulated the Global Crisis Man- agement Rules, which cover a wide range of areas, including  reporting channels and response systems in the event of a crisis in  Japan and overseas. At the same time, Omron conducted risk  analysis at several overseas affiliated companies. Moreover,  compliance monitoring activities were undertaken in the person- nel, labor, and other priority risk fields.  Affiliated companies in Japan appointed corporate ethics  promotion officers in charge of offering compliance education  selected from among manager- and higher-ranking employees.  A corporate ethics promotion officer meeting is held once a year  with these members participating to exchange information  regarding the implementation of a plan-do-check-act (PDCA)  cycle in accordance with an action plan as well as hosting  compliance training.  In fiscal 2012, Omron will put in place a business continuity  plan (BCP) based on deliberation details undertaken by the  Group Corporate Ethical Conduct Promotion Committee in fiscal  2011. At the same time, the Company will strengthen risk man- agement activities focusing mainly on compliance with global  statutory and regulatory requirements. Establishing operational regulations with clearly  stated provisions for the protection of whistle-blowers In Japan and North America, a whistle-blower hotline is in place  inside and outside of the Company for Omron Group executives,  full-time employees, and temporary staff as well as their families.  The Legal Affairs Department staff handle hotline information  within the Company, while an external attorney office serves to  accept information. In fiscal 2008, it became possible to contact  the hotline or seek advice through the electronic bulletin board  on the Companys intranet in Japan in addition to conventional  telephone and e-mail access.  In fiscal 2011, a total of 15 hotline contacts were made in  Japan and two in North America.  In operating the whistle-blower hotline, responses are based  on the Groups CSR Guidelines. These guidelines clearly state  strict maintenance of security and the protection of whistle- blowers from any detrimental treatment. Moreover, Omron  informs employees of the availability of the hotline through  corporate ethics cards, through the intranet, and during new  employee training. Ongoing case studies are used to help  further the skills of advisors. Omron will continue making the  hotline available and improving its response to whistle-blowing. Promoting continuous improvement of management  on the back of a PDCA cycle Omrons policy in enhancing information security is to fulfill its  responsibilities to stakeholders by appropriately managing  confidential information supplied from business associates as  well as personal information and its own corporate information  to protect from leakage.  Within the Company, an Information Security Management  Committee was set up as a Groupwide promotional organization  after formulating new management rules that reflect basic  policy. In this regard, Omron is implementing an integrated  management system covering both confidential information and  personal information. As a specific activity, and under the promo- tion system led by the committee, Omron has conducted  employee education and monitoring to check the status of  management at each worksite. Other activities included the  implementation of measures based on risk analysis for the  leakage of important information and surveys to determine the  information security management status of subcontractors on a  regular basis. Through these activities, the improvement of  information security is sought based on the implementation  of a Groupwide PDCA cycle.  Each year, management rules are reviewed and revised to  reflect changes in the external environment and incorporate  findings from worksite monitoring. In fiscal 2011, a new rule was  added regarding the use of smartphones and related devices.  Overseas, a set of common global rules for information  security has been established, with each Group company  establishing its own regulations based on the common global  rules. Furthermore, information security education is offered at  each affiliated company on a successive basis with steps taken  to confirm the status of management implementation.  Going forward, Omron will continually upgrade and maintain  information security management throughout the world.

These rules cover a wide range of areas while also  outlining basic policies, reporting procedures, and the establish- ment of an Emergency Response Headquarters.  Based on the Global Crisis Management Rules, the Company  established Disaster Contingency Planning Rules (established in  1999 and revised in 2011) as well as the Product Quality Risk  Management Rules (established in 2012). In addition to  implement ing response procedures by each type of crisis, Omron  is pursuing the compilation of a disaster response manual.  Omron is striving to instill a greater awareness and understand- ing of the details of these rules among employees by organizing  simulation drills to assist employees in preparing for possible  crises. Moreover, the Company provides training sessions for  emergency risk communications. The Omron Group initial  emergency response manual was prepared by referring to  countermeasures taken in past cases and applying knowledge  gained through drills. This manual serves as an important  reference for the Emergency Response Headquarters in the  event of a crisis. Business Continuity Plan (BCP) A series of events, including the Great East Japan Earthquake on  March 11, 2011, as well as the flooding in Thailand in October  2011, reinforced the importance of business continuity amid a  crisis to management.  Currently, Omron is conducting Groupwide efforts to review  its BCP, focusing particularly on prioritizing such critical functions  and areas as the head office, headquarters, IT, production, and  supply chain management (SCM).

When considering why I was selected as an outside  director by the Company, I naturally assume that it is  because of my common skill set and experience within  the manufacturing industry. On second thought, how- ever, Omron is essentially a component and materials  manufacturer, while as Chairman of Ricoh Co., Ltd., I  oversee the assembly of finished products. Recognizing  that manufacturing comes in many shapes and forms, my  role then is to provide input from a different perspective  within the broad manufacturing domain. Coming from a  company that took the path toward globalization a little  earlier than Omrons initial foray, I expect the Company  will be looking to draw on my experience and knowledge  in this area.  Against the backdrop of a harsh operating environment,  Ricoh has continued to generate steady increases in  revenues and earnings. In hindsight, however, this  growth has occurred without implementing the neces- sary fundamentals and foundation. Drawing on past  experience, therefore, I see my role as an outside direc- tor to provide advice that may benefit the Company and  prevent it from taking the wrong path. In another area,   I recognize the importance of Omrons Personnel Advi- sory Committee in selecting candidates for the positions  of director, corporate auditor, and executive officer. I am  impressed by the Companys President & CEO Selection  Advisory Committee, an unprecedented initiative, and  Omrons steps to establish a fair and impartial personnel  selection system. Coming from outside the Company,  however, I see my role as contributing to the overall  design of Omrons systems and determining the types of  mechanisms and processes that best fit the Company. —— In recent years, we have witnessed a suc- cession of incidents within the corporate sector,  most notably misconduct by senior executives.  As an outside director, how are you involved in  the Companys system of director checks and  balances and supervision? With each incidence of misconduct, I have felt that the  point of initial focus has generally been misdirected.  Before questioning whether the external governance is or  is not effective, emphasis should be placed on the inter- nal governance. In instances where in-house personnel  have a firm grasp on financial and other pertinent infor- mation, abnormal situations are readily uncovered at an  early stage. The importance then is on establishing an  environment in which any incidence of concern can be  openly and freely brought to light. Quite frankly, the need  to call on external resources because internal personnel  do not want to be whistle-blowers is absurd. In this  regard, the attitude and behavior of the president is of  paramount importance. When senior executives act in a  fair and honest manner, employees will follow suit and  behave accordingly. The role of an outside director is  therefore to provide input into governance mechanisms,  including a companys checks and balances as well as  supervisory systems from a separate perspective. This is  the principle to which I strive to adhere. —— What do you believe are Omrons strengths? There are several. I believe the most impressive strength  has been the Companys genuine and earnest efforts to  establish a robust foundation. I am constantly impressed  that whenever an officer provides an explanation of a  particular project or undertaking, it is always based on a  detailed understanding of where the particular business  structure fits within the Companys overall profit struc- ture. Everyone within the Company maintains a com- monly shared image of the degree to which a particular  area requires adjustment, be it costs, fixed, or variable  expenses. This naturally dovetails into a feature of particu- lar strength, namely the speed with which decisions are  made. Another attribute that defines Omron as a com- pany is its focus on teamwork. Such sports as soccer and  rugby are based a predetermined set of rules. Omron is  guided by a discipline that places the utmost emphasis  on the Companys profit structure. This rallying catch- phrase and commonly held philosophy is truly amazing. —— What are your thoughts on the Omron  Groups corporate culture? In a word, I would say that earnest best describes  Omrons corporate culture. More than just a mere super- ficial pursuit of the truth, the Company takes steps to  ascertain the roots of a particular matter and fully under- stand its structure.  This stance is also a distinguishing feature of the  manufacturing sector. Using the Board of Directors as an  example, Omron maintains an open environment that is  conducive to the lively exchange of opinions between  directors and executive departments. This positive trait  that extends throughout the entire Company, coupled  with genuine and flexible efforts to lend a keen ear to the  views of outside directors, are the sources of Omrons  highly effective corporate governance. —— What do you feel is required for Omron to  enhance its corporate value? Omron is currently stepping up its activities in such  promising fields as environmental solutions and health- care. Recognizing the critical need to secure innovative  technologies if the Company is to nurture these activities  as its next core businesses, I believe it is vital for Omron  to not only form alliances but also enter into M&As with  a strong and unwavering resolve.  Looking ahead, it is imperative that the Company intro- duce innovations that change the way people behave. To  this end, Omron must accurately picture customers  future lifestyles and become a company that is capable of  delivering added value that exceeds market expectations.  Of equal importance, and in combining its expertise  across a variety of fields with wide-ranging technologies,  the Company must broaden its horizons beyond the  engineering perspective and incorporate within its ranks  personnel from a diversity of areas. Only in this manner  can the Company hope to come up with the fresh and  innovative ideas necessary to achieve the aforementioned  goal. It is up to Omrons president to make the bold  decisions to introduce those human resources and acquire  those companies that can trigger change in areas that are  considered of significant value. I would therefore encour- age Mr. Yamada, Omrons president, to take increasingly  audacious strides going forward. Exemplified by its unique CEO Selection Advisory Committee, Omrons  robust systems of checks and balances as well as supervision are enhancing  the Companys corporate value. 4 Special Feature  Corporate Governance  Interview with Masamitsu Sakurai, Outside Director Working to Enhance   Omrons Corporate Value Masamitsu Sakurai joined Ricoh Co., Ltd., in 1966. Following successive  appointments as president of Ricoh UK Products Ltd. in 1984, director of Ricoh  Co., Ltd., in 1992, representative director and president in 1996, representative  director and chairman in 2007, and chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), Mr. Sakurai assumed the position of  director and chairman of Ricoh Co., Ltd., in 2011. As the first person with a  technical background to take the helm of Ricoh Co., Ltd., Mr. Sakurai led the  charge toward digital networking, helping the company to develop into a leading  IT entity. In addition to promoting environmental management that balances both  corporate management and environmental concerns, Mr. Sakurai adopted an  aggressive approach toward overseas M&A and was instrumental in the  companys global growth. Drawing on this proven track record, and after  assuming the position of Keizai Doyukai chairman, Mr. Sakurai put forward  numerous telling recommendations in the fields of both politics and industry.  Appointed an Omron outside director in 2008, Mr. Sakurai has received many  honors, including Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in  2003, Lordre national de la lgion dhonneur (National Order of the Legion of  Honour) from the French Republic in 2006, and the Deming Prize in fiscal 2011.

When conducted in good faith, both the Company with  Committees system, commonly adopted throughout  Europe and the United States, and Japans unique Com- pany with Board of Corporate Auditors system are more  than adequate in addressing the needs of all stakehold- ers. As someone who was appointed as an outside  corporate auditor at the Companys Shareholders Meet- ing, it is my duty to draw on every possible source of  outside information and enhance Omrons management  integrity from a broad perspective. To ensure manage- ment that consistently addresses the needs of all stake- holders in good faith, a variety of steps are undertaken.  For example, the Corporate Governance Committee,  which comprises outside directors and outside corporate  auditors, deliberates on those items that it considers are  important to increasing shareholder value. When asked  what must be protected, the answer lies not in the  interests of management, but in the interests of all  stakeholders, including shareholders. As outside corpo- rate auditors, our role is to protect Omrons corporate  value. At the same time, I am convinced that enhancing  corporate value is firmly entrenched in the hearts and  minds of the Companys management. —— In recent years, we have witnessed a suc- cession of incidents within the corporate sector,  most notably misconduct by senior executives.  As an outside corporate auditor, how are you  involved in the Companys system of director  checks and balances and supervision? The duties of an outside corporate auditor extend well  beyond attending meetings of the Boards of Directors  and Corporate Auditors and reviewing company docu- ments. In addition to attending every possible meeting,  an outside corporate auditor must maintain continuous  and constant dialogue with executive officers, visit  branch offices and plants, and actively seek opportunities  to listen carefully to comments from the frontline. Con- ducting numerous hearings directly with employees and  making every effort to accurately grasp the status of  business execution and operations is an effective way to  peg back any incidence of misconduct. For agenda items  scheduled for deliberation and determination by the  Board of Directors, the Board of Corporate Auditors must  play a central role in screening each item through a  process of prior consultation. In the event that a pro- posed agenda item is considered inappropriate, it is the  responsibility of outside corporate auditors and the Board  of Corporate Auditors to instruct the responsible depart- ment to make the appropriate modifications or to with- hold the agenda item. In my experience with the  Company, there has never been an occasion where  instructions have been ignored or an agenda item al- lowed to proceed to the Board of Directors without  modification or the appropriate action. In my opinion,  Omrons systems in this regard are functioning more  than adequately. —— How would you assess the effectiveness of  Omrons corporate governance? When serving as managing director of the Tokyo Stock  Exchange, I had the opportunity to closely examine more  than 700 companies. Compared with these companies, I  can commend Omron for its sound initiatives and activi- ties. The Company is indeed defined by a corporate  governance structure that imbues the spirit and values of  its founder and an unwavering focus on enhancing sus- tainability. A majority of the Board of Directors comprises  individuals whose principal role is to carry out a supervi- sory function. These directors take no part in the execu- tion of business. In addition, I am impressed by the role  played by corporate auditors, whose primary function is  to provide a system of checks and balances and super- vise the activities of directors. This attitude toward  consistently identifying the risks of failing to take appro- priate action as well as those risks associated with taking  inappropriate action, combined with unwavering efforts  to enhance corporate value, are collectively the driving  force behind the Company as a going concern. —— What do you believe is Omrons strength? Together with the technological capabilities and its sophis- tication, Omrons strength lies in the integrity of its corpo- rate culture that emphasizes the creation of products that  consistently satisfy customers. This comes from an  awareness of Omrons significance within society by each  and every employee together with management. While   I am equally sure that the Company can continue to  improve in a variety of areas, Omron is well served by its  unflagging efforts to minimize problems, issues, and risks  as well as garner the trust of users and client customers. —— What do you feel is required for Omron to  enhance its corporate value? In its most basic form, corporate governance entails risk  management. Accordingly, aggressively addressing risks  is vital to enhancing corporate value. Omron is already a  company with over half of its revenues generated over- seas. An important key to securing further growth is  therefore the Companys ability to rebuild its global risk  management structure and to then accelerate globaliza- tion. As a part of efforts to fulfill its obligations toward the  supply of essential products and services, Omron must  also work resolutely to rebuild its supply chain and imple- ment a robust business continuity plan (BCP). —— You are well versed in a number of fields,  including corporate governance and internal  control systems. How do you plan to utilize  these skills and knowledge with respect to the  Omron Groups management? More than just lip service, I believe my primary role is to  put forward specific recommendations that help formu- late Omrons management strategies going forward. This  includes bringing to the table an outside perspective on  what is required for a global company and how best to  enhance CSR. In addition, and as a member of society,  it is my responsibility to constantly point out the risks of  failing to take appropriate action from a variety of legal  and other aspects. I would therefore like to do my ut- most to assist Omron enhance its corporate value. —— In closing, is there a message that you  would like to convey to stakeholders? I would call on all stakeholders to adopt an open and frank  stance when analyzing the Company. Moving beyond  immediate gains and profits, I would ask that stakehold- ers point out any areas in which they believe Omron is  lacking, particularly in the Companys efforts to further  enhance its significance to society. At the same time,  I would hope that stakeholders will support the Company  over the long term in the belief that Omrons long-term  efforts will lead to increased corporate value. From my  perspective, as an outside corporate auditor with four  years standing, I am confident that the Company will  continue to follow the correct direction and path. Through a corporate governance structure that places the utmost emphasis  on sustainability based on the values of its founder as well as resolute risk  management, Omron is steadily enhancing its corporate value. 04 Corporate Governance  Interview with Eisuke Nagatomo, Outside Corporate Auditor Eisuke Nagatomo joined the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc., in 1971 and was  appointed managing director in 2003.

Based on this new vision, the Company will  promote two key measures: reducing the environmental impact of its business activities and  increasing the environmental contributions of its products and services. Omron established the Groups Environmental Policy in  1996 and its environmental management vision, "Green  Omron 21," in 2002. Based on this policy and vision,  Omron has promoted environmental management prac- tices centered on lessening the impact of its business  activities on the environment. Efforts were concentrated  on reducing total CO2 emissions and the amount of waste  associated with business activities in Japan.  The Omron Group formulated its new environmental  management vision, Green Omron 2020, in September  2011. In addition to continuing with efforts to reduce the  environmental impact of its internal business activities,  the vision highlights efforts to resolve global environmental  issues by creating and supplying products and services  that reduce environmental impact.   Under this vision, we aim to contribute to the develop- ment of a sustainable society by maximizing the effec- tiveness of management resources. Meanwhile, rather  than merely focusing on the environmental impact associ- ated with increased business activities, we will also con- centrate on reducing environmental impact by generating  more products and services that contribute to the global  environment. Having expressed these thoughts in our  Environmental Policy, we have established environmental  targets and for Action Guidelines to realize the objectives  of Green Omron 2020. Omron Group Environmental Policy Based on the Omron Group Corporate Motto and the Omron Principles, we will contribute to the  reduction of global environmental loads by maximizing the effective use of management resources,  such as human resources, materials, money, and energy, and providing useful products and services  for society. 1.  Considering the environmental impact of the Omron Group's business activities, products, and services, we will  establish the Environmental Management System globally and ensure continual improvements. 2.  We will comply with the legal and other requirements to which we subscribe concerning environmental aspects, and  we will take actions for environmental conservation and the prevention of pollution. 3.  Under the Environmental Policy, we will establish and implement objectives, targets, and programs, and through their  periodic evaluations we will strive to improve, maintain, and review our activities. 4.  To accomplish the objectives of the Environmental Policy smoothly and efficiently, we will communicate it to all em- ployees by providing environmental education and activities as well as subcontractors engaged in activities with the  Omron Group. 5.  We will disclose the Environmental Policy and the status of our environmental activities to the public in an appropriate  manner as necessary. Environmental Targets The Omron Groups Environmental Targets for Fiscal 2020  1.

Smart Power Savings is Omrons name for the energy- saving activities the Company is pursuing. By introducing  the Power Savings Monitoring System at our locations in  Japan, we were able to substantially reduce electric  power consumption without making sacrifices on the  operational and production fronts. We implemented a  host of energy-saving measures, such as improving facili- ties and manufacturing equipment to minimize energy  requirements through eco-manufacturing, and reduced  usage of air conditioners. As a result, we succeeded in  cutting our peak power consumption in all areas beyond  our target levels.  using the Power Savings Monitoring System to  Control Maximum Power Demand In July 2011, we segmented our 21 domestic business  locations according to electric power company service  area and introduced the Power Savings Monitoring Sys- tem at each site, making total power use for each area  visible in real time. When a site approached the preset  limit for power use, an alarm sounded, alerting the facility  manager to the need for measures to cut peak power  use. In the past, we had used this system for managing  individual sites. By expanding the system to monitor peak  power at several sites, we were able to efficiently man- age maximum power demand by area without suffering  productivity losses in individual locations.   Employing sensing and control technologies that Omron  has cultivated, the Power Savings Monitoring System  constitutes an environmental business solution. In addition  to using the system ourselves as a summer power-savings  measure, we have provided it to many of our customers,  who have also confirmed its effectiveness in reducing  power consumption. Eco-Manufacturing Eco-manufacturing is Omrons word for streamlining  the use of energy and resources employed in manufac- turing as much as possible by improving the operation of  manufacturing equipment and ancillary facilities. Produc- tion requires a great deal of energy, and the key to eco- manufacturing lies in economically supplying the amount  of pressure, lighting, and cooling that is needed for pro- duction precisely when needed. We render these require- ments visible and strive to save energy by determining  these needs in real time.   On a production line, for example, rather than simply  replace an existing machine with another that is more ener- gy-efficient—an approach that may be costly—we time- shift equipment use and switch off power while machines  are in wait mode as well as improve air conditioner and  compressor operation. These approaches have reduced  power consumption by as much as 30% at some facilities. Energy-Saving Initiatives at the Yasu Office At Omrons Yasu Office, the manufacture of semiconduc- tors, MEMS, and connectors requires a great deal of  energy. Located in the power service area, this plant  accounts for approximately 70% of the power used by all  Target and Actual Peak Power Cuts  through Smart Power Savings Area Target Actual Tokyo Electric Power  Company Incorporateds  service area (Kanto region) 15% (In response to government  request) 31% Kansai Electric Power  Co., Inc.s service area 15% (In response to request from  Kansai Electric) 22% Chubu Electric Power  Co., Inc.s service area 10% (Voluntary target) 14% Chugoku Electric Power  Co., Inc.s service area 10% (Voluntary target) 12% Kyushu Electric Power  Co., Inc.s service area 10% (Voluntary target) 16% Exceeding target  at one site Area total Achieved target  for all areas Environmental Impact Reduction: Exceeding Targets for Cutting Peak Power Use through Smart Power Savings of Omrons facilities in Japan. Measures to slash power  requirements at the Yasu Office therefore had a major  impact on reducing peak power use throughout the Kan- sai Electric Power service area.  In June 2011, Yasu Office managers gathered together  and set the goal of reducing peak power use between  July and September 2011 by 9.9% compared with 2010  levels and drawing up measures to reach this objective.  During this process, we realized that such electricity,  water, ventilation, and compressed air used by equipment  at the plant and supplied by utilities accounted for 56% of  peak electricity. We also recognized that around 70% of  utility-related peak electricity went toward refrigeration  systems—turbo freezers, chilled water pumps, cooling  water pumps, and cooling towers—and was used to cool  production equipment.   To cut peak power used by these cooling systems, we  ran simulations and conducted repeated tests with actual  equipment, allowing us to adjust coolant water pump  pressure and optimize flow rates.   In addition to energy-saving measures targeting these  cooling systems, we sprayed water on the roof of the  office wing, reduced lighting, consolidated office areas,  and lowered the volume of air delivered by air-condition- ing systems. Through relatively simple measures such as  these, we succeeded in reducing electricity consumption  from July to September 2011 by 13.3% year on year. In  addition to reducing electricity bills during the period,  these efforts will be instrumental in making power-saving  improvements in future years.   In fiscal 2011, we focused in particular on initiatives to  improve peak power consumption at the Yasu Office by  concentrating on utility services. We will also review tem- perature and humidity settings at our production facilities,  on the condition that revisions do not affect product qual- ity. As a result, we expect to save even more energy. 05 Resolving Environmental Issues Yasu Office   (City of Yasu, Shiga Prefecture) The center for our advanced technologies in the  microelectronics business, this facility uses ultrafine  processing technologies to manufacture MEMS,  semiconductors, and connectors. Also, the office  serves as the sales and marketing site for our IAB.  As well as efforts to save energy, at this office we  have introduced equipment to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions and improved wastewater processing  equipment, and employees participate in maintaining  and managing a biotope on site. Through environmental  preservation activities such as these, we take the  regions natural environment and resources into  account as we work to turn this facility into an  environmentally conscious model factory.

When research began, the industry believed the viability  of this sort of technological development to be low, and  the research was considered difficult. As a result, no  company other than Omron was interested in taking part.  However, we were able to take advantage of the product  development that we had conducted on protective relays  and other electrical equipment. Following six years of  technological development, in 2008 we took the industry  lead by successfully developing AICOT anti-islanding  technology, which is effective even when solar power  generation systems are concentrated at housing com- plexes or in high-density residential areas.  At Pal Town Josai-no-Mori, in the City of Ota, Gumma  Prefecture, we are collaborating with inhabitants on the  Demonstrative Project on Grid-Interconnection of  Clustered Photovoltaic Power Generation Systems,  using AICOT anti-islanding technology for multiunit sys- tems. AICOT-equipped power conditioners are used on a  total of 554 units (as of December 2009). Having a total  generation output of 2,129kW, this project is one of the  worlds largest multiunit systems.   The project is attracting significant amounts of attention  from many quarters, taking Pal Town Josai-no-Mori as the  model for an environmental city with low CO2 emissions. 05 Resolving Environmental Issues The AICOT marks design is meant to convey a sense of  tenderness toward the environment and people. The large circle  denotes the sun, while the three smaller orbs indicate houses.   * Anti-Islanding COntrol Technology (AICOT) is a registered trademark of Omron  Corporation (registration number 5205429). Trouble Resulting from the Concentration of  Solar Power Generation Facilities Solar power generation systems are the focus of rapidly  growing attention as a measure for countering the in- creasingly serious issue of global warming by converting  solar energy, rather than fossil fuels, into electricity. One  problem with installing solar power generation systems  on adjacent roofs, as has been done in the past, is that  this results in multiunit systems—multiple solar power  generation systems connected to electric wires as they  would be for an electric power utility. This complexity can  be the source of system trouble, creating a barrier to the  proliferation of solar power generation systems. We have  addressed this issue by taking the industry lead in devel- oping AICOT, an acronym for Anti-Islanding COntrol  Technology.  Solar power generation systems configured with Omron  power conditioners* employing AICOT allow the concen- tration of solar power generation systems within a certain  area. We believe this technology will contribute signifi- cantly to the popularization and promotion of solar power  generation systems.  Omron began marketing AICOT-equipped power con- ditioners in July 2011. Since that time, sales have grown  steadily as customers have recognized the  advantages the technology provides in alleviating the  problems associated with multiunit systems.   By leveraging the advantages of this technology, Omron  looks forward to encouraging the proliferation of solar  power generation systems. To do so, we will concentrate  on developing AICOT along with other technologies and  products. Removing the Need for Safety Verification on  Power Generation Systems Solar power generation systems may continue to gener- ate electricity even in the event that electricity supplied by  power companies is interrupted due to outages or electri- cal accidents. This situation, known as islanding, can  shock people involved in reconstruction activities, start  equipment fires when electrical service resumes, and  create a host of other problems. To address this situation,  solar power generation systems can be equipped with  anti-islanding functions. For multiunit systems, however,  interference between generation systems can prevent  anti-islanding functions from working properly.   To prevent this situation from occurring, we conduct  interference tests using multiunit systems with individual  meters attached to power conditioner assemblies, con- firming that no trouble arises and confirming their safety.  As this testing can require one to two months, however,  in the past we faced the risk that such testing could  affect delivery times. Using AICOT-equipped power  conditioners obviates the need for interference testing on  multiunit systems, eliminating potential problems on  delivery schedules. Contributing Significantly to the Popularization  of Solar Power Generation Systems Another major roadblock exists along the path to the  proliferation of solar power generation systems. For safe- ty reasons, rules are in place that limit solar power gen- eration system installation to around 10% of sites to each  area. However, power conditioners equipped with AICOT  are not subject to this regulation, so they could theoreti- cally be used to install solar power generation systems on  all roofs.   As a result, Omron is making a major contribution to the  popularization of solar power generation systems, which  use environment-friendly renewable energy. Accumulated R&D Expertise in Electrical  Equipment Results in AICOT Since 2003, Omron has been working with Kandenko Co.,  Ltd., and other organizations in Ota, Gunma Prefecture,  on the Demonstrative Project on Grid-Interconnection of  Clustered Photovoltaic Power Generation Systems, which  was commissioned by the New Energy and Industrial  Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

Some 130 million people are said  to suffer from hypertension, 100 million from obesity,  and 50 million from diabetes.* Alleviating or preventing  such lifestyle diseases has thus evolved into a major  social issue.  *According to a survey by Global Information, Inc.  To improve this situation in India, we are pursuing  activities centered on Omron Healthcare India (OHS-IN),  combining our experience and lineup of healthcare and  medical instruments with our expertise in health manage- ment and alleviating illness. Omron first established a  representative office in India in 1997. In 2011, we stepped  up marketing efforts involving digital blood pressure moni- tors. To expand our business activities further, in Novem- ber we established the marketing company OHS-IN in  Gurgaon, located near Delhi, in the state of Haryana. Encouraging the Proliferation of Health and  Medical Care Instruments and Contributing to  the Community Alleviating lifestyle diseases requires first determining a  patients condition, followed by the improvement of life- style habits. At the moment, however, in India only about  0.5% (as of 2010) of people with high blood pressure had  digital blood pressure monitors. Low diffusion levels are  also the norm for electronic thermometers, body compo- sition monitors, blood glucose monitors, pedometers, and  other healthcare and medical instruments. In many cases,  patients do not have the knowledge needed to use these  healthcare and medical instruments, but another major  issue is that many patients do not recognize the impor- tance of health management. This situation has been  changing in recent years as more people are becoming  aware of and interested in health, and the percentage of  people engaging in fitness activities is on the rise.   OHS-IN is working to encourage this trend toward  health by augmenting the number of shops that handle  Omron products to enable more households to gain  access to our products. Also, we are producing Hindi- language documentation and developing products to  match the needs of Indian people. In this way, OHS-IN is  reinforcing sales and promotional activities related to  healthcare and medical instruments. The company is also  contributing to the local community in a number of ways.  For example, we have begun holding free health-check  events to determine blood pressure and other factors,  thereby encouraging an understanding of how to prevent  or alleviate lifestyle diseases.  Activities Targeting a Greater Number of People Amid intense competition from other companies, OHS-IN  is making steady inroads in the Indian market. In fiscal  2011, the company expanded its sales network to 12,500  shops. Furthermore, Omron-brand digital blood pressure  monitors hold the top share of the Indian market, at 60%,  which reflects the fact that physicians around the world  recognize the quality and reliability of our products. Against  this backdrop, we are steadily cultivating local staff who  understand the importance of the healthcare business.   We aim to popularize digital blood pressure monitors in  small and medium-sized Indian cities with populations of  less than one million. By leveraging the local expertise and  personnel we are cultivating in India, we aim to popularize  healthcare and medical instruments and encourage health- promotion activities in other emerging markets as well. Free Health-Check Events In fiscal 2011, we held 376 free health-check events in  cities with populations of one million or more. Conducted  at such locations as pharmacies, these events gave at- tendees a chance to check their blood pressure, weight,  and temperature.  Owing to extremely high interest in measuring physical  health parameters, each of these free health-check events  attracts more than 100 people. At these events, we share  test results with participants and give them blood pres- sure diaries and health handbooks, which explain test  results in careful detail. Contributing to the Health of People in India Exercise is important to maintaining or improving health.  To encourage exercise, Omron sponsors three Indias  most prominent distance-running events: the Mumbai  Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Bangalore  10km Marathon, supporting the health of many competi- tors in the process.   Company booths at each of these marathons introduce  our healthcare and medical instruments, including digital  blood pressure monitors, accompanied by a free health- check event. Participants can visit our booth to check their  fitness before the race. 6 Resolving Health Issues Contributing to the Health of People  throughout the World Special Feature  A long queue for a free health check Mumbai Marathon Building that houses Omron Healthcare India (OHS-IN) Contributing to the Health of People in India The desire to be healthy is shared by people throughout the world.

Campaign In January 2012, we launched the Dream.Do. Campaign  to advance Omrons dream of contributing to Indian soci- ety by resolving health issues. The thrust of the cam- paign, which features  popular actor Farhan  Akhtar as a brand ambas- sador, is to emphasize  what a single person can  accomplish if they push  ahead toward their  dreams. Using newspa- per and mass media  advertising, this cam- paign is designed to  promote the image of  Omron as a progressive  and approachable brand  as well as raise the  awareness of health  management among  Indian people.  Supporting Pharmacies Privately managed pharmacies are a major channel for  acquainting Indian consumers with Omrons healthcare  and medical instruments. Therefore, we conduct semi- nars to demonstrate to heads of pharmacies how to use  our instruments, augment their understanding, and dis- seminate knowledge on the appropriate role of instru- ments in health management.   At the same time, to increase the understanding of  healthcare and medical instruments among consumers  who are unfamiliar with them, we erect billboards adver- tising Omron products along the street and at the front of  pharmacies.   Providing Support for Large-Scale  Clinical Research in India In fiscal 2011, we collaborated with the Indian Society of  Hypertension to support a large-scale clinical study involv- ing leading doctors from Japan, Canada, and India entitled  the Relationship between Indian Food Culture and Hy- pertension. As one of the societys official sponsors, we  provided medical personnel with digital blood pressure  monitors and other measurement equipment used in the  clinical study.  At Annamalai University, one site of the large-scale  clinical study, OHS-IN donated 100 digital blood pressure  monitors and 100 electronic thermometers for student  use, thereby supporting university research. Commencement of the GENKI Project Recognizing that healthy bodies and ensuring occupa- tional health and safety are essential if employees are to  fully utilize their skills, Omron has been a leader in various  business activities centered on health and safety. We  have had illness prevention measures targeting lifestyle  and other diseases in place for some time as well as  measures to address mental health. In fiscal 2011, we  augmented these programs by launching the GENKI  Project (genki means healthy in Japanese). The project  is aimed at fostering in which employees who are healthy,  full of energy, dynamic, and possess a sense of commu- nity. During the first year of the project, we conducted  Om-Walk and Kyoto Marathon Participant Support  activities.  The Om-Walk Walking Event in Japan The slogan for our Om-Walk event emphasizes being  healthy and competing in calorie-burning activities. Using  our products and services—activity monitors and Well- nessLink,* our health portal site—teams competed for  the highest overall activity level.   The fiscal 2011 Om-Walk was voluntary; however, 91%  of our employees participated, including temporary work- ers. (Participants numbered 13,554, composing 807  teams). We used WellnessLink to show how competing  teams fared, allowing participants to check their walking  status at a glance via the website and heightening the  sense of participation.    Participants made such comments as This event in- creased my awareness of walking and exercise, When  commuting to work, I decided to get off my train or bus  one stop earlier and walk the rest of the way, and This  was a great conversation topic at work; it helped to im- prove communications. 06 Resolving Health Issues Exercise Effectively Enjoy continuing to exercise Easy to Record Data  Just by having the pedometer in  your pocket, you can count your  steps each day.

As of March 31, 2012, three business companies, 16 Group  companies in Japan, and 24 Group companies overseas had  acquired certification under the ISO 9001 international standard  for their quality management systems. This has led to the estab- lishment and full-scale implementation of a plan, do, check,  act (PDCA) cycle at each organization. The PDCA cycle is in- tended to first formulate an improvement plan, implement it,  evaluate the degree of achievement, and reflect the evaluation  results by making subsequent improvements. The strict imple- mentation of an individual PDCA cycle helps ensure safety and  quality of products, the continued improvement of quality, and  the prevention of quality-related problems.  Quick Detection and Prevention of Serious Claims We manage information on customer inquiries and complaints  regarding defects so we quickly become aware of any major  quality issues that might affect customer safety as well as prevent  such quality issues from recurring. We have established Product  Quality Risk Management Regulations for communicating infor- mation about any major product quality issues immediately and  accurately to top management.  We respond promptly to customer inquiries and have in place  links between the quality departments at headquarters and  those of business companies and business divisions. This ar- rangement enables us to respond quickly to complaints and  prevent their recurrence.  Industry-Leading Customer Service and Support In fiscal 2006, IAB established the Global Service Center. With  the aim of increasing and standardizing service quality, the  center conducts customer satisfaction surveys at the site level  throughout the world (approximately 300 sites in 80 countries or  regions), among other activities.   In B to B Site Ranking, a study of web support in Japan by  Japan Brand Strategy, Inc., Omron has ranked first in customer  service for six consecutive fiscal years, through fiscal 2012.   Omron Healthcare Co., Ltd., has set up a Customer Service  Center, which handles customer queries, parts sales, and repairs  in an integrated manner.   The long-term management strategy that began in fiscal 2011  raises the goal for the customer service division of converting  each person who makes an inquiry at the Customer Service  Center into an Omron fan. In fiscal 2012, we changed our operat- ing structure, shifting from a rank-specific organization to one  that is function based. We are restructuring the center to im- prove quality and efficiency by creating a call center that is easy  to reach. Reflecting Customer Feedback in  Product Development Aiming to provide society with products that are easy for anyone  to use, Omron Healthcare conducts universal design evaluations  at every stage of product development to confirm universal  quality. As one example of this process, when configuring the  screens and verification-testing of the service content of the  MedicalLink home blood pressure management service employ- ing information technology, the company asked private medical  practitioners to evaluate the service. The frank opinions the  company received from healthcare professionals led Omron  Healthcare to introduce improvements.   In the past, usability evaluations and Group interviews were  conducted in a research format that centered on product param- eters. We have altered this approach and are accelerating our  rollout of lifestyle evaluations (ethnography studies) designed to  uncover potential needs. This method enables us to better un- derstand overseas needs, particularly in emerging markets,  against substantially different cultural backdrops. Determining  potential needs by taking lifestyles into account is instrumental  in developing glocal* product plans. We will remain closely  attuned to customers input and needs by using this information  to forecast future needs and gain a head start in the develop- ment of worldwide product plans. Maximizing Customer Satisfaction Aiming to Provide Products and Services That Are Safe and Instill Confidence Creating Value for Customers We strive to satisfy customers by enhancing the quality of the products and services we offer. By recognizing  business activities leading to the safety of our products, services, and customers as a management priority,  we pursue initiatives to provide products and services that function safely and that customers can use with  confidence. MedicalLink screen Quality Assurance Customer Service Cultivating Global Human Resources To achieve the goal expressed in our new long-term strategy,  Value Generation 2020 (VG2020), of creating a workforce and  organizations to support the global growth of our business, in  fiscal 2012 we will introduce Team Omron Global Training Pro- gram (TOP)—a human resources training system. Focused on  workplace practices, the Camp seeks to nurture staff with vision  who are ready for action. The program begins by determining  employees current skills and subsequently shows them the  next steps toward growth while continuing to challenge them.  In the current fiscal year, we have updated The Boot Camp,  our training program for newly appointed managers, to strength- en worksite management. In tandem with the global develop- ment of our business, we have begun training to assist employ- ees in quickly boosting their English proficiency and gaining a  necessary understanding of other cultures.  Promoting the Employment of People with  Disabilities on a Global Basis Omrons corporate philosophy emphasizes respect for diversity,  and one aspect of this tenet is to increase the number of em- ployment opportunities for people with disabilities. We continue  to rank at the top of the  manufacturing industry for  our employment of people  with disabilities, which as  of June 2011 amounted to  2.24% of our workforce in  Japan, including 24 Group  companies. In Indonesia,  meanwhile, although the  law stipulates that people  with disabilities must ac- count for at least 1% of the workforce, few companies comply.  However, in 2010, PT OMRON Manufacturing of INDONESIA  (OMI) created and is implementing a program to provide training  and employment as a package to people with disabilities. This  program has proved successful. OMI has raised its percentage  of people with disabilities to 2% of its workforce, and word of  the program has spread to  other companies in Indone- sia. Five companies have  now introduced a similar  type of program to OMI.  These efforts have earned  OMI the Best Practice  Award for employing peo- ple with disabilities from  the International Labour Organization (ILO) as well as kudos  from the Indonesian government.  Increasing Opportunities to Empower Women In order to improve motivation among women, we will work to  increase the number of opportunities for women to contribute  to the workplace and encourage a balance between work and  family life. We are thus promoting devotion to these initiatives  in top management, in the workplace, and among the women  themselves.  In October 2008, Omron launched a project to study ways to  increase the empowerment of female staff. In fiscal 2011, we  held study sessions, lecture presentations, and other events to  brainstorm ideas on expanding womens networks on a variety  of fronts.   Since fiscal 2001, we have conducted Female Leader Training  to promote women to positions of responsibility. As of fiscal  2011, 124 women have taken advantage of this program. As a  result of these initiatives, the  number of women in core  management positions—de- fined as positions of respon- sibility or specialist or higher  positions—has increased  steadily. As of April 2011,  throughout the Omron Group  21 women were in manager  positions and 260 in assis- tant manager positions.  Direct Dialogue with the President Omron has a practice of encouraging dialogue between employ- ees and the president called The KURUMAZA, which began as  a result of the presidents desire to foster a deeper mutual under- standing with workplace personnel. This program enables the  president to understand the issues employees face in their daily  work by hearing their problems and issues directly. The program  also gives employees the chance to hear firsthand the presi- dents thoughts and assists in cultivating an atmosphere of mu- tual understanding. We plan to introduce this program globally.  Respect for Individuality and Diversity Respecting Individuality and Diversity and Fostering Employees Who Are Effective in a  Global Context Creating Value for Employees Omron has made respect for individuality and diversity one of its Management Commitments. We do not  discriminate on the basis of nationality, gender, or ability, and we welcome individuals who have diverse  values and skills. We recognize such attributes encourage corporate and personal growth, and we aim to be  a company that encourages people to grow.

Omron uses a conveniently located  hotel at the JR Kyoto station as a venue for these meetings.  Also, Omron has set up systems that allow shareholders to  exercise their voting rights by post as well as an electronic voting  system that enables exercise via personal computer or mobile  device. Since 2006, Omron has offered access to the Electronic  Voting Platform, creating an environment whereby institutional  investors in Japan and overseas can quickly provide documents  for the general meeting and smoothly  exercise their voting rights.   After the close of the general meet- ing, a separate presentation to explain  management conditions is held as well  as a shareholder roundtable confer- ence. These events provide the oppor- tunity to offer shareholders further  information on Omrons initiatives that  could not be communicated during the  general meeting.  The 75th annual general shareholders meeting, held on June  21, 2012, was attended by 796 shareholders, 134 more than in  the preceding fiscal year. This figure represented 84.3% of  voting rights.  Aiming to Strengthen Two-Way Communications To enhance communications with individual investors, Omron  conducts corporate presentations and participates in investor  fairs. In fiscal 2011, Omron participated in 24 investor relations  (IR) events, communicating with some 2,500 investors.  For institutional investors, Omron provided about 970 communi- cation opportunities in fiscal 2011. These included trips that the  president made to personally meet investors throughout the world,  presentations of business results and financial standing, telecon- ferences, and participation in investor relations conferences.  In Japan, we hold tours of our plant in Kusatsu, Shiga Prefec- ture, for institutional investors and analysts. Overseas, we con- duct tours of our plants in Shanghai and Guangzhou, in China.  Moreover, we hold well-received technology briefings, centering  on our blood pressure monitor and relay technologies.   Input and feedback obtained through dialogue are relayed via  the investor relations department to the president and the man- agement team and are used to help create various manage ment  strategies. Proactive Information Disclosure We employ an IR site and various other tools to support interac- tive communications with shareholders and investors by disclos- ing information on product development and sales activities  tailored to specific markets as well as information on operating  performance. Our IR site features a message from the presi- dent, explanations of our strategies and operating performance,  and video footage.  Inclusion in SRI Indexes Omrons CSR activities have earned high praise from around the  world, and the Companys shares are included in two major  socially responsible investment (SRI) indexes: the Morningstar  Socially Responsible Investment Index and the Asia Pacific (AP)  version of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). Relationship Building with Shareholders IR Activities Focusing on Dialogue With its investor relations (IR) policy emphasizing interactive communication with current and potential  investors, Omron provides timely and accurate information on the Company's business conditions and  management policies. Omron also aims to reflect investors' comments in its management strategies to  the fullest extent possible to maximize corporate value. Creating Value for Shareholders  and Investors Providing Support through Business Activities To provide support for the people affected by the Great East  Japan Earthquake and assist in rebuilding the stricken region,  we donated a portion of the proceeds from sales of our KM  Series* of electricity monitors, which are used in energy-saving  activities at manufacturing plants. Through this effort, we raised  18,723,000 for the Japanese Red Cross Society.   During the 11 months from May 2011 through March 2012, we  worked with stores that market IAB products, concentrating on  sales of the KM Series. Numerous sales outlets and customers  joined in this effort, recognizing the importance of the KM Series  in saving energy at manufacturing plants and supporting recon- struction. Their cooperation was instrumental. Sponsoring the Kyoto Marathon The first Kyoto Marathon was held on March 11, 2012, to support  reconstruction efforts following the Great East Japan Earthquake.  Omron participated as a special sponsor in the event, and numer- ous employees, colleagues, and family members volunteered  their support on the day of the marathon, cheering on partici- pants or participating in the race themselves.   The Omron Group in Japan also sponsored an Om-Walk event  (for details, see page 81) during the 11 days leading up to the  marathon and provided matching donations. We donated  3,118,000 to correspond with participants total activity level,  providing these funds to the Japanese Red Cross Society via the  Kyoto Shimbun Welfare Work Team and crisis management  headquarters in the stricken region.  Lecturing at Ofunato High School On September 21, 2011, we conducted a lecture at Ofunato High  School, in Iwate Prefecture. Titled The Connection between  Omrons Technologies and Society, the talk coincided with the  schools Daylong General University event. By offering stu- dents a chance to learn from a broad spectrum of people in the  working world, the event encouraged high school students to  think about developing their own careers and gave them a point  of reference as they considered their paths for the future.   A post-event questionnaire revealed a number of forward- thinking comments, such as I want to remain aware of my  relationship with society as I learn and I want to become an  engineer who looks at society from various perspectives and  meets its needs.   We also received a posi- tive note from one of the  high school instructors: I  aim to help young people,  whose future is unfolding  before them, find their path  to the future. Through Japan Platform, the Omron Group donated 5 million to  victims of the major flooding that occurred in Thailand in October  2011.   After restoring its own plant, Omron Automotive Electronics  Co., Ltd., located in Ayutthaya Province, set about helping to  address the many scars left by the flooding, participating in such  volunteer activities as repairing and painting the damaged  schoolhouse of Wat Kan Ham Elementary School. The company  and employee volunteers also made contributions and provided  school supplies.   The volunteer activities  served another purpose:  through association with  members of another  Omron company in Bang- kok, volunteers strength- ened the ties within Team  Omron. Awareness and Practice of Corporate Citizenship Contributing to the Development of Local Communities as a Member of International Society Creating Value for Local  Communities Aiming to be a valued corporate citizen, Omron strives for harmonious coexistence with local communities.  As such, Omron complies with all applicable laws and rules and respects local culture and customs. We also  communicate proactively with local residents and organizations to build relations of mutual understanding.

Market Environment 1. Macroeconomic Environment  In fiscal 2011, the economic climate in Japan continued to  face harsh conditions, such as depression in corporate  production activities and consumer spending due to the  impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake, which occurred  on March 11, 2011. Moreover, efforts to recover from these  impacts were impeded by electricity shortages, which were  the result of the nuclear power plant incident that followed  the earthquake as well as the tight supply and demand  situation regarding parts. Overseas, while growth continued  in emerging countries, the combined impacts of the monetary  tightening in China, high unemployment rates in the United  States, the instability of financial systems in Europe, and    the severe flooding in Thailand in October 2011 further  strengthened the sense of stagnancy in the global economy.  The decrease in exports as a result of disrupted supply  chains in Japan and the sharp rise in resource imports forced  Japan to record a trade deficit for the first time in 31 years,  when deficits resulted from the 1979 oil crisis. Also, the  current account balance surplus dropped by more than 50%  in comparison with fiscal 2010. Further, the real GDP of Japan  was down 1.8% year on year during the first quarter of the  fiscal year. While a recovery was evident during the summer  months, real GDP did not show any change over the full fiscal  year and was down 0.7% for the calendar year.

The Omron Group Market Environment  In Japan, the drive for energy saving and increased environ- mental awareness contributed to higher product sales. Also,  demand for Omron products is expanding steadily in growing  markets in China and the Asia Pacific region.  Conversely, downward pressure was placed on earnings by  soaring materials prices and the strong yen, for which the  average exchange rates appreciated to 79.3 to the U.S. dollar,  up 6.5 from the previous fiscal year, and to 110.3 to the euro,  a 3.2 year-on-year rise.  The direct impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake was  minimal for the Omron Group, whose main production sites are  located outside the affected areas. In response to the supply  chain disruptions, we established emergency product supply  systems to fulfill our responsibility to supply products and limit  the impact of these disruptions on society to the greatest  extent possible. 2010 2011 Note: Seasonally adjusted Source: Cabinet Ofce, Government of Japan (FY) –6 –3 0 3 6 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 (%) Production  Shipments  Inventory Source: Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry 50 200 250 300 150 100 2008 2009 2010 2011 Growth Rate of Real Private  Capital Investment Index of Electronic Parts and Devices (Seasonally adjusted indices, 2005 average =100) Growth Rate of Machinery Orders (Manufacture) Silver and Copper Prices Exchange Rates 2010 2011 (Billions of yen) (%) Orders [left axis] Change from the previous quarter [right axis] Note: Seasonally adjusted Source: Cabinet Ofce, Government of Japan (FY) 0 850 900 950 1,000 –5 0 5 10 15 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 (Yen/kg) (Yen/kg) Silver [left axis] Copper [right axis] 0 40,000 60,000 80,000 120,000 0 600 20,000 300 900 1,200 100,000 1,500 1,800 2008 2009 2010 2011 (Yen) US$ EUR 70 130 140 150 160 120 110 100 90 80 2008 2009 2010 2011 CONTENTS Financial Section (U.S. GAAP) Internal Control Section To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information  90 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 91 Overview of Consolidated Results and Financial Condition   Note:  Segment operating income is prepared using the single-step method (which does not show individual income levels) based on U.S. GAAP. For an easier  comparison with other companies, operating income represents gross profit minus selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and research  and development (R&D) expenses.  In this market environment, the Groups consolidated net  sales were heavily affected by the strong yen, but it was still able  to record a 0.3% year-on-year increase, to 619.5 billion, due to  sales contributions of such initiatives as expanding operations in  emerging countries and introducing new products. However,  the strong yen and high raw materials prices significantly  impacted income, resulting in year-on-year decreases of 16.4%  in operating income, to 40.1 billion; 19.5% in income before  income taxes, to 33.5 billion; and 38.8% in net income  attributable to shareholders, to 16.4 billion.  Total assets decreased 4.5% from the end of the previous  fiscal year, largely due to declines in cash and time deposits,  which was a result of the redemption of commercial paper, as  well as in deferred tax assets. Total shareholders equity was  up 2.6%, to 320.8 billion, due to the accumulation of retained  earnings, and led to a rise in the shareholders equity ratio, to  59.7%, from 55.6% at the end of the previous fiscal year.  Return on equity (ROE) stood at 5.2%, and return on  invested capital (ROIC) was 6.9%, both percentages down  from 8.7% and 9.3%, respectively, in the previous fiscal year. Review and Analysis of the Statements of Income Net Sales  In fiscal 2011, the yen continued to appreciate against the  dollar and the euro, negatively impacting sales. At the same  time, sales benefited from the successes of such initiatives  as expanding operations in China, India, and other emerging  countries and the aggressive introduction of new products.  As a result, net sales were up 1.6 billion year on year, or  0.3%, to 619.5 billion.  By region, sales declined 1.4% in Japan. Overseas, sales in  Europe were down 1.1%, due to the impacts of the sovereign  debt crisis, whereas sales were up 0.6% in the Americas,  4.2% in the Greater China region, and 4.7% in the Asia Pacific  region. Performance in the Greater China region continued to  lead other overseas segments in terms of both net sales and  operating income. Cost of Sales and SG&A Expenses Cost of sales increased 1.4% year on year due to soaring raw  materials prices, and the cost of sales ratio rose 0.7  percentage point, to 63.2%. In fiscal 2011, the average price  per kilogram of silver rose rapidly, to 92,379, compared with  62,664 per kilogram recorded in the previous year, and the  unit price of copper also remained high. While the Company  strove to limit manufacturing fixed costs and enhance its  product mix, the environment continued to present difficul- ties with regard to profitability.  SG&A expenses increased 3.3 billion, or 2.3%, from the  previous fiscal year, and the SG&A-to-sales ratio rose 0.5  percentage point, to 23.5%. At the same time, R&D expenses  were up 0.8 billion, or 1.9%, and the R&D-to-sales ratio rose  0.1 percentage point, to 6.8%. This increase was due to the  Companys policy to steadily implement investment as neces- sary for future growth. Other Expenses (Income) * See Note 12 on page 115. Other expenses increased 0.2 billion year on year, to 6.6  billion, due to the impact of loss on impairment of goodwill  and foreign exchange loss, net. Segment Information Note:  Segment operating income is prepared using the single-step method (which does not show individual income levels) based on U.S. GAAP. For easier compari- son with other companies, operating income represents gross profit minus SG&A expenses and R&D expenses. Note:  In segment information, sales represent sales to external customers and exclude intersegment transactions. Conversely, operating income includes income  from intersegment transactions before deductions of headquarters expenses and other non-apportionable amounts. Please refer to pages 36–47 for detailed segment business results, fiscal 2012 outlook, and strategy.  1. Review of Operations by Business Segment Industrial Automation Business (IAB)  IAB net sales decreased 0.4% year on year, to 270.8  billion. Operating income was impacted by the strong yen and  the Groups strategic investment efforts and thus dropped  12.8%, to 33.3 billion. In Japan, sales were up during the first  quarter but were lackluster throughout the rest of the fiscal  year due to the impacts of inventory adjustment trends and  sluggish demand for semiconductor and electronic compo- nent-related products. Overseas, operations in Europe were  affected by external factors including the strong yen and the  instability of financial systems, but these factors were offset  by strong sales of control equipment for oil- and gas-related  businesses in the Americas and the benefits of reconstruction  demand following the floods in Thailand. Overall performance  in overseas operations was strong accordingly. Electronic & Mechanical Components Business (EMC)  EMC net sales increased 2.2% year on year, to 83.0 billion.  However, operating income declined 39.2%, to 7.2 billion,  due to the lower sales of high-profit-margin factory automation  (FA) products as well as the impacts of the strong yen and  soaring raw materials prices. In Japan, sales of automotive  components and amusement devices quickly recovered after  the Great East Japan Earthquake, and post-earthquake recon- struction demand drove strong sales of certain components  for consumer products. Overseas, sales of products for the  automobile industry and mobile telephones grew. Automotive Electronic Components Business (AEC)  AEC net sales edged up 0.9% year on year, to 85.0 billion,  however, operating income fell 35.3%, to 2.7 billion, as a  result of the strong yen and the impacts of the Great East  Japan Earthquake and floods in Thailand. Domestic sales  were adversely influenced in the first half of the fiscal year by  reduced production among automobile manufacturers, the  main customers for this business. However, demand recov- ered later in the year in conjunction with the recovery of these  manufacturers. In overseas operations, strong demand from  overseas automobile manufacturers and the economic  growth of emerging countries contributed positively to sales. Income before Income Taxes, Net Income Attributable  to Shareholders, and Profit Distribution  As a result of the above, income before income taxes and  equity in loss (earnings) of affiliates amounted to 33.5 billion,  declining 8.1 billion from the 41.7 billion recorded in the  previous fiscal year. Likewise, net income attributable to  shareholders was 16.4 billion, down 10.4 billion from the  previous years 26.8 billion. Basic net income attributable to  shareholders per share fell from 121.7 in fiscal 2010, to  74.5 in fiscal 2011.  The Company distributed an annual cash dividend of 28.0  per share in fiscal 2011, representing a 2.0 decrease from  the previous fiscal year payment. The dividend payment was  determined based on the Companys basic policy of securing  sufficient internal capital resources for future growth while  maintaining a minimum 20% dividend payout ratio and  targeting a 2% dividend on equity (DOE) ratio and returning  profits to shareholders to the greatest extent possible after  these conditions are met. The consolidated dividend payout  ratio was 37.6%, and the DOE ratio was 1.9% in fiscal 2011.

The environmental solutions business saw the smooth launch  of energy-saving, creating, and storing businesses, and the  related maintenance business witnessed continued sales  expansion for solar power generation and accompanying  installation services. Conversely, the railway infrastructure  business suffered due to the persisting trend of limited invest- ment among railway companies after the earthquake, which  offset favorable sales of safety and security solutions centered  on remote monitoring systems, thus leading to sluggish  sales. Performance in the traffic control and road control  systems business was lackluster in a similar manner. Healthcare Business (HCB)  HCB net sales stepped up 3.0% year on year, to 62.4  billion, but operating income was down 28.4%, to 2.9 billion,  as a result of the impacts of the strong yen and the imple- mentation of strategic investments. In Japan, sales of new  home-use healthcare devices, such as activity monitors, body  composition monitors, and thermometers, proved to be favor- able and we managed to expand our market share. In equip- ment for use in medical institutions, the worlds first visceral  fat monitor posted sales growth. However, the overall trend  of curtailing capital investment in the market resulted in weak  sales of physiological monitors, a core product. Overseas,  meanwhile, demand for Omrons healthcare equipment  increased, particularly in emerging markets, and sales were  strong in all areas except the Americas, where the impact of  the strong yen was particularly heavy. Other Businesses The Other segments net sales increased 7.8% year on year,  to 53.5 billion, and operating loss improved 1.1 billion, to  3.6 billion, due to the benefits of cost-reduction measures  instituted in the micro devices business. In the environmental  solutions business, the social drive for electricity saving and  the development of alternative energy sources contributed to  expansion of the energy-saving components and services  business, which includes systems for making electricity  usage data more accessible, while sales of solar power condi- tioners, as part of the energy-creation business, were also  strong. In the electronic systems and equipment business,  demand for uninterruptible power supply units continued to  increase in view of rising power supply concerns. In the micro  devices business, sales were sluggish for contract semicon- ductor production orders and custom integrated circuits for  consumer products and industrial use. In the backlight  business, sales increased notably thanks to strong demand  for smartphones. 2. Review of Operations by Region Japan  In Japan, demand for semiconductors, electronic compo- nents, and consumer electronics was sluggish, and invest- ment in railways and transportation infrastructure was low. At  the same time, post-earthquake reconstruction demand and  changes in consumer tendency fueled strong sales of  automobiles, machine tools, amusement devices, and  environment-related products. Also as a result of these  trends, sales in the IAB, EMC, AEC, and HCB were relatively  unchanged from the previous fiscal year. Due to the above,  net sales (including direct exports) in Japan declined 1.4%  year on year, to 307.6 billion, and operating income was  down 27.1%, to 21.7 billion. The Americas  In the Americas, sales in the HCB were heavily impacted by  the strong yen. However, the IAB benefited from the recent  increases in the price of crude oil, and sales of local oil- and  gas-related businesses were up accordingly. As a result, net  sales in the Americas rose 0.6%, to 74.8 billion, and operating  income increased 5.4%, to 3.0 billion. Europe  In Europe, the Company faced an increasingly harsh operating  environment, as major countries showed negative growth on a  quarterly basis and in the exchange market the yen continued to  appreciate against the euro. Performance in the HCB was  strong, but sales of certain products in the IAB and EMC were  adversely affected by ongoing inventory adjustment trends. As a  result, net sales in Europe declined 1.1% year on year, to 83.6  billion, and operating income decreased 11.0%, to 3.0 billion. Greater China  In China, while the monetary tightening measures imple- mented by the Chinese government slowed the economy to  a degree, the overall strong growth trend in the market  continued. In this environment, sales of components for the  automobile industry and products for use in mobile telephones  in the EMC were solid, and the HCB made particular notable  contributions to sales. As a result, net sales in the Greater  China region rose 4.2% year on year, to 101.1 billion.  Operating income, however, decreased 26.3%, to 8.4  billion, due to the worsening of the product mix. Regardless  though, the Greater China region still accounted for the  largest portion of the sales and income compared with other  overseas segments. Asia Pacific  In the Asia Pacific region, the impact of the floods in Thailand  was only temporary, and the subsequent reconstruction  demand contributed to higher sales in the IAB. The AEC, HCB,  and other businesses also registered improved performances.  As a result, net sales in the Asia Pacific region increased 4.7%  year on year, to 52.4 billion. Operating income contracted  20.6%, to 4.7%, due to the impacts of natural disasters and  the worsening of product mixes. Financial Condition Assets  Total assets amounted to 537.3 billion at the end of fiscal  2011, representing a decrease of 25.5 billion, or 4.5%,  compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This decrease is  mainly attributable to declines in cash and time deposits and  the result of the redemption of commercial paper as well as  in deferred tax assets. Liabilities and Shareholders Equity  Total liabilities amounted to 215.6 billion, down 33.5  billion from the previous fiscal year-end. This decline is largely  due to lower short-term debt and termination and retirement  benefits.  Total shareholders equity was up 8.1 billion, to 320.8  billion, causing the shareholders equity ratio to rise 4.1  percentage points, to 59.7%, compared with 55.6% at the  end of the previous fiscal year. The debt/equity ratio was  0.675 times, showing improvement from the previous years  0.799 times. Shareholders equity per share was 1,457.51 at  the end of the fiscal year, compared with 1,421.03 per share  at the end of the previous fiscal year. Cash Flows  Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year stood at 45.3 billion, a 29.5 billion decrease from the end of the  previous fiscal year. Cash Flows from Operating Activities  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 31.9  billion, down 10.0 billion from the previous fiscal year. Major  factors included a decline in net income before the deduction  of noncontrolling interests and decreases in notes and  accounts receivable—trade, net, and inventories. Cash Flows from Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities amounted to 26.5  billion, up 6.3 billion from the previous fiscal year. This  advance was the result of increased investments in such  areas as the expansion of production sites and production  facilities. Cash Flows from Financing Activities  Net cash used in financing activities was 33.5 billion,  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of  3.3 billion in the previous fiscal year. Major outflows included  those to repay debt and issue dividend payments.

Note that items referring to the  future reflect the Omron Groups forecasts and assumptions  as of June 22, 2012, the release date of its Yukashoukenhou- kokusho (Annual Securities Report filed under the Financial  Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan). (1) Economic Conditions  The primary businesses of the Omron Group are the Indus- trial Automation Business, Electronic and Mechanical Compo- nents Business, Automotive Electronic Components Business,  Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business, and Health- care Business. Accordingly, demand for Omron Group  products is affected by economic conditions in these markets.  Both in Japan and overseas, therefore, market forces affecting  the product markets in which the Omron Group conducts  business can result in the contraction of demand for its  products, thereby possibly having a negative impact on the  Groups operating results and financial condition. (2) Risks Accompanying Overseas Business Activities  The Omron Group actively conducts such business activi- ties as production and sales in overseas markets. The Group  may be subject to operating difficulties in countries outside  Japan related to possible social unrest due to factors including  differences in culture or religion; political turmoil and uncer- tainty in economic trends; differences in business customs in  areas such as the structure of relationships with local  businesses and the collection of receivables, specific legal  systems and investment regulations; changes in tax systems;  difficulty guaranteeing safety, labor shortages, and problems  in the labor management relationship; and terrorism, wars,  and other political circumstances.  These risks associated with overseas operations may have  a negative impact on the Omron Groups operating results  and financial condition. (3) Exchange Rate Fluctuation  The Omron Group has 116 overseas affiliated companies  and continues to target increased sales in emerging countries,  such as China and other Asian countries, while taking other  steps to reinforce its business operations in overseas  markets. The percentage of consolidated net sales accounted  for by overseas sales during fiscal 2011 was 52.2%, and  Omron expects further increases in the overseas operations  ratio due to factors such as production shifts. The Omron  Group seeks to hedge against exchange rate risk, for example,  by balancing imports and exports denominated in foreign  currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations, however, could have a  negative impact on the Omron Groups operating results and  financial condition. (4) Product Defects  The Omron Group seeks to provide maximum customer  satisfaction by providing the best quality products and  services based on its Quality first principle. Regarding  quality, the Group has established an ISO-certified quality  control system and develops and manufactures its products  in accordance with this system. A Groupwide quality check  system is in place for the ongoing improvement of the quality  of the Groups entire line of products and services.  While Omron takes every precaution against the occur- rence of defects, it has become extremely difficult to  guarantee that defects will not occur (including defects that  arise due to the changing environments in which the products  are used) or that recalls will not occur.  Changing conditions in Japan, such as the establishment of  the Consumer Affairs Agency, have necessitated corporate  responses that pay more attention to consumer protection.  Product quality is also increasingly a major issue overseas.  For this reason, product defects that require large-scale  product recalls or that carry damage beyond the coverage  capability of liability insurance could not only incur substantial  losses for the Group but also seriously damage trust in the  Company and the Omron brand. Such a situation could lead to  declining sales for the Group and has the potential to  negatively impact the Groups financial condition.  The Group also strives to provide Environmental Assurance  Products that do not include banned substances designated  in the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive  enforced by the European Union in July 2006. The Group  is investigating the status of regulated chemical substances  in components and materials and is seeking to use compo- nents and materials that do not contain banned substances.  Since 2009, the Group adheres to the European Unions  Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of  Chemicals (REACH) Regulation concerning the identification  of contained substances. Despite the Groups efforts, the  frequent modifications of the regulations on controlled  substances complicate the supervisory efforts, and it is  possible that infractions could incur, such as failure to comply  with modified regulations. (5) Research and Development Activities  The Omron Group has established technical strategies to  facilitate the development and reinforcement of technologies  from a medium- to long-term perspective and is advancing  research and development (R&D) activities accordingly.  Sensing and control technology is an area in which the  Company is particularly strong; this area represents the  source of our competitive edge. For this reason, we are  focusing R&D expenses on our mainstay Industrial Automa- tion Business and Electronic and Mechanical Components  Business, areas in which we are pursuing the development of  new products and the strengthening of manufacturing  technologies. As a result, the R&D-to-sales ratio remains at  approximately 7%.  The Group conducts R&D activities with the aim of devel- oping new products that meet market needs. However,  it is possible that the anticipated results of these activities  may not be achieved due to delays in R&D plans or a lack of  technological capabilities. It is also possible that the products  created through such R&D activities may not be as successful  in markets as expected. In such cases, the Omron Groups  operating results and financial condition could be adversely  affected. (6) Information Leakage  The Omron Group acquires personal information and classi- fied customer information through its business processes  and acquires important information in the course of business.  The Omron Group is taking steps to reinforce control over the  information the Group handles and to further improve  employees information literacy with the goal of preventing  external entry into its internal information systems and misap- propriation by third parties resulting from theft or loss of that  information. Unanticipated leakage of internal information,  however, due for example to invasion of internal information  systems using technology exceeding implemented security  levels could exert a negative impact on the Omron Groups  operating results and financial condition. (7)  Risks Associated with Patent Rights and   Other Intellectual Property Rights  The Omron Group conducts research on technology devel- oped by other companies and in the public domain in the  course of its R&D and design activities. A very large number  of intellectual property rights exist within the Groups range of  business and products, and new intellectual property rights  are declared on a daily basis. The potential therefore exists  that a third party could present a claim regarding one of the  Groups specific products or components, which could have a  negative impact on the Groups operating results and financial  condition.  When exercising our intellectual property rights during  efforts to resolve issues related to the intellectual property  rights of the Group, disputes with third parties could arise,  such as oppositional tactics from the third party subject to the  exercise of rights.  The Omron Group takes appropriate measures to recognize  and compensate employees for inventions, such as through  the Employee Invention Compensation Program and the  Invention Commendation Program. Disputes regarding the  value of an invention can arise with inventors, including inven- tors who have retired from the Group.  The Omron Group has accumulated technology and exper- tise allowing it to differentiate its products from those of its  competitors. However, the ever-increasing sophistication of  counterfeit product manufacturing and sales methods and  other factors make it virtually impossible to completely  protect all of the Groups proprietary technology and exper- tise in certain regions, including China. The Group implements  strategic measures to protect its intellectual property rights,  but the circulation of low-quality counterfeit items fraudu- lently bearing the Omron brand has the potential to damage  the trust in the Groups products and the Groups brand image  and could have a negative impact on the Groups operating  activities.  Omron has focused on brand management since its incep- tion and in recent years has initiated prompt and appropriate  countermeasures to the use of domain names similar to  Omron that have appeared overseas. Identifying and taking  action against all such fraudulent domain names that have  been registered is virtually impossible. The danger exists that  the same or a similar name to Omron could be used in a  fraudulent business transaction that could damage the trust  in the Group. (8) Natural Disasters  The Omron Group has implemented the necessary safety  measures and taken steps to facilitate the continuity and  early restoration of business operations in the case of a  natural disaster, fire, or other calamity, including a large-scale  earthquake in Japans Tokai, Tonankai, or Tokyo metropolitan  areas, and has implemented preventive measures for other  types of emergency situations, such as a worldwide outbreak  of a new form of influenza virus.  The Group and its business clients maintain operating bases  in Japan and around the world, making it virtually impossible to  completely avoid the risks that would arise from an unfore- seen natural disaster, fire, or other calamity. A major event of  an unforeseen scale could impact Group operations, such as  limiting its ability to carry out production and business activi- ties. Events such as the above could have a negative impact  on the Groups operating results and financial condition. (9) Raw Material Shortages and Provision Price Rises  It is absolutely essential to the Groups manufacturing  activities to obtain raw materials and parts of sufficient quality  in a timely manner and in necessary quantities. Therefore, we  stringently select suppliers from a reliability standpoint.  However, if one of the following supply issues were to arise  and we were to have difficulty changing suppliers, securing  additional suppliers, or switching to different parts under such  conditions, the Groups performance could be adversely  affected. 	 	The	supply	chain	is	significantly	disrupted	due	to	an	unfore- seen natural disaster or accident. 	 	The	deterioration	of	the	management	situation	at	a	supplier	 resulted in reduced or halted supply of materials or parts. 	 Market	demand	increased.  Further, while the Group has concluded contracts with  suppliers to fix provision prices, if increased demand in  emerging countries or an influx of capital into these countries  were to result in a rise in the prices of petrochemicals, steel,  silver, copper, rare earths, or other raw materials, it could  impact manufacturing costs.  Certain raw materials and parts can only be procured from  specific suppliers. According, events such as the above could  have a negative impact on the Groups operating results and  financial condition. (10) Environmental Laws and Regulations  The Group must comply with a wide variety of environ- mental laws and regulations, including those related to  climate change, air and water pollution, hazardous substances,  waste, product recycling, and the contamination of soil and  groundwater. These laws and regulations not only apply to the  Omron Groups current business activities but may also be  retroactively applied to past business activities or the past  activities of businesses transferred from other companies  through acquisition or some other means. It is possible that  compliance with future environmental laws and regulations or  efforts to improve the environmental soundness of opera- tions could result in a rise in expenses related to the environ- ment, which could subsequently have an adverse effect on  the Groups operating results and financial condition.

CONTENTS Financial Section (U.S. GAAP) Internal Control Section To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information  102 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 103 Nature of Operations  OMRON Corporation (the Company) is a multinational  manufacturer of automation components, equipment and  systems with advanced computer, communications, and control  technologies.

Basis of Financial Statements  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are stated  in Japanese yen. Based upon requirements for depositary receipts  issued in Europe, they are presented in accordance with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts previously  reported in order to conform to classifications as of and for the  year ended March 31, 2012. Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of  the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Companies).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been  eliminated in consolidation.  Investments, in which the Companies have a 20% to 50%  interest (affiliates), are accounted for using the equity method.  The consolidated financial statements include all the Companys  subsidiaries (153 and 152 companies at March 31, 2012 and 2011,  respectively). Application of Equity Method  Investments in the Companys affiliated companies are accounted  for using the equity method.   Affiliated companies recorded on the equity method as of  March 31:  2012  — Hitachi-Omron Terminal Solutions, Corp. and others.  Total: 12 companies  2011  — Hitachi-Omron Terminal Solutions, Corp. and others.  Total: 14 companies Differing Fiscal Year Ends  Certain subsidiaries have different fiscal year ends from that of  the Company and respective fiscal year end financial statements  of those subsidiaries were used for the purpose of the Companys  consolidation. For the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011,  difference in fiscal year ends between certain subsidiaries and the  Company did not have a material effect on the Companys consol- idated financial statements. use of Estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of  America requires management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclo- sure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consoli- dated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues  and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ  from those estimates. Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with  original maturities of three months or less, including time deposits,  commercial paper, and securities purchased with resale agree- ments and money market instruments. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements OMRON Corporation and Subsidiaries Allowance for Doubtful Receivables  An allowance for doubtful receivables is established in amounts  considered to be appropriate based primarily upon the Compa- nies past credit loss experience and an evaluation of potential  losses within the outstanding receivables. Marketable Securities and Investments  The Companies classify all of their marketable equity and debt  securities as available for sale. Available-for-sale securities are  carried at market value with the corresponding recognition of net  unrealized holding gains and losses as a separate component of  accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related  taxes, until recognized. If necessary, individual securities classi- fied as available for sale are reduced to fair value by a charge to  income in the period in which the decline is deemed to be other  than temporary. Available-for-sale securities are reviewed for  other-than-temporary declines in the carrying amount based on  criteria that include the length of time and the extent to which the  market value has been less than cost, the financial condition, and  near-term prospects of the issuer and the Companys intent and  ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to  allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.  Other investments are stated at the lower of cost or estimated  net realizable value. The cost of securities sold is determined on  the average cost basis. Inventories  Domestic inventories are mainly stated at the lower of cost,  determined by the first-in, first-out method, or market value. Also,  overseas inventories are mainly stated at the lower of cost, deter- mined by the moving-average method, or market value. Property, Plant, and Equipment  Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation  of property, plant, and equipment has been computed principally on  a declining-balance method based upon the estimated useful lives  of the assets. However, certain of the Companys subsidiaries  located outside Japan have computed depreciation using a straight- line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The estimated useful lives primarily range from 3 to 50 years for  buildings and from 2 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.  Depreciation expense was 19,165 million ($233,720 thousand),  19,095 million, and  22,239 million for the years ended March  31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  The Companies account for their goodwill and other intangible  assets in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board  (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 350,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which requires that goodwill no  longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least  annually. ASC No. 350 also requires recognized intangible assets be  amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed  for impairment. Any recognized intangible asset determined to have  an indefinite useful life is not to be amortized, but instead tested for  impairment until its life is determined to be no longer indefinite. Long-Lived Assets  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events  or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an  asset might be unrecoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held  and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an  asset to undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the  asset. If such assets are considered to be potentially impaired, the  impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which  the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value. Assets to  be disposed of other than by sale are considered held and used until  disposed. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower  of the carrying amount or fair value, less selling costs. Advertising Costs  Advertising costs are charged to earnings as incurred. Advertising  expense was 5,908 million ($72,049 thousand), 5,701 million,  and  4,957 million for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011, and  2010, respectively, and are included in selling, general, and admin- istrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and Handling Charges  Shipping and handling charges were 7,066 million ($86,171  thousand), 7,125 million, and 6,005 million for the years ended  March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, and are included in  selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated  statements of operations. Termination and Retirement Benefits  Termination and retirement benefits are accounted for and are  disclosed in accordance with ASC No. 715, Compensation- Retirement Benefits, based on the fiscal year end fair value of  plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of employees.  The provision for termination and retirement benefits includes  amounts for directors and corporate auditors of the Companies. Income Taxes  Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future  years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities  and their financial reporting amounts, operating loss carryforwards,  and tax credit carryforwards. Future tax benefits, such as net  operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, are  recognized to the extent that such benefits are more likely than not  to be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a  change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that  includes the enactment date.  Based on available information at the reporting date, and  considering a more likely than not threshold, tax benefit related to  tax position was recognized.  The Company and certain domestic subsidiaries compute  current income taxes based on consolidated taxable income as  permitted by Japanese tax regulations. 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies CONTENTS Financial Section (U.S. GAAP) Internal Control Section To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information  104 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 105 Consumption Taxes and Other Value-Added Taxes  Consumption taxes and other value-added taxes have been  excluded from sales and are shown net included in other receivables. Product Warranties  Liability for estimated warranty-related cost is established at  the time revenue is recognized and is included in other current  liabilities. The liability is established using historical information,  including the nature, frequency, and average costs of past  warranty claims. Derivatives  Derivative instruments and hedging activities are accounted for  in accordance with ASC No. 815, Derivatives and Hedging. This  standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for deriv- ative instruments and for hedging activities and requires that an  entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the  consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at  fair value.  For foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency  swaps, interest rate swaps, and commodities swaps, on the date  the derivative contract is entered into, the Companies designate  the derivative as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the  variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recog- nized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). The Companies  formally document all relationships between hedging instruments  and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and  strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process  includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow  hedges to specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated  balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted  transactions. Based on the Companies policy, all foreign exchange  forward contracts, foreign currency swaps, interest rate swaps,  and commodities swaps entered into must be highly effective in  offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.  Changes in fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and  that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded  in other comprehensive income (loss) until earnings are affected  by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item.  Cash Dividends  Cash dividends are reflected in the consolidated financial state- ments at proposed amounts in the year to which they are appli- cable, even though payment is not approved by shareholders until  the annual general meeting of shareholders held early in the  following fiscal year. Resulting dividends payable are included in  other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Revenue Recognition  The Companies recognize revenue when persuasive evidence  of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title and risk  of loss have transferred, the sales price is fixed or determinable,  and collectibility is probable. Stock-Based Compensation  The Companies apply ASC No. 718, Compensation-Stock  Compensation, and recognize stock-based compensation cost  measured by the fair value method.  Translation of financial statement items of the Companys  subsidiaries located outside Japan into Japanese yen  Consolidated financial statements of the Companys subsid- iaries located outside Japan are translated based upon ASC No.  830, Foreign Currency Matters. Assets and liabilities of the  subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of  exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense  items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing  during the year. Gains and losses resulting from translation of  financial statements are reported in accumulated other compre- hensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive Income (Loss)  The Companies apply ASC No. 220, Comprehensive Income.  Comprehensive income (loss) is composed of net income (loss)  attributable to shareholders, changes in foreign currency transla- tion adjustments, changes in pension liability adjustments,  changes in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities  and changes in net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, and  comprehensive income (loss) is disclosed within the consolidated  statements of comprehensive income (loss). New Accounting Standards  In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards  Update No. 2011-8, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):  Testing Goodwill for Impairment.  ASU No. 2011-8 gives companies the option to perform a quali- tative assessment to first assess whether the fair value of a  reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity deter- mines that the carrying value of the reporting unit is more likely  than not less than its fair value, then performing further impair- ment test becomes unnecessary. ASU No. 2011-8 is effective for  fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The adoption  of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our  consolidated financial statements. 2. Translation into u.S. Dollars  The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese  yen, the currency of the country in which the Company is incorpo- rated and operates. The translation of Japanese yen amounts into  U.S. dollar amounts is included solely for convenience of the  readers outside of Japan and has been made at the rate of 82 to  $1, the approximate rate of exchange at March 31, 2012. Such  translation should not be construed as representations that the  Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at the  above or any other rate. 3.

Based on this fact and other relevant factors, management has determined that these investments are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired. 5. Notes and accounts receivables  The companies have entered into different types of transactions with affiliated companies through the ordinary course of  business.  The amount of accounts receivable with affiliates resulting from these transactions was 2,484 million ($30,393 thousand) for  the year ended March 31, 2012. 6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   The components of acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, at March 31, 2012 and 2011, were as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars 2012 2011 2012 Gross amount Accumulated  amortization Gross amount Accumulated  amortization Gross amount Accumulated  amortization Intangible assets subject to amortization:  Software 34,618 27,316  35,060  26,771 $422,171  $333,122   Other 4,191 1,530 2,554 1,622 51,109 18,658 Total 38,809 28,846  37,614  28,393 $473,280  $351,780   Aggregate amortization expense related to intangible assets was 3,462 million ($42,220 thousand), 3,889 million, and  4,775 million for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Gross realized gains on sales were 318 million ($3,878 thousand),  20 million, and 592 million for the years ended March 31, 2012,  2011, and 2010, respectively.  There were no realized losses on sales for the year ended  March 31, 2012 and 2010. Realized losses on sales were 3  million for the years ended March 31, 2011.  Losses on impairment of available-for-sale securities recog- nized to reflect declines in market value considered to be other  than temporary were 384 million ($4,683 thousand), 790  million, and 517 million for the years ended March 31, 2012,  2011, and 2010, respectively.  Aggregate cost of nonmarketable equity securities accounted  for under the cost method totaled 4,514 million ($55,049  thousand) and 4,489 million at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respec- tively. Investments with an aggregate cost of 4,510 million  ($55,000 thousand) and 4,489 million at March 31, 2012 and  2011, respectively, were not evaluated for impairment because (a)  the Companies did not estimate the fair value of those invest- ments as it was not practicable to do so and (b) the Companies  did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that  might have had a significant adverse effect on the fair value of  those investments.

Impairment loss on Long-lived Assets  In accordance with ASC No. 360, Property, Plant and Equip- ment, the Companies recognized impairment losses on long- lived assets for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 of 534  million ($6,512 thousand) for impairment of property plant and  equipment due to decreasing profitability in the semiconductor- related business in other, and 137 million ($1,671 thousand)  for impairment of office building due to its uncertainty of usage  since one of our subsidiaries relocated its head office.  The Companies recognized impairment losses on long-lived  assets for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, of 96 million  and 317 million in automotive electronic component business  and other, respectively.  These impairment losses are included in Other expenses,  net of consolidated statements of income. Each of the fair value of these reporting units was estimated by  using their each present value of expected future cash flows.  In accordance with ASC No. 350, the Companies recognized impairment losses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, of  2,009 million ($24,500 thousand) in other. Due to the increasing competition in the backlight business market, the fair value of the  associated reporting unit decreased. The impairment losses are included in Other expenses, net of the consolidated financial  statements of income. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated by using the present value of expected future cash flows. 9. Leases  The Companies do not have any material capital lease  agreements.  The Companies have operating lease agreements primarily  involving offices and equipment for varying periods. Generally   leases that expire are expected to be renewed or replaced by  other leases. At March 31, 2012, future minimum lease payments  applicable to noncancelable leases having initial or remaining  noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows: 10. Termination and Retirement Benefits  The Company and its domestic subsidiaries sponsor termi- nation and retirement benefit plans which cover substantially  all domestic employees (the funded contributory termina- tion and retirement plan in Japan). Benefits were based on a  point-based benefits system, under which benefits are calcu- lated based on accumulated points awarded to employees  each year according to their job classification and performance.   If the termination is involuntary, the employee is usually  entitled to greater payments than in the case of voluntary  termination.  The Company and its domestic subsidiaries fund a portion  of the obligation under these plans. The general funding policy  is to contribute amounts computed in accordance with  actuarial methods acceptable under Japanese tax law.  8.

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior-service benefit that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive  income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost for the year ending March 31, 2013, are summarized as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars Net actuarial loss  3,251 $ 39,646  Prior-service cost (1,853) $(22,598) Measurement Date  The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries use March 31 as the measurement date for projected benefit obligation  and plan assets of the termination and retirement benefits. Assumptions  Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at March 31, 2012 and 2011, are as follows: 2012 2011 Discount rate 2.0% 2.0% Compensation increase rate 2.0% 2.0%  Weighted-average assumptions used to determine termination and retirement benefit costs for the years ended March 31,  2012, 2011, and 2010 are as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Discount rate 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% Compensation increase rate 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 3.0% 3.0% 3.0%  The expected return on plan assets is determined by estimating the future rate of return on each category of plan assets  considering actual historical returns and current economic trends and conditions. Plan assets  The Companys investment policies are designed to ensure  that adequate plan assets are available to provide future  payments of pension benefits to eligible participants. Taking  into account the expected long-term rate of return on plan  assets, the Company formulates a model portfolio composed  of the optimal combination of equity and debt securities in  order to yield a total return that will match the expected return  on a mid-term to long-term basis.  The Company evaluates the gap between long-term  expected return and actual return of invested plan assets to  determine if such differences necessitate a revision in the  formulation of the model portfolio. In the event that the  Company determines the need for a revision of the model  portfolio to accomplish the expected long-term rate of return  on plan assets, the Company revises the model portfolio to  the extent necessary.  Target allocation of plan assets is 20% equity securities,  69% debt securities and life insurance general account  assets, and 11% other. Equity securities are mainly composed  of stocks that are listed on various securities exchanges. The  Company has investigated the business condition of investee  companies and appropriately diversified the equity invest- ments by type of industry, brand, and other relevant factors.  Debt securities are primarily composed of government bonds,  public debt instruments, and corporate bonds.

Benefit Payments  The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid: Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars Years ending March 31  2013  6,668 $ 81,317   2014 6,935 84,573  2015 7,270 88,659  2016 7,057 86,061  2017 7,168 87,415  2018—2022 39,105 476,890  Certain employees of European subsidiaries are covered by  a defined benefit pension plan. The projected benefit obliga- tion for the plan and related fair value of plan assets were  4,672 million ($56,976 thousand) and 3,844 million ($46,878  thousand), respectively, at March 31, 2012, and 3,424 million  and 2,872 million, respectively, at March 31, 2011.  The Companies also have unfunded noncontributory termi- nation plans administered by the Companies. These plans  provide lump-sum termination benefits which are paid at the  earlier of the employees termination or mandatory retirement  age, except for payments to directors and corporate auditors  which require approval by the shareholders before payment.  The Companies record provisions for termination benefits  sufficient to state the liability equal to the plans vested  benefits, which exceed the plans projected benefit obliga- tions.  The aggregate liability for the termination plans, excluding  the funded contributory termination and retirement plan in  Japan, as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, was 3,845 million  ($46,890 thousand) and 4,450 million, respectively. The aggre- gate net periodic benefit cost for such plans for the years ended  March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, was 574 million ($7,000  thousand), 346 million, and 515 million, respectively. 11. Shareholders Equity  Japanese companies are subject to Japanese Corporate  Law (the Corporate Law).  The Corporate Law requires that all shares of common stock  be issued with no par value and at least 50% of the issue price  of new shares is required to be recorded as common stock  while the remaining net proceeds are required to be presented  as additional paid-in capital, which is included in capital surplus.  The Corporate Law permits Japanese companies, upon  approval of the board of directors, to issue shares to existing  shareholders without consideration by way of a stock split.  Such issuance of shares generally does not give rise to changes  within the shareholders accounts.  The Corporate Law also requires that an amount equal to  10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve or as  additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus)  depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of  such dividends until the total of aggregate amount of legal  reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the  common stock. Under the Corporate Law, the total amount of  additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed   without limitation of such threshold. The Corporate Law also  provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in  capital, other capital surplus, and retained earnings can be  transferred among the accounts under certain conditions upon  resolution of the shareholders.  The Corporate Law also provides for companies to purchase  treasury stock and dispose of such treasury stock by resolution  of the board of directors. The amount of treasury stock  purchased cannot exceed the amount available for distribution  to the shareholders which is determined by a specific formula.  Under the Corporate Law, companies can pay dividends at  any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end  dividend upon resolution at the shareholders meeting. For  companies that meet certain criteria, such as; (1) having the  board of directors; (2) having independent auditors; (3) having  the Board of Corporate Auditors; and (4) the term of service of  the directors is prescribed as one year rather than two years of  normal term by its articles of incorporation, the board of direc- tors may declare dividends (except for dividends in kind) if the  company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation.

Under the above-mentioned plan, the exercise price of each  option exceeded the market price of the Companys common   stock on the date of grant and the options expire five years  after the date of the grant. Generally, options become fully  vested and exercisable after two years. A summary of the  Companys fixed stock option plan activity and related informa- tion for the year ended March 31, 2012, are as follows: Unit: Yen Fixed options Shares (number) Weighted-average  exercise price Weighted-average fair  value of options granted  during the year Options outstanding at March 31, 2009 838,000 2,930  Granted — —  —  Exercised — —  Expired (179,000) 2,580 Options outstanding at March 31, 2010 659,000 3,026  Granted — —  —  Exercised — —  Expired (205,000) 2,550 Options outstanding at March 31, 2011 454,000 3,240  Granted — —  —  Exercised — —  Expired (217,000) 3,031 Options outstanding at March 31, 2012 237,000 3,432  Options exercisable at March 31, 2012 237,000 3,432 Unit: U.S. dollars Fixed options Shares (number) Weighted-average  exercise price Weighted-average fair  value of options granted  during the year Options outstanding at March 31, 2011 454,000 $39.51   Granted — — $ —  Exercised — —  Expired (217,000) 36.96 Options outstanding at March 31, 2012 237,000 $41.85  Options exercisable at March 31, 2012 237,000 $41.85   The fixed stock options at March 31, 2012 are as follows: Shares (number) Weighted-average  remaining  contractual life  Range of exercise prices Weighted-average exercise price Yen U.S. dollars Yen U.S. dollars Options outstanding 237,000 0.25 years 3,432 $41.85  3,432 $41.85  Options exercisable 237,000 0.25 years 3,432 $41.85  3,432 $41.85   No fixed stock options were granted for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010.  The Black-Scholes option-pricing model used by the  Company was developed for use in estimating the fair value  of fully tradable options, which have no vesting restrictions  and are fully transferable. Additionally, option valuation models  require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including  the expected stock price volatility. It is managements opinion  that the Companys stock options have characteristics signifi- cantly different from those of traded options and because  changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate, the existing models do not  necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value  of its stock options.  There was no cash received from exercise of options under  the plan for the year ended March 31, 2012. When options are  exercised, the Company reissues its treasury stock. 12.

Semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year  upon resolution of the board of directors if it is stipulated by  the articles of incorporation of the company. Under the Corpo- rate Law, certain limitations were imposed on the amount of  capital surplus and retained earnings available for dividends.  The Corporate Law also provides certain limitations on the  amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury  stock. The limitation is defined as the amount available for  distribution to the shareholders, but the amount of net assets  after dividends must be maintained at no less than 3 million.  Such amount available for the dividends under the Corporate  Law was 58,699 million ($715,841 thousand) at March 31,  2012, based on the amount recorded in the Companys  general book of accounts.

The Company has not provided for Japanese income taxes  on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to the  extent that they are believed to be indefinitely reinvested. The  accumulated unremitted earnings of the foreign subsidiaries  which the Company has not recognized deferred tax liabilities  were 88,417 million ($1,078,256 thousand) and 78,769  million at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Dividends  received from domestic subsidiaries are expected to be  substantially free of tax.  The Companies have adopted ASC No. 740, Income Taxes.  The Companies believe that the total amount of unrecognized  tax benefits as of March 31, 2012, is not material to its result  of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.  The Companies recognize interest and penalties accrued  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes in the  consolidated statements of income.  The Companies file income tax returns in Japanese and  foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, tax examinations in  Japan, for years prior to March 31, 2009, have been finished.  With few exceptions, tax examinations in foreign countries,  for years prior to March 31, 2003, have been finished. 14. Per Share Data  The Company accounts for its net income per share in  accordance with ASC No. 260, Earnings per share. Basic net  income per share has been computed by dividing net income  available to common shareholders by the weighted-average  number of common shares outstanding during each year.  Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution of   convertible bonds and stock options and has been computed  by the if-converted method for convertible bonds and by  the treasury stock method for stock options.  A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the  basic and diluted net income per share computations as of  March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, was as follows: CONTENTS Financial Section (U.S. GAAP) Internal Control Section To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information  118 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 119 Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars  Numerator 2012 2011 2010 2012  Net income attributable to Shareholders 16,389 26,782 3,518 $199,866   Diluted Net income attributable to shareholders 16,389 26,782 3,518 $199,866  Denominator 2012 2011 2010  Weighted-average common shares outstanding 220,093,275 220,131,599 220,158,389  Dilutive effect of:   Stock options — — —  Diluted common shares outstanding 220,093,275 220,131,599 220,158,389 15.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, of the Companies financial instruments are  as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars 2012 2011 2012 Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value Derivatives  Included in other current assets (liabilities)   Forward exchange contracts (703) (703) (340) (340) $(8,573) $(8,573)   Foreign currency swaps (16) (16) (27) (27) (195) (195)   Commodities swaps — — 198  198  — —  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of each class of financial instruments for which  it is practicable to estimate its value: Nonderivatives (1)  Cash and cash equivalents, notes and accounts receivable,  short-term debt, and notes and accounts payable:    The carrying amounts approximate fair values. (2)  Investment securities (see Note 4):     The fair values are estimated based on quoted market prices  or dealer quotes for marketable securities or similar instru- ments. Certain equity securities included in investments  have no readily determinable public market value and it is not  practicable to estimate their fair values. Derivatives  The fair value of derivatives generally reflects the estimated  amounts that the Companies would receive or pay to termi- nate the contracts at the reporting date, thereby taking  into account the current unrealized gains or losses of open  contracts. Dealer quotes are available for most of the  Companies derivatives. For the rest of the Companies deriv- atives, pricing or valuation models are applied to current  market information to estimate fair value. The Companies do  not use derivatives for trading purposes. 18. Derivatives and Hedging Activities  The Companies enter into foreign exchange forward  contracts and combined purchased and written foreign  currency swaps to hedge changes in foreign currency rates  (primarily the U.S. dollar and the euro). The Companies enter  into interest rate swaps to hedge changes in interest rates.  The Companies enter into commodities swaps to hedge  changes in prices of commodities, including copper and silver  used in the manufacturing of various products. The Companies  do not use derivatives for trading purposes. The Companies  are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by  counterparties to derivatives, but management considers the  exposure to such risk to be minimal since the counterparties  maintain good credit ratings.  Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward  contracts, and foreign currency swaps designated and quali- fying as cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other  comprehensive income (loss). These amounts are subse- quently reclassified into other expenses, net, in the same  period as and when the hedged items affect earnings. Changes  in the fair value of commodities swaps designated and quali- fying as cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other  comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassi- fied into cost of sales, net, in the same period as and when the  hedged items affect earnings. Substantially, all of the accumu- lated other comprehensive income (loss) in relation to foreign  exchange forward contracts, foreign currency swaps, and  commodities swaps at March 31, 2012, is expected to be  reclassified into earnings within 12 months.  The notional amounts of outstanding contracts to exchange foreign currencies at March 31, 2012 and 2011, were as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars 2012 2011 2012 Forward exchange contracts 49,095 43,184 $598,720  Foreign currency swaps  1,200  1,200 $ 14,634  Commodities swaps      —  1,307 $      — CONTENTS Financial Section (U.S. GAAP) Internal Control Section To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information  122 Omron Corporation Integrated Report  2012 123  The fair values of derivatives at March 31, 2012 and 2011, were as follows: Derivatives designated as hedges Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars Assets 2012 2011 2012 Forward exchange contracts 394 254 $4,805  Commodities swaps   —  213 $    — Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars Liabilities 2012 2011 2012 Forward exchange contracts (1,096) (594) $(13,366) Foreign currency swaps    (16)  (27) $   (195) Commodities swaps      —  (15) $     —  The effects on consolidated statements of operations for the year ended March 31, 2012, were as follows: Derivatives designated as hedges Profit and loss of other  comprehensive income (loss)  (hedge effective portion) Transfer from other comprehensive  income (loss) to profit and loss  (hedge effective portion) Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars Cash flow hedge 2012 Forward exchange contracts   6 $  73    89 $ 1,085  Foreign currency swaps   8 $  98     0 $     0  Commodities swaps (11) $(134) (146) $(1,780)  The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was not material.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants  in several pending lawsuits. However, based upon the infor- mation currently available to both the Company and its legal  counsel, management of the Company believes that damages  from such lawsuits, if any, would not have a material effect on  the consolidated financial statements. Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Compa- nies to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of  short-term cash investments and trade receivables. The  Companies place their short-term cash investments with high  credit quality financial institutions. Concentrations of credit  risk with respect to trade receivables, as approximately 48%  of total sales are concentrated in Japan, are limited due to the  large number of well-established customers and their disper- sion across many industries. The Company normally requires  customers to deposit funds to serve as security for ongoing  credit sales. Guarantees  The Company provides guarantees for bank loans of other  companies. The guarantees for the other companies are  made to ensure that those companies operate with less  finance costs. The maximum payment in the event of default  at March 31, 2012 and 2011, is 185 million ($2,256 thousand)  and 246 million, respectively. The carrying amount of the  liability recognized under those guarantees at March 31, 2012  is immaterial. Cost for Environmental Remediation  The Companies record an environmental remediation  accrual when the probability of the accrual is probable and the  amount can reasonably be estimated. As of March 31, 2012,  the environmental remediation accrual is 567 million ($6,915  thousand). Product Warranties  The Companies issue contractual product warranties under  which they generally guarantee the performance of products  delivered and services rendered for a certain period or term.  Changes in accrued product warranty cost for the years ended  March 31, 2012 and 2011, are summarized as follows: 20. Fair Value Measurements  ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date. ASC  No. 820 establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that  prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value as follows: Level 1 —  Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 —  Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabil- ities in active markets, quoted prices for identical  or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are  not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are  observable, and inputs that are derived principally  from or corroborated by observable market data by  correlation or other means. Level 3 —  Inputs are significant to measure fair value of  assets or liabilities and unobservable.

Segment Information Operating segment information  ASC No. 280, Segment Reporting, establishes the disclosure  of information about operating segments in financial state- ments. Operating segments are defined as components of an  enterprise about which separate financial information is avail- able that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision  maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing  performance. The operating segments are determined based  on the nature of the products and services offered.  The Company discloses five operating segments: Indus- trial Automation Business, Electronic and Mechanical  Components Business, Automotive Electronic Components  Business, Social Systems Solution and Service Business,  and Healthcare Business. These segments are mainly  separated based on the Companies consideration of their  lines of business and size within the consolidation. The  Company presents operating segments other than the above  five segments in Other.  The primary products included in each segment are as  follows: (1)  Industrial Automation Business: Sensors, programmable  logic controllers, timers, vision sensors, automated optical  inspection devices, safety components, temperature  controllers, and motion controllers. (2)  Electronic and Mechanical Components Business: Relays,  switches, components, and units for amusement devices,  connectors, and combination jogs.

Independent Auditors Report To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of OMRON Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of OMRON Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as  of March 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2012, all expressed in Japanese yen. These  financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these  financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements  are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for  designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also  includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the  accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of OMRON Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their  cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted in the United States of America. Our audits also comprehended the translation of Japanese yen amounts into United States dollar amounts and, in our opinion,  such translation has been made in conformity with the basis stated in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Such  United States dollar amounts are presented solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan.

In an assessment of ICFR under PCAOB, there is no such detailed guidance. Accordingly,  regarding the scope of assessment of internal control over business processes, we selected locations and business units to be tested based  on annual consolidated net sales (after the elimination of transactions between consolidated companies), and companies with net sales of  approximately two-thirds of the total amount on a consolidation basis were selected as "significant locations and/or business units." At selected  "significant locations and/or business units," we included in the scope of assessment, business processes leading to sales, accounts receivable  and inventories as significant accounts that may have a material impact on our business objectives. Further, in addition to selected significant  locations and/or business units, we also included in the scope of assessment, as business processes having greater materiality, business  processes relating to (i) greater likelihood of material misstatements and/or (ii) significant accounts involving estimates and the managements  judgment and/or (iii) a business or operation dealing with high-risk transactions, taking into account their impact on the financial reporting.

Managements Report on Internal Control 1. Matters relating to the basic framework for internal control  over financial reporting  Yoshihito Yamada, President and Chief Executive Officer; and  Takayoshi Oue, Senior General Manager of the Accounting and  Finance Center, Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer are  responsible for designing and operating effective internal control  over financial reporting of Omron Corporation (the "Company")  and have designed and operated internal control over financial  reporting in accordance with the basic framework for internal  control set forth in "The Standards and Practice Standards for  Management Assessment and Audit Concerning Internal Control  Over Financial Reporting (Council Opinion)" released by the  Business Accounting Council.  The internal control is designed to achieve its objectives to the  extent reasonable through the effective function and combination  of its basic elements. Therefore, there is a possibility that  misstatements may not be completely prevented or detected by  internal control over financial reporting. 2. Matters relating to the scope of assessment, the basis date  of assessment and the assessment procedures  The assessment of internal control over financial reporting was  performed as of March 31, 2012 which is the end of this fiscal  year. The assessment was performed in accordance with assess- ment standards for internal control over financial reporting gener- ally accepted in Japan.  In conducting this assessment, we evaluated internal controls  which may have a material effect on our entire financial reporting  on a consolidation basis ("entity-level controls") and based on the  results of this assessment, we selected business processes to  be tested. We analyzed these selected business processes,  identified key controls that may have a material impact on the  reliability of the Companys financial reporting, and assessed the  design and operation of these key controls. These procedures  have allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of the internal  controls of the Company.  We determined the required scope of assessment of internal  control over financial reporting for the Company, as well as its  consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliated compa- nies, from the perspective of the materiality that may affect the  reliability of their financial reporting. The materiality that may  affect the reliability of the financial reporting is determined by  taking into account the materiality of quantitative and qualitative  impacts on financial reporting. In light of the results of assess- ment of entity-level controls conducted for the Company and its  consolidated subsidiaries, we reasonably determined the scope  of assessment of internal controls over business processes.  Consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliated compa- nies determined to have an insignificant quantitative and qualita- tive influence on the reliability of financial reporting are not  included in the scope of assessment of entity-level controls.  Regarding the scope of assessment of internal control over  business processes, we selected locations and business units to  be tested based on the previous years consolidated net sales  (after the elimination of transactions between consolidated  companies), and the companies whose net sales reaches  two-thirds of total amount on a consolidation basis were selected  as "significant locations and/or business units." At selected "signif- icant locations and/or business units," we included in the scope of  assessment, business processes leading to sales, accounts  receivable and inventories as significant accounts that may have  a material impact on the business objectives of the Company.  Further, in addition to selected significant locations and/or  business units, we also included in the scope of assessment, as  business processes having greater materiality, business  processes relating to (i) greater likelihood of material misstate- ments and/or (ii) significant accounts involving estimates and the  managements judgment and/or (iii) a business or operation  dealing with high-risk transactions, taking into account their  impact on the financial reporting. 3. Matters relating to the results of the assessment  The above assessments determined that the Companys  internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the last  day of the fiscal year under review. 4. Additional notes  No material items to report. 5. Special notes  No material items to report.

June 22, 2012 Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC  Designated Unlimited Liability Partner, Engagement Partner, Certified Public Accountant: Kazuyasu Yamada Designated Unlimited Liability Partner, Engagement Partner, Certified Public Accountant: Kenichi Takai Designated Unlimited Liability Partner, Engagement Partner, Certified Public Accountant: Hiroaki Sakai Audit of Financial Statements   Pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 193-2 of the Financial Instru- ments and Exchange Act, we have audited the consolidated financial  statements included in the Financial Section, namely, the consolidated  balance sheet, and the related consolidated statements of income,  comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity and cash flows of  OMRON Corporation (the Company) and its consolidated subsidiaries  for the fiscal year from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012 , and the related  notes, and consolidated supplementary schedules. Managements Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial  Statements   Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of  these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in  the United States of America pursuant to  the third paragraph of the Supplementary Provisions of the Cabinet Office  Ordinance for Partial Amendment of the Regulations for Terminology,  Forms and Preparation Methods of Consolidated Financial Statements  (No.11 of the Cabinet Office Ordinance in 2002), and for such internal  control as management determines is necessary to enable the prepara- tion of consolidated financial statements that are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors Responsibility   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated  financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in  accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reason- able assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements  are free from material misstatement.   An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence  about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial state- ments. The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgment,  including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the  consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In  making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control  relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of the consoli- dated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing  an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control. An audit  also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by  management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the  consolidated financial statements.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.   Audit Opinion   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to  above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of  OMRON Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31,  2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the  year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted in Japan. Audit of Internal Control   Pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 193-2 of the Financial  Instruments and Exchange Act, we have audited managements report  on internal control over financial reporting of OMRON Corporation as of  March 31, 2012. Managements Responsibility for the Report on Internal Control   Management is responsible for designing and operating effective  internal control over financial reporting and for the preparation and fair  presentation of its report on internal control in conformity with assess- ment standards for internal control over financial reporting generally  accepted in Japan. There is a possibility that misstatements may not be  completely prevented or detected by internal control over financial  reporting. Auditors Responsibility   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements report  on internal control based on our internal control audit. We conducted  our internal control audit in accordance with auditing standards for  internal control over financial reporting generally accepted in Japan.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether managements report on internal  control is free from material misstatement.    An internal control audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence about the results of the assessment of internal control  over financial reporting in managements report on internal control. The  procedures selected depend on the auditors judgment, including the  significance of effects on reliability of financial reporting. An internal  control audit includes examining representations on the scope, proce- dures and results of the assessment of internal control over financial  reporting made by management, as well as evaluating the overall  presentation of managements report on internal control.     We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion   In our opinion, managements report on internal control over financial  reporting referred to above, which represents that the internal control  over financial reporting of OMRON Corporation as of March 31, 2012 is  effectively maintained, presents fairly, in all material respects, the  results of the assessment of internal control over financial reporting in  conformity with assessment standards for internal control over financial  reporting generally accepted in Japan.
