These include Gray Ordinary Portland Cement, White  Portland Cement, Masonry or Mortar, Oil-well Cement, and Blended Cement.  The main ingredient in ready-mix concrete, cement is created by combining finely ground  clinker with gypsum and other chemical additives. The clinker results from the calcination at  1,450C of a mix of limestone, clay, and iron ore.  AGGREGATES Aggregates—comprising materials such as stone, sand, and gravel—are an indispensable in- gredient in ready-mix concrete, asphalt, and mortar. They account for approximately 60 to 75  percent of ready-mix concretes volume and, therefore, strongly influence concretes freshly  mixed and hardened properties.  Our customers use our aggregates for a wide array of applications: as a key component in  the construction and maintenance of highways, walkways, parking lots, airport runways, and  railways; for drainage, water filtration, purification, and erosion control; as fill material; sand  for golf course bunkers, beaches, playing field surfaces, horse racing tracks, and related ap- plications; and to build bridges, homes, and schools, among many other applications.  READY-MIX CONCRETE Concrete, made from a mixture of cement, aggregates, water, and admixtures, is quite ver- satile, can be cast into many different shapes, and is durable. Increasingly, it is also seen as a  fundamental component of sustainable construction. We constantly work to develop innovative solutions that advance the sustainability of struc- tures made with concrete. These products include concrete with insulating properties that  helps buildings use less energy, concrete that requires less water, and concrete that is made  with recycled materials.  In this way, our customers can design sustainable buildings that  take advantage of the benefits of concrete in a wide range of applications. OuR SERvICES We respond to our customers needs by offering them not only high-quality and tailor-made  products, but also the most reliable and cost-effective service.  In each market and locality in which we operate, we do our best to provide our customers  with the most compelling integrated building solutions. For example, to solve infrastructure  needs in major cities, we not only provide ready-mix concrete, but also help to design the  project, identify the best technical solution, propose different financing options, and execute  the project in collaboration with local builders. Similarly, we work alongside our neighbors  in small, less-affluent communities to help them solve their housing needs and pave their  streets and sidewalks.

We  strengthened both our business model and our balance sheet, po- sitioning our company for long-term profitable growth. At the same  time, we intensified our commitment to integrating sustainability into  all aspects of our world-wide business.  Sustainability is central to our business strategy and one of the keys  to our future growth. As the largest concrete producer in the world,  we have both a responsibility and a great opportunity to help lead  the transition to a truly sustainable construction industry. That, in  turn, would be a critical element of a low carbon economy.  The challenges of building the sustainable housing and infrastructure  required by a growing global population are immense. Society needs  innovations not only in design, materials, and construction processes,  but also in creating access to green housing and infrastructure, espe- cially for those who are in most need. CEMEX is committed to helping  stimulate those innovations, while improving the sustainability of our  own operations and increasing our social investment. I am pleased to report that we made progress on all those fronts  last year. For example, although concrete is the most inherently sustainable  building material, we intensified our work to improve its character- istics. This included developing concretes that improve structural  strength, provide extra insulation or allow water to filter through.  We also introduced a carbon footprint tool- the first of its kind in the  building materials industry- that allows us to measure the greenhouse  gas emissions of our cement, ready-mix, and aggregates products. The  tool has already been implemented in all of CEMEXs operating cement  plants, and is now being extended across our ready-mix and aggre- gates operations worldwide. As a result, we will begin to roll out carbon  content information for our products during 2011. We significantly increased the use of lower-carbon alternative fuels  in our kilns. In 2010 our alternative-fuel use rose to 20.3 percent of  our total fuel mix, almost doubling from the 10.3 percent recorded  in 2008. Partly as a result, we are on course to avoid 25 percent of  specific net CO2 emissions related to manufacture of cementitious  products by 2015 compared to our 1990 baseline. CEMEX has a longstanding and well-documented commitment  to biodiversity and wilderness preservation. In concert with this  tradition, last year we and our partners at BirdLife International  completed a multi-year scoping study on the biodiversity status  of our worldwide cement and aggregates operations. We assessed  543 sites and identified 131 sites that overlap with areas of high  biodiversity value. We are using this study to develop biodiversity  action plans.  6 —  Lorenzo H. Zambrano Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer During 2010, we continued our initiatives to build affordable housing  and infrastructure in developing markets. Last year alone, more than  45,000 families were able to improve their homes through our Patri- monio Hoy program, bringing the total to more than 300,000 since we  started the program in 1998. The World Business and Development  Awards organized by the United Nations Development Program, the  International Chamber of Commerce, and the International Business  Leader Fund, recognized our contributions towards achieving the Mil- lennium Development Goals through programs such as Centros Pro- ductivos de Autoempleo, which we expanded to Colombia in 2010. Last year witnessed a number of extreme weather events and natu- ral disasters that severely affected countries and communities where  CEMEX operates. In response, we intensified our disaster relief efforts,  providing emergency humanitarian aid and supporting long-term  reconstruction efforts. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, CEMEX raised US$750,000 in com- pany and employee contributions, with donations from more than  2,500 employees in 29 countries, to help support both emergency  relief and reconstruction efforts. Additionally, we provided direct  assistance in Haiti itself. After Junes catastrophic flooding in Central  Europe, CEMEX focused on Poland and northeastern Hungary, where  the damage was greatest. We provided machinery to help drain  the water and clear roads, and donated construction materials to  reinforce flood banks. In Northern Mexico, Hurricane Alex produced  record-breaking rainfall during early July, creating widespread flood- ing and leaving thousands homeless or without access to water or  electricity. CEMEX and our employees responded with significant  donations of time, money and equipment as part of the cleanup,  relief and reconstruction efforts. An integral part of our sustainability commitment is our continuing,  company-wide effort to improve workplace and community safety.  The safety and well-being of our employees, contractors, and other  third parties involved in our operations is paramount. While we  made significant progress in many health and safety-related areas  last year, we are profoundly sorry to report that in 2010 there were  46 employee, contractor and third-party fatalities related to our  operations. This is unacceptable to us: we refuse to accept even one  such tragedy as inevitable. Zero tolerance for accidents requires constant innovation. In this spirit,  we have continued to roll out the LEGACY training program globally.  In 2011 we will launch new health and safety policies, implement our  new Health and Safety Management System, and require greater ac- countability for safety performance from all our managers. At CEMEX, we know that sustainability is a fundamental—and  urgent—requirement of planetary survival, and we are deeply  committed to pursuing an aggressive sustainability agenda in our  industry, in our communities and in the countries where we operate.  We have continued to work with a broad range of stakeholders— including customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, neighbor- ing communities, NGOs, universities and governments—to develop  and promote best practices, innovative research and positive policy  solutions.  For example, at the 2010 World Economic Forum in Latin America, we  proposed a new model for urban development and urged new alli- ances among key stakeholders to finance housing projects. And, at the  end of the year, CEMEX was an official sponsor of the COP 16 meeting  in Cancun, Mexico, contributing to the global climate change debate  with initiatives that highlighted how existing building and energy  technologies can help the transition to a low carbon world. Every CEMEX employee recognizes that sustainability requires con- stant effort, innovation and commitment both as individuals and as  a company. We are grateful for the input of the Sustainable Devel- opment Reporting Advisory Panel in our ongoing effort to report  more transparently on our challenges as well as our successes. Their  guidance is invaluable to this process. At the same time, we invite  feedback from all of our stakeholders and look forward to continually  improving our performance in the coming years. Sincerely, Lorenzo H. Zambrano Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 7 —  Lead in Sustainable Construction CEMEX introduced a carbon footprint tool—the first of its kind  in the building materials industry—that allows the company to  measure the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) of all of our ce- ment, ready-mix concrete, and aggregates products. It measures  emissions from raw-material sourcing to the release of the finished  product at the factory gate.  To further promote the mainstreaming of sustainable construction  practices, we partnered with the World Green Building Council to  host an event during the 2010 COP16 Meeting in Cancun, Mexico.  Key Challenges for Construction in the 21st Century was an  open dialogue during which experts discussed global emerging  sustainable-construction trends. Special emphasis was placed on  concretes sustainable attributes and how its proper application  can play a significant role in reducing climate change. We have been very successful in replacing fossil fuels with alternative  sources of energy. Our fuels substitution rate increased from 16.4% in  2009 to 20.3% in 2010, reducing the usage of an equivalent of 1.4 million  tons of coal and avoiding 1.7 million tons of CO2 emissions.  Our reduction in CO2 specific net emissions keeps us on track to meet  our 25% reduction target by 2015. In December 2010 we registered a new Clean Development Mecha- nism project at our Zapotiltic, Mexico, cement plant, which aims to  substitute alternative fuels for petcoke. The Comprehensive Road Rehabilitation Project (PIRE) in  Tijuana, Mexico, in which CEMEX participated, was completed. Dur- ing this two-year project, 126 kilometers of major roadways were  upgraded and rehabilitated, improving traffic flow and air qual- ity in the region and mitigating the heat-island effect by reducing  road-surface temperatures by up to 15C. CEMEX coordinated the environmental certification required for the  project to obtain more than US$110 million in financing from the  North American Development Bank and the Border Environment  Cooperation Commission.

The study mapped 543 sites and identified that 131 of them are  located in proximity to areas of high biodiversity value.  CEMEX achieved significant reductions in the number and sever- ity of environmental incidents.  We are very sorry to report that a total of 46 employees, contractors,  and third parties died in connection with CEMEX activities. Such  tragedies are unacceptable. We are redoubling our safety training  and  incident-prevention measures. 2,108 CEMEX line-managers completed the two-day LEGACY   CEMEX Safety Leadership Program. The training covers themes  such as leading by example, understanding processes and people,  and ensuring accountability for safety. In 2010, we developed the  CEMEX Health and Safety Management System (HSMS), a risk- based operating system aligned   with OHSAS 18001.  Our lost-time injury rate decreased to 2.6 per million of hours  worked.  This rate slightly exceeds our target of 2.5, but represents  significant improvement from 3.2 in 2009.  totaling 308,311 families and more than  1,984,500 m2 of housing since 1998 Through the Centros Productivos de Autoempleo program, partici- pants built over one million construction blocks and 5,158 tempo- rary jobs were created. After Hurricane Alex struck Mexico, we launched the program  Construimos Juntos in each of the 10 damaged municipalities and  donated 500 tons of cement and 200 packages of building materials  for basic-housing units. In September 2010, the United Nations recognized CEMEX for its con- tributions toward achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals,  specifically with regard to the companys low-income housing. We focused our global training efforts on executives and employees  in higher risk positions and locations. Approximately 840 instructor- led training sessions were delivered on compliance topics such  as anti-bribery, antitrust, and insider trading and more than 4,000  online courses were taken. These efforts will continue during 2011. 84% of countries where we operate regularly conducted   customer-satisfaction surveys 93% of our purchases were made from locally and   nationally based suppliers 84% of countries have a process to screen suppliers in relation to  social and environmental aspects Excellence in Environmental &   Biodiversity Management  High Priority to Health & Safety Strengthen Local Communities Partnerships with Key Stakeholders 85% 97% 19% 40% +19,000 83% 543 45,099 of our active cement and aggregates sites  have quarry rehabilitation plans in place of our operations have  community engagement plans decrease in employee lti  frequency rte in 2010 decrease in lost work days of our employees actively  use our learning platform employee engagement level sites were evaluated for their proximity  to high biodiversity value areas families improved their  homes through Patrimonio  hoy in 2010 9 —  PERFORMANCE summary The following tables provide an overview of our performance indicators and progress toward our companywide sustainability targets.

(6) As emission targets for 2015 have been already met, CEMEX is undergoing a thorough analysis of its operations and market developments to set new, challenging targets for 2015. (7) A new target of 0.5 has been established to ensure we continue to work towards our ultimate goal of zero LTIs. (8) We believe that the previous Health Indicator for % employees participating in annual medical exams was difficult to progress globally given the difficulty in some countries to legally conduct  these exams for workers. A new indicator showing our employee sickness absence rate is universally tracked and was agreed to be a more relevant indicator to measure our progress in health. (9) Having achieved close to 100% of the previous target % of operations with safety training programs for drivers, new KPIs to track our progress in complying with the CSI Driving and Contractor  standards were introduced. (10) In 2010, the separate Health and Safety Management Systems were combined to create a single HSMS, hence a new KPI tracking implementation progress of this new system was introduced. NA = Data not available 11 —  sustainability  VISION and model The world we live in is changing rapidly: The worlds population will grow significantly in the next 40 years  and there will be a massive migration of people from rural areas  to cities. The general scientific consensus is that climate change cannot be  ignored, and that average global temperatures are likely to increase  significantly by the end of this century1.  These increases in tem- peratures will mean not only rising sea levels, but also more intense  precipitation in some countries, increased risk of drought in others,  and adverse effects on agriculture, health, biodiversity, and water  resources around the world.  The global community must find a way to rapidly grow existing  cities and build new ones making a better use of resources and  responding to the expectations of local communities of having  their living standards improve. To achieve this, business as usual  cannot continue. Envisioning a sustainable future As a leading company in the  global building materials  industry, CEMEX is positioned  at the convergence of great  environmental and social  challenges. 12 —  As a producer of cement and concrete, CEMEX faces a twofold  challenge:  1.  Cement and its end product, concrete, are intrinsically related  to human development, with a direct relationship between  demand for cement and economic growth. The simple human  aspiration for a decent home with basic infrastructure means  that significant amounts of concrete will be needed. However,  the cement industry is a significant emitter of greenhouse gases,  with cement manufacturing accounting for approximately five  percent of man-made CO2.2 Therefore, it is our aim to reduce  our emissions to the lowest levels that are both technically and  economically feasible. 2.  We firmly believe that concrete must play a major part in any  successful transition towards a sustainable society. Be it the instal- lation of renewable electricity generation, the development of  more efficient infrastructure, the building of new roads, or the  construction of more sustainable buildings, all of these activities  and others need concrete.  Given the importance of the sustainability-related challenges  that society is facing, CEMEX has integrated sustainability into its  business strategy. With the help of our Sustainability Model, we  are incorporating sustainability practices into all of our day-to-day  operations and decision-making processes worldwide. Our model  ensures that we concentrate our efforts and resources on the issues  of highest relevance to our business and greatest concern to our  stakeholders. 1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2007, Fourth Assessment  Report: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf 2  WBCSD / IEA: Cement Technology Roadmap 2009 – Carbon emissions reductions up to 2050,  Geneva / Paris 2009; http://www.iea.org/papers/2009/Cement_Roadmap.pdf       V A L U E   C R E A T I O N                               F O O T P R I N T       E N H A N C E   O U R                                           M A N A G E   O U R                     S T A K E H O L D E R S                         E N G A G E   O U R SUSTAINABILITY AT CEMEX Manage Our Footprint: CEMEX strives to minimize  the ecological impacts of its operations on the  communities in which we operate. Such impacts  are carefully identified and measured so that we  can continuously reduce our footprint to the  lowest level that is both technically and economi- cally feasible. We also have a robust pipeline of  projects that provide carbon offsets to further  reduce our net impact. Engage Our Stakeholders: CEMEX fosters positive,  long-term relationships with key stakeholders  to address the pressing needs and concerns of  society. With a highly committed and empowered  employee base, CEMEX closely collaborates with  a broad variety of institutions that allow us to  complement our core competences and enable  us to generate social benefits that contribute to  strengthening local communities. Enhance Our Value Creation: CEMEX aims to  deliver the innovative, high-performing  products, services, and solutions that  our resource-constrained society  requires in order to create a growing  and profitable low-carbon economy.  By fulfilling the needs of the construc- tion sector in its efforts to adopt more  sustainable operating practices, we  aim to create long-lasting competitive  advantages. CEMEXs sustainability model We have three main sustainability objectives: 13 —  CEMEXs sustainability  PRIORITIES We have identified seven priorities in our Sustainability  Model. The definition of these priorities has followed a  structured process of both internal and external consulta- tions where we have measured the impact that the main  sustainability issues have on our stakeholders and on  CEMEX operations. For this matter, we have performed  a Materiality Analysis which is further explained in our  About this Report section.  Our seven priorities aligned to each of our three objec- tives are the focus of our 2010 Sustainable Development  Report: Enhance our Value Creation: n Lead in Sustainable Construction n Low-Income Housing & Infrastructure manage our footprint: n Enhance Our Carbon Strategy  n Excellence in Environmental & Biodiversity Management  Engage our stakeholders: n High Priority to Health & Safety n Strengthen Local Communities n Partnership with Key Stakeholders 14 —  Our sustainability strategy rests on the belief that we generate value for soci- ety by helping to meet some of the worlds most important needs. We do this by  developing concrete that helps buildings conserve energy; manufacturing pro- cesses that reduce carbon emissions and water usage; housing and community  infrastructure that is safe and affordable; and high impact social programs that  foster community development.

By building strong, long-term relationships with our key  stakeholders, we increase our responsiveness to their  needs and concerns, find new ways to reduce our im- pacts, contribute to sustainable development worldwide,  and make CEMEX a more competitive and profitable  enterprise. 15 —  LEAd in sustainable construction the average Co2 equivalent emissions calculated for   CeMeX products is:  798kg Co2e per ton of cement 298kg Co2e per m3 for ready-mix concrete products  5.3kg Co2e per ton for aggregates products Hercules Towers, located in the Bay of Algeciras, Spain 16 —  CEMEX aims to lead in sustain- able construction by developing  building products and solutions  that have significant positive  sustainability attributes and  contribute to the transformation  of the construction sector.  58% buILDING MATERIALS FOR A GROWING WORLD Concrete is humanitys primary building material. It literally provides  the foundation, structural support, floors, and walls for much of the  infrastructure of modern civilization: from homes, offices, and facto- ries to bridges and runways, dams, and power plants. That infrastruc- ture must and will continue to grow. By 2050, world population is expected to increase from todays 6.9  billion to more than 9 billion.1 Also by 2050, some 70 percent of  earths population will live in cities, up from 47 percent in 2000.2  Concrete will be fundamental to providing this burgeoning urban  population with housing, energy, transportation, and the many other  necessities and enjoyments of life. At current growth rates, CEMEX forecasts that by 2050, global annual  concrete consumption will be at least double the estimated 7.5 bil- lion cubic meters produced in 2006.  of our total worldwide production has  implemented the tool  1EEB report Energy Efficiency in Buildings – Transforming the Markets: http://www.wbcsd.org/ DocRoot/rVDgBRKvPngUrqivMHNM/91719_EEBReport_WEB.pdf 2  United Nations, World Urbanization Prospects: The 2006 & 2007 Revisions in 2010, we introduced the first carbon footprint tool in the industry 17 —  WITH GROWTH, WE SEE OPPORTuNITY—  AND RESPONSIbILITY As the largest producer of concrete in the world, CEMEX sees an  enormous opportunity in the future growth of the global construc- tion industry as. However, along with this opportunity, comes a  corresponding responsibility. We believe that the successful transi- tion to a truly sustainable civilization will require the development  of new building products and solutions that use resources more  efficiently, perform better, and last longer. CEMEX is rising to the challenge with a three-part strategy to: n Develop better building products and solutions that can be  more sustainably produced, facilitate more efficient construc- tion processes, and contribute to the overall sustainability of  buildings and other infrastructure. n Support the design and renovation of buildings to consume  significantly less energy, water, and other resources in their use,  maintenance, renovation, and disassembly.  n Promote and enable sustainable urban planning policies and  practices, including regulatory policy and designs that anticipate  the main challenges cities will face in the future. DEvELOPING bETTER buILDING PRODuCTS AND SOLuTIONS Led by our Global Center for Technology and Innovation (GCTI) in  Switzerland, CEMEX technology centers around the world are creat- ing a range of innovative concrete products to meet the construc- tion industrys growing demand for high-performance, low-carbon  building solutions.  In 2010, we became the first  cement company in the world to  provide certified carbon labels  for our cement in the United  Kingdom, using the UK Carbon  Trusts Carbon Reduction Label 18 —  Some of our most noteworthy offerings within our growing product portfolio are:  Self-compacting concrete that im- proves the structural strength, durabil- ity, and life of buildings while reducing  both energy consumption and noise  caused by concrete vibration. Insulating concrete forms, made  primarily from polystyrene and filled  with concrete, which help keep heat  out in hot climates and retain it in cold  weather. Impervious concrete (Impercem),  which reduces water absorption by  buildings while maintaining normal  setting times for reliable strength and  performance—ideal for landscaped  roofs and water transport systems. Structural thermal insulation con- crete that reduces the thermal bridges  and increases its insulation performance,  making homes and buildings more  energy-efficient and comfortable. High-strength concrete, that enables  the use of less concrete with no loss of  strength or structural integrity. Low CO2 footprint-self compacting  and easy compacting concrete, with  all the advantages of the conventional  versions, but based on special mix de- signs that allow for low cement content  and embedded energy.  Permeable concrete that allows rain- water to filter through, reducing both  heat build-up and flood risk. Specially designed high-performance  concrete with enhanced resistance to  demanding environments, such as con- crete pipes for potable water, sewage,  and wastewater systems, and high acid- resistance concrete for use in cooling  towers and various industrial processes. 19 —  In 2010, CEMEX introduced a carbon footprint tool. The first of its  kind in the building materials industry, it is certified in accordance  with international protocols by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), one of the  worlds leading independent certification entities. The tool measures  emissions from cradle-to-gate—from raw material sourcing to the  release of the finished product at the factory gate—which allows  CEMEX to track the greenhouse gas emissions of all of its cement,  ready-mix concrete, and aggregates products.  We developed the carbon footprint methodology with the following  objectives: n Quantify and communicate the CO2e emissions from the produc- tion of our products to help our customers calculate the footprint  of their projects. n Perform a benchmark of company facilities with the goal of con- tinually reducing our CO2 footprint. n Collaborate with our clients in the design phase of their proj- ects and in the selection of materials that will help reduce CO2  emissions.  The tool has already been implemented at 629 CEMEX cement, ready- mix concrete, and aggregates sites, corresponding to 58 percent of  total production. During 2011, CEMEX will begin publishing product  specific carbon content for its products in selected operations, in a  rollout schedule that will be driven by market requirements.  CEMEX unveiled its CO2 footprint tool at the COP16 Meeting in Can- cun, Mexico in December 2010 during a round-table discussion the  company hosted along with the World Green Building Council.

Typically, manufacturing and  transportation of building materials and actual construction account  for only around 10 percent of a buildings total energy consumption.  In contrast, nearly 90 percent is used for operation, maintenance, and  renovation during the buildings lifespan.1 Given this equation, we  have the challenge to develop not only sustainable building materi- als, but also more sustainable buildings—more energy- and water- efficient in their construction, operation, and maintenance. We have taken a leadership role in several partnerships and policy  organizations focused on sustainable building and development. n We are a Core Group member of the Energy Efficiency in Build- ings (EEB) initiative within the World Business Council for  The Environmental Expectations of Our Modern Society The environmental expectations of modern society are beginning to transform our concep- tion of buildings, from their construction to how we inhabit them. Two lines of action are necessary, which in the end are simply two distinct faces of the same  coin. On one side is the lengthening of materials lifetimes in order to reduce their emissions.  This transition requires a profound shift from the traditional perspective of a building as a  single object to an understanding of a building as an assemblage of separately manufac- tured and recyclable components.  On the other side of the coin are the thermal properties of materials, which can stabilize tem- peratures inside buildings and, used properly, substantially reduce energy consumption. A new architecture is emerging as an expression of the technological, economic, and ideologi- cal achievements of this new shared ideal; this architecture will become our voice in time. Within this context, CEMEX can have a decisive role both in minimizing the environmental  impacts of cement production and supporting the transformation of the construction and  architectural sectors.  Felipe Pich-Aguilera  Advisory Panel Member Sustainable Development (WBCSD). This initiative is setting  new standards for the use of energy in buildings. The goal is to  transform the market for commercial buildings worldwide and  achieve significant carbon emission reductions by sharing and  promoting best practices.   n In the US, CEMEX has been actively involved with other industry  players in the establishment of the Concrete Sustainability Hub  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  In 2010,  MIT released preliminary research findings that will help set a new  standard in lifecycle assessment (LCA) modeling (see sidebar). MIT  is set to release a follow-up study in 2011 to examine and quantify  the benefits and savings from better use of concrete in buildings  and pavements, from a total lifecycle cost perspective (environ- mental and economic).  Skyline of Panama City 21 —  To further promote the mainstreaming of sustainable construction  practices, we partnered with the World Green Building Council to  host an event during the 2010 COP16 Meeting in Cancun, Mexico.  Key Challenges for Construction in the 21st Century was an open  dialogue during which experts discussed global emerging sustain- able construction trends.  PROMOTING SuSTAINAbLE uRbAN PLANNING PRACTICES Sustainable development, especially the planning and development  of more sustainable cities, may present the greatest challenge of  the 21st century—one that will only be met if multiple stakeholders  work together. Business, industry, and government must collaborate  on integrated solutions based on systems thinking and collaboration  across nations and industrial sectors.  With this in mind, we have taken the first steps toward this col- laboration by participating as co-chair in the Urban Infrastructure  Initiative (UII) created by the World Business Council for Sustain- able Development (WBCSD) with the goal to show that business  should be involved early on in cities strategic planning discussions,  Understanding the lifecycle impacts of our products The Concrete Sustainability Hub at MIT is conducting studies to quantify the cradle-to-grave environmental impacts of paving and  building materials. Ultimately, this will create the most comprehensive concrete lifecycle analysis model produced to date. Initial find- ings in the Buildings LCA have shown that more than 90 percent of the lifecycle carbon emissions from residential buildings are due to  the use or operational phase. The study also showed that in residential structures, the use of insulating concrete forms instead of code- compliant, wood-framed construction can produce operational energy savings of 20 percent or more, with the highest energy savings  occurring in colder climates. The Highway Pavement LCA showed that for high-volume roads, the use phase of the lifecycle can account for up to 85 percent of  total carbon emissions.   We are encouraged by this first report and expect more information on the sustainability attributes of concrete, as well as technical  innovations that will result in additional benefits to the industry and society at large. as private sector participation can help unlock opportunities and  develop the practical, cross-cutting solutions needed to create  sustainable cities.  ENvISIONING THE CITY OF THE FuTuRE During the COP16s Green Solutions Expo, CEMEX presented a  vision of the city of the future. Our exhibit showcased how con- cretes properties make it an ideal material for building sustain- able cities.  n Clean energy: Concrete, as a technically versatile product, can  be used in many structural applications, including those that  allow alternative energy sources to replace fossil fuels. For  example, concrete is required for foundations of large photovol- taic energy installations and for high-performance onshore and  offshore wind towers.  n Transportation and mobility: Concretes durability makes it a great  choice for transportation infrastructure projects that reduce fuel  use, including track beds for trains, light rail, and trams; guided  bus lanes; and bicycle lanes. Jorge Tadeo Lozano University in Bogot, Colombia 22 —  Recognizing sustainability innovation and leadership Established in 1991, the CEMEX Building Awards recognize outstanding construction projects and the talented  individuals who contribute to their creation. Along with providing recognition for construction excellence, the  awards encourage a culture of continuous innovation. In keeping with the spirit of constant evolution, we added  Sustainable Development as a separate award category since 2002.  The 2010 first-place winners in the sustainable construction category were the Split University Library in Croatia  and the Ecological Interpretive Center in El Cielo Biosphere Reserve in Mexico.     For more information about this awards program, please visit www.cemexbuildingaward.com n Energy efficient residential and non-residential buildings: Concretes  thermal mass reduces heating and cooling requirements, while its  durability minimizes building maintenance. In addition, it provides  fire resistance, sound insulation, flood resilience, and air tightness. n Sustainable urban design and infrastructure: Concrete is used to build  infrastructure that reduces the consumption of natural resources,  thereby contributing to communities sustainability. For example,  concrete is widely used in water management infrastructure. n Industrial ecology (systems in which companies in different  industries exchange materials so the waste of one industry  becomes the feedstock for another): Concrete manufacturers play  an essential role in industrial ecologies by building on current  practices, such as using fly ash and blast furnace slag as cementi- tious materials, and using alternative fuels, predominantly waste  or by-products from industrial, domestic, agricultural, and forestry  processes. In addition, during its lifetime and demolition, concrete  captures meaningful amounts of CO2 that remain embedded in  recycled aggregates and can then be incorporated into newly  built concrete structures. 1   EEB report Energy Efficiency in Buildings – Transforming the Markets: http://www.wbcsd.org/ DocRoot/rVDgBRKvPngUrqivMHNM/91719_EEBReport_WEB.pdf  For more information about CEMEXs City of the Future, please  visit our corporate website. Ecological Interpretative Center in   El Cielo Biosphere Reserve in Mexico 23 —  low-income   HOUSING and   INFRASTRUCTURE 1,502 low-income houses—170% more than  in 2009—built with support of CeMeX  Vivienda initiative, in Mexico  24 —  CEMEX supports social  and economic progress,  especially in the developing  countries where we operate.  We believe that we can make a tremendous difference by helping  to build affordable housing and better, more modern, and durable  community infrastructure such as roads and sidewalks, schools, hos- pitals, parks, and other public spaces. The worlds need for housing is urgent and unrelenting. According to  the United Nations:1 n Worldwide, an estimated 1.1 billion people in urban areas alone  live in inadequate housing.  n Between 2000 and 2030, urban areas in developing countries will  absorb 95 percent of the worlds population growth. n During the last decade, the annual need for housing in developing  countries urban areas was an estimated 35 million units.  n Nearly 95,000 new urban housing units must be constructed each  day in developing countries in order to relieve overcrowding and  substandard living conditions.  in Mexico, our infrastructure program supported the completion of   7 million square meters of urban concrete paving and over 3 million  square meters of concrete highway paving.  1  UN-HABITAT, http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&catid=282&cid=789 25 —  Working together with communities, we focus on: n organizing and teaching communities to build walls and roofs, n consolidating alternative models to provide access to housing,  and n building more quickly efficiently while reducing costs through  innovative solutions. REDuCING HOuSING DEFICITS CEMEXs housing strategy is designed to address the significant  housing deficits in developing countries, chiefly Mexico and the  countries of South and Central America, the Caribbean, and Asia.  Our goal is to demolish building and development paradigms  that limit the affordability of home ownership for low-income  families by establishing cooperative relationships among low- income communities, government agencies, developers, and the  financial sector. Working with communities CEMEXs low-income housing strategy is based on the notion that  lower-income people are capable of paying for their own homes.  Through our financing programs, including private microfinance,  we enable low-income individuals and communities to buy build- ing materials on favorable terms as a step toward homeownership.  CEMEX then provides training programs, equipment, technology,  and our own expertise to help customers build homes, businesses,  and stronger communities.  Patrimonio Hoy, an initiative started in Mexico and now successfully  replicated in Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and the Dominican  Republic, offers micro-financing to low-income families so that they  can build, expand, or remodel their homes. Through our Patrimonio  Hoy program we have proven that, with the right assistance and  advice, families and entire communities can put aside the necessary  funds to meet their payment commitments.  For more information on Patrimonio Hoy and its achievements dur- ing 2010, please see Strengthen Local Communities on page 57.  Housing project in Dominican Republic Alleviating the housing deficit that pre- vails in Latin America requires a joint effort  between the public and private sectors as  well as NGOs. We must build new alliances  between governments, developers, financial  entities, and communities to develop signifi- cant housing projects.   Jess Gonzlez  President of CEMEX in Central America  26 —  Starting with a model for semi-urban living in San Marcos,  Mexico, CEMEX housing experts have developed several  prototypes for affordable housing in various types of com- munities. The San Marcos prototype, consisting of a living  room, two bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom, offers 35  square meters of living space, expandable to 42, 68, and  up to 84 square meters. It comes complete with doors,  windows, bathroom fixtures, water tank with base, in-wall  water, and electrical and sanitary systems. During autumn  2010, the San Marcos prototype was tested as part of the  Nuevo Len Reconstruction Program for victims of Hur- ricane Alex. For the San Marcos and other low-cost housing prototypes  developed by CEMEX, we bring our expertise and experi- ence with advanced building materials and techniques  to bear on the challenges of housing a growing world  population. Designs based on precast concrete forms make  the structures sound and sustainable as well as fast and  economical to build. The use of special products such as  our sealing and water proofing Impercem and Hidratium  and our antibacterial concrete add to the soundness and  safety of these structures. developing prototypes for low-income housing semi-urban housing San Marcos project: housing basic unit 35 m2 Working with developers CEMEX works hand-in-hand with private developers to bring needed  resources, technology, and know-how to the development of low- income housing. Where public policies facilitate financing to low- income home buyers—such as Mexico and Colombia—developers  have shown avid interest in the low-income segment of the housing  market. Their support has helped to significantly boost the supply of  housing. More financing is needed, however, in order for small and  medium-sized developers to make further progress. To encourage developers to build more and better housing, we  provide support through the CEMEX Vivenda initiative. Through  this partnership we provide assessment, expertise, and introduce  construction systems and financial programs that benefit both the  developer and the end-user, promoting the building of more sustain- able communities and more affordable housing that offer a higher  quality of life.  In Mexico, the CEMEX Vivienda initiative supported  developers construction of 1,502 homes in 2010—170 percent more  than in 2009.  Housing unit in Puerto Rico 27 —  Rebuilding infrastructure   in Tijuana CEMEX was a moving force in the recently completed Compre- hensive Road Rehabilitation Project or PIRE (Programa Integral de  Repavimentacin) in Tijuana, Mexico. Despite a significant annual  allocation of public-works funds for road maintenance and repair,  the citys primary roadway system was unable to handle traffic  demands because of severe deterioration due to age, heavy use,  erosion, and other factors. PIRE was a key component in a two-year effort to rehabilitate and  upgrade some 126 kilometers of Tijuanas urban roadways. Old  asphalt paving was overlaid with a hydraulic concrete layer, thus  reducing the environmental impact of disposing of old paving in  landfills. Additional work included the rebuilding of storm drains,  construction or reconstruction of curbs and sidewalks, and restora- tion of the landscaping adjacent to roadways in some areas.  By improving traffic flow on the citys roadways, the project has  improved air quality in the region, mitigated the heat-island effect  by reducing road surface temperatures almost 15C, and reduced  energy consumption for street lighting due to the concrete sur- faces high reflectivity (up to five times that of asphalt surfaces). At a total cost of nearly US$125 million, the project also delivered  enormous economic benefits for the community by creating more  than 5,500 jobs during the construction phase. The project was fi- nanced through an innovative irrevocable trust that administers and  guarantees payments. CEMEX coordinated the environmental certi- fication required for the project to obtain more than US$110 million  in financing from the North American Development Bank and the  Border Environment Cooperation Commission (two US-Mexico  binational institutions created under the auspices of the North  American Free Trade Agreement to address environmental issues in  the border region). The financing of the project became the largest  loan in the North American Development Banks 15-year history. attracting private investment CEMEX believes that private investment has an essential role to play  in alleviating the housing deficits that prevail in Latin America. Alli- ances and joint efforts between financial institutions, governments,  NGOs, developers, and communities can develop significant housing  projects that provide a step towards homeownership and a decent  standard of living for low-income people. We aim to maintain the interest of all involved stakeholders in order to  convert this process into a virtuous cycle—one that improves quality of  life and facilitates wellness—which in turn will help developing coun- tries and communities become more productive and competitive. PROvIDING AFFORDAbLE, DuRAbLE buILDING   MATERIALS TO LOW-INCOME COMMuNITIES During 2010 we supported several housing projects in Mexico  through which over 700 homes are being built and will be fin- ished during 2011, totaling more than 25,000 square meters of  construction:  n In Nuevo Len, a northern Mexican state that was one of the most  affected by flooding during hurricane Alex in 2010, we launched a  program to build 239 houses in the municipality of Anhuac and 103  homes in Monterrey. These houses will be finished by June 2011.  n In southern Mexico, we launched a similar 394-house project in  the state of Campeche. This is a pilot project of a new financial  scheme by SHF (Mexican Housing Bank), called the Assisted  Self-Construction Program in which a loan will be given to the  customer. The goal is to have the 394 homes built by June 2011.  n In the state of Sinaloa in northern Mexico, we participated in the  construction of a prototype house. Built in just 10 days, the house  was used as a showcase by the Governor to inaugurate the State  Housing Program, which will aim to build 5,000 homes during a  six-year period and contribute to the reduction of the housing  deficit in the area. 28 —  We also initiated participation in housing projects in Central and  South America in 2010: n In cooperation with local and national governments, CEMEX  launched in November 2010 a low-income housing project in San  Rafael del Sur, Nicaragua, a community near one of our cement  plants. Precast products are being used for the housing units  exteriors and interiors. The project will be finalized by mid-2011  and will benefit 143 families.  n In Colombia, CEMEX spearheaded a four-phase housing initia- tive in the city of Barranquilla in 2010 to build over 800 houses  for low-income families. Through a strategic alliance with the  local developer MARVAL, CEMEX will launch the project in 2011  and build 202 houses during the year as part of the first phase of  the project.  PARTNERING TO MAKE HIGH-SCALE INFRASTRuCTuRE   A REALITY CEMEX works with governments and local authorities to identify, co- ordinate, and develop infrastructure projects. Over the past 15 years,  we have participated in 70 concrete road-building projects that have  created 10,000 lane-kilometers of pavement surface for highways  alone. The use of concrete rather than asphalt provides a more sus- tainable solution, as concrete allows for greater durability, safety, and  light reflection, lower fuel consumption and temperatures, as well as  lower lifecycle costs. In addition to our building materials, technical expertise, and  equipment, we also bring turnkey solutions to high-scale infra- structure projects such as concrete paving, asphalt pavement  rehabilitation with cement, and concrete pavement rehabilita- tion. Our involvement in these projects spans the entire lifecycle:  from originating new projects and helping to secure and structure  financing through third-party financial institutions, to executing  and managing construction—and in some cases maintenance and  toll-road operation.  We partner with local construction companies that might not qualify  to participate on their own, often arranging innovative financing  mechanisms that include these local subcontractors. By making  them investors in larger-scale developments, we help these compa- nies grow and promote their involvement in future projects while  also diminishing long-term risks for all parties. In Mexico we sup- ported the completion of 7 million square meters of urban concrete  paving and over 3 million square meters of highway concrete paving  in 2010 through our infrastructure program.  By becoming fully involved in each project, we develop closer rela- tionships with our public- and private-sector clients. Ultimately, we  provide greater value for them—offering the cost-effective, compre- hensive solutions they need—while creating a competitive advan- tage and generating new market opportunities for CEMEX.  Infrastructure project in Colombia Financing the building needs of the 21st  century will require new partnerships be- tween the public and private sectors, as well  as new economic models. We will have to be  as innovative in our financial engineering as  we are in our civil engineering.  Gabriel I. Garca  Infrastructure Projects, Innovation Initiative Leader 29 —  ENHANCE  our  carbon   STRATEGY 20.5% reduction in net Co2 specific emissions,  compared to our 1990 baseline 30 —  Our comprehensive carbon  strategy is a key component  of our sustainability model  because it allows us to reduce  our environmental footprint  and foster the development of  a low-carbon economy.  TRANSITIONING TO A LOW-CARbON ECONOMY  Climate change is caused by increasing concentrations of green- house gases, primarily CO2, in the Earths atmosphere. It is widely be- lieved that this phenomenon is the result of human activity, includ- ing the burning of fossils fuels for energy and also emissions derived  from a variety of agricultural and industrial processes. Minimizing  climate change and its consequences is a critical global challenge. The global cement industry produces about five percent of all man- made CO2 emissions.1 This greenhouse gas is generated chiefly in the  production of clinker (the main ingredient in cement). Clinker is pro- duced in large rotary kilns by processing limestone, clay, and other  minerals under very high temperatures (>1,400 C or 2,500 F). CO2  results from the fuel combustion required to achieve such high tem- peratures and from the chemical decomposition of limestone into  lime and CO2. Compared to these emissions, other sources, mainly  the transport of raw materials and final products and emissions re- lated to the generation of electricity that CEMEX consumes, are very  small, but still offer an opportunity to reduce our total footprint. we have long been engaged in a multi-pronged approach to reducing  the overall carbon footprint of our operations, chiefly by: n replacing traditional fossil fuels with lower-emission alternatives, n by reducing the clinker content in cement, n increasing our use of renewable energy and the energy efficiency of  our operations n exploring new carbon-reduction options and policies. (1) WBCSD / IEA: Cement Technology Roadmap 2009 – Carbon emissions reductions up to 2050,  Geneva/ Paris 2009; http://www.iea.org/papers/2009/Cement_Roadmap.pdf 31 —  For an energy-intensive company with worldwide operations like CEMEX, addressing  climate change must be of the highest priority. It has been gratifying to see the prog- ress that CEMEX has achieved in this regard, from increasing energy efficiency and  its use of alternative fuels, alternative materials, and renewable energy to reducing  the levels of emissions and particulates. This improvement process must now go into  high gear to achieve the goals that CEMEX has set for itself, as it will become harder  and harder to achieve continued efficiencies.  It has also been gratifying to see the support CEMEX has given to the building indus- try as a whole through the Cement Sustainability Initiative of the WBCSD, as well as in  its interaction with the Government of Mexico and the 16th Conference of the Parties  to the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change (COP16) in Cancun. Antonio Vives  Advisory Panel Member Key Performance Indicators 2015 Targets 2010 Progress Reduction in CO2 emissions per ton of  cementitious product from 1990 baseline Reduce emissions per ton of cementitious- product by 25% to 602kg CO2/ton 625 kg CO2/ton, a 20.5% reduction vs. 1990  levels, keeping us on track to meet our  2015 target. Alternative fuels substitution rate Changed target from 15% to 35% We have redefined our goal to set a more  ambitious target and continue to have the  fastest increase rate in the industry.  Alternative raw materials rate Substitute use of natural raw materials by  12%* We achieved an 11.8% alternative raw ma- terials  rate in 2010, an improvement that  almost  meets our 2015 target. *We have a target of 15% by 2020, currently under review On target to meet our carbon reduction goals CEMEXs Beckum Cement Plant in Germany 32 —  Record alternative fuel rates in  Europe Our use of alternative fuels is highest in Europe, where we have  made significant investments in retrofitting our facilities. CEMEX Germany has worked for many years to reduce the con- sumption of fossil fuels by replacing them with alternative fuels.  In 2010, the average substitution rate for our operating kilns at  our Rdersdorf and Kollenbach cement plants was 74 percent.  This means that both plants burned more than 414,000 tons of  alternative fuels, resulting in a net reduction of 337,000 tons of CO2.  With this result, CEMEX Germany is number one among CEMEX  operations worldwide in the use of alternative fuels. In addition to  the most popular RDF (refuse derived fuels), several other alterna- tive fuels are being used, such as tire chips, dried sewage sludge,  and animal meal. In 2011, a sophisticated project will start in the  Kollenbach plant in order to ensure a smoother kiln operation due  to better homogeneity of the ground fuels. This will further reduce  CO2 emissions and save natural resources. CEMEX Poland has also been investing in reducing the amount  of fossil fuels consumed by its operating kilns by replacing them  with alternative fuels derived from waste. In 2010 the average level  of substitution at our Polish cement plants reached almost 70  percent, with 76 percent at Chelm. In the old long kilns in Rudniki  with a 47 percent alternative fuels rate we have almost reached  the technical limit of substitution in terms of quantity. Combined,  the plants disposed of more than 300,000 tons of waste last year,  recovering energy from the material that would otherwise be land- filled. CEMEX Poland is not only the leader in the use of alternative  fuels in the domestic market; it also ranks second among CEMEX  operations worldwide. It has responded to the developing market  opportunities with numerous investments. In addition to RDF other  kinds of alternative fuels are being utilized, such as tires, sewage  sludge, and liquid fuels, as well as agricultural biomass wastes in  the form of locally sourced straw. Our goal is for the share of alter- native fuels to increase again in 2011, due in part to the planned  installation of an animal meal facility in Chelm.  In 2010, alternative fuels supplied as much as 40 percent of the fuel  needs at our plant in Buol, Spain and, in Rugby, England, we have  replaced 47 percent of fossil fuels with alternative fuels including  Climafuel, a solid, non-hazardous fuel derived from household  waste. 20.3% alternative fuels  substitution rate CEMEX has developed a carbon strategy—the application of  company knowledge, skills, technologies, and ingenuity to reduce  CO2 emissions. We have long been engaged in a multi-pronged approach to reduc- ing the overall carbon footprint of our operations, chiefly by: n replacing traditional fossil fuels with lower-emission alternatives n reducing the clinker content in cement n increasing our use of renewable electricity and the energy ef- ficiency of our operations n exploring new carbon-reduction technologies and policies Our CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious products have dropped  by 20.5 percent compared to our 1990 baseline, and we are on track  to meet our 25 percent reduction target by 2015.  uSING ALTERNATIvE FuELS TO REDuCE EMISSIONS The use of alternative fuels is a key pillar of our carbon strategy. By  replacing traditional fossil fuels with alternative fuels that are less  CO2 intensive or that recover energy from waste, we are measurably  reducing both our CO2 emissions and our fuel costs.  We have quadrupled our use of alternative fuels since 2005. In 2010  alone, the share of alternative fuels in our total fuel mix reached 20.3  percent compared to 16.4 percent in 2009. Our target is to reach an  alternative fuels substitution rate of 35 percent by 2015. addressing community concerns  To ensure the environmentally and socially responsible use of alter- native fuels in our kilns, CEMEX has established corporate guide- lines that reflect best practices in our industry. We also engage with  communities to address to their concerns and explain how the use  of cement kilns for waste disposal is an environmentally friendly so- lution that mitigates potential harm by avoiding the land use and  hygienic challenges of landfills. We further meet with regulators to  ensure that our use of alternative fuels is fully compliant with all ap- plicable local, regional, and national policies and regulations.  For further information about our use of alternative fuels, please  read CEMEXs position paper on alternative fuels which is avail- able for download in our website. 33 —  REDuCING OuR CLINKER FACTOR   TO CuT EMISSIONS We continue our efforts to reduce  CO2 emissions by increasing the  use of alternative cementitious  materials and reducing the  content of clinker in cement (the  clinker factor). For example, we are  increasingly using fly ash, a by-prod- uct of coal-fired power stations, blast  furnace slag, a by-product of the steel indus- try, and naturally occurring pozzolanic materials as  cementitious materials. In 1990, clinker comprised 84 percent  of our cement; by 2010, we had reduced the clinker content of  our cement to 76 percent. providing electricity to our neighboring cement plant. We will continue  to expand our use of renewable electricity wherever possible.   STATE-OF-THE-ART EquIPMENT bOOSTS ENERGY EFFICIENCY By replacing older equipment with state-of-the-art kilns, mills, and  other equipment, we increase thermal energy efficiency and reduce  power consumption significantly. The recently installed dry kiln at  our plant in Broceni, Latvia, for example, requires just about half as  much thermal energy to produce clinker as the wet kiln it replaced.  In the English port of Tilbury, our new cement grinding and blending  plant employs a vertical cement mill—the first of its kind in the UK— that consumes up to 40 percent less energy than a conventional mill. We are also redefining our logistics networks and processes to optimize  our transport methods in order to reduce  fuel consumption. We pur- chase from locally based suppliers and use rail, sea, and inland water- ways to optimize the delivery of our products. The distance raw materi- als travel is marginal as our cement kilns are located near quarries. EXPLORING NEW CARbON REDuCTION TECHNOLOGIES   AND POLICIES Much remains to be done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to  the levels that science calls for. CEMEX is committed to leadership in  both the research and policy development that will drive effective  climate management by the cement industry. For example, we are engaged in research on carbon capture and  storage (CCS) solutions—such as solid sorbent technologies,  biological capture using algae, and geological sequestration—that  can be integrated into cement production. In late 2009, the US  Department of Energys National Energy Technology Laboratory  granted CEMEX funding to conduct groundwork for the develop- ment and demonstration of a commercial-scale CCS project at  CEMEXs Odessa cement plant in Texas. This study, completed in 2010 jointly with other industrial partners,  concluded that commercial-scale CCS in the cement industry is not  yet ready for deployment. Significant research and development,  public-private cooperation, and funding, as well as policy changes,  will be required in order for CCS to realize its potential. With a grant  from CEMEX, Imperial College in the UK is carrying out additional  fundamental research on the subject.   For additional information on these and other initiatives, please  read our position paper on Carbon Capture and Storage avail- able for download in our website Using market incentives to reduce CO2 The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a market- based initiative that allows emission-reduction projects in develop- ing countries to earn certified emission-reduction credits that can be  sold on the open market.  INCREASING RENEWAbLE ELECTRICITY uSE AND   OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY  The production of cement requires significant amounts of both  fuels and electricity. For example, electricity is used for grinding raw  materials and the final product, ventilation of the kiln system, or  transport of materials in the plant. Although CEMEX does not control  emissions related to the generation of electricity by public utilities,  we can reduce them by optimizing the power consumption of our  plants and sourcing electricity from renewable sources.          DEvELOPING RENEWAbLE ENERGY SOuRCES CEMEX is committed to securing renewable electricity sources by either  contracting for power from existing providers or developing new renew- able energy projects ourselves, such as EURUS. About 25 percent of the  total electricity consumed by our Mexican cement operations comes  from EURUS, a 250-megawatt wind farm developed jointly by CEMEX  and ACCIONA, the worlds largest independent (nonutility) renewable  energy developer and owner. Our cement plant in Panama consumes  only electricity sourced from a hydropower plant. Moreover, in Rders- dorf, Germany, a waste-to-energy plant was built for the sole purpose of  34 —  disposing of community waste  in cement kilns With the high temperatures they attain, cement kilns are ideal  for safely disposing of waste materials while capturing the  recoverable energy in them—energy that might not other- wise be recovered at all. Using it as a fuel also avoids landfill- ing of waste, where its decomposition produces methane—a  greenhouse gas 25 times more damaging to the atmosphere  than CO2. CEMEX disposes of waste and by-products from industrial,  domestic, agricultural, and forestry processes, including used  tires, spent solvents and waste oils, processed municipal solid  waste, and biomass such as rice and coffee husks, animal  meal, and sewage sludge.  CEMEX has successfully registered four CDM projects, for a total  reduction of 850,000 tons of CO2 per year. Achieved in December  2010, the latest UNFCCC approval is for a project at our Zapotiltic,  Mexico, cement plant where alternative fuels will be used to substi- tute petcoke. CEMEX has a pipeline of more than a dozen additional  CDM projects under development that could significantly decrease  our total CO2 emissions. Partnerships and disclosure are essential   We believe that industry must work with government, NGOs and  peers to develop policies and practices that address a wide range of  environmental and related sustainability issues. CEMEX is a leading  participant in the following initiatives, among others: n The World Business Council for Sustainable Development Cement  Sustainability Initiative is a voluntary global effort through which  cement companies work together to find solutions to the sus- tainability issues that are most important to the cement industry.  CEMEX chairs its Communications Task Force and Concrete Sustain- ability Task Force. n Getting the Numbers Right (GNR) is a sector-wide global infor- mation database developed through the WBCSDs CSI. Covering  more than 800 cement facilities in more than 100 countries, GNR  provides accurate, verified data on the cement industrys CO2  emissions and energy performance. We have provided data to  GNR since 2007. The first report summarizing the industrys CO2  emissions, released in June of 2008, showed that while cement  production by participating companies increased by 53 percent  from 1990 to 2006, absolute net CO2 emissions increased by  only 35 percent. n The Steering Committee of the UN Caring for Climate Initia- tive is a government body through which business leaders and  government decision-makers discuss practical climate-change  solutions. n The Prince of Waless Corporate Leaders Group on Climate  Change (CLG) is a cross-sectorial group of business leaders  participating at the highest levels of policy debate surrounding  climate change.  n The Carbon Disclosure Project is a voluntary initiative that re- quests annual information on climate-change risk management  and performance.

FACING GLObAL ENvIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES The global scientific consensus, drawing on research such as the  Millennium Ecosystems Assessment and the United Nations Inter- governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report, is  that human activity is degrading the planets environmental health  and its ability to sustain current and future generations of life.  Global drivers for ecosystem decline include human population  growth, the need for improved living standards across the develop- ing world, increased consumption of goods, and trade flows associ- ated with that consumption. These factors are creating severe stress  across global ecosystems, impacting atmospheric balance, water and  land availability, and biodiversity. For example: n 60 percent of ecosystems services—including water purifica- tion, medicinal supply from plants, crop pollination, and carbon  sequestration—are already in decline1 n two-thirds of the worlds people will likely experience water stress  by 20252  sites were evaluated for their proximity to   high biodiversity value areas   of our active cement and aggregate sites have   quarry rehabilitation plans in place   543  85% 1  Millennium Ecosystems Assessment, United Nations Environment Programme, 2007 2  Global Environment Outlook (GEO4), United Nations Environment Programme, 2007 37 —  n driven by land degradation and climate change, 11 percent of ter- restrial species may be lost by 20503   But signs of environmental improvement can also be found. These  successes demonstrate that with adequate awareness, resources, and  political will, good practices can be widely implemented and replicat- ed. Business can and should play a critical role in leading this change.  CEMEX accepts this responsibility.  Independently and in partnership with other businesses and leading  NGOs, such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Develop- ment (WBCSD) and its Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI), we are  working to minimize the environmental impacts caused by our  operations and create environmental benefits whenever possible.  As pledged in the CEMEX Environmental Policy, we are more fully inte- grating management of these issues into business strategy, setting  meaningful performance indicators, developing measurement proto- cols, identifying best practices, and providing training and supervision  in order to drive continuous improvement.  ADDRESSING ALL OuR ENvIRONMENTAL IMPACTS  CEMEX uses a systematic approach to manage environmental issues.  Our global environmental strategy addresses all the environmental  impacts of our plants, quarries, and logistics, including emissions to  air, land, and water. We focus on these challenges not only to help  preserve the long-term health of people and ecosystems, but also  to build strong positive relationships with local communities and  preserve our social license to operate. Regional representatives who are responsible for environmental per- formance work together as an environmental council to coordinate  the alignment of local, regional, and global activities. The council has  guided adoption of the companys environmental strategy, promulga- tion of the environmental governance framework, and in 2011, will  assist in the implementation of CEMEXs new global Environmental  Management System (EMS).  IMPLEMENTING A CuSTOMIzED EMS GLObALLY Managing environmental issues consistently and well across all our  quarries and cement, ready-mix, and aggregates locations is a com- plex undertaking. Currently, 76 percent of our operations have an EMS  in place, 18 percent have an ISO 14001 certification. Over the past  year, a team of experienced, multinational CEMEX professionals has  worked to develop a customized global EMS that is compatible with  ISO 14001.  Pilot implementation of the new EMS will begin during  2011 with global rollout in 2012.   The global EMS will set a standard approach for managing air quality,  biodiversity, water use, waste management, environmental distur- bances, and environmental incidents. CEMEX will use it to:   n ensure legal compliance n identify environmental issues and their impacts  n establish objectives, targets, and corresponding action plans million in environmental capital  expenditure in 2010 n ensure compliance with CEMEXs standards and guidelines n drive continuous performance improvement and common  reporting  One early achievement has been the restatement of incident defini- tions so that they are clearer and more objective. These clarifications  enhance the comparability of incident reports and the insights from  root-cause analyses. Ems Goals Target Pilot implementation of EMS in selected countries 2011 Full implementation and compliance with CEMEX EMS 2015 ACHIEvING AIR EMISSIONS TARGETS AHEAD OF SCHEDuLE We have made a significant investment to effectively monitor air  emissions from our cement production facilities. Major emissions  include dust, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur compounds (SOx).  Other pollutants, such as dioxins, furans, volatile organic compounds,  and heavy metals (including mercury), are usually found in very small  quantities. By controlling and monitoring emissions, while comply- ing with all applicable national and local laws and regulations, we  have achieved significant reductions ahead of our 2015 target date.  Our efforts include: n investing in equipment to reduce major emissions (dust, NOx, SOx) n establishing the status analysis for minor emissions at cement  kilns (evaluating the emissions fingerprint of each kiln to deter- mine if additional controls are needed) n developing guidelines for handling fuels and emissions  n participating in industry-based efforts and multi-stakeholder  dialogues to develop methods for addressing mercury and dioxin  emissions n reporting emissions in accordance with the CSI reporting protocol 3  The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity Report, TEEB, 2010 Us$93 CEMEXs Rudniki Cement Plant in Poland 38 —  74%  or our clinker produced with continuous monitoring of major emissions 16%  reduction of dust emissions per ton of clinker produced from 2009    7%  increase of nox emissions per ton of clinker produced from 2009 19%  reduction of sox emissions per ton of clinker produced from 2009 air Emissions Goals Target 2010 Progress Clinker produced with continuous monitoring of  major emissions (dust, NOX, and SOX) (%) Monitor 50% of clinker production by 2010  Monitor 100% of production by 2015 2010 target achieved; 74% of clinker pro- duced with monitoring.

In many  parts of the world, freshwater resources are under pressure and ac- cess to water is already constrained by competing priorities. Water scarcity will lead to various social and business challenges that  can affect CEMEX operations, among them: n higher water costs n limited availability of clean water n stronger regulations regarding access to land, water withdrawals,  and wastewater treatment n competition with other users, including local communities Fresh Water: The Essence of Life In 2010 we published Fresh Water: The Essence of Life, the  18th title in the CEMEX Conservation Book Series. This book  focuses on Earths freshwater supplies and ecosystems, show- ing how they are essential for human survival and that they  are in rapid decline. It also offers realistic solutions and actions  to be implemented now to protect them. Begun in 1993, The CEMEX Conservation  Book Series program is an editorial part- nership with the International League of  Conservation Photographers and other  leading conservation organizations.

It is within our grasp to adapt to the conditions we have  created and to mitigate our impact on the future, but the  window of opportunity is closing. Now is the time to reclaim  our humility in relationship to the Earths fresh water and to  resurrect an understanding of how interdependent we are  with these ecosystems.

Additionally, water  is a primary component of concrete, representing an average of  15 percent of the mixture. It is also used for cooling and preparing  slurry for cement, washing aggregates, and cleaning plants and  equipment, including concrete delivery trucks. In our operations,  therefore, we seek to increase water efficiency and recycling and  to carefully control our water emissions, such as hydrocarbons and  suspended solids.  Additionally, some of our quarries are in contact with aquifers and  can cause changes in ground water levels. However, quarry reha- bilitation can also contribute to the conservation and restoration of  wetlands and watersheds and can offer water storage solutions and  help mitigate floods.  In 2010, we began a three-year partnership with the International Union  for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to strengthen our approach to water  issues. IUCN is the worlds oldest and largest global environmental  network.  In this partnership, we will develop a strategy to minimize  CEMEXs impacts on water availability and quality and take better advan- tage of our water-related opportunities by effective water policies and  management systems. The partnership will also develop the tools— operating standards and guidelines, measurement protocols and key in- dicators, best practices, and training materials—we need to implement  the strategy. In the first phase, to be completed in 2011, we will: n more precisely assess CEMEXs global water footprint n map operational sites against key water issues and identify   CEMEXs most sensitive sites n analyze water trends and stakeholders expectations with regard  to water issues n explore the role of business in working with stakeholders at the  local level to develop sustainable solutions to watershed man- agement n identify the highest priority issues and begin developing ap- proaches to address them 40 —  11%  reduction in total disposed  hazardous waste compared  to 2009  9%   reduction in total disposed  non-hazardous waste  Beyond 2011, the partnership will continue in order to develop and  adopt a corporate water strategy and provide our operations with  the appropriate tools and standards to manage water impacts. ACHIEvING SIGNIFICANT REDuCTIONS IN WASTE DISPOSAL At CEMEX, we have adopted a manifold waste-reduction strategy  based on the philosophy of monitor, minimize, reuse, and recycle. In  2010, this strategy enabled us to reduce, compared to 2009, hazard- ous waste by 11 percent to 74,553 tons, and non-hazardous waste by  9 percent to 215,788 tons, saving significant resources and money.   Our processes generate waste that is disposed of according to our own  standards and the requirements of the law. In terms of operational  wastes, cement kiln dust represents the largest amount of waste we pro- duce. We now reuse it in the production process and other processes. As  we follow the waste hierarchy, we seek to monitor, minimize, reuse, and  recycle our wastes. The actions we undertake in this area include: n monitoring of hazardous and non-hazardous waste generation in  all our operations n replacing primary aggregates with other discarded materials (e.g.  glass and demolished concrete) n reusing and recycling, insofar as possible, the fresh concrete  returned from construction sites ENvIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT CEMEX has achieved significant reductions in the number and  severity of environmental incidents. By combining technology and  careful planning, we minimize disturbances such as noise, vibration,  vehicular traffic, unsightly aesthetics, and fugitive dust. Noise reduction We mitigate the noise associated with our opera- tions through operational controls and measures such as noise  suppression, isolation of noise sources, and careful scheduling of  blasting activities. To the degree it is possible, we avoid working at  night in our quarry operations and coordinate our blasting sched- ule to minimize disturbance. Traffic calming To minimize traffic congestion, and as part of our sus- tainable transport approach, we look for non-truck ways to move raw  materials and products. Many sites use conveyor belts to move raw  materials from the quarry, and whenever feasible we use multimodal  systems comprising road, rail, and water to transport products. We  operate and maintain our vehicle fleets to ensure community safety  and, by the use of strategic route planning, avoid unnecessary truck  traffic during peak travel hours.  These efforts reduce noise, vibrations,  and congestion, as well as energy use, CO2 emissions, and costs.  Dust minimization We use dust collection systems at our opera- tions and dust-suppression methods in roads, crushers, and conveyor  belt systems. In addition, we maintain trees and other vegetation on  and around our operations to prevent erosion, improve area aesthet- ics, and create a noise barrier.   striving towards zero environmental incidents Our goal—zero environmental incidents such as spills or uncontrolled  emissions—is a priority throughout CEMEX and a responsibility that  extends from our top management team to each individual operator. 41 —  learning from past events to prevent future environmental  problems As important as preventing and immediately responding to the  effects of incidents are our efforts to learn from them in order to  prevent future occurrences. Incident reports and trends are re- viewed at every level of our company, including our top manage- ment team. We have developed company-wide standards and definitions to  report and record incidents consistently and accurately using an on- line tool. This standardization enables us to identify the root causes  of incidents, develop solutions, and disseminate corrective action  plans based on best practices. To reinforce the integrity of reporting  procedures, CEMEX business unit leaders train operations managers  at the country level; the managers, in turn, train their own teams.  We are also developing standardized analytical tools and sharing  best practices to increase the utility and transparency of our incident  reporting systems.  bIODIvERSITY MANAGEMENT At CEMEX, we recognize the importance of conserving biodiversity  and ecosystems—for their own intrinsic value and because they are  necessary for the sustainability of our society and the planet. Healthy  ecosystems provide food, fibers, medicines, natural regulation of  climate variability and water flows; they also support climate change  adaptation and mitigation and help to moderate extreme weather  events, among other ecosystem services. CEMEXs operations can potentially affect habitats and species,  especially through land clearance for quarrying and emissions to air  and water. The opening, operation, and closing of our cement and  aggregates sites, in particular, can potentially affect biodiversity and  ecosystem health through habitat degradation, species disturbance,  changes in groundwater levels, discharges to water bodies, and dust  emissions. CEMEX, however, can also contribute to biodiversity con- servation by providing valuable habitat for specific species.  For these reasons, we are committed to being a responsible stew- ard of the land we manage and to conducting our operations in a  sustainable manner, and thereby protect the biodiversity within our  operations and maximize our contribution to nature conservation. Prioritizing sites with high biodiversity value and enhance- ment potential In 2010, CEMEX completed a multi-year scoping study on the bio- diversity status of our worldwide operations. This study was under- taken as part of our ten-year partnership with BirdLife International.  The Biodiversity Scoping Study prioritizes 543 CEMEX cement and  aggregates operations worldwide in terms of biodiversity sensitiv- ity and opportunities, based on both their proximity to areas of  importance for biodiversity and their current biodiversity manage- ment practices. It represents a significant milestone in the CEMEX- 2  Category 1 incidents in 2010,  compared to 8 in 2009*  *  Category 1 incidents are defined as major uncontrolled spills or releases beyond  site boundary in breach of internal control procedures that might result in legal  action and threat to operating license. Part of this reduction is due to the reduc- tion in the number of sites operating during 2010 as a result of temporary site  closures and divestment from our Australia operations. However, we recognize that, despite our best efforts, occasional inci- dents can ocur. Therefore, we maintain the capacity to respond to any  emergency, natural or manmade, that poses a potential threat to our  neighbors, host communities, or operations. We start with a founda- tion of using quality equipment and technology and applying best op- erating practices and safety standards. We then work with our neigh- bors, regulatory authorities, public agencies, and other stakeholders  to develop contingency plans at each site. We also have Emergency  Response Teams that are specifically trained to address environmen- tal incidents; to ensure their preparedness, they complete annual  emergency drills. Furthermore, we constantly monitor our operations  to receive early warnings and detect incidents as soon as possible. Our  tracking of environmental indicators, such as emissions and water use,  can provide early warnings of potential problems before they become  actual spills or unexpected emissions. In 2010, we reduced the number  of Category 1 incidents to only 2, from 8 incidents in 2009.*   42 —  543  CeMeX sites evaluated for their  proximity to high biodiversity value areas  and biodiversity enhancement potential 131  sites within, containing, or  adjacent to high biodiversity value areas  38% of sites with high biodiversity  value have implemented biodiversity  management plans 1 Such as international and national protected areas, Important Bird Areas (IBA), Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA), and  Natura 2000 sites.  2 Often with assistance from local BirdLife Partners or other conservation organizations.  3 Require further investigation to ensure that impacts on biodiversity are appropriately considered.

Of the 543 CEMEX sites assessed, 131 overlap with an area of high  biodiversity value such as international and national protected  areas, important bird areas, key biodiversity areas, and Natura 2000  sites. The study further differentiates the 131 sites according to  their national, regional, or global relevance: 109 are of national or  regional importance and 22 sites have a global relevance. Among  the 22 globally important sites, 10 have already implemented  voluntary conservation projects, often with assistance from local  BirdLife Partners or other conservation organizations. The other 12  sites have the potential to enhance biodiversity management and  require further investigation to ensure that impacts on biodiversity  are appropriately considered. They were identified as priority sites  and will be given highest priority for conservation efforts.   Please see results of the study in graphs below.   The practical outputs of the study are maps and databases that  provide detailed information on the biodiversity characteristics of  each operational site. This knowledge will enhance site-level land  management decision making. The scoping study provides the baseline analysis from which the  strategy is to progressively implement biodiversity action plans  (BAPs) for all the sites that overlap with important biodiversity areas,  starting with the 12 priority sites. Ultimately, CEMEXs objective is for  100 percent of these 131 sites to have a BAP in place by 2015.  To help this process, we are currently working with BirdLife to  develop a BAP standard and projects have been started at 2 prior- ity sites in Spain and the UK. The standard will guide the operations  on how to: assess the biodiversity context and potential impacts of  sites, set conservation objectives and actions, monitor and report the  progress against targets, and engage with stakeholders.  Wherever  possible, local BirdLife Partner organizations will assist CEMEX opera- tions in the development and implementation of such plans. 43 —  CEmEx biodiversity policy In 2010, we adopted a new Biodiversity Policy to guide our actions in the field of biodiversity conservation. Through this statement, we  renew our commitment to being a responsible steward of the land we manage and to conducting our operations in a sustainable manner.  More specifically, we will: n Ensure compliance with all relevant legislation and align our biodiversity initiatives with our business model so that biodiversity is  considered in our decision making processes and management systems, throughout the lifecycle of sites. n Assess, prevent wherever possible and reduce the biodiversity impacts of our operations and seek opportunities for biodiversity  enhancement initiatives that contribute to local, national and global conservation priorities. n Prioritize our operational sites for their biodiversity value and adopt a systematic management approach for sites with high biodiver- sity potential. n Establish constructive relationships with local, national and international stakeholders to generate synergies and contribute to knowl- edge and best practices development. n Provide instruction and training to encourage greater awareness among our employees and other stakeholders. n Monitor and review our performance against measurable targets and industry best practices to drive continuous improvement and  report on the results achieved.  The full CEMEX Biodiversity Policy can be found on www.cemex.com The recently completed CEMEX-BirdLife Biodiversity Scoping Study is an ideal platform  from which CEMEX can build effective biodiversity management and conservation work  across its operations. I hope that CEMEX can now move quickly to develop and imple- ment a focused biodiversity strategy as part of the wider Sustainability Vision, with a  clear overall goal and explicit targets and measures referring to the baselines in the  Scoping Study. This strategy would consolidate CEMEXs commitment to biodiversity  conservation and further raise the standard of the companys sustainability reporting. It  would also be a fitting way to mark the start of the UN Decade of Biodiversity in 2011.

Thus, our quarry rehabilitation  work aims to create sustainable quarries,   simultaneously minimizing  negative impact and contributing to local development. We are committed to implement quarry rehabilitation plans at all  of our operating sites by 2015. At year-end 2010, 85 percent of our  sites had such plans in place. In addition, we continue to work with  our industry peers in the Cement Sustainability Initiative to estab- lish Quarry Rehabilitation Guidelines and help raise the standard of  rehabilitation projects. successful quarry rehabilitation concludes with donation of  6,000 acres in Colombia In 2010 we donated 6,000 acres of land to Chingaza National Natural  Park in central Colombia. The donation of the land to the countrys  park service was the final step of the quarrys restoration and an op- portunity for CEMEX to give back to the central Colombian commu- nity. Chingaza Park is located an hour from the capital city of Bogota  and is a crucial part of the countrys ecosystem. It provides drinking  water for nearly 11 million people in central Colombia and is home  to numerous rare plant and animal species.

Owned by CEMEX and other private landowners, El Carmen is home to more than 500 species of plants, 289 species of  birds, 80 species of mammals,  65 kinds of reptiles and amphibians, and149 species of butterflies. The initiative uses scientific  research and proven habitat and wildlife management practices to restore and protect the landscape, native grasslands, and  wildlife species. El Carmen staff also provides guidance on habitat and wildlife restoration to our partners and interested adja- cent landowners. Solar and wind-power generator systems are used to provide renewable energy to the facilities at El Carmen. Over the past ten years, El Carmen has averaged two research projects per year, with an average of two scientific papers pub- lished annually.  The table below shows the strong response to wildlife restoration in El Carmen thus far, as well as the projection for the next  five years. Please note the highlighted large mammal species, which were extinct in the region for more than 50 years and  required complete reintroduction. Through the donation of the land to Chin- gaza National Natural Park, CEMEX conveys  a message of commitment to the environ- ment and sustainable development. The re- sponsible and controlled use of land resourc- es guarantees respect for nature and, in turn,  community development. This is an example  that other companies should follow.

To further this commitment, we  are implementing new standards, in- creasing accountability, and providing  more training and information.  CREATING A CONTINuALLY SAFER, HEALTHIER CEMEX  The safety, health, and well-being of our employees, contractors,  and the third parties affected by our operations are CEMEXs high- est priority. That is why we have introduced industry-leading safety  systems to identify and address risks, innovative employee health  initiatives to promote well-being, and line-manager ownership of  health and safety to ensure that programs are implemented and led  as effectively as possible.  Despite our commitment, fatalities increased last year. Such trag- edies are unacceptable, and we must learn from the findings of our  investigations. We are redoubling our safety training and incident- prevention measures. In 2011, we are radically changing our ap- proach to safety. Leaders at all levels of the company will be held  personally accountable for improving the safety performance of their  operations. In addition, we will launch new health and safety policies  and implement our new Health and Safety Management System. decrease in employee lti frequency rate  in 2010 decrease in lost work days in 2010 19% 40% 47 —  PRIORITIzING HEALTH AND SAFETY THROuGHOuT OuR  OPERATIONS While health and safety programs are, by necessity, implemented at  the country and site level, the chain of responsibility and monitoring  extends from CEMEXs top management team and Board of Direc- tors. Line management, supported by health and safety specialists in  the country, implement programs by communicating standards, pro- viding appropriate equipment and training, conducting risk assess- ments and monitoring compliance. Line management is responsible  and accountable for implementing initiatives, investigating incidents,  and demonstrating correct safety behaviors. In other words, country  and business unit leaders ensure that our actions meet CEMEXs  commitments and objectives. Oversight, review, and guidance con- tinue all the way up through regional and company-wide levels to  the Sustainability Committee, which reports progress and challenges  to the top management team.  1           2         3         4           5           6           7           8           9       1 0       1 1     1 2       1 3     1 4   Leadership & accountability Risk management Regulation policies Driving safety Contractor Management Health People, training & behaviours Communication & consultation Document control Std. operating procedures Operation control Emergency management Incident invest. & reporting prevention Audits, inspect. & continuous  improvement                                                                           P L A N N I N G                                             I M P L E M E N T A T I O N   &   O P E R A T I O N S                              C H E C K I N G M AN AG EM EN T RE VI E W Board of Directors MANAGEMENT TEAM Regional and Country Presidents Americas and EMEAA  Sustainability Coordinators Sustainability Country Operations Chairman & CEO EVP Planning &Finance VP Technology & Procurement Sustainability Committee HSMS framework Corporate  H&S Director EVP Administration President EMEAA President Americas TAKING A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO MANAGING HEALTH AND  SAFETY PERFORMANCE As part of our continuous effort to strengthen ownership and ac- countability for health and safety by line management, we devel- oped the CEMEX Health and Safety Management System (HSMS) in  2010. Aligned with OHSAS 18001, the risk-based HSMS clearly sets  out the companys expectations of managers in terms of health and  safety performance. The HSMS includes performance requirements  and supporting guidance and tools for managers to help them  implement our health and safety strategies through: n risk assessments n system audits and site inspections  n health and safety training and development n performance monitoring and tracking n emergency preparedness n incident investigation  n identification and sharing of lessons learned and best practices CEMEX SAFETY ORGANIzATION AND  COMMuNICATION STRuCTuRE 48 —  HSMS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FRAMEWORK  The HSMS framework outlines CEMEXs commitment to Health and Safety and the requirements of  top management for the effective management of health and safety, as well as incident prevention. It also provides the foundation for the HSMS Framework, which de- scribes the 14 elements that comprise our comprehensive approach  to managing risk and improving safety and well-being at CEMEX. We  begin with leadership and accountability: we expect everyone at CEMEX  to comply with our policies, and we hold managers accountable for  the safety of their operations. We then plan the needed initiatives and  support, execute the plans, and track and monitor our progress and  challenges. In an ongoing process, the performance metrics are used to  reinforce leadership and accountability and to develop new initiatives. The CEMEX HSMS will be used to support sites and businesses across  the company globally with the objective to:  n identify and reduce risks to all persons n develop supporting standards and guidelines  n share best health and safety practices throughout the company n continually improve the health, safety, reliability, and efficiency of  operations 1           2         3         4           5           6           7           8           9       1 0       1 1     1 2       1 3     1 4   Leadership & accountability Risk management Regulation policies Driving safety Contractor Management Health People, training & behaviours Communication & consultation Document control Std. operating procedures Operation control Emergency management Incident invest. & reporting prevention Audits, inspect. & continuous  improvement                                                                           P L A N N I N G                                             I M P L E M E N T A T I O N   &   O P E R A T I O N S                              C H E C K I N G M AN AG EM EN T RE VI E W THE 14 ELEMENTS OF THE  CEMEX H&S MANAGEMENT  SYSTEM FRAMEWORK 98%  operations with a safety management system in 2010 (unchanged from 2009) 79%  operations with a health management system in 2010 (+4% from 2009)  CEMEXs new Health and Safety  Management System set for  pilot testing in 2011 During 2010 we developed a practical, risk-based Health  and Safety Management System (HSMS) that will be rolled  out globally in 2011.

TRAINING OuR LEADERS TO FOCuS ON SAFE PRODuCTION We are striving to make CEMEX safer by implementing robust safety  systems and standards, and by strengthening safety leadership capa- bilities to create a safety culture focused on achieving zero incidents.  The foundation of these efforts is LEGACY.  Developed in 2009, LEGACY is our companys in-house flagship  safety leadership program designed to help us achieve our goal  of zero incidents. One of its chief objectives is to shift manage- ment focus from production to safe production. When fully  implemented, LEGACY will equip managers at all levels with the  tools, skills, and behavioral standards required to lead safer, more  efficient operations. LEGACY, which is organized around the seven behaviors of effec- tive safety leadership, covers themes such as leading by example,  understanding processes and people, and ensuring accountability.  The course complements other behavior-based safety programs  previously established in certain company operations, such as Visible  Felt Leadership and 365.  We will continue implementing LEGACY in 2011. We will begin  training in the countries that do not yet have it, and in countries that  have completed the first phase, we will expand the training to top- level managers who did not yet complete it. In 2010, we completed  LEGACY training for 2,108 CEMEX supervisors and managers. Our  goal is for all individuals in leadership roles to have completed the  training by 2015. IMPROvING SAFETY THROuGHOuT OuR OPERATIONS CEMEX has steadily reduced on-site employee injuries and fatal  incidents, but significant improvement is still needed with regard to  transport activities and contract drivers, which represent a major- ity of the 2010 fatalities. In 2010, there were two on-site employee  fatalities and zero employee or contractor fatalities from working  at height. However, we must significantly improve our transport  activities and management of contract drivers. We deeply regret the  deaths of 46 employees, contractors, and third parties in connection  with CEMEX activities in 2010. The majority of these fatalities resulted  from one incident in September 2010 involving a CEMEX truck and a  public bus in which 12 bus passengers died.   REDuCING LOST-TIME INjuRIES IN 2010 In 2010, we had a lost-time injury (LTI) rate of 2.6 and lost the  equivalent of approximately 15,600 work days. While this rate slightly  exceeds our target of 2.5 for 2010, it marks a significant improvement  over 2009 with a 19 percent decrease. This progress reflects that  fewer people were injured, their injuries were less severe, and they  were able to return to work more quickly. We will continue to address the risks that cause incidents and inju- ries. In 2011 we will focus on improving near-miss reporting to better  identify the root and system causes of incidents that typically result  in lost-time injuries. We are launching this system and conducting pilot audits in 2011,  and it will be fully implemented in all operations over the course of  the next five years.  APPLYING ROOT-CAuSE ANALYSIS TO LEARN FROM INCIDENTS  Over the past two years, we have steadily improved our use of  root-cause investigation tools and methodologies to understand  why incidents happen in our operations. In 2010 root-cause  investigations involving line leadership and technical and safety  specialists were completed for every fatal incident (both CEMEX  culpable and non-culpable incidents), and corrective and preven- tive action plans were implemented. Despite this effort, we rec- ognize that there are opportunities to further improve the skills  of investigation teams and their understanding of the root-cause  analysis process. To further our performance, we have developed  a training program that will not only enable us to better under- stand underlying causes of safety incidents, but also identify as- 50 —  MEETING THE GREATEST CHALLENGE: DRIvING AND  CONTRACTOR SAFETY   Driving-related incidents involving our employees, contractors, and  the public represent the majority of fatalities in our company and the  industry. Furthermore, approximately 60 percent of all fatalities in the  CSI database are related to contractor activities. In 2009, we led the CSI Driving Safety Working Group in its devel- opment of industry-wide standards to address driving risks and  incidents and to measure progress in reducing incidents and injuries.  The CSI Recommended Good Practice for Driving Safety outlines  practices for drivers, their managers, and transport management  contractors. Similarly, the Recommended Good Practice for Contrac- tor Safety outlines performance standards and requirements for  contractors and contractor managers. IMPLEMENTING THE CSI SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS All 21 CSI member companies approved these practices in October  2009 and are expected to fully implement them in their operations  by 2014. In 2010, we immediately began implementation by con- safety Goals Targets Eliminate employee, contractor, and third-party fatalities  0 fatalities Reduce employee lost-time injuries (LTI rate) 0.5 by 2015 Full compliance with CSI Driving and Contractor Safety Recommended Practices December 2014 Full compliance with CEMEX Health and Safety Management System (through risk- based governance audits) 2015 100% top management trained in LEGACY (CEMEX Safety Leadership Program) 2015 2,108 CeMeX supervisors and managers  completed legACy training in 2010 51 —  ducting a baseline gap analysis across all of the countries in which  we operate to determine the level of compliance with the CSI Rec- ommended Practices. On average, we achieved 64 percent compli- ance with the driving standards and 63 percent compliance with the  contractor safety standards. Each country will now implement action  plans and track and report progress in order to achieve 100 percent  compliance by the end of 2014. In addition to the CSI-related efforts, we incorporated driving safety  and contractor safety as high-priority elements in the CEMEX HSMS.  The majority of our operations already have a driving certification  program that individuals must complete before they can drive CE- MEX vehicles as well as systems for addressing poor driver behaviors.  Under the HSMS, management will be audited against the require- ments of the Driving and Contactor Safety elements to advance the  companys leadership in these areas. FOCuSING ON ENSuRING GREATER DRIvING SAFETY It is clear that more work must be done to ensure driving safety. We  operate in geographies where road infrastructure is poorly devel- oped and road safety culture is still maturing. CEMEX will continue  to advocate for stricter driving regulations and enforcement in these  regions. Meanwhile, we will continue to improve our management  of those factors we can control, such as training and selection of  drivers, journey planning and risk assessment, vehicle specification,  and site safety. We are also increasing accountability at all levels for  driving safety performance. We believe these efforts will not only  reduce the risks to CEMEX but also make the communities in which  we live and work safer. INvESTING IN OCCuPATIONAL AND PREvENTIvE HEALTH CARE We are empowering employees to improve their personal health  by raising awareness, providing information, and offering assis- tance. Based on the work of our global health council and other  CEMEX Global Safety Awards Since 2000, the annual CEMEX Global Safety Awards have recognized business units and country-level operations that have built and  continually improved their safety culture to achieve superior safety performance. Businesses and countries are judged based on six  criteria: safety performance and continual improvement, safety leadership, innovative practices to reduce risk, incident investigation,  analysis, and follow-up and near-miss reporting.

Our  goal is to improve each employees health by offering beneficial  occupational and preventive health programs.  All of our health programs—whether voluntary or required by local  law—are designed according to four basic principles that we have  integrated into our Health and Safety Management System:  n Information and promotion of health topics Better-informed  employees can prevent or reduce health-related risks; therefore, we  make information on a range of health topics readily accessible.  n Vaccinations We have a permanent program that provides our  employees, and in some cases their families, with vaccines. n Timely diagnosis Prevention and early detection of health issues  are critical; therefore, at 96 percent of our operations, we have a  qualified health professional on site or offer access to an external  health provider.  n Rehabilitation We help employees identify the best recuperation  and rehabilitation options following illness or incident.  An essential component of Health Essentials is communication.  Each  month we provide materials—presentations, brochures, flyers, post- ers, self-evaluation tests, and recommended actions—related to that  months featured topic. Some essentials, such as Lung Power and Safeguard Your Back,  reflect the risks that many employees face during their daily work at  CEMEX. Others, such as Healthy Heart, Vaccines, and Prevent Stress,  focus on preventive care and improved daily habits (e.g., healthful  eating, regular exercise, and annual exams). By unifying health ef- forts in all our operations and promoting a culture of well-being at  CEMEX, we promote improved employee health and quality of life;  reduce incidents, sick days, and healthcare costs; and build trust. 53 —  45,099 families improved their homes  through Patrimonio hoy strengthen   local  COMMUNITIES 54 —  CEMEXs operations are often  an important part of local  communities. We employ com- munity members, work with  local suppliers, and contribute  to the community through tax  payments, social investments,  and on-the-ground programs. Our goal is to always be a good neighbor and trusted member of the  community.  MAKING A POSITIvE IMPACT IN EvERY COMMuNITY WE SERvE Although we are a global company, the impacts of our operations— both positive and negative— are felt locally. Accordingly, we seek  to develop strong long-term relationships with local community  members. We engage with the communities where we live and work to more  fully understand their needs and concerns. We collaborate with com- munity members, local and regional organizations, and governments  to develop and implement social-investment programs that yield  positive economic and environmental returns, promote citizenship,  empower people, and help build a foundation for long-term well- being. And where possible, we seek to realize business benefits from  these programs. Increasingly, we also join national and international  policy discussions so that the positive impacts of our contributions  can be magnified.  of our operations have community engagement  plans, a 14% increase from 2009 of our operations have employee volunteering  programs 97% 41% 55 —  buILDING TRuST THROuGH OPEN DIALOGuE  Community relations are managed at the country level so that they  can be tailored to the particular circumstances of each locale. Before  we open, close, or change local operations, we talk with our neigh- bors in order to improve our mutual understanding of needs and  concerns. Approximately 97 percent of our operations have commu- nity engagement plans, which help us to identify the communities  near our operations, our impacts on them, and their needs; and then  develop and implement effective, site-specific social programs. Our  new Environmental Management System will also include a require- ment that all business units consider community concerns when  identifying the potential effects of our operations. Though details  are determined locally, the community plans must be in accordance  with CEMEXs social-investment guidelines. These internal guidelines  provide a common framework for the planning and execution of all  of our social-investment strategies: programs we run directly, pro- Learning from our neighbors In Colombia, we have three formalized mechanisms for community engagement:  neighbor committees, a complaint management system, and social responsibility  programs. During meetings with the public, the neighbor committee listens to the  communitys concerns and follows up on previously raised issues. Individuals can  also communicate concerns and receive timely responses through our complaint  management system. Promoting and participating in social responsibility programs  related to housing, education, and environmental issues give us the opportunity to  spend time in the communities with our neighbors and support their development.  Our programs in Mexico focus on continuous dialogue with our neighboring com- munities. Through these conversations, we learn about community needs and work  together to address them in a sustainable way.

Our efforts include  the following: n promoting access to affordable housing and improved infrastruc- ture for low-income families in developing countries  n supporting education and training opportunities in schools and  universities, including funding cultural and sporting activities n promoting self-employment and the development of microbusi- nesses within local communities Woman participates in the  concrete block production  process in a CPA in Mexico 56 —  Recognizing Patrimonio Hoys  success  2006 - Wins the World Business Award 2007 - Receives the Corporate Citizen of the Americas Award 2009 – Honored with the United Nations HABITAT Business  Award in the category of accessible housing solutions n fostering local environmental awareness n encouraging employee volunteering n contributing to disaster relief PROMOTING ACCESS TO buILDING MATERIALS AND SERvICES One of the most important ways in which CEMEX helps to reduce  global poverty is by providing low-income customers access to  building materials and services. We do this by creating programs that  align the values and commercial objectives of our business with the  needs of the communities we serve—generating long-term benefits  for all. In addition, we advocate policies and financing models that  will enable countries around the world to adopt development plans  based on our programs. CEMEX has several initiatives that help families and communities  to build and renovate homes and construct and renovate commu- nity infrastructure and buildings. The programs also provide social  benefits such as job and skills training for community members and  volunteer opportunities for CEMEX employees. Patrimonio Hoy: much more than a house Our premiere achievement in low-income housing is our award- winning Patrimonio Hoy program, a self-sustaining social enterprise  with more than 100 offices in Latin America, that enables families to  build or improve their homes more quickly, more efficiently, and with  better materials—concrete, cement blocks, and steel—than would  otherwise be possible within their means.  Since 1998, Patrimonio Hoy has provided affordable building  materials and services and US$169 million in microfinancing to  more than 300,000 families in five countries. In 2010 alone, 45,099  families benefited from the program. Sixty percent of participants  in Mexico say they would not have been able to build their home  without the program. In addition, Patrimonio Hoy promotes local economic development  and creates jobs for local masons and other workers. In particular, it  provides opportunities for meaningful work for women. Most local  Patrimonio Hoy promoters—the individuals who sell and admin- ister the loans—are women, half of whom had no work experience  prior to joining the program.

We are currently developing an initiative similar to Patrimonio Hoy  in the Philippines: a comprehensive community development plan  for low-income communities using housing as a core driver. The pro- gram will provide microfinancing for those who need to build new  houses, as well as those who need to rehabilitate homes that were  severely damaged by Typhoon Ondoy. Construapoyo: a model for disaster response and   long-term relief Begun in 2005 to provide disaster relief to the survivors of Hurricanes  Stan and Wilma in Mexico, this program has since been used in  other government-subsidized housing and community infrastruc- ture initiatives because it is both efficient and transparent. Regional  governments identify beneficiaries and provide funds for building or  rebuilding, which CEMEX distributes in the form of debit cards. We  make results available online to government officials. In 2010, ap- proximately 28,000 individuals benefited from ConstruApoyo.  lazos familiares: building community institutions Since 2005, Lazos Familiares has helped communities build and  renovate local institutions and public facilities such as health centers,  hospitals, orphanages, and schools. CEMEX and more than 625 of  its clients and distributors donate materials and building assistance.  Working alongside individuals from the communities, employee  volunteers help communities complete the work more quickly and  efficiently. In 2010, six projects were completed representing more  than 3,000 square meters of built or renovated infrastructure, benefit- ing close to 700 people. To date, individuals have completed more  than 45 projects representing a total of 15,037 square meters of built  or renovated community infrastructure, benefiting more than 33,600  people. mejora tu Calle: facilitating community movement This CEMEX initiative helps communities and governments work to- gether to improve neighborhoods by using microloans from CEMEX  CEmEx again honored at the World business and Development awards The World Business and Development Awards are international awards organized by the United Nations Devel- opment Program, the International Chamber of Commerce, and the International Business Leader Fund. In 2010  the Awards recognized CEMEX for its contributions to achieving the Millennium Development Goals through  programs that foster and facilitate development, including Centros Productivos de Autoempleo. This is the third time in four years that CEMEX was recognized by the United Nations for offering viable, innovative  solutions for low-income families to improve their quality of life. to pay for the concrete paving of streets and sidewalks. By com- bining community contributions with government funding, most  projects are completed in just 70 weeks—much faster than the 10  years it often takes low-income neighborhoods to complete these  projects. The results: easier travel, safer neighborhoods, improved  access to public services, and increased income and property values  in the communities served.  Since the program began in 2005, more than 35,000 microloans  have financed 400,000 square meters of paving in 12 municipalities,  benefiting 7,000 low-income families. We are seeking to replicate  the Mejora tu Calle model in more Mexican municipalities; as the  program continues to succeed in Mexico, we will replicate it in other  countries in Latin America.  Centros Productivos de autoempleo (CPa): pursuing do-it- yourself construction In this program, CEMEX partners with municipal or state authori- ties, as well as NGOs and communities, to establish community  centers where low-income families can temporarily work. Partici- 58 —  CEMEXs investment in local communities is aligned with  its values and business objectives. Through innovative mar- ket-based solutions like Patrimonio hoy and Mejora tu  Calle, CEMEX addresses the housing needs of low-income  families and paving of streets and sidewalks. Through its  community centers, CEMEX provides self-employment  programs that contribute to the economic and social de- velopment of the communities. CEMEX also assists commu- nities in times of great need and devastation by providing  assistance for community rebuilding. Notwithstanding the results achieved to date, CEMEX  faces challenges in replicating its social enterprise suc- cess model in other countries. The company also needs to  improve the development and measurement of key per- formance indicators, verified by independent institutions,  which show the impact of their CSR programs on the well  being of the communities. Irma Gmez  Advisory panel member pants produce concrete blocks and other precast products, half  of which they can use to build, repair, or expand their homes.  Municipal or state governments purchase the other half for infra- structure development. The resulting proceeds are reinvested in  the centers to make them self-sustaining. In 2010, we used CPAs  to assist the victims of Hurricane Alex in northern Mexico (see  page 61 for more information). Also in 2010, we expanded the CPA program to Colombia, where it is  called Bloqueras Solidarias, through a partnership with the Inter- American Development Bank (IADB). This collaboration, through  which the IADB is providing 35 percent of the financing for the first  18 months, allows CEMEX to leverage its investment to help more  families and, by extension, their communities. The program not only  improves housing conditions but also empowers the community as  a whole through the development of relationships with participating  local NGOs and government agencies.  In 2010, through our 22 CPAs operating, 5,158 temporary jobs were  created and approximately 1,290 families were assisted. ADvOCATING NEW MODELS OF AFFORDAbLE HOuSING  DEvELOPMENT CEMEX is expanding its affordable-housing efforts to policy discus- sions. At the 2010 World Economic Forum in Latin America, CEMEX  proposed a new model for developing affordable housing. The model  promotes lease-to-own and cooperative-based ownership options, as  well as rental alternatives. Emphasizing the business opportunities that  affordable housing projects present, we also urged the development  of new alliances between governments, developers, financial entities,  and communities to alleviate the housing deficits. For more information about our progress in 2010 on these housing  projects, refer to the Low-income Housing and Infrastructure section  on page 24 of this report.  SuPPORTING EDuCATION AND TRAINING OPPORTuNITIES We partner with educational institutions and programs to nurture  future talent. We support a variety of efforts that, together, help to  educate the individuals who will serve the global economy in a variety  of capacities. For example, CEMEX is a vigorous supporter of the Tec de  59 —  Monterrey, university where CEMEXs Chairman and CEO has served as  Chairman of the Board since 1998.  In 2010, we completed the CEMEX- Tec Center for Sustainable Community Development, a program that  seeks to promote collaboration between the public, private, and aca- demic sectors in order to support innovative solutions to challenges in  this field.  In addition, several of CEMEXs country operations granted scholar- ships and supported educational chairs at local universities in the areas  of architecture, sustainable construction, and corporate responsibility.    PROMOTING SELF-EMPLOYMENT AND MICRObuSINESSES As part of our efforts to improve local communities and promote self- sufficiency, we provide resources and advice for motivated individuals  to start locally based microbusinesses. For example, at the Community  Center of our cement plant in Torren, Mexico, 20 students enrolled in  the sewing and dressmaking course have made and sold more than  3,000 uniforms for workers at the cement plant. Now, they are beginning  to produce uniforms for local schools and have applied for a loan from  a government-run development bank; they will use the funds to form a  business entity and continue their growth.  Moreover, in Colombia, 80 women and men who have participated in  our educational programs have become CEMEX suppliers, providing  environmental and maintenance services, performing work at height  and in pre-blasting preparations, and selling uniforms and industrial  safety clothing. FOSTERING LOCAL ENvIRONMENTAL AWARENESS We invest in local environmental projects related to issues such as  environmental awareness, conservation, biodiversity preservation,  and reforestation. These programs improve our understanding of  unique ecosystem characteristics in a particular location, enable  us to better address local environmental challenges, provide op- portunities for individuals to learn more about their communitys  environment, and also create volunteer opportunities for CEMEX  employees. The following are some examples of our programs and activities   in 2010: n In the Philippines, as part of the Adopt-a-Wildlife Species program  created to actively work on biodiversity conservation in the re- gion, in partnership with Batas Kalikasan (Law of Nature) Founda- tion, CEMEX provided assistance in 2010 in building the Sailing of  the Seas. This floating training facility provides interactive learning  on marine ecosystems, conservation, and environmental educa- tion. As a mobile program, it will be able to reach more communi- ties and educate people about conservation.  n During 2010, events for employees and local communities  were organized in the UK, France, Latvia, Poland, and the US  where participants—employees, their families, and community  members—learned about local bird species and how to identify  them, as well as the characteristics of the birds habitats.  For  example in Latvia, over 1,000 CEMEX employees, their families,  and other invitees participated in over 20 activities in support  of CEMEX Bird Days, organized in cooperation with the Latvian  Ornithological Society, a non-governmental organization that  has represented BirdLife International in Latvia since 1994.The  participants went on bird-watching excursions along with orni- thologists (specialists in the study of birds) and participated in  constructing approximately 500 bird homes to help protect the  avian biodiversity in the region. n In 2010, we launched our first CEMEX-BirdLife Nature Photo  Competition in honor of the UN International Year of Biodiversity.  The objective of this photo competition for our employees was  to let them illustrate their appreciation for natures extraordinary  biodiversity—and show off their photographic skills. Over 500  entries were received from employees in 31 different CEMEX  countries. ENCOuRAGING EMPLOYEES TO vOLuNTEER IN THEIR  COMMuNITIES In 41 percent of our operations, we have employee volunteering  programs, and many of the social projects we support depend on their  60 —  41% of our operations have  employee volunteering programs 22,000+ hours of volunteer work  dedicated by employees in Mexico   participation. For example, on Mexicos Day of the Tree, we organize re- forestation brigades in all of our operations nationwide that have green- houses. In 2010, employee volunteers and local community members  planted more than 45,000 trees. Overall, employees in Mexico dedicated  more than 22,000 hours of volunteer work during the year. Most projects are organized at the country level in accord with local  needs and resources. CEMEX Mexico has also instituted a country- wide Volunteer Day during which all employees are encouraged to  participate in local volunteer work. CONTRIbuTING TO DISASTER RELIEF Our disaster relief efforts support employees and global communities  during times of great need and devastation.  We took immediate action to support our 115 Haitian employees,  their families, and neighboring communities after the January 2010  earthquake by donating money, food, medicines, and heavy machin- ery to the relief efforts. We delivered shipments of basic goods from  Mexico and the Dominican Republic; made heavy machinery available  to assist relief teams; and used our vessel Marianela to deliver an ad- ditional 90 tons of direct aid from Mexico that had been gathered by  the CEMEX community and its customers. CEMEX and its employees  also donated approximately US$750 thousand, from joint contribu- tions of the company and more than 2,500 employees in 29 countries.  CEMEX has also started the construction of a housing project for our  employees in the country who were left homeless. The project in its  initial stage consists of building around 30 houses.  In Mexico, we provided recovery assistance to several communities in  the wake of floods in Oaxaca and Veracruz; an earthquake in Baja Cali- fornia and Sonora; and Hurricane Alex in Nuevo Len, Tamaulipas, and  Coahuila. Following Hurricane Alex, we were able to use established  programs to provide emergency disaster relief and rebuilding. Our  first response was to distribute 250 tons of humanitarian aid, includ- ing food and clothing, and provide trucks and heavy machinery to  assist in cleanup efforts in the affected areas. To help residents repair  and rebuild damaged homes, CEMEX also launched the Construimos  Juntos program, which consists in setting up Centros Productivos  de Autoempleo in each of the 10 damaged municipalities. As part  of this program, CEMEX donated 500 tons of cement and 200 pack- ages of building materials for the production of cement blocks, as  well as equipment and training. The municipal governments assigned  parcels of land for the centers, selected families to participate, and  took charge of providing professionals to supervise the construction  process. We have established partnerships with more than 10 institu- tions interested in helping to rebuild these communities. More than  7,000 individuals have benefitted from this assistance.  In addition, we helped local communities in Colombia, Poland,  and Hungary following severe flooding in each of those countries.  Through the national program Colombia Humanitaria, CEMEX  Colombia supported national and local governments and do- nated 1,205 tons of cement. In addition, 192 employees donated  US$12,000.  In Europe, CEMEX provided Hungarys Central Disaster Recovery  Office with machinery, including plunger pumps, a power gen- erator, and a wheel loader, to help drain water and clear roads.  CEMEX volunteers then donated their services to operate the  equipment. CEMEX offered special discount prices on all materials  needed for recovery work, such as washed sand and gravel, clas- sified gravel, ready-mix concrete, and paving stones. Furthermore,  in Poland, CEMEX donated materials to reinforce the flood banks  in the Dobrzykow area and a mobile plant to reinforce flood  banks in Warsaw.  CEMEX is proud to have participated in the efforts to mitigate the  unfortunate effects of these devastating events, highlighting its  global commitment to foster the well-being of local communities  around CEMEX operations. 61 —  partnership with KEY  stakeholders 62 —  We continuously interact  with a wide variety of  stakeholders to discuss  and address societys most  pressing needs. we have defined four core stakeholder groups:   n our people  n our neighbors  n our business partners, and  n our world. We engage in continuous  communications with stakeholders We have adopted the following periodic communication channels  for each of our stakeholder groups:  Our People: monthly: newsletters; quarterly: internal magazines,  site visits/ dialogue sessions with management; annually: surveys;  ongoing: leadership engagement and communications, CEMEXPlaza  (intranet), email and on-site message boards, training programs Our Neighbors: monthly: community meetings; quarterly: advisory  panels, dialogue sessions; annually: open house days; ongoing: site  visits, local partnerships, social programs, volunteer work Our business Partners (including customers, suppliers, investors,  and analysts): monthly and/or quarterly: financial updates; annually:  financial and sustainable development reports, commercial events,  CEMEX Day, customer-satisfaction surveys; ongoing: website updates  and press releases, customer service centers and help lines, capacity- building programs (ie. Supplier portal) Our World (including academic institutions, communities, NGOs,  policy-makers, and governments): monthly:  conferences; annually:  sustainable development report and conservation books; ongoing:  public policy discussions, long-term partnerships with NGOs, posi- tion papers, educational programs with universities and schools 63 —  Aiming to be an employer of choice,  strengthening employee engagement   Our people are the key to CEMEXs success. Their talent, energy, and  vision make us what we are: a world leader in building materials with  a proud past, a strong reputation, and a bright future.  EMPLOYEE DEDICATION LEADS TO COMPANY SuCCESS We know that employee engagement is critical for the successful  implementation of our business strategy. Loyal, involved employ- ees go above and beyond whats required to satisfy customers and  achieve business goals. Therefore, we continuously invest in identi- fying, recruiting, and retaining top talent by making CEMEX a safe,  healthy, ethical place to work and to develop professionally.  We constantly monitor our business needs, strengths, weaknesses,  and stakeholder feedback regarding employee engagement. Then  we devise strategies to address gaps and improve our performance.   We are continuously implementing initiatives that support our em- ployees professional and personal lives.   At the end of 2010, CEMEX had 46,533 employees and approximately  14,790 contractors. These numbers reflect voluntary turnover of six  percent. Unfortunately, we also had involuntary turnover of nine per- cent. The decision to reduce headcount was difficult, but necessary  to ensure our continued competitiveness.  All restructuring efforts were performed in accordance with local  employment laws and applicable employment agreements. When  significant operational changes required a notice period, we com- plied with local employment laws and collective agreements and  provided an average of 30 days notice. In some business units, we  also offered support services to help affected employees, including  financial and recruiting advice and job-placement services. We seek to attract, hire, and retain key talent by  offering a value proposition that includes: n interesting, challenging and innovative work n a variety of career choices and opportunities n skills training for  current position  n programs and services that support work-life balance  and employee health n competitive compensation packages n international perspective 64 —  bREAKDOWN bY TYPE OF CONTRACT percentage bREAKDOWN bY LEvEL percentage bREAKDOWN bY AGE percentage l FULL TIME    l  PART TIME l  EXECUTIVE    l  NON-EXECUTIVE    l  OPERATIONAL l   UNDER 30  l 31-40 l 41-50  l OVER 50 99 36 32 59 27 22 1 bREAKDOWN bY SENIORITY percentage l   <1 YEAR   l 1-5 YEARS l 5-10 YEARS  l OVER 10 YEARS 29 19 38 14 5 bREAKDOWN bY GENDER percentage l   MALE l   FEMALE 87 13 19 Our global workforce LISTENING TO OuR EMPLOYEES We ask for our colleagues feedback—on topics ranging from ethics  to innovation to operations— through mechanisms that include  the CEMEX Survey, town-hall meetings, global webcasts, and team  briefings. In addition, Employee Councils are consulted on major  organizational topics when their input is appropriate. Other types of  engagement initiatives are tailored to meet the needs of particular  operations. For example, meetings with country managers or depart- ment managers are held to address particular issues. Since 2006, we have conducted the CEMEX Employee Survey. This  survey measures the degree to which employees feel motivated  by their job, supervisors, and team, as well as their commitment  to stay with the company and contribute to its success. In 2010,  the Employee Survey showed an 83 percent employee engage- ment(1) level. Guided by these results, which are reported by  business unit and functional areas, we develop action plans and,  in 2010, we had 674 initiatives implemented or ongoing based on  employee input.  65 —  83% employee  engagement  level(1) Tailored to the needs of each location, initiatives include regu- larly scheduled meetings and interactions between line workers  and managers, open dialogues with leaders, training programs  to improve leadership communication and managerial skills,  expanded health insurance coverage, salary surveys to ensure  market-appropriate remuneration, picnics and sporting events  for employees and their families, as well as an employee product  purchase policy.   During 2010 we also launched Shift, a social networking platform  designed to make the company more innovative, efficient, and  agile by building strong relationships among employees. Shift  enables employees worldwide to easily collaborate on projects and  share their experiences, insights, information resources, and best  practices.  EMPLOYEES DESERvE—AND RECEIvE—EquAL  OPPORTuNITIES AT CEMEX Fairness is a fundamental value at CEMEX, and treating people fairly  begins at the level of individual interactions. Thats why we design  our organizational structures and choose and train our managers  with great care. We develop leaders who have not just the knowl- edge and skills to keep CEMEX competitive, but the people skills to  bring out the best in the employees who work for them.  Our Equal Opportunity Employment Policy As formalized in our Equal Opportunity Employment Policy, CEMEX  hires, develops, and promotes all employees on an equal-opportuni- ty basis—that is, without regard to race, gender, sexual orientation,  religion, appearance, age, national origin, and/or physical disability.  And we are uncompromising in maintaining a civil, pleasant working  environment free of harassment, intimidation, and discrimination  toward anyone.  To encourage diverse candidates to apply for positions, CEMEXs  hiring procedures seek candidates from a variety of sources.  We promote that open positions are publicly posted in our job  posting site, which is available to both internal and external  candidates; we ask employees to make referrals; and we look for  qualified candidates at local universities and through job-search  websites and social media. After reviewing the candidates files,  we generally interview two to five people before selecting the  individual to hire.  As part of CEMEXs broader commitment to ethical conduct, employ- ees are encouraged to report violations of CEMEXs non-discrimina- tion policy. They can report violations to the local Ethics Committee  or through ETHOSline, a secure, confidential website. A phone-based  ETHOS hotline is also available for about 50 percent of employees;  we are working to make it available to all employees.   supporting diversity at CEmEx We are working to increase diversity throughout our workforce, in  particular with regard to gender. As women comprise 13 percent of  CEMEXs workforce, we have implemented initiatives to encourage  more women to join the company, such as formal work-life balance  programs in some of our operations (e.g., Corporate, Mexico, Domini- can Republic, Czech Republic and Ireland). At the management level, we are succeeding in our diversity aims.  Over 30 nationalities are represented in senior management and ap- proximately 60 percent of senior management positions at signifi- cant CEMEX operations are local hires. This mix reflects a balancing  of several CEMEX commitments: to promote local development;  to place our employees in the right role at the right time; and to  encourage employees to take challenging assignments in order to  enhance their growth, facilitate the exchange of best practices, and  strengthen our shared corporate culture.  (1) Engagement level is calculated as an average of the answers to a set of questions. It could  vary from 0-100%. 66 —  700+ online courses available  through CeMeX learning 19,000+ employees with  access to CeMeX learning platform Performance Evaluation  Over 20 percent of our executives and employees have  access to a formal online system to register evaluations, and  97 percent of these employees reported receiving feedback  in 2010.  The remainder of our employees and operators  also receive regular performance evaluations with their  individual managers, though the process is not registered  in a global tool. uPHOLDING EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION We recognize the right to freedom of association and collective bar- gaining among our workers. We negotiate collective bargaining in  good faith, balancing our business needs with our employees needs.   We also use these union interactions as another opportunity to learn  valuable information regarding employee needs and ideas. In 2010,  54 percent of CEMEX employees were members of an independent  union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.     HELPING ALL EMPLOYEES TO LEARN, GROW, AND ADvANCE At CEMEX, we promote a culture of consistent high performance  worldwide. To help our employees meet this standard, we provide  them with work experiences, tools, and guidance that allow them  to improve their professional skills and interact effectively. Through  CEMEX Learning, over 700 courses are accessible and available to  approximately 19,000 employees worldwide.  Since we consider experience the cornerstone for growth, we en- courage employees to seek advancement opportunities throughout  the company. Our Job Posting Policy supports this goal by giving  employees opportunities to apply for positions that will afford them  professional growth.  We help our employees succeed in each posi- tion by providing comprehensive support in the form of personal  career guidance from their supervisor, department head, and Human  Resources, as well as training. CEMEXs human resources processes allow supervisors to effectively  provide feedback and coaching to their colleagues through direct  interactions and performance reviews. CEMEXs Talent Review is a  dialogue-based employee-development process through which the  employees performance and potential are assessed collectively by  the employees direct supervisor and peers, as well as the area leader.   At the supervisory level, Talent Reviews open a forum for discus- sions about our people, build a common language to evaluate and  identify talent, and empower the organization to actively participate  in employee development. They also help CEMEX address two ongo- ing challenges: the identification of talent gaps in specific operations  and the development of strategies to fill those gaps.  67 —  supporting skills development and lifelong learning Our employee engagement efforts identified a need for training on  specific skills tailored to the needs of different functional areas. To ad- dress that need, CEMEX offers and is continually developing an array of  instructor-led and online courses. Several of these programs are aimed  at strengthening the skills and competencies of people already in lead- ership positions and individuals rising to those levels. These courses give  our future leaders the opportunity to learn about decision-making mod- els, business trends, and strategy; strengthen interpersonal skills; build a  strong international network that promotes knowledge and best-prac- tice sharing; and experience working in virtual and multicultural teams.  In 2010 we developed a Manager Training Program that focuses on  providing basic management tools for collaboration; we will now offer it  to colleagues with collaborators at operations around the world. To complement our onsite training efforts, we have a state-of-the- art online learning management system, CEMEX Learning, through  which our employees can design and pursue their individual  development plans. Course subjects range from interpersonal skills  and project management to specific business issues, such as our  CO2 emissions challenge, use of alternative materials in products,  and technology strategy. In addition, during 2010 more than 350  employees received support to complete university courses and  degrees.   supporting employees lives outside of work We value and support our employees as individuals, family members,  and citizens of their communities. To help them balance all their  roles, CEMEX offers employees flexible work arrangements as tailored  to their particular culture and business unit needs; 69 percent of our  operations have work-life balance programs, including dependent  care, child care, elderly care, sabbaticals, parental leave, or other flex- ible benefits. In Spain, for example, we have two voluntary programs:  Banco de das, which grants employees up to 10 compensation  days in exchange for accumulated work hours; and a work-reduction  program in which employees voluntarily reduce both their hours  and compensation.  We also encourage CEMEX employees to contribute to sustainability  in their own way and in their own backyards by giving their time and  talents to local community programs. We lend company support to  many social projects in which CEMEX employees participate. Total rewards to attract and help retain the best talent CEMEXs reward package is intended to both motivate employees  and recognize their performance. Our goal is to provide all employ- ees with a competitive compensation package for their position  and level of responsibility. As a global company operating in diverse  markets, however, we are challenged in our effort to design a glob- ally consistent compensation package. To ensure that our offerings  are appropriate, we consider the following: n the total compensation provided by comparable companies n the labor markets in which a given CEMEX business unit com- petes for talent n data compiled from independent, professional, third-party surveys 69% of our operations have   work-life balance programs 68 —  Listening to our customers We use customer surveys, including end-of-project satisfac- tion surveys, and ongoing dialogue to gain a clear under- standing of our customers needs and preferences. Then we  collaborate with them to develop efficient, effective building  solutions that fit their budgets.  In 2010, 84 percent of the countries in which we operate  regularly conducted customer-satisfaction surveys, up from  78 percent in 2009.  Learn more about our products and service online. We always comply with the applicable local laws of the countries where  we operate, including pension plan and health and safety benefits re- quirements. Indeed, we provide additional health and insurance benefits  at different levels in over 90 percent of our operations and additional  pension benefits in approximately 45 percent of our operations. Moreover, we are committed to paying the same wages to men and  women who perform similar jobs at the same level of experience, as  evidenced by our male-to-female salary ratio of 1.02—with seniority  accounting for the slight difference.  Continuous investment We make significant investments to help our employees develop  their skills and be more effective at executing our business strategy.  We have set the following objectives to address issues of immediate  priority to our colleagues and the company and to build a strong  foundation for the future:  short-term objectives  n Retain key talent and recruit highly qualified individuals who have  the competencies CEMEX needs n Continue to develop career planning alternatives  n Continue providing leaders with communication and leadership  training Medium-term objectives  n Develop organizational capabilities to support our strategy n Implement a redesigned leadership development program that is  aligned with talent management  n Continue to build a solid talent pipeline in critical areas n Ensure the availability of growth and development opportunities Focusing on customer needs Loyalty happens by design, not by chance. Thats why we intensely  focus on every customer, whether a construction giant building a  skyscraper or an individual building his familys first home.  We work with our customers to identify and implement effective  ways to create more value for them. Because commercial needs  and building practices vary greatly from region to region, we are  careful to respond to market challenges in locally specific ways. In  some regions, we have launched new value-added cement and  ready-mix products that streamline the construction of housing and  other infrastructure. In other areas, we have helped develop financial  mechanisms that enable local governments to build roads and other  infrastructure and partner with developers to produce low-income  housing. In the wake of the worldwide recession, the public sector  has become the most important customer in many markets, and we  are developing new skills and solutions to best serve its needs. We are continuously improving our processes to make them more  customer-friendly and are launching new technology-based tools  to help our customers execute and manage their projects. Our 24/7  Load delivery service allows customers to receive products when- ever they need them, thus optimizing delivery schedules to fit the  needs of their projects. In the same vein, Mobile Solutions sends  automated SMS messages to the customer each time an order of  cement or ready-mix concrete is ready for delivery. This free service  keeps customers up-to-date on project logistics and lets them plan  for the arrival of the materials. In addition, with just a single call to  our one-stop Service Centers, customers can place orders, make  inquiries, review the status of orders, or request technical assistance.  In addition, we work hard to ensure that our products are safe to use  and that customers use them properly. All of our production pro- cesses are certified locally and many of our cement plants are certi- fied to ISO 9000, an internationally recognized quality management  standard. We also offer local training programs to help our customers  improve their construction skills and better manage their businesses. 69 —  93%   of our purchases were made from locally and nationally  based suppliers 84%   of the countries in which we operate have a process to  screen suppliers social and environmental practices  Fostering supply chain  sustainability We recognize that our responsibility for sustainable business practices  extends to the farthest reaches of our supply chain. Our customers and  other stakeholders hold us just as accountable for the sustainability of  our sourcing and procurement practices as for the sustainability of our  products and services. Thus, our success in part relies on the support  and participation of our suppliers, who provide valuable local perspec- tives, expertise, and practices and whom we view as partners. WE HELP CREATE SuSTAINAbLE COMMuNITIES THROuGH  LOCAL SOuRCING We believe that local sourcing is in and of itself a sustainable busi- ness practice: it creates jobs, which in turn stimulate local economies  while developing new skills among local workers. Whenever feasible,  Fulfilling our global  commitments  CEMEX is the only building materials company that par- ticipates in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)  Advisory Group on Supply Chain Sustainability. We collabo- rated with other members of the Advisory Group to produce  the UNGCs Supply Chain Sustainability: A Practical Guide  for Continuous Improvement, which was published in June  2010. As we do every year, we attended the UNGCs annual  meeting in Oslo, Norway, in January 2010, and will attend the  2011 meeting, to be held in Mexico. we support small and locally based suppliers everywhere we oper- ate; in fact, in 2010, 93 percent of our purchases were made from  locally and nationally based suppliers. Our procurement teams par- ticipate regularly in events to identify new, local suppliers, in particu- lar small-to-medium-sized enterprises. We also provide training and  development programs to help suppliers strengthen their business  practices and integrate sustainability into their business processes.  In addition, we are now developing basic training materials for all  CEMEX employees who deal with suppliers—as well as the suppliers  themselves—to help everyone better understand the many sustain- ability aspects of the supply chain process.  Responsible sourcing for a better world In 2010, CEMEX started the first phase of a new Sustainable Procure- ment Program that will systemize and expand the various sustain- able sourcing practices that have been used for several years. In brief,  the programs objectives are to: n inform all employees and main suppliers about CEMEXs commit- ment to sustainable sourcing policies and practices, and what we  expect from them n ensure that all current and potential new suppliers are qualified  and evaluated thoroughly, fairly, and at regular intervals on the  sustainability of their own business practices n enable main CEMEX suppliers to adopt and develop more sus- tainable practices and empower them to assist us to do the same n extend sustainable procurement practices beyond the procure- ment area to include all departments that use suppliers n strengthen the lines of communication between CEMEX and our  suppliers in order to facilitate collaboration To launch the first phase, we developed a supplier survey to assess  the sustainability practices and performance of current suppliers. That  survey was sent to a selected number of suppliers in Mexico, Colom- bia, the Dominican Republic, and the Philippines; it will be distributed  in other countries in 2011. CEMEX offices in some countries have sepa- rately conducted similar surveys of their local suppliers. To complete  the first phase of the program, we will consolidate information from  all the surveys to build a global picture of the companys supply chain  sustainability. By 2010, 84 percent of the countries in which we operate  had processes to screen suppliers social and environmental practices.  70 —  In the second phase, CEMEX will communicate to all of its suppliers  its philosophy of and commitment to sustainable sourcing, as well as  what it expects of its suppliers. We will incorporate basic sustainabil- ity clauses into all our purchase orders and contracts during the third  phase. We have already drafted and are reviewing the language for  these clauses, which is based on the UNGC principles regarding hu- man rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. In the fourth  and last phase, we will develop a supplier sustainability scorecard  and roll it out as appropriate in each country. While we expect to complete the first three phases of the Sustain- ability Procurement Program in many of the countries in which we  operate in 2011, CEMEX offices in each country will determine the  appropriate pace for implementation based on local circumstances.  With their more mature supply chain and sustainability management  environments, Spain and Croatia have already implemented all four  phases of the Sustainability Procurement Program.

As we continue to roll out the  Sustainability Procurement Program in 2011 and beyond, a funda- mental goal is to better communicate it worldwide. We have long had a Supplier Portal that is unique in our industry  (www.cemexsuppliers.com). In the coming year, the portal will be  completely redesigned to function as a more friendly and useful  website, enabling greater interaction with suppliers through online  courses and training, newsletters, and best-practice forums. The  goal is to build a network of close collaboration with and among  our suppliers so that we can share experiences, know-how, and best  practices to improve our businesses and the communities in which  we operate.  71 —  Our partnerships We leverage our knowledge and resources through global part- nerships and memberships. CEMEX maintains more than 300  partnerships and memberships with global and local organiza- tions, including NGOs, trade associations, educational institutions,  and intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations.

CEMEX hosted a series of events that showcased the com- panys own efforts at reducing GHG emissions and pro- tecting biodiversity and also demonstrated the significant  role ready-mix concrete can play in a low-carbon world.  At the Green Solutions Expo, CEMEX used an innovative  interactive platform to present concrete solutions for the  prototype low carbon footprint city of the future, including  ready-mix concrete applications in urban design, mobility,  clean energy, and efficient buildings. The Climate Change  Village provided a space for public participation and col- laboration at COP16 through conferences, exhibits, and  cultural events.  In addition, CEMEXs Vice President of Energy and Sustain- ability participated in the meetings plenary sessions—the  first time that private sector representatives were included. Off-stage, CEMEX sponsorship helped to offset the confer- ences carbon emissions and support the Mexico-based  SEMARNAT Environmental Leadership for Competitiveness  Program. The offsetting of 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions,  equivalent to approximately 25% of the conferences total  emissions, is being completed through the reforestation  and maintenance of 1,300 hectares of land in Oaxaca,  Mexico. The funds donated to the Environmental Leader- ship and Competitiveness Program will provide resources  to small and medium-size companies to help them imple- ment environmentally responsible practices.

Every quarter,  these two executives provide CEMEXs Board of Directors with an  update on the progress achieved in the main sustainability key per- formance indicators and on the companys main global sustainability  initiatives.  In parallel to the functional responsibility for sustainability, CEMEX  has created a global coordination structure that ensures that best  practices are continuously shared and that the main global initiatives  are implemented in all geographies. The Sustainability Committee,  a body formed by 19 top executives that report to various members  of the CEMEX management team, meets on a quarterly basis to  analyze, discuss and provide guidance on the sustainability program  at CEMEX.  Through their work, sustainability priorities are defined  and resources are allocated to those initiatives that have the highest  impact and provide the largest improvement opportunities.   81 —  Decisions made by the Sustainability Committee and validated by  the CEO, the management team and the Board of Directors are  swiftly executed with the support of the two regional Presidents,  through their regional teams and the individual country operations. COMPANY POLICIES  At CEMEX, in addition to our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct,   we communicate our expectations and set global standards through  several company-wide policies, covering:   n Code of Ethics n Health and Safety  n Environmental  n Biodiversity n Anti-bribery  n Antitrust   n Sponsorship of and participation in international dialogues   (e.g., COP16 summit)  n Discussions with regulators, such as regional policy discussions in  North America, in which we highlight the importance of cement  and concrete in sustainable construction  n Engagement through trade associations and industry forums,  including the European Cement Association (CEMBUREAU),  EU Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, the World  Business Council for Sustainable Development, the Cement  Sustainability Initiative, and the United States Portland Cement  Association n Dialogues and partnerships with non-governmental organiza- tions (NGOs), think tanks, and academic institutions, including  BirdLife International and IUCN Personal political activity As detailed in the CEMEX Code of Ethics, we respect the right of our  employees to participate in political activities of their own choosing.  Their participation must be on a personal basis, however, and must  not interfere with their work duties or obligations. Employees cannot  use company facilities or assets for political purposes, nor imply in  any way that CEMEX endorses or supports their positions.   LAYING THE FOuNDATION FOR ETHICAL, RESPONSIbLE  buSINESS In 1999, representatives from all of our operational areas participated  in the development of the CEMEX Code of Ethics and Business Con- duct, which was unveiled by Lorenzo H. Zambrano, Chairman of the  Board and Chief Executive Officer, on April 13, 2000.  In all of our interactions, in every part of the world in which we  work, we endeavor to act lawfully and with integrity. Our Code  of Ethics and Business Conduct—inspired by our core values of  collaboration, integrity, and leadership—ensures that all employ- ees understand CEMEXs high standards of conduct. As such, new  Taking a public stance on important issues We published six position papers in 2010, all of which are available on our website, which explain CEMEXs stance on:  Alternative Fuels    Capture and Storage   Climate Change    Environmental Management & Biodiversity  Market Mechanisms    Sustainable Construction  Public policy activities We actively follow public policy developments in many of the coun- tries and regions in which we operate, and advocate in support of  our business and sustainability priorities. Current priorities include: n Environmental protection n Climate change n Carbon markets n Sustainable construction n Economic policies and financing models to encourage invest- ment in sustainable infrastructure CEMEXs Chairman and CEO and the top management team de- termine the companys priorities and public positions on issues.  Our Vice President for Corporate Communications and Public Af- fairs then works with regional managers to devise an appropriate  strategy for each region, depending on which issues are of high- est priority for the operations and what forms of engagement are  available in each country. The following are some examples of the  ways in which we contribute to public debate and the develop- ment of solutions: 82 — 82 —  employees are required to sign the code as part of their orienta- tion and it is always available on our internet site, and intranet. Our  code has been translated to over 20 languages. The code governs our relationships with all of our stakeholders and  encompasses such areas as: n non-discrimination and fair treatment of employees, customers,  and suppliers n government and community relations n political activities and contributions n workplace safety n compliance with laws and policies n environmental responsibility n conflicts of interest n financial controls n confidential information   Instructor-led  training Online  courses TOTAL Code of Ethics and  Business Conduct   183 183 Compliance 380   380 Anti-bribery 382 768 1150 Insider Trading 28   28 Antitrust 51 2,949 3,000 Conflict of Interests   15 15 Sarbanes-Oxley   13 13 Protecting Confidential  Information   150 150 Harassment   18 18 TOTAL 841 4,096 4,937 Training efforts were supported by a robust global communication  campaign on topics such as giving/receiving gifts, antitrust, anti- bribery, and harassment. Respecting and protecting  human rights We are committed to supporting and respecting the protec- tion of internationally proclaimed human rights, as well as  ensuring we are not complicit in any human rights abuse.  In addition, several sections in CEMEXs Code of Business Eth- ics and Conduct—including Employee Relations, Customer  Relations and Fair Dealing, Supplier Relations and Fair Dealing,  Government Relations, and Political Contributions and Activ- ities—clearly communicate our expectation that employees  will conduct themselves in a way that respects and protects  human rights. This obligation is reinforced by our public  pledge as a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact  to align our business practices with the 10 UN Global Com- pact principles (which address human rights, labor relations,  environmental protection, and anticorruption practices), and  our membership in Foro Soria 21—an international organiza- tion focused on social ethics and values. Pursuant to these commitments, we do more than just comply  with local employment laws; we forbid all forms of discrimina- tion, we do not use child or forced labor, and we guarantee  the right to freedom of association. We have implemented  company procedures to prevent inadvertent violations of these  policies: we have delineated hiring processes, we do not hire  people under 18 years old, and in more than 90 percent of our  operations, we have adopted local overtime policies.  We provide ongoing communication and training around hu- man rights issues to further raise employee awareness about  their rights and obligations. For example, we make clips and  training materials available to our employees through our in- tranet, and promote our Code of Ethics and make it available  on our intranet and internet. strengthening our systems to uphold human rights Based on stakeholder concerns and CEMEXs greater un- derstanding of the human rights risks the company may be  exposed to, we are taking steps to ensure that human rights  are respected not only across all of our companys opera- tions but also to the full extent of our influence. Among other  measures, we are: n updating our Code of Ethics, n including explicit references to the Code of Ethics and  our human rights commitments in vendor and supplier  contracts, and n enhancing the systems we use to screen suppliers social  and environmental performance.

It includes  training for individuals, employee perception surveys, communication  campaigns on specific topics, ETHOS@Plaza (the companys employee  intranet), and the ETHOSline reporting channel. Training, which is  tailored according to employees responsibilities and specific circum- stances, includes in-person and online courses on the Code of Ethics  and Business Conduct and other topics for all employees.   ETHOS@Plaza is hosted on our intranet and allows all employees to  access a range of resources, including:  n Global and local CEMEX policies n Guidance on ethics, compliance, and governance topics  local Ethics Committee, local Human Resources Department, or  immediate supervisors. Where permitted by law, concerns can also  be anonymously reported via ETHOSline, a confidential and secure  communications channel through which any employee can seek  advice or report a violation. Retaliation against any employee for  reporting a concern or violation in good faith is strictly forbidden. Depending on the type of issue, the individuals involved, and the  severity of the conduct, the appropriate internal authority will inves- tigate and address the reported issue. All allegations are thoroughly  investigated, and when found true, disciplinary actions are taken to  prevent further misconduct. These disciplinary actions can range  from a written warning to dismissal, and may involve legal action,  depending on the type and severity of the violation.  The ethics committees received 184 reports during 2010; 88 per- cent have been investigated and resolved. Of the 11 cases related  to discrimination, 10 are closed. Only four were found to have been  substantiated, and appropriate disciplinary action—from warning  letters to employee termination—has been carried out in each case.   184 reports of alleged violations  received in 2010  88% allegations that have been  investigated and resolved   (12% of the allegations are currently being investigated) 77 disciplinary actions implemented  48% allegations found to have merit n Courses related to ethics and compliance (e.g., antitrust, anti-corrup- tion, conflicts of interest, the Sarbanes-Oxley law, confidential informa- tion, intercultural relations, and workplace harassment) n Advice and tools to help employees manage ethical dilemmas, in- cluding Ethos Clips— 30 mini-courses that illustrate the behaviors  expected of employees n Explanations of the business and personal implications of misconduct n ETHOSline, a confidential channel to ask questions and report viola- tions related to ethics, compliance, and governance topics During 2010 we focused our global training efforts on executives and  employees in higher risk positions and locations. Approximately 840  instructor-led training sessions were delivered on compliance top- ics such as anti-bribery, antitrust, and insider trading and more than  4,000 online courses were taken, as detailed below. These efforts will  continue during 2011. Responding to reported concerns Reports of violations of our Code or policies can be made directly to  the Audit Committee, Global Ethics Committee, Legal Department,  84 —  Main sustainability-related risks  and how we address them  A multitude of risks can affect CEMEX, its assets and employees, as  well as our neighbors. Accordingly, we use risk management sys- tems and tools to gather information from a range of sources, ana- lyze the data, identify and assess potential risks, and then respond  to them. Since 2007, these processes have included an evaluation  of environmental, health, and safety risks. We have several processes that test the robustness of our systems,  evaluate compliance across all business units, and encourage con- tinuous improvements. These processes include compliance train- ing for employees, periodic reviews of our policies and procedures,  and regular internal audits. OuR OPERATIONS ARE SubjECT TO ENvIRONMENTAL AND  HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGuLATIONS Our operations are subject to a broad range of environmental and  health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions  in which we operate. These laws and regulations impose increas- ingly stringent environmental protection standards regarding,  among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the  use and handling of hazardous waste or materials, waste disposal  practices, the remediation of environmental damage or contami- nation and health and safety of employees and contractors. These  standards expose us to the risk of substantial environmental, health  and safety costs and liabilities, including liabilities associated with  divested assets and past activities, even conducted by prior owners  or operators and, in some jurisdictions, without regard to fault or  the lawfulness of the original activity. Efforts to address climate change through domestic federal, state  and regional laws and regulations, as well as through international  agreements and the laws and regulations of other countries, to  reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) can create risks  and uncertainties for our business. This is because the cement  manufacturing process requires the combustion of large amounts  of fuel and creates carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct of the  calcination process. Such risks could include costs to purchase al- lowances or credits to meet GHG emission caps, costs required to  provide equipment to reduce emissions to comply with GHG limits  or required technological standards, or decreased profits or losses  arising from decreased demand for goods or higher production  costs resulting directly or indirectly from the imposition of legisla- tive or regulatory controls. Our operations can be affected by some of the associated  effects of climate change In addition to the risks identified above arising from actual or  potential statutory and regulatory controls, severe weather, rising  seas, higher temperatures and other effects that may be attribut- able to climate change may impact any manufacturing sector  in terms of direct costs (e.g., property damage and disruption to  operations) and indirect costs (e.g., disruption to customers and  suppliers, higher insurance premiums). We do not believe that any  such impacts on our operations would significantly differ from  those to other sectors and the public at large. Higher energy and fuel costs may have a material adverse  effect on our operating results Our operations consume significant amounts of energy and fuel,  the cost of which has significantly increased worldwide in recent  years. To mitigate high energy and fuel costs and volatility, we have  implemented the use of alternative fuels such as tires, biomass,  and household waste, which has resulted in less vulnerability to  price spikes. We have also implemented technical improvements  in several facilities and entered into long-term supply contracts of  petcoke and electricity to mitigate price volatility. Despite these  measures, our operations would be materially adversely affected in  the future if energy and fuel costs increase. securing the supply of raw materials is a key element in our  production processes Due to the nature of our business, we have a high degree of  integration into the mining and sourcing of the key raw materials  required in our production processes. Failure to maintain the land  and mining rights in our sites could have a materially adverse effect  on the continuity of our operations and potentially increase the  cost of some of those raw materials. Our operations are subject to antitrust and anti-bribery  regulations Antitrust laws seek to prevent monopolies, collusions, and other  anti-competitive behaviors, based on the principle that competi- tion benefits consumers and promotes economic growth. Govern- ments across the world are increasingly active in enforcing antitrust  and competition laws, and are cooperating with each other to  prevent anti-competitive behavior.  Furthermore, local laws are  converging on basic antitrust principles and concepts.  CEMEX as a  global company operating in many different countries is exposed  to different civil and/or criminal penalties that can have a signifi- cant impact on our profitability.  Under applicable laws in the United States, Europe, and other  places where CEMEX does business, it is a crime for CEMEX directly,  or through an intermediary, to offer, pay, or promise to pay, a bribe  or anything of value to a government official (including employ- ees of state-owned enterprises and officers of public international  organizations) for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  The term anything of value includes both monetary and non- monetary gifts and bribes, and can include favors and other types  of consideration. The civil and/or criminal penalties for violating the  different local and international anti-bribery laws can be severe. 85 —  CEMEXs risk management  The companys sustainability-related risks are addressed by our Enterprise Risk Management System, which is ultimately  supervised by our Board of Directors and the management team. The day-to-day responsibility for risk management at  CEMEX has been delegated to the Executive Vice President of Planning and Finance, under which tasks and activities have  been distributed to the functional departments that have the relevant skills and expertise:  n The Executive Vice President of Planning and Finance  addresses risk management (including sustainability-related risks):  Periodically identifies, analyzes, maps and communicates enterprise risks using risk assessment methodologies.  Provides early warning on emerging risks that could affect the companys business model.  Proposes actions and preventive measures to mitigate these risks.

For this reason, in 2008 we assembled a group of independent  sustainability experts to advise us on our efforts. CEMEXs Sustainable  Development Reporting Advisory Panel provides feedback on our  sustainability reporting and encourages us to continue improving it.  For the 2009 reporting period, while we have not been able to im- mediately respond to all the concerns raised in the last years report,  we have made progress on a number of fronts and will continue to  improve our performance and reporting in the coming year. To read  CEMEXs response to the 2009 Sustainable Development Reporting  Advisory Panels recommendations, please refer to our website at    www.cemex.com/sustainability For the 2010 reporting period, CEMEX invited new experts to take  part in the Advisory Panel. The new panel first met with CEMEXs  sustainability team in December 2010 in Cancun, Mexico, while at- tending the events and exhibits in which CEMEX participated during  the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change (COP 16). In addition, the panel  members and CEMEXs sustainability team met in a private session  during which CEMEX shared its Sustainability Model and its progress  in the implementation of its most relevant initiatives. In January 2011, panel members reviewed the outline for this 2010  report and provided recommendations that we have incorporated  into the report development. This marks the first time we involved  panel members at the beginning of the reporting process; we found  their perspective very helpful. For example, based on their feedback,  we crafted the introductory sections such that they can be used as a  stand-alone summary of the entire report. With this structure, readers  who read only the introduction will still gain a balanced understand- ing of our priorities, the progress weve made in achieving them, and  where we need to improve. We have also incorporated key perfor- mance indicators into each priority section—in addition to includ- ing a consolidated data section at the end of the report—and have  more fully explained our efforts to protect biodiversity and develop a  comprehensive water-management strategy.  We thank the panel members for their time and efforts and look for- ward to more productive—and challenging—discussions with them  throughout the year.   In 2008 we assembled a group  of independent sustainability  experts to advise us on our  efforts.  87 —  Felipe Pich-Aguilera n PhD in Architecture, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Spain n Professor of architecture and sustainability, Superior School of Architecture of the International University of  Catalonia ESARQ/UIC (2008 – present) n Director of environmental and industrialization investigation area, Superior School of Architecture of the Inter- national University of Catalonia ESARQ/UIC (2010-present) Mr. Pich-Aguilera currently serves as president of the Green Building Council in Spain, where he actively pro- motes sustainability in the construction sector.

We note that CEMEX  has taken the Panels recommendations seriously and addressed many  of the issues raised.  This augers well for our relationship with CEMEX  and we look forward to a productive two years of work.  Completeness and clarity The advanced draft of CEMEXs 2010 Sustainable Development  Report, which we reviewed, is comprehensive, informative, well bal- anced and clear.  We note a marked improvement of quality, balance  and readability compared with previous reports. We do, however,  have concerns on specific elements.  We have communicated these  to management, including suggestions on improving the reviewed  draft.  Below, we highlight areas where we expect improvement in  future reports.  Overall, the reports clarity and consistency are significantly en- hanced by using the CEMEX Sustainability Model as the organizing  structure. This could be further improved by making clear how the  seven Sustainability Priorities map onto the three main Sustainability  Objectives, and by ensuring that the terminology used to describe  the Priorities is consistent across different sections of the report. Governance We welcome the better explanations of corporate governance and  policy development.  But the report concentrates on describing  process and not on explaining how decisions are made and who is  accountable. In particular, we recommend including more detail on  the link between executive compensation and sustainability perfor- mance.  materiality  The report fails to clarify how the Sustainability Model itself is de- signed, agreed, updated and how targets are set. Reporting on the  materiality analysis of sustainability issues is valuable, but it is not  made explicit how this analysis was determined and how it informed  revision of the Sustainability Priorities. In relation to the seven Sus- tainability Priorities, the set of targets still appears to have significant  gaps. It would be helpful to have in the report an assessment of  these gaps and an explanation of how they will be filled.  Human rights Reporting on human rights remains wholly inadequate and we look  forward to CEMEX responding to the work of the United Nations  proposed guidelines on the subject.  In particular, we would like  to see reporting on how CEMEX deals with human rights issues in  specific high-profile countries in which it operates, especially Egypt,  the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates.   safety The previous panel drew particular attention to the need for CEMEX  to improve its safety record. We note that CEMEX has responded and  provided details on how its executives are being held accountable  for operational safety. We are, however, extremely concerned about  the continuing poor safety record and especially the performance of  its contractors.   biodiversity The detailed sections on quarry rehabilitation projects and on El  Carmen provide interesting real-life examples of biodiversity con- servation. They illustrate that it should be possible for CEMEX now  to go beyond the fairly vague commitments in the CEMEX Biodiver- sity Statement and develop a biodiversity strategy with clear and  quantifiable targets, based on an overall commitment to Net Positive  Impact on biodiversity across the companys operations. In future,  the reporting emphasis should shift to Biodiversity Action Plan  implementation at active sites. We caution CEMEX to be mindful of  the danger of continuing to highlight its good work in El Carmen at  the expense of dealing with more challenging issues, such as safety  and human rights.  Key performance indicators We find these indicators useful to track CEMEXs performance over  time. A clearer set of headline indicators is needed that covers the  most important issues, aligned with filling the gaps in the set of  targets. Clarity would be improved by using normalized (rather than  absolute) measures and more explanation of changes.   Data and context We commend the range of performance data published and the  shift to include more quantitative information in the text sections,  which enhances understanding.  We look forward to further im- provements to enable the reader to gauge the significance and  relevance of the data.   stakeholder engagement We would like to see a clearer account of how CEMEX uses stake- holder feedback to inform the development of its Sustainability  Model and strategy, and the actions it takes in response to the  feedback. We look forward to a considered response from CEMEX and working  with the company to help it further improve its reporting.  89 —  AWARdS and recognitions Our commitment to sustainability is reflected in the various awards  that we have received around the world, including the following in  2010: World business and Development awards by the United Nations  Development Program, the International Chamber of Commerce,  and the International Business Leader Fund recognized CEMEX for  its contributions to achieving the Millennium Development Goals  through programs that foster and facilitate development, including  Centros Productivos de Autoempleo. forrester Groundswell award in management–Collaboration  system category recognized CEMEX for its Shift platform.

Unless otherwise indicated, the information provided in this report is  for the company as a whole. We are including information for the op- erations in which we have financial and operative control. If a plant is  sold, its information is no longer included in our data nor considered  in our targets. We have restated certain data sets from previous years  because of improvements to our data-collection systems or changes  to our business; each case is clearly marked. All monetary amounts  are reported in US dollars. Tons are metric tons. The information for this report came from several sources, including  internal management systems and performance databases and our  Sustainable Development Report Survey, a global questionnaire.  This approach has enabled us to report against our key performance  indicators for the whole company. We aim to improve the transparency and completeness of each report  we produce. We include a statement from PricewaterhouseCoopers,  which verified our data on greenhouse gas emissions; atmospheric  emissions; alternative fossil and biomass fuels rates; environmental  incidents; and safety for our cement, ready-mix, and aggregates opera- tions. In addition, we engaged with our Sustainable Development  Reporting Advisory Panel, which provides feedback on our reporting.  CO2 Emissions CEMEX reports absolute and specific CO2 emissions following the  CSI Cement Protocol CO2 Accounting and Reporting Standard for  the Cement guidelines and spreadsheet. As defined in the protocol,  it considers direct emissions excluding CO2 emissions from biomass  fuels and purchased electricity. All historical information from base- line to current year is calculated under these procedures to reflect  appropriate trends and allow year-to-year comparison analysis.  Dust, NOx  and sOx emissions  Absolute and specific figures are calculated based on kilns emissions  measurements taken from   Continuous Emissions Monitoring Sys- tems (in those sites where kilns are equipped with such technology)  or spot analysis. These methods fully comply with the CSI Guidelines  for Emissions Monitoring and Reporting. All information is reported  to CEMEX databases, processed, calculated, and validated to provide  a final group value. Energy Fuel consumption indicators are reported to internal CEMEX data- bases in which conventional, alternative, and biomass fuels are  classified according to the CSI Cement CO2 protocol spreadsheet.  Heat values are obtained from on-site analysis (where applicable),  value provided by supplier or standards from the CSI Guidelines for  the Selection and Use of Fuels and Raw Materials in the Cement  Manufacturing Process Clinker factor & alternative fuels All material consumption is reported to internal CEMEX databases  in which alternative materials are defined following the standards  from the CSI Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Fuels and Raw  Materials in the Cement Manufacturing Process. The clinker /cement  factor is calculated using the procedures from the CSI Cement CO2  protocol spreadsheet with information obtained from the databases. safety An internal CEMEX safety database collects all related safety infor- mation from each site and automatically provides the appropriate  information to calculate the indicators. The database is configured  using the WBCSD / CSI definitions We applied the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 Sustainability  Reporting Guidelines to produce the full report, which meets an ap- plication level of A+ for the third consecutive year.  In addition, this report constitutes our communication on progress  against the commitments of the United Nations Global Compact  (UNGC). As a signatory to the Global Compact, we work to align our  companys operations and strategies with its ten principles. We are  also committed to helping the world meet the targets of the Kyoto  Protocol and Millennium Development Goals. The indices for the GRI and the UNGC are found in our website and  are available for download at    www.cemex.com/sustainability 94 —  0 1 1 2 3 4 5 2 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON CEMEX products for low-income public policy product safety and quality R&D/ innovation vibrations and noise transport/ logistics water risk management raw materials supply chain quarry rehab/ biodiversity other air emissions community engagement health and safety stakeholder dialogue corporate gov. & ethics climate & CO2 energy use/ efciency employee relations sustainable construction customer relations economic value creation STAKEHOLDER CONCERN 3 4 5 High-priority issues MATERIALITY ANALYSIS, THE bASIS FOR IDENTIFYING THE  HIGHEST PRIORITY ISSuES   CEMEX faces an array of issues related to the operation of our busi- ness and how it impacts society. To ensure that we are focused on  the most important issues, we conducted a materiality analysis. This  analysis examined the potential impact of specific sustainability is- sues from both a stakeholder and a company perspective. The materiality analysis took into account a broad range of stake- holders input, both direct and indirect. We considered opinions and  evaluations from investors and sustainability analysts and rating  agencies; feedback from customers, suppliers, employees, and local  community leaders and representatives; news media coverage;  feedback given by CEMEXs Sustainable Development Reporting  Advisory Panel; and the public reports of our industry sector, among  other sources. At the same time, we conducted an internal evaluation of the poten- tial impact on CEMEX of specific issues from a financial, reputational,  and operational standpoint. The results of the materiality analysis provided the basis for identify- ing the issues of highest importance to stakeholders and highest  impact to CEMEX.
