Metso Annual Report     www.metso.com     Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com From the CEO ingly important. These trends bring both challenges  and opportunities for Metso and for other industry.   – MK:  We are well positioned to benet from the glob- al megatrends. Favorable economic development  in emerging markets not only supports the demand  for metals, energy and infrastructure solutions, and  paper and board, it also oers us excellent oppor- tunities. Our strong position in services is based on  long-term customer relationships and our extensive  installed equipment base, and we are continuously  developing our services portfolio. Global concern  about environmental issues and sustainability cre- ates demand also for our environmental solutions  and for the life-cycle services supporting them. So  our strategic focus areas oer us excellent growth  opportunities also in the future.      Continuous renewal is a critical element of our  own operations. Competition in the global market- place is erce and constant. Todays competitors are  developing their operations and new contenders are  emerging. Moreover, our customers are expecting in- creasingly better results at a more competitive price.  For these reasons, we must continuously evolve. For  Metso employees, only a company that is continuous- ly improving is a good workplace in the long-term.  Collaboration brings results  – JE: Our discussions with our customers in recent  months have been encouraging and forward looking.  The markets are recovering and Metso is considered  the leading player in its sector and a good partner.   – MK: It is a matter of honor for us to make sure that  we remain a desired partner also in the future. The  quality of our products, our delivery reliability and  our services portfolio must be superior.    – JE: Satised customers are the best guarantee for  continued protable growth, which in turn creates  new business opportunities and interesting jobs  for Metso employees. Satised shareholders are  another cornerstone in the solid development of the  company. The total shareholder return, taking into  account the increase in share price and dividends  paid, on Metsos share was  percent last year.   – MK:  Also the Boards dividend proposal of EUR .  per share reects our solid nancial position and con- dence in Metsos future performance.  Metsos position is strong  – JE: In ten years Metso has evolved into a global com- pany with exible operating models. Our services  business has more than doubled to some EUR .  billion, and it represented  percent of our net sales  last year. About half of the orders we receive come  from emerging markets; just ten years ago, the cor- responding gure was  percent. The environmental  business is a newer development area for us – and  an area that has room to grow because the world is  in need of technologies and solutions that are more  eco-ecient. And today Metsos protability is at  a better level than before. But I am convinced that  Metso has much potential to do even better. In fact, a  big question is how to make Metso even better.   – MK: Metsos position stabilized and the company  matured during Jormas tenure. A strong nancial  foundation is important because it gives us op- portunities to invest in product development and  to actively develop our operations. Last year the  markets recovered and Metsos business turned to  growth. Now we are pursuing more momentum as  the markets rapidly evolve.   Accelerating pace of change   – JE: True, the world is changing at a faster pace than  just a decade ago. The economy has globalized,  emerging markets are growing in signicance, the  demographics are changing as the global population  rises and environmental issues are becoming increas- Metsos President and CEO Matti Khknen  and his predecessor Jorma Eloranta sat down  in Helsinki to talk about Metso and its future.  Metsos nancial position and strategy are  on solid footing. However, the global pace of  change is accelerating and driving the need for  Metso to continuously renew and improve its  operations. Results are being achieved by work- ing together.

All Metso employees deserve praise for the good  performance in . This year will also have its  challenges. Uncertainties in the generally favorable  outlook are created by e.g. the fragility of economic  recovery in developed markets and stronger ination  pressures. On the positive side, demand in emerging  markets remains steady, the outlook in the mining  industry continues to improve and the demand for  services is expected to remain strong in all our busi- nesses.  – JE: I want to thank our customers, our partners and,  most of all, Metso employees for seven terric, and  sometimes challenging, years of achieving results  together. On the way to a sustainable future  – MK: Last year we had an internal discussion about  what is Metsos purpose. Our renewed mission oers  a clear answer to this: We contribute to a more sus- tainable world by helping our customers to process  natural resources and recycle materials into valuable  products.      Likewise, our new vision Working as One to be  Number One and our new leadership principles sup- port our protable growth and will help us towards  a sustainable future. Also our values, our Code of  Conduct and the UN Global Compact initiative we  have endorsed guide Metso employees to operate  in a manner consistent with sustainability.     In line with these policies, Metso employees and  other stakeholders can expect Metso to operate in  a straightforward and transparent manner. I believe  this is to the benet of Metso employees, our cus- tomers and our shareholders.  – JE: Metsos situation is good and it has a strong  strategy. I am thrilled that my successor and Metsos  entire Executive Team were found from within the  company. This indicates that Metso has competent  people and that the company is heading in the  right direction. I have no doubt that Metso will  continue along the path of protable growth under  the leadership of Matti and his team.     However, I would be very surprised if the new  management didnt present changes. Continuous  renewal to benet customers and to secure com- petitiveness is important.    – MK: The new Executive Team is o to a good start  and has received full support. I want to thank Jorma  for his extraordinarily successful leadership of  Metso. As a company, Metso is in excellent shape.  This gives the new Executive Team a good platform  for working together with Metso employees.     Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com METSO AND MEGATRENDS Metso and megatrends Globalizing economy Supply chains  in change New competitors in  global markets Redistribution  of economic  power Economic power is gradually shifting away  from developed markets and being redis- tributed more evenly among more countries  and geographical regions. The liberalization  of global trade and information technology  development are accelerating this trend. As  a result, the rules for the global operating  environment are being redened.   Redistribution of economic power The focus of global economic growth shifted  during the rst decade of the st century  from developed to emerging markets.  Growth has slowed in developed markets  and is today mainly based on the growth  in services. The rise in living standards, an  increase in consumption, and the construc- tion of new production capacity and infra- structure in emerging markets will continue  to drive growth. The s are estimated  to be a period of dominance for emerging  economies.  Global industrial companies, including  Metso, have clearly strengthened their pres- ence in emerging markets. This has helped  the companies to survive the economic  downturn that started in . It was feared that the economic crisis  would slow globalization through growth in  new protectionism. The measures promot- ing the liberalization of global trade are  continuing, although their pace of imple- mentation has temporarily slowed down.  New competitors in global markets Emerging markets are creating new, often  very competitive players for global markets.  These companies have a strong ability to  adapt to changes in the operating envi- ronment as a consequence of the major  changes in their domestic markets in recent  years, and they are expanding their opera- tions also to global markets.  When the number of competitors grows,  product life cycles become shorter and new  innovations are created faster than before.  Tighter competition often lowers product  prices. In the capital goods markets, the  companys own strong research and product  development as well as new innovations are  increasingly important competitive factors.   Supply chains in change The globalizing economy is changing  the markets ways of operating and value  chains. The worlds dierent economies  and their players are in closer contact and  more dependent on each other. By globally  managing the supply chains various links,  like procurement, production, distribution,  sales and marketing, companies can nd  the most ecient solutions, both operation- ally and economically. The signicance of  the emerging markets has grown along the  entire supply chain. It is increasingly dicult for companies  to gain a competitive or cost advantage  from manufacturing. Product development,  design and brand, as well as close customer  relations and life cycle services have become  the new competitive advantages. In this  kind of market environment, many capital  goods producers, like Metso, are pursuing  new growth opportunities from the services  business.

Strategy, p. –   Services business, p. –   Global presence, p. – LINKS &   NOTES      Metso Annual Report     www.metso.com METSO AND MEGATRENDS Economic   power of  emerging markets Local,  cost-ecient solutions Growing global  middle class Rise of emerging economies This decade marks the rst that economies   of emerging markets are estimated to  account for a larger share of world GDP  than those of developed markets. Knowing  customers needs is a central success factor  in emerging markets. Economic power of   emerging markets The BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and  China) account for over  percent of world  GDP growth. China has the biggest signi- cance and has become a superpower in the  global economy. Development in India and  Brazil has also been very strong. In addition,  there are a number of other countries in  Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe  that will each change the global economic  playing eld. These rapidly growing econo- mies are challenging the developed market  economies to a new kind of competition.  The utilization of natural resources and  production based on them are often a  platform for the rising auence of devel- oping national economies. A functioning  transportation infrastructure is necessary  for economic growth and for investments  into production in a new geographical area.  As prosperity and urbanization advance,  consumer habits change, thereby boosting  the demand for packaging board, paper  and tissue, for instance. The growth in  consumption also increases the demand for  minerals and thus investments in the mining  industry. Maintaining economic growth and  the related urbanization require additional  investments in infrastructure development  and increase the consumption of aggre- gates and minerals. As economic growth  advances, energy consumption grows and  ecient waste management becomes  increasingly important. Growing global middle class Over the past decade emerging markets  have seen the formation of an extensive  middle class with purchasing power and a  desire to quickly achieve Western standards  of living. This translates to growth in the  demand for natural raw materials and for  consumer goods in particular. The growing  consumption may also lead to competition  for natural raw materials and production  resources. The production of consumer  goods has increasingly shifted to emerging  markets, which have production facilities  manufacturing products for their growing  domestic markets as well as for the whole  world.  Local, cost-ecient solutions Companies and consumers in emerging  markets are very cost-conscious and dont  want to pay for all the product features  that have been developed for Western  customers. To fully tap into the growth op- portunities in emerging markets, Western  companies must know the competitive  situation and the customer needs of the  new markets and they must be ready to  adapt their products and services. Custom- ers in emerging economies want to achieve  high productivity and a competitive quality  with basic applications that are economical  and can be delivered quickly. Competing  successfully requires exibility and a strong  local presence.

Strategy, p. –  Services business, p. –   Global presence, p. – LINKS &   NOTES     Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com METSO AND MEGATRENDS Population growth and the economic  growth of emerging nations are leading  to rapid urbanization, which is estimated  to continue for a long time. Today it is  estimated that  percent of the worlds  population, i.e.  billion people, will live in  urban areas in . Population growth  and urbanization  Ecient trac and transportation solutions  are a necessity for functional metropolises  and for economic development. Building  new infrastructure and maintaining and de- veloping existing infrastructure will require  investments globally in the upcoming years,  boosting the demand for minerals, like iron,  copper and nickel as well as aggregates.  Transporting the constantly growing vol- umes of food products and consumer goods,  undamaged, from production facilities to  shops, often from one continent to another,  and from shopping centers to homes also  Changes in demographics Population growth  and urbanization Aging workforce   in developed markets Knowledge transfer  and training needs requires more packaging materials as well as  machines and equipment to produce them.  A sucient supply of energy and water as  well as waste management and recycling  are other challenges related to urbanization.  In fact, it is envisioned that small paper and  board mills utilizing recycled materials and  municipal waste-red power plants will be  built in urban areas in the future.   Aging workforce in   developed markets For companies, competent employees are  a critical factor for success and for stand- ing out from the competition, and a factor  that will become even more emphasized in  the future. In many developed markets, the  population is aging and population growth  is slowing or even declining, which may lead  to a slow-down in economic growth and a  labor shortage. In many cases, companies  must revise their business models to reect  the new operating conditions. Many companies in labor-intensive  industries are transferring their operations  to emerging markets where skilled employ- ees are more readily available. More and  more often companies are dealing with the  challenges associated with the availability  of competent employees by concentrat- ing only on their core competencies while  outsourcing the other functions. This creates  new business opportunities for e.g. process  and equipment suppliers in the area of  service and maintenance. Need for knowledge   transfer and training Aging personnel and outsourcing or  transferring operations to new geographi- cal regions challenges companies ability to  retain the knowledge that is important for  operational continuity. Transferring knowl- edge, especially tacit knowledge to younger  generations and new areas is vital in the  ongoing transition.  The internal training programs supple- ment the knowledge and skills acquired in  local educational facilities. Collaboration  with local educational facilities is becoming  increasingly common as means to ensure  that the students graduating have the right  set of skills. In an eort to accelerate internal  knowledge transfer, job rotation between  dierent countries and units and the utiliza- tion of latest information technology, like  social media, are being used. It is also impor- tant to increase the know-how employees  in developed markets have regarding the  special issues of emerging markets.

Services business, p. –   Global presence, p. –  Metso people, p. – LINKS &   NOTES      Metso Annual Report     www.metso.com METSO AND MEGATRENDS Sustainability, essential for the future, has a  signicant impact on the activities of eve- ryone. For Metso, sustainability is both an  opportunity and a challenge. We promote  sustainability by oering our customers eco- ecient technologies and services. At the  same time, in our own operations we strive  for responsibility and for as little environ- mental impact as possible. Eco-ecient solutions Economic growth and the growing  prosperity and industrialization of emerg- ing economies will boost consumption,  although many raw materials are already be- ing used at an unsustainable rate. Sustain- ability requires either lowering the current  standard of living or creating new solutions  that substantially reduce the environmental  impacts of economic growth.  Slowing the greenhouse eect neces- sitates signicant changes in energy use  and production. In energy production, the  Eco-ecient   solutions New energy   solutions and   energy eciency Increasing   regulation Sustainability and climate change  search is on for solutions based on renew- able natural resources to replace those  based on non-renewable natural resources.  The use of virgin raw materials is being  reduced in all production through recycling  and with new technologies.  Developing new, environmentally  friendly technology is often time- and  capital-intensive. In fact, companies and  various research facilities are working  together across industrial sectors to develop  solutions that support sustainability. The  adoption of new technologies is often  slowed by the unwillingness to invest in new  technology that is considered expensive.  New energy solutions   and energy eciency Stopping climate change requires solutions  that improve energy eciency and the de- velopment of dierent forms of renewable  energy. Solutions improving energy ecien- cy generally can be implemented relatively  quickly, and their adoption allows more time  to develop entirely new solutions.  Using various biomasses and waste  as fuel is an eco-ecient way to produce  energy and to conserve natural resources.  Boosting eciency in the recycling and pro- cessing of industrial and household waste  and utilization of waste in energy produc- tion can reduce the amount of waste going  into landlls and the environmental load  caused by waste management.  Increasing regulation The expectations and requirements of  company operations and the local and  global impacts of those operations have  increased. Companies must simultaneously  meet shareholders expectations and look  after the well-being of their personnel and  the communities and nature around them.  In line with the principle of sustainability,  current generations must act in a way that  doesnt compromise the opportunities for  future generations.  Tougher energy and environmental  legislation around the world requires the  reduction of greenhouse gases, more ef- cient use of energy and raw materials, as  well as increases in recycling and in the use  of renewable energy sources. The changes  have a signicant impact on the business  and cost structures of industrial companies.

Our comprehensive  product and services oering, our extensive  installed equipment base and our strong  presence in emerging markets provide an  outstanding foundation for fully tapping into  the world-changing megatrends. Our strategy  is crystallized in three themes that aect all  of our businesses: strong development of the  services business and environmental solu- tions, and strengthening our global presence.  We are pursuing growth both organically and  through complementary acquisitions. We are striving for improved protability  by increasing the share of businesses with  the highest prot margins and making our  cost structure more exible and global, and  by improving the nancial performance of  our least protable businesses. We are continuing eorts to further  develop and implement Metsos leader- ship principles, vision, mission and values  throughout our organization.  We contribute to a more sustainable  world by helping our customers to process  natural resources and recycle materials into  valuable products.  SEE LINKS 1 AND 2  Key role for Metsos technologies Our services, project and product busi- ness together form a balanced portfolio  supporting our protable growth strategy.  The services business accounts for approxi- mately  percent of our net sales, projects  for approximately  percent and products  for approximately  percent. We are growing the services business  primarily organically through our installed  equipment base, although we maintain  other suppliers equipment through our  comprehensive services network as well. We  also support growth with complementary  acquisitions. Our own products and technologies  and the research and product development  activities supporting them form the core of  Metsos know-how and development. The  development of cost-ecient solutions for  local conditions is an increasingly important  part of our know-how. Product and project  deliveries increase our installed equip- ment base, and the expansion of our own  technology improves our opportunities for  the continuous development of our services  business.  Balanced business portfolio We oer our products and services to the  mining, construction, power generation,  oil and gas, recycling, and pulp and paper  industries. Our customer industries are in  varying phases of development and thus  balance the development of our net sales,  protability and cash ow. Mining industry markets oer us excel- lent growth opportunities all over the world.

We supply mining and construction technol- ogy solutions that are typically subjected  to heavy wear and require a lot of wear and  spare parts throughout their life cycle. The  services business oers us additional growth  opportunities around the world. We estimate that energy and environ- mental technology oers us good oppor- tunities for growth in the long-term, both  organically and through complementary  acquisitions. The strong growth in energy  consumption, biofuels, waste recycling, and  process automation used to enhance the  eciency of industrial processes are growth  drivers for Metso.  The paper and ber technology markets  for new machines and equipment are ma- ture, and the majority of new investments  are being made in Asia and South America.  The supplier base in big turn-key solutions  has stabilized to a few key suppliers that  hold rather large market shares. This makes  growth through business acquisitions di- cult. The services business continues to oer  good growth opportunities globally, both  organically and through acquisitions. Strong market positions  We are one of the global market leaders in  mining and construction technology, metal  recycling systems, biomass-based energy  production solutions, and paper and ber  technology. We are among the leading  suppliers of automation and ow control  solutions for the process industry and of  solid-waste crushing equipment. Our main competitors in the delivery  of comprehensive production plants are  global companies that have product and  service portfolios somewhat similar to ours.  There are only a small number of these  global suppliers of comprehensive solu- tions. In individual products, we also have  smaller regional and local competitors. The  competitive arena in the services business is  typically fragmented and has a high number  of competitors, ranging from local compa- nies to global players.  Our competitors vary by customer in- dustry and product. There have been some  changes in our competitive environment  recently with the consolidation of smaller  players or business acquisitions by players  whose product oering is tangential to ours  or by emerging market competitors enter- ing the global markets. We estimate that  these transactions have not had a material  impact on our market positions. We research  business acquisition opportunities and  monitor changes in the competitive arena.

There have been very few  investments in new capacity, and more than 500 ma- chines have been shut down. Instead, the demand for  services has increased.  In over a decade, we have transformed from a tra- ditional machine supplier to a major services supplier.  The net sales of our services business have tripled since  the late 1990s. Today, 98 percent of our Paper & Fiber  Technology employees in North America work in ser- vices. The oering covers maintenance, spare parts and  life-cycle services.   One of our customers is Domtar, the largest integrat- ed manufacturer and marketer of uncoated freesheet  paper in North America and the second largest in the  world based on production capacity. Over 90 percent of  Domtars production is made with Metsos machinery,  and to a large extent its mills use Metsos expertise to  service and optimize machine performance. through cooperation Results In the picture: Jukka Tiitinen,  Metso, Mike Edwards, Domtar.     Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com SERVICES BUSINESS Services  business Strategic theme: One of our key strengths is our extensive  installed equipment base and the services  business supporting it. Our services business  comprises spare and wear parts, maintenance,  repairs, rebuilds, and various process analyses  and optimizations. Our comprehensive local  presence supports the growth of the services  business.  Our services business has developed vigorously over the  past ten years and is one of our main strategic themes.  Consistent with our goal, we have evolved from an  equipment supplier to an expert and services company.  The services business oers us signicant opportuni- ties for development and growth because of our con- tinuously expanding installed machine and equipment  base, our comprehensive services portfolio, and our local  presence. The growth target we have set for our services  business exceeds the pace of growth for equipment and  project sales over the business cycle and will lead to a  gradual increase in the share of our services business. In  fact, our goal is to grow the services business share of to- tal net sales and to reach a situation where the services  business accounts for over  percent of net sales at the  peak of a business cycle and for as much as  percent  at the bottom of a cycle, when the share of project and  equipment business is low. We pursue growth both  organically and through business acquisitions.  In  the services business accounted for  percent  (%) of our net sales. In developed markets the share  was  percent and in the emerging markets  percent. The foundation of the services business is built on  our own strong product technology and extensive in- stalled equipment base, our profound knowledge of our  customers processes, and our presence close to custom- ers. The goal is to ensure the production and delivery  capacity, safety and eco-friendliness of our customers  processes and the quality of the end products. We help  our customers to maximize the productivity of their  machine and equipment base.  We typically oer a one- or two-year warranty on the  machines, equipment and processes we deliver. Project  deliveries usually include spare parts in a so-called start- up package. We sell wear parts for the machines also  during the warranty period. The majority of our services business comprises wear  and spare parts, the demand for which directly corre- lates to customer production volumes. Customers value  our local presence and the fast availability and quality  of our spare and wear parts. Our investments to develop  our own products and technologies as well as our own  production support our success as a supplier of spare  and wear parts. We provide spare parts mainly for the  equipment we supply, but we sell wear parts for equip- ment installed both by us and by our competitors. Segment Share of spare and wear  parts of services business  net sales Mining and Construction Technology 85–90% Energy and Environmental Technology Approximately 10% Paper and Fiber Technology Approximately 70% Growth from extensive installed   equipment base Based primarily on our installed equipment base, we  have determined the size of the services business mar- ket to be about EUR  billion. A signicant part of this  consists of maintenance and repair activities performed  by our customers. We estimate our market share to be  about – percent of the total market.  We typically have a very high market share in spare  parts for Metso equipment; customers usually rely on  the original equipment supplier for spare parts. The wear  parts market has a lot of local and regional companies  specializing in spare and wear parts; they sell products for  equipment supplied by a variety of manufacturers and our  market share is lower than in spare parts. Our market share  in maintenance and other expert services is still low, and  our goal is to signicantly increase our own services oer- ing and resources in the upcoming years. We aim to grow our market share and strengthen our  presence by expanding our oering also through busi- ness acquisitions. For example, we gained an extensive  installed paper machine base mainly in North America  through the Beloit acquisition in .

Our customers are  increasingly making their investment decisions based  on the total cost and the entire life cycle of the product.  Our customers expect a new kind of know-how from us;  at the same time, we get the opportunity to support our  customers during the dierent phases of the machine,  equipment or process life cycle. The collaboration high- lights our ability to integrate the machine or equipment  with service and to understand the needs of our dier- ent customer groups. For us, this has meant the develop- ment of new, customer-driven know-how alongside the  traditional product- and technology-centric know-how.  There isnt just one correct way of producing services;  the solutions are developed partly based on the needs  of each customer.  New service concepts for the needs of   dierent customer segments  Every day we receive plenty of feedback from customers  through our comprehensive and global sales and cus- tomer service network. A continuous dialogue with our  customers makes it possible to identify the development  areas in dierent technologies and to take corrective  action. The billing for our service agreements is often based  on wear or spare parts sold, number of hours worked or,  e.g., tons produced. Our aim is to make more and more  service agreements that target on the production reli- ability of the equipment or production plant or the qual- ity of the end product. In these agreements, the benets  and also the risk related to plant performance are shared  between us and the customer. Right now, these types  of agreements represent only a small fraction of the  services business net sales, but we aim for increasing the  share of these agreements gradually as the scope of the  services business becomes more comprehensive.  Developing service packages is part of the develop- ment of our services business. We have the most experi- ence with this in Mining and Construction Technology.  An expanded services portfolio is visible to our custom- ers through the improved quality of end products and  in the ability to optimize the performance of equipment  and entire processes. By packaging services, we can  compete more eectively with small competitors. Also  in the Recycling business we have good experience with  package-based services business.  The service and maintenance activities by our Paper  and Fiber Technology and our Power business partly  take place during our customers annual production out- ages. Then we must ensure that we and our subcontrac- tors have the necessary resources to carry out the annual  maintenance within the planned time frame.  In our research and development activities, we are  increasingly focusing on new solutions for the services  business that will improve the cost eciency and overall  competitiveness of our customers operations. Our  important sustainability-related goals include reducing  the amount of energy, water and raw materials needed  in our customers processes and the amount of waste  generated. Optimizing the servicing and maintenance of  production lines lengthens their useful life. At the same  time, we improve their cost- and eco-eciency. The  services business is an integral part of our eco-ecient  solutions as well.

Presence close to customers In order to serve our customers well, we must operate  close enough to customer production plants, and our  personnel must be readily available. We have strength- ened our local presence by building our service center  network, and we will continue this development work  also in the years ahead.  In October we opened our third service center in  China serving the pulp and paper industry. The new  center is located in Zibo, Shandong Province, and it  employs  maintenance professionals. The center  oers machine maintenance and process development  services in North China. Our rst service center in China was opened in Wuxi,  Jiangsu Province, in . The expansion of the center in   doubled its roll service capacity, and by Septem- ber  it had serviced , rolls. In January  we  opened our second service center in China, in Guang- zhou, Guangdong Province, serving the pulp and paper  industry in South China. Our network of service centers and our production  must work together so that our customers receive the  spare and wear parts they need for their processes at the  right time. In September  we acquired the Prerov  factory in the Czech Republic. The factory, which manu- factures and supplies wear parts for our mining and  construction industry customers operating in Central  and East Europe, strengthens our ability to deliver wear  parts fast.       Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS Bioboiler plant improved air quality  and created new jobs  Residents of Facture, a city in southwest France, have  been breathing cleaner air since October 2010. A  biomass-red combined heat and power plant, one of  Europes largest and representing Metsos latest tech- nology, was commissioned at the local Smurt Kappa  paper mill.   The plants dust and nitrogen oxide emissions are  signicantly lower compared to those of the old grate  boiler plant. The plant is fueled with bark from the mill  and forest residue collected from neighboring areas.  Collecting the forest residue has created new jobs for  the local people.  Owned by Dalkia, the plant generates steam for the  mill and electricity for the national grid. The investment  is the largest in Frances national green energy program,  which aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to  curb climate change. Metso supplied the plant with the process equip- ment, from fuel handling systems and biomass boiler all  the way to ue-gas cleaning and the complete automa- tion for the plant. The project was implemented in good  collaboration, again demonstrating our strong know- how in the growing bioenergy markets.  Environmental   solutions through cooperation Results      Metso Annual Report     www.metso.com ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS     Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS We oer products and services that reduce  the environmental load and improve the qual- ity of our customers operations. We carry out  research and development in cooperation with  customers and leading research institutes. We  work together to develop, for example, new  technology for biomass and waste-based ener- gy solutions. We also aim to further strengthen  the collaboration between our dierent busi- nesses in the development of solutions advanc- ing sustainability. Environmental solutions Our eco-ecient solutions and products are related  primarily to renewable energy sources, the material and  energy eciency of production processes, recycling,  the ecient utilization of raw materials, conserving  water, the reduction of emissions, dust and noise, and  the optimization of processes. Process optimization as  well as wear and spare parts and maintenance services  support the minimization of the environmental impacts  of products throughout their life cycle.  Our goal is production processes to be as eco-e- cient as possible, both in our own and in our customers  production plants. Environmental impacts occur mainly  in the use of machinery and equipment in customer pro- duction processes. Signicant results in reducing green- house gases, for instance, are achieved more quickly by  developing solutions with lower emissions and higher  energy eciency for the industries generating the big- gest emissions and consuming the most energy.  Our eco-ecient solutions are not a separate busi- ness; they are a natural outcome of the overall solutions  that stems from our customers needs. We believe that  environmental technology oers us signicant growth  opportunities in the future. Climate targets increase demand for   bioenergy solutions  Our bioenergy know-how is a signicant competitive  factor when the use of renewable energy is increased to  achieve climate targets around the world. For example,  the EU is aiming for  percent of its energy to come  from renewable sources by . And elsewhere in the  world, similar types of new regulations are accelerating  the development.  We have comprehensive know-how with a variety of  challenging fuels used in energy production: fuels such  as by-products from the forest industry and agricul- ture as well as energy crops and municipal waste. Our  strength is our ability to supply comprehensive solutions  for biomass and waste combustion. Those include the  reception and handling of fuel, the boiler plant, the  ue-gas cleaning system, and complete power plant  automation and life-cycle services to ensure the ecient  operation of the plant. The goal of the Metso Bioenergy  Solutions program, which combines know-how from our  dierent businesses, is to nd ways to better utilize our  bioenergy-related know-how. Bioenergy production is most economical and most  ecient when implemented locally; however, biomass  supplies are not consistently available everywhere in the  world. The bioenergy solutions under development will  maximize the energy value of the biomass and enable  bio-based fuels to be transported longer distances.  Biomass is organic matter used as a renewable fuel, e.g.  wood and agro-biomass. Biofuels, like biogas and bio-oil,  are fuels that have been rened from biomass.  There are several ways of using biomass in energy  production. In addition to new combustion solutions,  the biomass handling processes under development can  produce products with greater added value. They can be  used either as fuels in energy production or as raw materi- als in various chemical processes. Expanding the end uses  for biomass creates demand for new technologies.  We are developing the mechanical handling of biofu- els, the equipment used in the handling process and the  automation. There are already industrial-scale projects  for the gasication of biomass and waste. Gasication  of biomass produces gas that can be used in place of or  alongside fossil fuels like oil or natural gas.  Bio-oil production through pyrolysis and the produc- tion of lignin pellets are in the pilot phase. In pyrolysis,  Strategic theme:      Metso Annual Report     www.metso.com ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS biomass is distilled with heat to separate an oil-like end  product. We are also exploring biomass pelletizing in  which biomass is crushed, dried and compressed into  easy-to-handle biopellets for fuel. Our research is also  focusing on biocoal production.  Energy and material-ecient solutions   save costs and reduce emissions The investments our customers make in energy e- ciency have a direct impact on their operating costs and  eco-eciency. With energy eciency improvements, our  customers can lower their energy costs and reduce their  CO2 emissions. We oer our mining and construction industry  customers process design and optimization, automa- tion, wear and spare parts and maintenance services.  An optimized crushing-grinding process design can  signicantly improve a mines energy eciency. With  the solutions we have developed for mobile crushing,  screening and conveyors, crushing can take place on site  at the bottom of a quarry or close to a construction site,  thereby decreasing emissions and dust, lowering energy  consumption and improving work safety. Our technologies in pulp and paper production  cover all sub-areas, from wood handling to paper and  board production. Our automation and control systems  enhance process utilization and runnability, while at the  same time improving energy and material-eciency.  Also the supply of clean water is a global challenge. We  have developed solutions to signicantly reduce water  consumption in pulp and paper manufacturing pro- cesses and to reuse the process waters more eectively. We work with our customers to nd the best ways  to extend the life cycle of their production processes  and thus improve their eco-eciency. The solutions  can be used e.g. to upgrade old technology to meet  new environmental regulations. The broad selection  of special applications for process automation enables  accurate monitoring and control of emissions levels and  environmental reporting.  From the recycling of scrap metal   to the handling of municipal waste   Restrictions on the use of natural resources and tougher  legislation are increasing the use of solutions that im- prove energy eciency and promote recycling. Ecient  Continuous  development of  environmental  solutions OUR AMBITION: ENERGY EFFICIENCY Energy eciency is dened as the ratio between  a certain product and service and the amount  of energy used to produce it. Favorable energy  eciency can come from small, continuous  improvements as well as from radical technologi- cal innovations. As energy eciency evolves over  time, the energy eciency of solutions is meas- ured in relation to a general benchmark level.  The benchmark level is taken from the technol- ogy currently in use and from the best available  technology.  recycling systems reduce the use of water, wood, metals  and aggregates, for example. Increasing the eciency of  industrial and household waste processing can reduce  the amount of waste ending up in landlls and decrease  the environmental load caused by waste.  We are the leading supplier of mid-range and heavy- duty equipment and comprehensive solutions in metal  recycling. The shears, balers, crushers and other metal  recycling equipment we have delivered account for  about  percent of the worlds scrap metal handling  capacity. The use of recycled metal in steel production  signicantly reduces the energy need in the steel-mak- ing process and the emissions into the environment. We  supply equipment and plants also for the processing of  solid and other municipal waste.     Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS Strategy supporting   research and development In our research and development activities we focus on  many important areas of sustainability, such as energy-  and raw materials-eciency, the utilization of renewable  raw materials, advanced process control technology and  new solutions for the services business. In  our R&D  expenditure, including industrial property rights, totaled   EUR  million (EUR  million), i.e. . percent (.%) of  our net sales. In  we launched the Metso Stimulus program to  accelerate strategically important long-term research  and development projects. The purpose of the program  is to support long-term R&D activities by allocating  funding to projects that support the environmental and  services business in particular.  In R&D we network with customers, research facili- ties and universities. The universities we have the most  collaboration with are in Finland, Sweden, the United  States, China and Brazil. Our partners include Lule  University of Technology in Sweden, Aalto University in  Finland, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),  Georgia Institute of Technology and North Carolina  Technical University in the United States, Facens - Engi- neering University of Sorocaba in Brazil, and Beijing Uni- versity of Science and Technology, Shanghai Dazhong  Technical School, Nanjing Forestry University and South  China University in China.  Our R&D Center in Tampere, Finland, is researching  the production of bio-oil in collaboration with the VTT  Technical Research Centre of Finland, the energy com- pany Fortum and the forest products company UPM.  The goal is to use forest residue-based bio-oil to develop  a considerable alternative to the traditional light and  heavy fuel oils, which generate carbon dioxide emis- sions. The project is combining pyrolysis with uidized  bed combustion technology; Metso is among the world- leading experts in such boiler technology.  At the end of  we started collaboration with the  Swedish Bio Energy Development North AB to develop  torrefaction.

High-quality design is an important part of our R&D  activities. Our design is customer- and user-driven,  competitive, environmentally and socially responsible,  and has a recognizable visual identity. Consistent with  our design principles, we aim to make purpose-oriented  and safe products that are based on customer needs  and improve our own and our customers competitive- ness and protability.    Open dialogue between  Metso and suppliers pro- motes sustainability  Kalle Reponen, Senior Vice President, Strategy and  M&A, Metso Group, and Olli Hyvrinen, Senior Vice  President, Procurement, Paper business line, initiated  a dialogue within goods suppliers about promoting  sustainability.     – Kalle Reponen (KR): We can better promote sustain- ability by involving our supply chain and by oering  them support. We must be able to talk about important  issues openly and to explore solutions together. Col- laboration and an open dialogue are a must in making  progress in this issue. An excellent tool for this is the  sustainability criteria for suppliers, launched in .   – Olli Hyvrinen (OH): We have previously applied  ethically sustainable principles in our procurement, but  the common criteria now apply to all of our goods and  services suppliers globally. The common criteria allow  us to jointly support sustainability and share our experi- ences and views.   – KR: In addition to environmental issues, the criteria  are related to e.g. quality and occupational safety. They  require our suppliers to comply with competition legis- lation and to oer a safe work environment.   – OH: They help us at Metso to choose suppliers that  endorse sustainability and to assess their quality during  collaboration. It is about continuously paying attention  to issues related to ethically sustainable operations.   – KR: When all of us – Metso employees and suppliers  alike – fully comprehend principles of sustainability,  they will become an intrinsic part of our daily work, not  just criteria that are part of some separate assessment  process.  through dialogue Results                                 EUR million Research and development expenditure (including IPR expenses)     Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com GLOBAL PRESENCE      Metso Annual Report     www.metso.com GLOBAL PRESENCE Global presence Health, safety and   the environment in focus Health, Safety and Environmental issues (HSE) are an in- tegral part of our operations. We aim to increase person- nel awareness and to build a systematic way of holding  all accountable for safety.  Metso Park, in Alwar, Rajasthan, India, has delivered  good results. In 2010, there was only one incident creat- ing lost time and one minor incident. In most months,  Metso Park reached our goal of zero accidents. Several HSE initiatives have been launched at Metso  Park during the year. A 24/7 primary health care center  was opened, visitors safety instructions were imple- mented and an internal HSE audit system was deployed.  In addition, our employees have been involved in  improving the safety of the manufacturing facilities. For  example, hand rails have been installed, open vents and  drain lines have been properly covered, and machine  safety and the storage of highly ammable chemicals  have been improved.  At Metso Park we also pay attention to the environ- mental impact of our operations. Natural light is used  to illuminate the plant, and energy ecient equipment  with variable frequency drives and sensors is used in  manufacturing. The site has an ecient sewage treat- ment plant, which prevents pollutants from being  discharged into the environment and enables the use of  treated water in gardening and ushing.

We aim to have a lo- cal presence in sales, product development and  research, engineering, procurement, production  and the services business all over the world.   Global presence We serve our customers globally. We employ over ,  professionals e.g. in engineering, production, procure- ment, sales and the services business in over  units  located in more than  countries on all continents. We  have customers in over  countries in the mining, con- struction, energy, recycling, pulp and paper industries.  We measure our success based on e.g. market share,  i.e. how often our customers choose us as their partner  and supplier. Our competitive strengths include our pro- found knowledge of markets and customer processes,  long-term customer relationships, an extensive installed  equipment base, a competitive product and services  portfolio, and our global presence and ability to trans- form all of this into added value for our customers. From equipment supplier to service provider Metsos world is divided: the emphasis in developed  markets is on the services business for the installed equip- ment base, while the majority of sales of new equipment  and plant projects are in emerging markets. This means a  refocusing of resources: in developed markets we have ad- justed our equipment and project business resources and  have redirected them to the services business. At the same  time, equipment- and project business-related know-how  must be transferred to emerging markets while strength- ening our own resources there. Acquiring new competi- tors that crop up in emerging markets is an opportunity  to grow our presence and to add to a globally competitive  product portfolio. Correspondingly, acquiring companies  with a service business focus in developed markets is one  way to support the implementation of our strategy.  During the year we invested EUR  million to  strengthen our presence in emerging markets. In ,  our total investments, excluding business acquisitions,  were EUR  million (EUR  million), of which main- tenance investments accounted for  percent, or EUR   million.  Global economic recovery strengthened in   and the demand for our products and services turned  to growth. Our customers capacity utilization rates  increased with the improved economy. This had a posi- tive impact on the demand for our services business in  particular, but also on equipment sales. Uncertainties  related to our order backlog diminished as customers  restarted their projects. Over the course of the year the  uncertainties in the nancial markets created by budget  decits in many European countries and in the United  States cast a shadow over the market recovery. However,  this didnt signicantly impact the demand for our  products and services; most of our customers con- dence to invest in new and existing equipment bases  strengthened.  Emerging markets In the upcoming years emerging markets will robustly  grow their production capacities in all areas for which  Metso has a product oering. Today the demand for new  equipment and processes is mainly in Asia, South and  Central America, Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle  East. In , all four BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India  and China) were among the seven biggest countries in  terms of orders received. Emerging markets accounted  for half of our net sales and  percent of our new orders  in .  Economic growth in emerging markets is estimated  to remain strong. The growing, young middle class is  becoming more auent and purchasing consumer  goods; this translates to strong growth in the consump- tion of various minerals, energy and packaging industry  pro ducts. Emerging economies are investing strongly  in new transportation infrastructure, which is a basic  requisite for sustainable economic growth and a higher  standard of living. Rapid growth areas include espe- cially India, China and Brazil, which have allocated a lot  of funds to build and improve road and other trac  networks and infrastructure. There is also a big need  for infrastructure development in Eastern Europe and  Strategic theme:      Metso Annual Report     www.metso.com GLOBAL PRESENCE Southeast Asia. The focus of new mining and construc- tion industry investments has shifted to emerging  markets that are rich in natural resources. In developed  markets the demand outlook also for the energy indus- try – including energy production based on renewable  fuels and for recycling technology related to waste  materials – is promising.  The number of our personnel working in emerging  markets grew by , and its share of total personnel  grew to  percent (%). Asia Our net sales in Asia increased by  percent and ac- counted for  percent of Metsos net sales. About   percent of our employees work in Asia.  China In , China was the most signicant country for  Metso, measured in terms of the value of orders received  (EUR  million), and net sales (EUR  million). We  employ a total of about , people in our  local  sales, production and services units in China. China is the main market area for new paper and  board lines. In  demand in China was good; we  received orders from there for ten new paper and board  machines and three pulp lines. We are the leading West- ern and local supplier in the paper and board machine  markets in China. We delivered the rst paper machine  to China in the s, and in  we established a joint  venture that started the local manufacturing of Metsos  paper machines. Our reliable references and strong  brand give us an edge in these markets where the cus- tomer often expects its partners to operate clearly more  quickly than in Europe.  We have systematically developed our local presence  in China. In  we opened our third service center  serving the pulp and paper industry in Zibo, Shandong  Province. It oers machinery maintenance and process  development services especially in Northern China. The  growing markets for paper machine fabrics are served  by our factory for wet and dry ltration applications in  Tianjin and a lter factory in Shanghai. Chinas pulp and  paper industry has made substantial investments over  the past ten years. We have been a partner in many of  these projects and we are currently the leading technol- ogy supplier in the sector. The Chinese markets for the Automation and Re- cycling businesses are growing. Last year we delivered  several extensive automation packages with ow  control equipment for paper, board and pulp mills.  However, we are expecting the most sales growth from  the Asian energy, oil and gas industries. Metsos biggest  investment in China recently, the technology center  specializing in automation and ow control solutions,  was inaugurated in May in Shanghai. The technology  center strengthens our customer service especially in  China and the Asia-Pacic region. The centers multi- functional facilities, like the modern valve factory, the  assembly unit and distribution center, and the facility  for testing automation systems, provide good op- portunities to develop automation solutions. The new  factory manufactures products and components also  for Metsos other valve factories. We are the leading sup- plier of automation for Chinas pulp and paper industry.  We also have a good market position in other process  industry sectors, like the oil and gas industry, from  which we expect growing demand. China has committed to signicantly reducing  carbon dioxide emissions in upcoming years and is  pursuing its targets by encouraging dierent industries,  like cement production, to reduce their carbon footprint.  Urbanization is generating bigger volumes of waste. In  China, our Recycling business serves solid waste- and  biomass-red power plants and refuse-derived fuel  (RDF) production plants. Our customers also include  companies specializing in the reprocessing of recycled  metals. Last year we delivered several pre-shredders and  scrap metal recycling stations to China. The Chinese gov- ernment is encouraging investments in metal recycling  equipment to reduce the metal industrys dependency  on scrap metal imported from elsewhere.  We delivered our rst rock crusher to China back  in the s. Chinas mining and construction industry  has grown briskly. Today we have close to  Metso  employees in China serving the mining and steel  industry, and supplying equipment for the produc- tion of aggregates at quarries and directly to e.g. port,  terminal, road and dam construction sites. Our modern  crusher factory in Tianjin employs over  people. The  factorys production includes a comprehensive selection  of crusher models, and it serves the Chinese and Asian  markets as well as our customers globally. Mining indus- try customers account for the majority of the Mining and  Construction Technology segments business in China.  In  we received an order for three grinding mills and  the required installation and start-up services for TISCOs  new iron-ore processing plant. TISCO is Chinas largest  producer of stainless steel.  India We have operated in India since , and today we have  a total of nine units and approximately  employees in  the country. The mining and construction industry is our  fastest growing customer segment in India. We are the  leading supplier of mobile crushers and screens in India.  India is quickly gaining prosperity. It is the worlds  second most populated country and will be an increas- ingly signicant market for Metso. Environmental issues,  the rapid growth in the need for energy and transporta- tion infrastructure will become increasingly bigger chal- lenges, oering business opportunities for Metso. Strong growth   close to   customers OUR AMBITION:     Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com GLOBAL PRESENCE Our Mining and Construction Technology operates a  crusher factory in Bawal, a foundry in Ahmedabad, and  regional sales and service units in New Delhi, Bangalore,  Kolkata, Thane, Hyderabad and Chennai. In March, the  rst phase of our largest single industrial investment so  far, Metso Park in Alvar, was completed; encouraged by  the favorable market development, phase two of the  investment has been started. The industrial park will  feature production, oce and engineering facilities as  well as a logistics and training center. The investment  signicantly strengthens Metsos presence and will cater  to the rapid growth in demand for mining and construc- tion products and services in India and other quickly  growing markets in Asia-Pacic. At the facility we also  manufacture components for our assembly units operat- ing in emerging markets as well as some products for  global markets.  Our joint venture with our Indian collaboration  partner focuses on power industry solutions and sup- plies engineering services for our other power industry  units globally. The unit, operating in Chennai, has also  designed a recovery boiler solution for the Southeast  Asian markets in particular; we have already received  two orders. Our local resources in India also serve the pulp  and paper industry and the fast-growing oil, gas and  petrochemical industry, for which we have delivered e.g.  extensive ow control solutions     Rest of Asia Rapid urbanization is creating sizable infrastructure  development needs in Southeast Asia. Indonesia is Asias  third-largest growing economy after China and India,  and it has a major pulp and mining industry. Indonesia  is the worlds second-biggest producer county of tin, the  third biggest of copper, and the fourth biggest of nickel.  Various construction and infrastructure development  projects are driving the demand for our equipment and  services in places like Thailand, Vietnam, the Philip- pines, South Korea, Malaysia and the SAARC countries  (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan  and Sri Lanka). The regional demand for mining and con- struction industry products is good, particularly for our  mobile crushers and stationary crushing plants as well  as our various pumps for use in the mining industry. In  , we received an order for board making technology  from Cheng Loong Corporation for their new container- board production line at the Hou-Li paper mill in Taiwan.  South and Central America South and Central America accounted for  percent of  our orders received. Brazil is by far our biggest market  in this region. Last year it accounted for  percent of all  our orders received, and was the third most signicant  country for Metso, measured in terms of the value of  orders received (EUR  million). Measured in terms of  net sales, Brazil was also our third largest country (EUR   million). The number of our personnel increased by   in South and Central America, particularly because  of the increased demand in the mining business. At the  end of the year, we had a total of , employees in the  region, , of them in Brazil.  In recent years, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Mexico have  become leading mining industry countries in the  world, and our deliveries to the mining industry have  grown rapidly in these countries. We have increased our  presence, particularly in the services business, close to  the big mines, and we have won several major service  agreements for mines in recent years. The growth in  the services business has had a signicant eect on the  increase in the amount of our personnel. We have been operating in Brazil for nearly  years.  We have an extensive local business network and our  customers operate in several dierent industries. In addi- tion to the mining industry, e.g. the build-up of the trans- portation infrastructure in Brazil is continuing strongly,  which supports the growth in demand for our construc- tion equipment. Sizable investments by the Brazilian oil  industry have oered signicant opportunities for our  Automation solutions. South America, particularly Brazil,  is on its way to becoming the worlds leading supplier  of pulp, and there are several pulp mill projects planned  to be launched in the region in upcoming years. We also  serve the countrys paper and tissue industry. Among  the most signicant orders we received last year, was the  order for MDF board manufacturing equipment from  the Brazilian company Berneck in Curitibanos, the order  for a ball mill and related equipment and services from  Kinross Gold Corporation for its gold mine in Paracatu,  and service and restoration of one of Celulosa Arauco  y Constitucins pulp mill recovery boilers, which was  damaged during the February  earthquake in Chile.

In Araucaria, Parana state, Brazil, we started con- struction work on a new facility serving the pulping  and power generation industries. The facility will be  completed by the end of , and at that time all Metsos  functions from Curitiba will move into the new premises.  The growing demand for maintenance services in the  pulp and power generation industries requires a more  comprehensive local presence and service capacity.   Africa and the Middle East Our strongest customer industries in Africa and the Mid- dle East are the mining and construction industries, but  there has been strong growth also in our valve deliver- ies, particularly to oil, gas and petrochemical plants in  the Middle East. In , we received an order for special  valves from the South Korean company GS Engineer- ing and Construction for a plant operating in United  Arab Emirates. The special valves, for use at extremely  low temperatures and in gas drying processes, are for a  liqueed natural gas plant.  The continent of Africa holds a signicant share  of the worlds known mineral resources, such as gold,  platinum, chromium and diamonds. A substantial share  of the worlds bauxite, cobalt, phosphate and uranium  deposits is also found in Africa.  In South Africa, we have sales and services units serv- ing our mining and construction customers. In addition,  we have a factory manufacturing rubber-based wear  parts, a factory manufacturing crushing and screen- ing equipment and pumps, and a manganese foundry  producing wear parts for crushers. Our other sites serv- ing the mining industry in the region are the sales and  services units located in Ghana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  Our Automation business has sales and maintenance  units both in South Africa and the Middle East. We also  have a sales unit for our paper and pulp customers along  with a joint venture specializing in maintenance services  in South Africa.    The number of our personnel in Africa and the Mid- dle East at the end of the year was , (,). Our orders  received from the area totaled EUR  million (EUR   million), or ve percent (%) of our total order intake.  Eastern Europe Eastern Europe is becoming an increasingly signicant  area for our business. In the long-term, infrastructure de- velopment in transportation and energy, local utilization  of natural resources in the mining and pulp industries,  and various projects supporting sustainability will  increase demand for our products.  Of the Eastern European countries, Russia is Metsos  most signicant market, and the outlook there has  developed favorably. Orders received from Russia in   accounted for ve percent of our total order intake.  We have operated on the Russian markets for about   years, and we have  sales and service oces around  the country. In , we signed an agreement for the  delivery of a complete ber line, the rst in Russia in   years. The ber line will be delivered to Ilim Group, which  is one of Russias leading pulp and paper manufacturers.  When commissioned, the Bratsk mill will be one of the  worlds biggest and most modern softwood pulp plants.  Also the Mining and Construction Tecnhology segments  orders clearly grew during the year; and there are several  big mining and transportation infrastructure projects in  the planning stage in Russia. Among the other signi- cant orders we received from Eastern Europe was the  order to deliver a complete tissue production line with  an extensive automation package for the AK GIDA SAN  ve TC company in Turkey and an order to supply a lime  calcining system to OJSC Novolipetsk Steel in Russia. The number of our employees in Eastern Europe was  , (). Our orders received from the area totaled EUR   million (EUR  million), or nine percent (%) of our  total order intake.  Developed markets Our traditional markets are the developed markets, i.e.  Western and Northern Europe, North America, Japan,  Australia and New Zealand. The focus in these markets  is on the services business and on modernization of the  existing equipment base.

However, our cus- tomers capacity utilization rates clearly improved, which  also impacted our services business favorably. We devel- oped our services portfolio by acquiring web inspection  and web break system business and rubber belt-related  business to complement our product and services oer- ing for the European pulp and paper industry. In Jyvskyl, Finland, we completed the upgrade of  the Paper Technology Centers second pilot machine. In  June we started construction work on a new factory in  Vantaa, Finland, that will manufacture special valves for  demanding applications. Metsos industrial valve pro- duction in Finland and about  Automation and Pow- er employees from the Helsinki area will move into the  new facility during the rst half of . We have strong  know-how in Finland in the product development and  manufacturing of special valves for demanding applica- tions e.g. at oil reneries and energy production plants.  The new facility will oer us even better opportunities to  develop product quality and delivery capacity.  We continued boosting the eciency of our produc- tion network by centralizing the manufacturing of tube  rolls and roll rubber covering in Finland to our Jrvenp  factory and closing our Tampere and Oulu units. The  start-up of the revamped production was preceded by  a large-scale renovation of the premises in Jrvenp.  Centralizing the manufacturing of tube rolls and rubber  coverings to the same facility will cut transport costs,  shorten lead time and improve production eciency.  In Tampere, Finland, we relocated more than ,  energy and environmental technology experts into the  same facility. The new unit is an internationally notable  cluster of boiler and automation expertise for bioenergy  solutions.  We are also establishing a production competence  center in Tampere for Power business. The new compe- tence center will develop new and ecient boiler pro- duction technology and will support our global boiler  production network.  In Germany, we sold our Flexowell conveyor belt  business to ContiTech Transportbandsysteme. Conveyor  belts and bulk material handling systems will continue  to be part of our oering to mining and construction  industry customers, but in the future we will procure  them from our subcontractors.  For the most part, in , we nished the capacity  adjustment measures that had been initiated in ,  but a few measures were left for . They mainly  involved the valve supply center in Wittenheim, France,  and the metal recycling business in Germany.

About  percent (%) of our order intake  comes from North America. The services business ac- counts for an increasing share of our business in North  America, and we have adjusted our resources and cost  structure accordingly; in fact, our number of personnel  in North America has been reduced by half during the  past ten years. The net sales of our services business has  tripled during the same period. About  percent of our  employees are in North America.  The increased budget decits also in the United  States created uncertainty, which slowed market  recovery in . However, the increase in our custom- ers capacity utilization rates had a favorable impact on  development of our services business.  A new facility for Mining and Construction Technol- ogys needs was taken into use in May in York, Pennsyl- vania. The new facility supports our capacity to serve  mining industry customers both globally and regionally.  In line with our strategy, we aim to increase our  services business; as part of this goal, we acquired the  services business of Wyesco of Louisiana in Louisiana,  United States. Wyesco of Louisiana has operated in  the service business for over  years and was Metsos  licensed repair facility for the repair of certain pulp  mill components in North America. The acquisition  complements our maintenance services, technology and  product portfolio for the regions pulp industry.  Pacic region (Australia, Japan   and New Zealand) Of the countries in the Pacic region, the demand in  Australia in  remained at a good level, particularly in  the mining industry. We received an order for two grind- ing mills and the related equipment for the Newcrest  Cadia Valley gold mine. Newcrest is Australias largest  gold producer and among the worlds top ten mining  companies. We also received an additional order for con- tainerboard making technology from Amcor Packaging  for the containerboard line located in Sydney.

A well-managed supply  chain benets everybody   With the role of Asia growing, Ari Harmaala, President  of Metso Operations in China, and Sudhir Srivastava,  Senior Vice President, Asia-Pacic, Mining and Con- struction Technology, discussed global supply chain  management.  – Ari Harmaala (AH): Today almost all raw materials,  components, production methods and services are  available in China. As long as productivity exceeds costs,  it is the place to manufacture and source products.  – Sudhir Srivastava (SS): India and China are markets  with long-term potential, but they are also increas- ingly important sourcing hubs. We have increased  our sourcing in Asia manifold and have expanded our  manufacturing footprint. This has enabled us to improve  competitiveness, especially locally but also on a global  basis.  – AH: We are building a world-class supplier base in  China. A real supply chain starts from engineering;  tailored customer needs are engineered to modular, lo- calized and standardized solutions. They are purchased  from audited suppliers or made by us.  – SS: The development of sourcing in India and China  has followed the same pattern. At rst we just made  make-or-buy decisions but now we are also transfer- ring responsibility in engineering and quality control to  those areas. Sourcing has been developed in standard  and customized oerings.   – AH: We gain by unifying knowledge, operations and  volume purchases for Metso as a whole, as we have seen  with castings and pressure vessel purchases in China.  Our customers get high-quality Metso products at  competitive prices. When deliveries from China remain  in Asia, also delivery times are shorter and the carbon  footprint is smaller. through dialogue Results     Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com METSO PEOPLE Developing our human resource management  and investing in know-how strengthens our cor- porate culture and supports protable growth.

Metso people Metso people Leadership has a signicant role in Metsos success.  To successfully implement our strategy, our leaders  must be able to inspire Metso people in their work to  achieve both Metsos as well as their personal develop- ment goals. One of our central strengths is the exten- sive know-how of Metsos employees in more than   countries; we are investing in the continuous mapping,  development and sharing of this know-how. Our vision, mission and values guide the develop- ment of our personnels know-how and well-being and  our work environment. We have dened the common  principles and practices supporting human resources  management in our HR policies.  SEE LINK 1 New leadership principles We continued the development of leadership in   and dened Metsos leadership principles. The principles  represent our shared view of what makes a Metso leader.  Succeeding together requires good leaders who are  actively involved in the daily work. The new principles  emphasize the fact that supervisors inspire, show  employees the way forward, and create an atmosphere  of trust and continuous learning. According to the  principles, supervisors must clearly communicate the  individual- and team-level goals to each employee and  invest in employee development and coaching, while  ensuring operational productivity. The new leadership principles were included in the   renewal of the performance and development  review processes. The principles were rst implemented  in the supervisors self-assessments, which all individuals  in supervisory positions carried out and then reviewed  with their own supervisors as part of the development  review in autumn. The implementation of the leadership  principles will continue in . The renewal of the leadership principles is also part  of the harmonization of Metsos ways of operating. We  take into consideration the special characteristics of dif- ferent countries and cultures in the implementation of  the uniform ways of operating. Competence development and   training programs Continuous learning and development are an important  part of Metsos development and culture. They also play  a key role in ensuring our competitiveness.  In  we separated the development review and  performance review that are part of the annual assess- ment process from each other. This ensures that at least  one of the annual reviews focuses particularly on the  employees development needs, both short-term and  long-term. This in turn enables planning for the know- how, knowledge and skills that will be needed in the  future in the dierent areas of our business and for the  correct way to develop these competences. The performance review focuses on setting and  achieving personal goals, whereas the development re- view focuses on development needs. With the develop- ment reviews we aim to ensure that we have a learning  organization and that we have competent and commit- ted personnel. They also support employee career plan- ning, internal mobility, and the sharing of knowledge  within our organization.

In  a total of  () Metso  employees spent a total of , (,) training days in  our global training programs. In other training programs  supporting competence development, we continued  investing in the promotion of Metso-wide cooperation.  Our training expenses, excluding the wages and salaries  of the participants, totaled EUR  () million.  Job satisfaction and   work well-being development projects Our TellUs employee survey provides feedback on how  Metso people perceive our company and their own  work community. The survey is a tool for the long-term  development of the organization; it can be used to spark  discussions and to generate new ideas and concrete  improvements within the work community.  The last Metso-wide TellUs survey was conducted  in late . In , based on its results, team-specic  development projects and action plans have been initi- ated to help improve the work atmosphere and to clarify  resourcing in teams. Work on occupational health and safety  Safety is a leadership issue at Metso and an indication  of work quality. Our occupational safety management is  built on a platform of employee orientation, continuous  training, risk assessment related to the workplace and  the work, measures to reduce and eliminate risks when  possible and systematic monitoring of local legislation.  Every Metso employee plays a role in workplace safety. We develop safety in the same way as other factors  related to operational quality. Our Metso-wide occupa- tional health and safety policy supports the develop- ment of a safe, healthy and well-tended work environ- ment. Every Metso employee has the right to work in  a safe manner and, at the same time, an obligation to  comply with work safety guidelines. We aim to prevent  accidents and injuries through operating guidelines and  measures that reduce risks in the work environment. In  we continued the global roll-out of our new  occupational health and safety monitoring system,  OHS Monitor; , Metso employees were within  the sphere of the monitoring. All signicant accidents,  near-miss situations and observed risks related to  occupational health and safety, as well as employee  absence information are collected into the OHS Monitor.  Analyzing the information can prevent similar incidents  throughout Metso. In factories, the system accelerates  the procedures for reviewing accidents and dangerous  situations. The standardized and comparable data also  facilitates safety communications.  The results of occupational health and safety work  and development measures that have been initiated are  reviewed regularly at follow-up meetings at various lev- els of the organization and also quarterly by the Metso  Executive Team and Board. In the long run, our target  is for zero work injuries. In  our lost time incident  frequency (LTIF) was .. Our short-term LTIF target is  less than  in every Metso unit by . LTIF reects the  number of incidents resulting in an absence of at least  one workday per million hours worked.  SEE LINK 2 Personnel structure  There was a clear turnaround to growth in our number  of personnel in . At the end of  we had a total of  , (,) employees. More than half of the person- nel increase came through acquisitions and the rest  organically, mainly in emerging markets. The share of  our employees in emerging markets in proportion to our  total number of personnel was  () percent. Women  accounted for  () percent of our workforce.  Of our personnel,  percent were employed full- time,  percent were working part-time, and the propor- tion of trainees was one percent. Permanent employees,  both full-time and part-time, made up  () percent of  the personnel structure. The overall employee departure  turnover rate was  () percent. The voluntary turnover  rate was .

The new format is extensive; thorough  preparation is a prerequisite for a successful dis- cussion. The stronger focus on leadership issues  supports both our business goals as well as em- ployee motivation, says Ulla Partanen, Director,  Service Solutions, Automation business line.

Both see it as  supportive of their own goals. Its a good opportunity to really sit down  with every employee and discuss their indi- vidual role in the light of Metsos strategy and  values, Martin says. Pia also stresses the importance of taking per- sonal responsibility for ones own development. A self-assessment before the development  review gives you a chance to think about  where you want to go; the discussion gives  you the opportunity to express it, she says.       Metso Annual Report     www.metso.com TARGETS AND ACHIEVEMENTS Targets and achievements Factors that aected our operations in 2010  Strengthening economic growth   and polarization of growth The global economy gradually gained  strength during the year. In emerging mar- kets, economic growth was strong and the  downturn didnt seem to have much impact  on economic development. In Europe and  North America, recovery was slow, and the  big budget decits in several countries  fueled uncertainty both in the real economy  and in the nancial markets. Services business growth Industrys utilization rates were up and  production volumes grew even faster than  the global national product. This and the  improved protability of the customer base  boosted demand for spare and wear parts as  well as investments in repairs, optimizations  and rebuilds that had been postponed dur- ing the dicult times. Volatility in the currency  and nancial markets Substantial regional dierences in economic  growth and the continued volatility in the  nancial markets led to strong changes in  currency exchange rates, which added to  uncertainty about the global economy and  delayed investment decisions particularly in  Europe.  Growing ination pressures The continued strong economic growth  in emerging markets and the globally  strengthened demand for raw materials  fueled ination pressures, particularly in  emerging markets, and, in the second half  of the year, also in other parts of the world.  Wage ination of the educated workforce in  emerging markets has reached a high level.  Many raw material prices approached the  peak levels seen in –.  Strengthening upswing   in the global mining industry The continued strong growth of emerging  markets increased the demand for minerals  and lifted mineral prices. Several mining  companies announced sizable new mining  projects. At the same time, the depletion of  mineral resources of existing mines requires  major investments to increase the capacity  at these mines.  Environment There is consensus around the world about  the need for eco-ecient technology to  mitigate climate change. Even so, the lack  of political decision-making related to e.g.  renewable energy is slowing the develop- ment of the markets.  1 4 5 6 2 3     Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com TARGETS AND ACHIEVEMENTS Financial targets Net sales growth > % DESCRIPTION Average annual net sales growth of more  than 10%.

We are increasing our research  and product development investments in  environmental solutions and systematically  developing our Energy and Environmental  Technology oering. Our strong global presence close to cus- tomers and our more robust investments to  develop the services business oer growth  opportunities in all our businesses.   In the long-term, we estimated that  Metsos growth will come particularly from  Mining and Construction Technology and  from Energy and Environmental Technology.  We are pursuing mainly organic growth, be- cause it has the lowest risk potential. At the  same time, we are also exploring business  acquisition opportunities that comple- ment our current product and services  oering and geographical presence, and  create added value for our customers and  shareholders. Protability Our protability in recent years has im- proved by – percentage points compared  to the period before . Our targets for  relative protability (EBITA-%) and return  on capital employed (ROCE-%) have been  set so that achieving them requires a good  demand situation consistent with a strong  business cycle like the one in –.  Calculated at todays exchange rates, our net  sales at that time were close to EUR  billion. The structure of our business operations  has a signicant impact on the achievement  of our protability targets. Our goal is to in- crease the share of the services business and  In August  we set our long-term  nancial targets. Last year, we achieved  our targets in net sales growth, protability  improvement (measured in euros), cash ow  and capital structure.  The proposed dividend exceeds our divi- dend policy.  Achieving our targets in rela- tive protability (EBITA as a % of net sales)  and return on capital employed (ROCE-%)  requires a strong demand environment.  Both key gures improved, but still fell short  of our targets. We believe that we have a  solid foundation upon which to achieve our  long-term targets as demand is restored to  the good level seen in –.  Growth Our goal is for sustainable protable growth.  The global megatrends oer us excellent  opportunities for growth. Economic growth  in emerging markets and urbanization  are increasing infrastructure investments  in transportation networks, construction  and energy capacity. This is boosting the  demand for a variety of metals and minerals,  and thus necessitating increases in mining  capacity and metal recycling solutions  globally. The rapid growth of a middle class  with more purchasing power and the rise  in the standard of living are increasing the  consumption of board, paper and tissue and  requiring additional investments for their  production.  As energy consumption grows, concern  about the changing climate and the deple- tion of fossil fuels is driving investments in  the utilization of renewable energy sources  like biomass and waste as well as in produc- tion processes that use less energy, raw ma- Our operating environment recovered sig- nicantly in , and we were again able to  turn our focus to growth and our long-term  goals. In the previous year we had a strong  focus on securing competitiveness and ex- ibility and on protability and cash ow.  The gradual economic growth that  began in  improved our operating  conditions. We made good progress in the  goals we had set for the strategy themes  important for us, i.e. increasing the services  business and eco-ecient solutions and  strengthening our presence in emerging  markets. We also continued developing our  operations towards our long-term nancial  targets. The following is a review of the  actions we have taken to achieve these  goals. We have also elevated the prevention  of work injuries and the reduction of our  energy consumption to Metso-wide sustain- ability goals.   MANAGEMENT  ANALYSIS FINANCIAL TARGETS      Metso Annual Report     www.metso.com TARGETS AND ACHIEVEMENTS to keep it above  percent of our net sales  also at the top of a business cycle. We esti- mate Paper and Fiber Technologys share of  our net sales to drop to less than  percent  in upcoming years. With these structural  changes, we estimate EBITA before non- recurring items in relation to net sales to  improve by approximately one percentage  point compared to the – period.   In addition to changes in the business  structure, achieving our protability targets  requires restoring the protability of Mining  and Construction Technology and Energy  and Environmental Technology to the previ- ous peak levels and a – percentage point  improvement in Paper and Fiber Technol- ogys protability from the – level.  Key factors for improving Paper and Fiber  Technologys protability are cutting down  the cost structure, growing the services  business, and improving the protability of  new equipment sales in the Fiber and Tissue  businesses.  We are monitoring the success of  our businesses in terms of protability  measured as EBITA-% and return on capital  employed. Realizing Metsos ROCE target  of over  percent requires EBITA to exceed   percent of net sales. The capital needs of  our businesses vary based on the type of  business in question, i.e. project, product  or services business. At the segment level,  achieving a ROCE of  percent requires  that EBITA exceeds  percent of net sales  in Mining and Construction Technology,   percent of net sales in Energy and Environ- mental Technology, and  percent of net  sales in Paper and Fiber Technology.  Conclusions The Board of Directors dividend proposal of EUR  1.55 per share reects our solid nancial position  and our condence in Metsos future performance.  Even after the dividends are distributed, we will  have a strong balance sheet to develop Metso.  Based on the development last year and assum- ing that the gradual recovery of the global econ- omy will continue, we estimate that Metsos net  sales in 2011 will grow by more than 10 percent  compared to 2010 and EBITA before non-recurring  items will further improve.    This year has its own challenges in improving  the nancial result, including the fragility of eco- nomic recovery in certain areas, climbing ination  especially in the emerging markets, and exchange  rate uctuations. On the positive side, the outlook  in the Mining business continues to improve and  prospects for services across our businesses remain  strong. The past years have clearly proven Metsos  agility and competitiveness. Metso is in a strong  position to deliver continued protable growth.      Metso Annual Report  www.metso.com TARGETS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OVERVIEW Our goal is to improve energy eciency  and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions  by 15 percent by 2015, and by 20 percent  by 2020. YEAR 2010 In 2010 we launched an energy eciency  program and established an energy ef- ciency team, and we started mapping  opportunities to save energy. YEAR 2011 In 2011 we will continue mapping the  opportunities to save energy in our  energy-intensive production units and we  will launch the rst investments targeting  energy eciency improvements. OVERVIEW The short-term occupational safety target is  a lost time incident frequency (LTIF) of <10  in every Metso unit by 2012.   YEAR 2010 In 2010 our LTIF was 12.4. Of our 93 biggest  units, 53 achieved the goal.    YEAR 2011 We will boost the focus on safety by  strengthening our occupational safety  organization and by e.g. increasing training  in occupational safety issues.  Global sustainability goals We have two sustainability goals that we  set in  regarding energy savings and  occupational safety. Last year over half of  our biggest units achieved the short-term  occupational safety goal. To achieve our  energy-savings goal, we launched a Metso  wide energy eciency program in . Global safety targets Metsos occupational health and safety policy  supports the development of a safe, healthy  and well-kept work environment. Our long- term goal is for zero work-related injuries. Our short-term occupational safety goal  is a lost time incident frequency (LTIF) of less  than  in every Metso unit by . In   our LTIF was .. LTIF reects the number  of injuries resulting in an absence of at least  one workday per million hours worked. In ,  of Metsos  biggest units  achieved the occupational safety goal we  had set. The results reported by Metsos  units in this area vary dramatically, and  there is clearly still room for improvement in  occupational health and safety work. In   we will increase our focus on occupational  health and safety by e.g. strengthening the  occupational safety organization and by  implementing new tools in occupational  safety training. We believe that every injury  can be prevented.  Energy eciency benets   the environment and the economy In  we set global, Group-wide energy- saving and carbon dioxide emissions targets  for our own production. The majority of our  reported CO2 emissions come from the use  of energy; therefore decreasing energy con- sumption will also reduce emissions – while  also bringing nancial benets.  Mapping the opportunities to save  energy and decrease carbon dioxide emis- sions at the Group level was started in the  ENERGYSAVINGS  AND CARBON   DIOXIDE EMISSIONS OCCUPATIONAL  SAFETY      Metso Annual Report     www.metso.com TARGETS AND ACHIEVEMENTS LINKS &   NOTES most energy-intensive production units,  the biggest of which are the steel and iron  foundries. The mapping will continue this  year in the rest of the energy-intensive pro- duction units. Upon completion,  percent  of Metsos energy consumption will have  been mapped.  The biggest energy-saving opportuni- ties are related to the use of fuel and heat.  Potential savings outside our production  processes were also found, e.g. in cooling  and compressed air systems.  Conclusions  We believe that the companies focusing their operations on  resolving the challenges of sustainability will succeed and will  create value and well-being for stakeholders and the sur- rounding society in the long-term.  The fast changes taking place in our operating environment  increase the importance of internal development and opera- tional improvement. Occupational safety requires continuous  development of our operations. Increasing the eco-eciency  of our own production is also an important part of our sustain- ability. Read more about sustainability in our Metso Sustainability  Results 2010 online publication at  www.metso.com. Using the results of a study by the  energy eciency team, we dened energy  eciency indexes, and the production units  reported their energy consumption in ac- cordance with the indexes for the rst time  in the third quarter of . In the future the  quarterly reporting will promote energy  eciency improvements and monitoring at  the Group level.

Technology, Energy and Environ- mental Technology, and Paper and Fiber Tech- nology – oer products and services to a range  of customer industries.  Customers in several industries  We serve customers around the world in the mining,  construction, power generation, oil and gas, recycling,  and pulp and paper industries by supplying them with  capital goods and the related process solutions and ser- vices. Most of our customers are industrial companies,  like mining companies, energy companies and paper  companies. Contractor customers are mainly in the con- struction and recycling industries. Most of our custom- ers operate in the process industry and use natural raw  materials or recycled materials in their production.  We have a balanced oering of products, projects  and services business. Large-scale project deliveries are  typical to the mining, power generation, and pulp and  paper industries. Our deliveries to the construction and  the oil and gas industries mainly consist of individual  equipment components and smaller package solutions.  The share of the services business is signicant in all our  businesses. Our customers make investment decisions based  primarily on the long-term demand and price forecasts  for their products. They nance their bigger investment  projects typically with a combination of cash ows and  debt nancing and the smaller purchases of services  and machine rebuilds with their own cash ows. As a  principal rule, we do not participate in the nancing of  customer projects.  Our customers are emphasizing return on invest- ment in their decision-making and are thus pursuing  ecient solutions with low initial investment and  operating costs.  Our customer industries Mining industry  Our mining industry customers include global mining gi- ants, signicant regional players, and smaller, local min- ing companies. In recent years the mining industry has  consolidated, but a signicant part of the worlds mining  operations is still carried out by small- and medium- sized regional and local mining companies. In the past  decade mining industry investments have shifted more  clearly to the southern hemisphere. Close to  percent  of our mining industry net sales come from major global  players or signicant regional mining companies.  We estimate that about two thirds of the equipment  and processes we supply are used in the production of  iron ore, copper and gold, but other mining operations,  such as those related to the production of nickel, plati- num, zinc, silver and diamonds, are also important to us.   Our product oering consists of e.g. crushers, screens,  grinding mills, enrichment solutions, pelletizing plants,  materials handling equipment and pyro processes as  well as expert and maintenance services.   To secure the ecient operation of their existing  mines, mining companies must make replacement  investments and purchase spare and wear parts and  maintenance services for existing machines and equip- ment also in an economic downturn. The services  business accounts for over half of our deliveries to the  mining industry, which osets the impact that economic  uctuations have on our net sales.   New mining projects are launched increasingly  in areas with geopolitical challenges and insucient  infrastructure, areas like Africa and the hard to access  mountain regions in South America. The continuing  depletion of ore bodies requires investments in capacity  because increasingly bigger volumes of ore must be  processed to produce the same amount of mineral. It is  estimated that in the upcoming years these large-scale  and highly capital-intensive projects will oer plenty of  business opportunities for companies that are large sup- pliers of technologically advanced mining equipment  and services, like Metso.  The recovery in developed markets and the con- tinued, strong economic growth in emerging markets  increased mineral consumption in . Because of the  strengthening demand and the higher price for miner- als, the capacity utilization rates of mining companies  soared, which clearly increased mining company  investments in wear and spare parts and in capacity  upgrades. Also sales negotiations for large-scale invest- ments picked up, but only a few investment decisions   www.metso.com CUSTOMER INDUSTRIES      Metso Annual Report     were nalized during . Thus investment decisions  remained clearly below the peak levels of  and  . We estimate that the investments in the mining  industry will continue to grow in  and also larger  greeneld investment projects will be nalized. Due to  the strengthening demand for minerals and our large  installed equipment base, we expect the demand for our  mining services to remain strong. Construction industry The construction industry customer base is fragmented:  The sector consists of a few major aggregates produc- ers but the majority of our customers are small- and  medium-sized companies and contractors. The net sales  of our construction business are almost equally divided  between quarries and contractors. Quarries are either  major international companies or local and regional  players. Contractors are mainly small- or medium-sized  local or regional companies operating as contract crush- ers at quarries and construction sites. Our construction  industry customers typically react quickly to changes  in the market situation by adjusting their level of new  investments.  We supply our construction industry customers with  rock crushers, mobile and stationary crushing plants,  screens and conveyors as well as expert and mainte- nance services. Our customers are interested particularly  in energy-ecient mobile solutions that can be easily  transferred from one location to another and that gener- ate as little waste, noise and dust as possible. More than  one third of our construction industry net sales come  from the services business.   Key drivers for construction industry develop- ment are the rapidly growing need for infrastructure,  especially in transportation, investments in emerging  markets and the modernization and expansion needs  of the aging infrastructure in developed markets. We  see the emerging markets, particularly the Eastern  European countries, India, China and South America, as  future growth areas. The public sectors in these areas  have earmarked signicant amounts for road network  construction and other transportation infrastructure  development.  Many countries have introduced stimulus measures re- lated to infrastructure development. These measures have  had only a minor impact so far. We expect them to have  The role of biomass   in future energy production Teemu Ruska, Partner and Managing Director of Bos- ton Consulting Groups oce in Finland, shares his view  on the role of biomass in future energy production. The European Union has set an ambitious target  for increasing the share of renewable energy from  around 12 percent of nal energy demand in 2010 to  at least 20 percent by the end of this decade. In this  context, nal energy demand covers electricity, heat- ing and cooling as well as transport fuels. All member  states have recently led initial plans on how they  are planning to meet this target. Renewable energy  targets vary from 13 percent in Belgium to as high as  50 percent in Sweden. The solution will build on a balanced mix of tech- nologies, and the relative weight of alternative renew- able technologies will vary signicantly by member  state. Biomass-based power and heat generation is  one of the important technologies utilized. Biomass is  supported not only for environmental and economic  reasons, but also for its high availability independent  of weather conditions and easily utilized heat load. Based on the country plans, total biomass-based  power and heat production will increase by over  400TWh between 2010 and 2020. Electricity gen- eration from biomass will double from 114TWh to  232TWh, and biomass-based heating and cooling will  grow from 685TWh to 1,006TWh. In absolute terms,  the highest planned increases will happen in France,  Italy and the UK.  A large share of the biomass will be locally col- lected and utilized, but big regional dierences in the  demand/supply balance of biomass will also lead to  more international trade of biomass. Very interesting  times lie ahead as more new units are built and devel- opment of the biomass market proceeds.  through cooperation Results  www.metso.com CUSTOMER INDUSTRIES     Metso Annual Report  a positive impact on construction industry demand in the  long-term. In the Asia-Pacic region and Brazil strong eco- nomic growth continues and infrastructure construction  projects are maintaining good demand for construction  equipment. We anticipate that demand for equipment  used in aggregates production in Europe and in North  America will gradually start to recover in , thanks to  the delayed replacement cycle, but will still remain weak.  We estimate that demand for our services business for the  construction industry will remain satisfactory. Power generation Independent energy companies and municipal power  plants account for about two thirds of the net sales of  our Power business, and pulp and paper mills account for  about one third. Our strengths in power generation solu- tions include our technological know-how enabling the  use of biomass and waste in energy production, and con- trolling technically challenging combustion processes  that utilize multiple fuels simultaneously, supported by  advanced automation solutions. Our oering for power  suppliers includes power plant boilers, medium- and  small-sized power plants, ue-gas cleaning systems,  automation systems as well as expert and maintenance  services.  The long-term market outlook for the energy indus- try, and particularly for energy production based on  renewable fuels like biomass and waste, is promising.   The International Energy Association (IEA) and McKinsey  have estimated that about  percent of the power plant  capacity necessary in  has not yet been built, and a  signicant share of that new capacity is estimated to be  based on renewable energy sources.  The sizable need to  modernize aging power plants in Europe and the United  States during the next two decades is estimated to also  increase demand for power boilers.  Several European countries and the United States  have set targets to increase the use of renewable energy;  we expect this to support demand for power plant  solutions based on the use of biomass and waste. We  estimate the demand for power plants using renewable  energy sources to be good in Europe and North America  in . However, uncertainties related to the nancial  markets and support mechanisms for renewable energy  may delay nal decisions in some projects. We estimate  demand for the services business to be at a good level.  Oil, gas and petrochemical industry Our oil and gas industry customers are mostly oil and  gas reners. We supply them with industrial valves used  mainly for ow control and with automation systems  used to control and monitoring processes, as well as  expert and maintenance services. Flow control solutions  are a critical part of the rening process, the eciency  of which has a signicant impact on the protability of  reneries. Over two-thirds of our automation products  go to the oil, gas and petrochemical industry, and the  rest mainly to the pulp and paper industry.  There was a favorable turnaround in the oil, gas and  petrochemical industrys investments and demand for  automation products in , triggered by the increased  demand and price for energy resulting from the global  economic recovery. We estimate that demand for our  automation products will continue to be good in , as  the oil, gas and petrochemical industries increase their  investments.  Recycling industry Our recycling industry customers are mostly regional  operators specialized in recycling. We supply the metal  recycling industry with crushers, shears, shredders and  balers and the related services. Our product portfolio  also includes technology for crushing other solid waste.  Trends in the recycling industry include sector con- solidation and expansion of operations to cover all kinds  of recycling operations, including the recycling of metal,  solid waste, electronics and energy waste.  The metal recycling industry is most developed in  Europe, Japan and North America. Growth areas include  Eastern European countries, Asia and South America.  Making the reuse and recycling of waste as ecient as  possible and utilizing the remaining waste for energy   production will become more common over the  long-term because of the aim to prevent the growth of  landlls.  We expect the demand for metal- and solid-waste re- cycling equipment to be satisfactory in . Demand for  the recycling equipment services business is expected  to strengthen, as the capacity utilization rates of our cus- tomers plants and equipment increase. The long-term  outlook in the recycling industry is good.

We are one of the  worlds leading suppliers of paper, board and tissue  lines, pulping lines, the related spare and wear parts, and  expert and maintenance services.   Investments in new machinery and equipment are  clearly more concentrated to Asia and South America,  where economic growth is strong and the raw material  used is the fast-growing, plantation-grown, short-ber  eucalyptus and acacia. Also in Russia there are several  pulp mill projects planned that utilize the countrys  extensive forest resources.  The pulp and paper industry  in Europe and the United States is adjusting its opera- tions to the permanently changed market situation, and  production capacity has been dramatically decreased.  Demand for our products and services in these areas  primarily targets machine rebuilds, process improve- ments, spare parts and consumables as well as repair  and maintenance services.   Demand for new ber lines, rebuilds and pulp mill  services has clearly recovered from the low levels of  the past few years. We expect the ber line equip- ment market to continue to be active this year with a  tight competitive environment for large new projects.  Demand for paper and board lines is expected to be  satisfactory and demand for tissue lines good in .  We expect the improved capacity utilization rates of the  paper and board industry to boost the demand for our  services business. through dialogue Results Mining companies looking for  closer supplier relationships John Trescot, Senior Vice President, Global Sales, Ross Wother- spoon, Country manager, Vice President, Australian and New  Zealand Region, and Aldo Cermenati, Country Manager, Vice  President, Services, South America, all from Metsos Mining and  Construction Technology, talked about the global mining outlook.    – John Trescot (JT): The worlds major mining companies expect  metal prices to remain high for some years, and they are investing  accordingly. After the nancial crisis, our customers are looking for a  closer supplier relationship.  – Ross Wotherspoon (RW): In Australia many major mining  companies plan to expand and grow their capacities. There has been  a rise in foreign investment in Australia from emerging markets,  especially China. Emerging economies have traditionally been huge  consumers of our resources, and now they want to take part in  developing both the resources and the associated infrastructure.   – Aldo Cermenati (AC): Also in South America, we expect  investments in new projects and existing operations. The Chinese  and Japanese presence is growing rapidly as they are investing in  new proprietary mining projects to assure a continuous supply of  concentrates.  – JT: In China and India, for example, we are being called in more  and more to work with customers on projects outside their territory.  Fortunately, we have strong operations in both countries and can  provide global support from a local base.   – AC: Customers show more interest in package solutions that  include a process guarantee, more supplier involvement on the ow  sheet design and one-source responsibility.   – RW: Customers are also trying to do more with less. There is a  greater emphasis on lower operating costs, lower water consump- tion, improved energy eciency, lower manning requirements,  reduced development time, lower capital costs, and the list goes on.  Some of the larger miners are developing highly automated facilities  that are operated from control rooms thousands of miles from the  actual mine site. The opportunity that exists for us is to provide a  total service solution that accommodates all of these requirements.  LINKS &   NOTES  www.metso.com MINING AND CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY     Metso Annual Report  Mining and Construction   Technology Mining industry investments are estimated to  be at a high level in upcoming years due to  the rapidly growing consumption of minerals  in emerging economies. Economic growth in  emerging markets requires sizeable investments  in transportation infrastructure, which supports  the demand for our construction equipment.  We are pursuing growth from the services busi- ness and by strengthening our presence par- ticularly in the growing markets in South and  Central America, India, China and Russia.  Supporting customers   throughout the product life cycle  Our strong market position is founded on our profound  understanding of customer processes and technologies,  our long-term customer relations, and our compre- hensive product and services portfolio. Our extensive  installed equipment base, which is growing rapidly par- ticularly in emerging markets, coupled with the growing  demand for minerals and aggregates create a good  platform for the development and future growth of our  services business also in the long-term.  Our mission is to serve our mining and construction  industry customers throughout the product life cycle  – from the initial delivery of the process or equipment  to the continuous optimization and maintenance. In  recent years we have put special focus on developing  our services business by e.g. expanding our oering and  strengthening our resources and customer service close  to customers.  Wear and spare parts account for some – per- cent of the net sales of the services business; mainte- nance and other expert services account for about –  percent. We see growth opportunities particularly in  equipment maintenance and various expert services,  which many customers have thus far taken care of on  their own, and in heavy-use wear parts, where the com- petitive arena is still quite fragmented. Focus of growth to emerging markets The growth and urbanization of emerging markets and  the infrastructure construction required by the increasing  stream of goods strengthen the demand for virtually all  minerals and aggregates. Both in the mining and con- struction industries, the focus of growth of new equip- ment has shifted to emerging markets and it is laying a  foundation also for the growth of the services business. In recent years we have expanded our operations  particularly in India and Brazil. Our global presence is  supported by the construction of Metso Park in Alwar,  in the state of Rajasthan, India; the industrial facility  started its operations in late . Initially, the factory  is manufacturing mobile crusher components, pumps  and rubber parts primarily for the needs of customers  in India and other nearby areas. In recent years Brazil  has become our single biggest market in terms of net  sales and number of personnel, and we will continue  strengthening our operations there. In upcoming years we will invest in developing our  business also in China and Russia so that we can tap into  the growth opportunities of these markets. Our goal is  to strengthen our local sales and service organizations in  both of these markets and to develop our local procure- ment know-how and subcontractor networks. Australia,  South Africa, Chile, Peru, Mexico and Canada are also  very important mining industry markets for us, and we  will continue to strengthen our competitiveness in these  countries.  Systematic work to  improve competitiveness We operate in global markets; growth and success in the  intensifying competition require us to continuously de- velop and enhance our operational eciency. We have  several programs under way to develop and improve  our procurement, production, supply chain logistics and  inventory management. By developing operations we  are not only targeting cost savings and the release of  capital tied to operations – our goal is the continuous  improvement of customer service and competitiveness.  Our global management and enterprise resource plan- ning systems ensure that our operations are uniform and  ecient and that we utilize economies of scale.

Minimizing the environmental impacts  of mining and construction processes has become a  key factor steering our business development and our  product oering. In the equipment and processes we  supply, we use the best available technology for reduc- ing energy consumption, emissions, noise and dust, and  maximizing protability. Also health, safety and environ- mental aspects are emphasized in all our activities.    Securing sucient capacity and highly qualied  personnel resources also play a key role. Ensuring the  availability of components and products through our  own production or via our supplier network is critical.  Competent professionals in engineering and project  management duties as well as those in maintenance  and services play a key role in enabling growth around  the world. The transfer of know-how is important in  securing operational continuity. Towards protable growth There was a clear upswing in the demand for our  products and services in  particularly in the mining  industry, and emerging markets, also in the construc- tion sector. Our goal is for protable growth and strong  competitiveness both in the short- and long-term. We  are relying on our extensive installed equipment base,  our global presence, our good customer relationships,  and our strong know-how in the services business to  help us achieve this goal.  OPERATING MODEL Mining industry products are mainly tailored for the  customers needs, and we focus on engineering and  managing delivery projects. We buy most of the manu- facturing for heavy-duty mining products from our  global subcontractor network. Construction equipment  products are mostly standard solutions. We manufacture  them in our own factories in dierent market areas, and  we focus on the nal assembly of components supplied  by our subcontractor network. We manufacture spare  and wear parts mainly in our own factories located in  dierent market areas, which enables quick deliveries to  our customers. 2009 2010 Net sales 2,075 2,235 EBITA* 201.6 264.8    % of net sales 9.7 11.8 Personnel, Dec 31 9,541 10,206 KEY FIGURES, EUR million * before non-recurring items  www.metso.com ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY    Metso Annual Report  Energy and Environmental  Technology The segments uniting factors are biomass-  and waste-based energy production solu- tions, for which Power supplies the boiler  and ue-gas cleaning technology, Automa- tion the process control solutions, and Recy- cling the solid-waste handling solutions. We aim to grow in fast-developing mar- kets for biomass- and waste-fueled energy  production solutions. Supplementing tech- nologies related to our bioenergy solutions  is an important development project for us. We are one of the worlds leading suppli- ers of comprehensive bioenergy solutions.  We have a wide selection of biomass-fueled  power plant solutions. Additionally, we have  technology for the reception and handling  of fuel, ue-gas cleaning and complete pow- er plant automation. In modern power plant  solutions, automation plays a signicant role  in boosting energy eciency and reducing  emissions.  We are also the leading supplier of power  generation solutions, recovery boilers, and  automation solutions and valves for the  pulp and paper industry. Our automation  and service solutions help our customers  increase eciency and reduce emissions and  the use of raw materials and energy in many  industrial processes. We are also a signicant  supplier of valves and services for the oil, gas  and petrochemical industry and the lead- ing supplier of metal recycling equipment.  Geographical expansion of our operations  and growth in the services business are  important development areas for us. Biomass replacing fossil fuels Global targets to reduce carbon dioxide  emis- sions and to increase the use of renewable  energy sources are boosting the demand for  biomass- and waste-fueled solutions. Bio- mass, which consists of organic materials like  wood, can be used to replace fossil fuels.  Energy produced with biomass is called  carbon neutral, because the carbon dioxide  released in the combustion process is  absorbed in new growth. Because its fast  cycling, it is estimated that biomass will  have a central role in increasing sustainable  energy production.  We are an especially strong supplier of  multifuel-red power boilers. We also have  a solid track record in converting pulverized  coal-red boilers into biomass-red boilers.  A signicant part of the coal-red power  plants in Europe and North America are  approaching the end of their useful life, and  converting them into modern biomass- and  multifuel-red boilers utilizing process  automation is expected to become topical  in upcoming years. We have developed  automation products and applications that  power producers can use to increase the ef- ciency of their power plants and to reduce  fuel consumption as well as emissions. Alongside the combustion process, we  are developing new biomass rening pro- cesses, such as gasication, pyrolyses and  torrefaction. The end result is new biomass  products that are more energy ecient,  such as bio-oil, biogas, bio-coal and other  highly rened products.   SEE LINK 1 Growth in new market areas and  services  The main markets for our bioenergy solu- tions are still in Europe and North America.  We are actively expanding our operations in  Asia and South America where we already  have a strong position in automation and  power generation solutions for the pulp and  paper industry.  One of the challenges of our Recycling  business is to grow also in emerging mar- kets. Higher oil and gas prices have boosted  demand for valves and valve services in  emerging markets.  In spring  we opened a technology  center in Shanghai, China, specializing in  automation solutions. The center provides  facilities for comprehensive engineering  and manufacturing. Local sales, service and  product support functions for Automation  Our growth in upcoming  years in the area of en- ergy and environmental  technology will be based  increasingly on the de- velopment of bioenergy  solutions. Our bioenergy  solutions are built on the  collaboration and shared  know-how for the needs  of the energy industry.  www.metso.com ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY     Metso Annual Report      Read more about how  global megatrends  impact our opera- tions, p. –  Read more about the  development of the  energy and recycling  industries, p. –  Read more about  our environmental  solutions, p. –  Read more about our  nancial development  in  in the Board of  Directors Report,  p. –  Figures, p. –  www.metso.com/ power  www.metso.com/ automation  www.metso.com/ recycling LINKS &   NOTES 2009 2010 Net sales 1,523 1,435 EBITA* 147.4 139.0    % of net sales 9.7 9.7 Personnel, Dec 31 6,060 6,073 as well as some functions of Recycling and  Power businesses are also located in the unit.  In addition to technology, we oer our  customers life-cycle services for products and  production processes as well as in-depth ap- plication know-how. We are working actively  to strengthen our position as a supplier of  key knowledge-based services close to our  customers.  Environmental awareness   brings growth Demand for energy and environmental tech- nology products and services strengthened in   as our customers increased their invest- ments and the market outlook improved. We  believe that rising environmental awareness  and tougher environmental legislation create  favorable longer-term growth prospects for  our bioenergy solutions, our energy eciency- boosting automation solutions and our recy- cling technology.  OPERATING MODEL Power industry products are tailored for the  customers needs. We focus on engineering  and project management and outsource a  signicant part of the manufacturing. Process  automation solutions account for half of our  Automation business, and control valves and  positioners for the other half. Valves and posi- tioners are assembled mainly in our own facto- ries and the components are outsourced. Our  process and automation solutions are based on  our own engineering know-how. A signicant  part of the engineering work is purchased from  our subcontractors operating in competitive  countries. Our recycling technology know-how  is related mainly to metal and solid-waste recy- cling solutions. We manufacture and assemble  recycling equipment mainly in our own units,  and the bulk of the components come from our  subcontracting network. OUR STRATEGIC   FOCUS AREAS  Development of   bioenergy solutions  Business growth in emerging  markets  Growing know-how-based   services business close to   customers * before non-recurring items KEY FIGURES, EUR million  www.metso.com PAPER AND FIBER TECHNOLOGY     Metso Annual Report  Paper and Fiber Technology Investments in new paper and board capacity  are continuing in China and elsewhere in Asia,  fueled by brisk economic growth. New pulp  capacity is being built mainly in South America  and Southeast Asia, where low-cost wood raw  material is available. Our extensive installed  equipment base oers excellent growth op- portunities for our services business globally.  We are responding to changes in the sector by  strengthening our global presence. Improving  the protability of our Fiber and Tissue business- es and cutting down the cost structure through- out the entire business segment are the key  factors in strengthening our competitiveness. Services business important in   all market areas In the pulp and paper industry the need for mainte- nance and expert services is emphasized in developed  markets, as customers are optimizing existing capacity  through process upgrades and machine rebuilds to  meet market demand and to improve protability. In the  European and North American markets we are putting  a stronger focus on developing spare and wear parts  services and other maintenance services. Our services  business development is supported by our extensive  installed equipment base and on an in-depth under- standing of our customers industrial processes. In emerging markets we oer our customers  long-term maintenance and other service agreements  already during the start-up of new projects. Oering  expert services close to customers is critical in terms  of competitiveness. Our third service center in China,  located in the city of Zibo, in Shandong Province, was  inaugurated in November . The operational growth  of our customers will continue to drive the expansion of  our maintenance network. We are growing our services business-related oer- ing and know-how also through strategic acquisitions.  At the end of  we purchased Tamfelt Corporation,  one of the worlds leading suppliers of technical textiles.  It became our new Fabrics business line. Strong position in emerging markets The consumption of paper, packaging and tissue paper  is increasing as a result of globally growing demand for  consumer goods and the fast growing middle class with  higher purchasing power in the emerging markets. The  consulting and engineering company Pyry estimates  that demand in emerging markets will grow by .–  percent a year, which requires the amount of new invest- ments to remain at about the same level as in past years.   New paper and board machine investments are con- centrated in the major and rapidly growing markets of  China. We are currently the biggest supplier of paper and  board machines and the related maintenance and expert  services in China, with a market share around  percent. It is anticipated that local competitors will strengthen  their oering, particularly as suppliers of individual  equipment components and maintenance services. Our  competitive strengths include our services business  know-how, solutions developed for local needs and  comprehensive know-how of customer production  processes. The emphasis of pulp production has shifted from  the northern hemisphere to South America and South- east Asia, where the availability of low-cost raw material  is abundant. In recent years Brazil has become one of  the worlds leading pulp producers. We are strengthen- ing our presence there by constructing a new service  and maintenance center in Araucaria. Other important  emerging markets for us include e.g. Russia and India,  where we already have a strong market position in pulp- ing equipment markets. We aim to expand our opera- tions in both countries as their markets develop. To strengthen our global presence, we are increasing  also local engineering and project management know- how in emerging markets. One of our key challenges is  to ensure that the quality of our operations and prod- ucts remains high as we increase our production and  procurements in Asia and South America.  www.metso.com PAPER AND FIBER TECHNOLOGY      Metso Annual Report     We aim to support the structural change of our  customer industry through our research and product  development by adapting our products and services to  the new needs of our customers. In developed markets  this means innovations that support the services busi- ness as well as solutions enabling entirely new business,  like forest company bio-rening projects. On the other  hand, in emerging markets this translates to increasingly  cost-ecient solutions. In addition to these, solutions  supporting sustainability are a focus area of our product  development.  Protability brings competitiveness The demand environment for Paper and Fiber Tech- nology strengthened in , after two dicult years.  Improving the protability of the Fiber and Tissue  businesses, strengthening our presence in emerging  markets and cutting down our cost structure through- out the segment are the key factors in strengthening our  competitiveness. Our innovative products and services,  our global sales and services network and our large  base of installed equipment give us a solid foundation  for strengthening our position as the industrys leading  supplier of products and services.    OPERATING MODEL  Paper, board and tissue machines are customized prod- ucts, which we engineer and assemble in our units in  the Nordic countries and China with steel structures and  components purchased from subcontractors. The Fiber  business line oers customized solutions for chemical  and mechanical pulp industry customers, and we focus  primarily on engineering and delivery project man- agement while subcontractors are manufacturing the  products we supply. We manufacture fabrics and paper  machine clothing in our own factories in dierent market  areas. The service of paper, board and tissue machines  consists mostly of repairs and maintenance of paper ma- chine rolls. We have roll service units around the world  specializing in the handling of heavy components.

Rosangela Santos De Paula. Education for disadvantaged  youth in Sorocaba   A Brazilian saying goes instead of giving sh  to the people, teach them how to sh. Since  1990, some 360 boys and girls from 16–18  years old and coming from poor neighbor- hoods in Sorocaba, Brazil, have taken part in  the Fishing Project. Supported by Metso, the  project complements their school education  and provides them with basic mechanical and  vocational skills. The target is to help them get  their rst job and to move forward in life. The  program has been successful: 90 percent of  the participants are now employed, staying  away from crime and drugs. Its an excellent program that gave me bet- ter professional opportunities. Its important  that learning also extends beyond the class- room. My family is proud of my achievements.  I now have more responsibility and am willing  to learn new things. The project gave me the  chance to be a trainee.

The budget deficits of several European countries and the United  States together with high volatility in currency exchange rates cre- ated uncertainties in the financial markets, which overshadowed the  upswing in the markets. Many major mining companies have confirmed significant capi- tal investment programs for the coming years. As a result capacity  expansion plans clearly increased, and the amount of quotations for  equipment and projects continued to strengthen throughout the year.  Several smaller mining companies still have financing challenges to  push their projects forward but the situation is improving with them,  too. Due to our large installed equipment base and our customers  growing production volumes, demand for our mining services also  strengthened markedly during the year. Demand for mining equipment  has so far related mostly to small and medium-size replacement and  expansion investments, but towards the end of the year there was a  clear increase in quotations for bigger new capacity expansion invest- ments, too. Demand for equipment and services used in aggregates  production by the construction industry was strong throughout the  year in the emerging markets in Asia, Brazil and Eastern Europe, and  showed first signs of recovery during the last quarter also in Europe  and North America. Demand for power plants utilizing renewable fuels was good in Eu- rope and North America; however, uncertainty in the financial markets  and pending policies on support mechanisms for renewable energy  delayed final decisions on orders in several projects. Demand for our  automation products clearly strengthened during the year as the oil,  gas and petrochemical industries increased their investments due to  the increase in energy prices and demand. Demand for metal and solid  waste recycling equipment and related services also turned positive as  a result of the global upswing in the demand for steel, but overall it still  remained weak. Demand for new fiber lines, rebuilds and pulp mill services clearly  recovered during the year from the low levels of the past few years.  Some large pulp mill projects in South America became active during  the second half of the year but competition remained tough. Demand  for tissue lines was strong both in the emerging as well as in the devel- oped markets. Demand for paper and board lines was at the previous  years satisfactory level with demand coming primarily from China and  smaller size board machines. The improved capacity utilization rates in  the paper and board industry kept the demand for our services busi- ness good. orders received and order backlog Orders received in 2010 totaled EUR 5,944 million, an increase of 36  percent on the comparison period. Excluding the effect from exchange  rate translation, the growth would have been 27 percent. New orders  significantly increased in all business segments and in all geographical  regions. Our customers improved capacity utilization rates were also  reflected in the strong 36 percent growth (28% excluding the impact of  the acquired Fabrics business) in our services orders compared to the  previous year. The three countries with the highest value of orders received were  China, the United States and Brazil, which together accounted for 37  percent of all orders received. All the four BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and  China) countries were among the seven largest countries measured in  new orders. The share of emerging markets in our orders received was  53 percent (48% in 2009). At the end of December, our order backlog was EUR 4,023 million,  which is 18 percent stronger than at the end of 2009 (EUR 3,415 mil- lion). Around EUR 3.1 billion of the deliveries in our order backlog are  expected to be recognized as net sales in 2011, and around EUR 850  million of these are services business orders. The order backlog at the  end of 2010 included some EUR 375 million in projects (some EUR 500  million on December 31, 2009) with uncertain delivery schedules and  which will, according to present estimates, be delivered after 2011. The  uncertainties in the order backlog mostly concern the Fibria pulp mill  project in Brazil. net sales Our net sales for 2010 increased 11 percent on the comparison period  and were EUR 5,552 million (EUR 5,016 million in 2009). Excluding the  effect from exchange rate translation, the growth in net sales would  have been 4 percent. The growth came from Paper and Fiber Technol- ogy, which recorded an increase of 32 percent and from Mining and  Construction Technology, with an increase of 8 percent. Energy and  Environmental Technologys net sales declined 6 percent due to the  low level of new orders in the previous year. Net sales for our services  business increased 17 percent (excluding the impact of the acquired  Fabrics business the growth was 10 percent) and its share of the total  net sales increased to 45 percent (42% in 2009). Measured by net sales, the largest countries were China, the United  States and Brazil, which together accounted for 36 percent of our  total net sales. The share of emerging markets in our net sales was 50  percent (44% in 2009). Financial result In 2010 our EBITA before non-recurring items was EUR 491.0 million,  i.e. 8.8 percent of net sales (EUR 399.0 million and 8.0% in 2009). The  improvement in our profitability resulted primarily from an increase  of over one percentage point in the gross profit margin as a result of  higher capacity utilization rates and sales volumes. The EBITA margin in  2010 was negatively affected by over one percentage point because of  under-absorption in several manufacturing units while capacity utiliza- tion rates were still relatively low. Selling, general and administrative  expenses increased on a comparable basis (excluding the impact of  the acquired Fabrics business, currency translation and non-recurring  items) less than 3 percent while we were preparing for increasing  order and delivery volumes especially in Mining and Construction  Technology. The profitability improved in the Mining and Construction  Technology and Paper and Fiber Technology segments while Energy  and Environmental Technologys profitability remained at the level of  the previous year. In 2010 our operating profit (EBIT) was EUR 445.2 million, i.e. 8.0 per- cent of net sales (EUR 293.6 million and 5.9% in 2009). The EBIT includes  EUR 11.8 million in non-recurring items, which had a positive impact  (EUR 64.7 million in negative non-recurring items in 2009), as specified  in the table next page. Group Head Offices operating profit in 2010 includes foreign ex- change gains of EUR 10 million from foreign exchange hedge contracts       Metso Financial Statements 2010  75  BoaRD oF DiRectoRs' RePoRt www.metso.com made by reporting segments with Group Treasury (EUR 12 million gain  in 2009). Corresponding foreign exchange losses are included in the  operating results of the reporting segments. Net financing expenses for 2010 were EUR 75 million (EUR 72 million  in 2009). Interest expenses were EUR 69 million (EUR 75 million in 2009).  Net financing expenses include EUR 10 million in foreign exchange  losses related to the above-mentioned Group Head Offices foreign  exchange gain. Our profit before taxes was EUR 370 million (EUR 222 million in 2009),  and our tax rate for 2010 was 30 percent (32% in 2009). The profit attributable to shareholders in 2010 was EUR 257 million  (EUR 150 million in 2009), corresponding to earnings per share (EPS) of  EUR 1.71 (EUR 1.06 per share in 2009). Return on capital employed (ROCE) before taxes was 13.5 percent  (10.0% in 2009) and the return on equity (ROE) was 13.6 percent (9.8%  in 2009). Financial indicators for the years 2006–2010 are presented on page  137. cash flow and financing Following the substantial reduction in net working capital and excep- tionally strong overall operating cash flow in 2009, cash generation was  also good in 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities amounted  to EUR 506 million (EUR 770 million in 2009). Thanks to continued focus  on working capital management, our net working capital decreased  EUR 25 million in January-December in spite of increasing delivery  volumes.  Free cash flow in 2010 was EUR 435 million (EUR 717 million in 2009). Net interest bearing liabilities declined considerably and totaled EUR  310 million at the end of the year (EUR 583 million on December 31,  2009). Our total cash assets at the end of 2010 were EUR 1,051 million, EUR  406 million of which has been invested in financial instruments with an  initial maturity exceeding three months. The remaining EUR 645 million  has been accounted for as cash and cash equivalents. In December, we  renewed the syndicated five-year EUR 500 million revolving credit facil- ity. The facility is primarily to support short-term funding. Our liquidity  position is good.

Our gearing continued to improve through- out the year and was 15.0 percent at the end of 2010 (32.5% in 2009) and  our equity to assets ratio was 38.1 percent (35.7% in 2009). capital expenditure Our gross capital expenditure in 2010, excluding business acquisitions,  was EUR 135 million (EUR 117 million in 2009). The share of maintenance  investments was 58 percent, i.e. EUR 78 million. Capital expenditure in- cluded two small technology related investment; in April we purchased  the paper machine web inspection and web break system business and  took over about 30 people, and in August we invested in rubber belt  related business with 16 people to complement our service and prod- uct offering to the pulp and paper industry. We estimate new capital  expenditure in 2011 to increase 10–20 percent on 2010. The first phase of our largest single industrial investment so far,  Metso Park in India, was completed in March and the second phase has  been initiated. A technology center specializing in automation and flow  control solutions and products was inaugurated in May in Shanghai,  China. In York, Pennsylvania, USA, Mining and Construction Technology  took up new office premises under operating lease arrangements in  May. In June, construction work was started in Vantaa for a new facility  to strengthen our global industrial valve production. This investment  will also be accounted as an operating lease. In Araucaria, Brazil,  construction work on a new facility for our regional pulping and power  operations has been started. In Jyvskyl, Finland, we completed an  upgrade of a pilot machine at the Paper Technology Center. In Zibo, our  third service center in China for the pulp and paper industry was inau- gurated in November. Investment projects in global enterprise resource  planning (ERP) systems are underway in Mining and Construction  Technology and in the Automation business. Mining and Construction  Technologys ERP project is estimated to be completed during the first  half of 2011. acquisitions, divestments and joint ventures In November, the two investment companies Pontos Group and Finnish  Industry Investment Ltd invested through a directed share issue a total  of EUR 20 million into our automotive business, thereby giving them a  total shareholding of 34 percent in Valmet Automotive. Valmet Auto- motives key management will be committed and incentivized through  a separate directed share issue under which the management will  invest in Valmet Automotive, too. After these arrangements, Metsos  ownership in the company will be somewhat over 60 percent. In connection with the above mentioned transaction, Valmet Auto- motive acquired Karmanns convertible roof systems in Germany and  Poland. The acquired roof business employs over 700 people and the  net sales were about EUR 170 million in 2010. As one of three leading  suppliers of roof systems, Karmann has a market share of about 25  percent and delivery agreements spanning several years. In July, we acquired the repair service business of Wyesco of Louisi- ana, L.L.C., in the U.S. state of Louisiana. The business was affiliated to  the Paper and Fiber Technology segment and it employs 30 people. In May, we completed the divestment of the Flexowell conveyor belt  operations in Germany to ContiTech Transportbandsysteme GmbH.  Flexowell was part of the Mining and Construction Technology seg- ment. In November 2009, we concluded a combination agreement with  Tamfelt, one of the worlds leading suppliers of technical textiles. The  remaining 2 percent of Tamfelts shares were redeemed in accordance  with the Finnish Companies Act, and in May 2010 Metso gained title to  all the shares in Tamfelt. Since December 2009, Tamfelt has been a part  of our Paper and Fiber Technology segment and today constitutes the  segments Fabrics business line. Research and development Our research and development activities focus on several areas that  are important in terms of sustainability and competitiveness, such as  energy and raw material efficiency, utilization of recycled raw materials,  process control technology and, increasingly, new services business  solutions. We have concentrated our R&D work on projects that offer  the best potential for capitalizing on our future growth opportunities. Our research and development expenses were EUR 111 million in 2010,  i.e. 2.0 percent of Metsos net sales (EUR 115 million and 2.3% in 2009).  In addition to this, expenses for intellectual property rights amounted  to EUR 18 million in 2010 (EUR 15 million in 2009). Our R&D resources  are spread throughout about 40 networked units in Europe, North  America, South America and Asia and employed 829 people (763 in  2009) in 2010. Our personnel made approximately 780 invention disclo- sures during the year (620 in 2009), which led to more than 180 priority  patent applications (200 in 2009). At the end of the year, approximately  3,000 Metso inventions were protected by patents (3,000 in 2009). In  2010, we launched a new, EUR 10 million stimulus package to accelerate  our long-term strategic R&D and innovation activities. The program was  focused on R&D supporting the growth of environmental and services  business. Focus areas of our R&D during 2010 were services business, energy  and environmental efficiency as well as features aimed at improving  profitability of our customers investments. New products included,  for example, service offerings for mining customers in which they can  select inspection, site supervision, maintenance, process optimization  and complete maintenance services and even performance contracts  with risk and profit sharing options. Another example is a new energy- saving layering concept for various packaging board grades reducing  customers initial investment and operational costs. During the year, we launched several R&D cooperation projects with  our partners, such as an industrial-scale development project for tor- refaction with Swedish Bio Energy Development North AB. The target is  to install an industrial-scale development unit in rnskldsvik, Sweden,  for torrefaction of wood biomasses and residues from the agricultural  sector. Torrefaction is a mild pyrolysis process, whereby green coal is  produced from biomass. Green coal is a sustainable fuel and will play  an important part as a substitute for fossil coal in power generation  and gasification processes. In cooperation with Stora Enso and Domtar  we established a long-term project to develop a future pulp mill bio- refinery based on new pulping technology. The target is to develop a  new concept that improves the energy efficiency and cost effectiveness  of the process, has lower initial capital investment costs and reduces  fiber usage, however without affecting its properties important to  paper and board quality. We are also expanding our product development activities to  emerging markets with a target to localize and customize our products  for the needs of new markets. We use our global product designs as  basic development platforms which we then engineer locally. These  products are also designed to use locally available materials and  components and to be manufactured locally. For example in 2010 our  Indian engineering team developed the first track-mounted crushing  unit primarily for the Asian market and to be manufactured in India.  The first units will be available for sale in 2011. Another good example is  a small size recovery boiler designed by the Indian power engineering  unit to be manufactured locally in India. The first boilers have already  been delivered to customers. environment and environmental technology The environmental impact of our own production is minor and relates  mainly to the consumption of raw materials and energy, emissions to  air, water consumption and waste. We are continuously improving our  environmental management practices and the eco-efficiency of our  production facilities, as well as developing our cooperation, towards       Metso Financial Statements 2010  77  BoaRD oF DiRectoRs' RePoRt www.metso.com greater environmental efficiency with our subcontractors and the  entire supply chain. We set in 2009 Metso-wide global energy savings and carbon dioxide  emissions targets for our production operations in an effort to reduce  our energy consumption and emissions by 15 percent by 2015 and 20  percent by 2020, in line with the EU goals. Our first projects targeted at  reaching those goals were launched in 2010. Many of Metsos technology solutions have been developed in close  cooperation with our customers. The solutions are related to renew- able energy sources, energy efficiency of our customers production  processes, waste management, recycling, efficient utilization of raw  materials and water, reducing dust, noise, carbon dioxide and particle  emissions, and process optimization, to name a few. We also provide training, maintenance and other services related to  our technology to secure efficient and sustainable use of the processes  and equipment we have delivered. Risks and business uncertainties Our operations are affected by various strategic, financial, operational  and hazard risks. We take measures to manage and limit the potential  adverse effects of these risks. If such risks materialized, they could have  material adverse effects on our business, financial situation, and operat- ing result or on the value of Metso shares and other securities. Our risk assessments take into consideration the probability of the  risks and the estimated impact of them on our net sales and financial  results. The management estimates that the overall risk level of the  company is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of our  operations and the practical measures available to manage these risks. The budget deficits in many European countries and the United  States with potential negative impact on funding from capital markets  coupled with strong fluctuations in exchange rates have increased the  uncertainty which could slow the economic recovery particularly in  Europe and North America. Despite this, we estimate that the business  environment in our main customer industries continues to gradually  improve because of the global megatrends like emerging markets  growth, urbanization and increasing importance of environmentally  sustainable process solutions. We estimate that the high share of our  business derived from services and emerging markets will diminish the  possible negative effects that market uncertainties may have. If the recovery in the global economy is interrupted, it might have  adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in  our order backlog. Some projects may be postponed or they may be  suspended or canceled. At the moment less than 10 percent of orders  in the order backlog are subject to uncertainties relating to delivery  schedules. In long-term delivery projects the initial customer down  payments are typically 10–30 percent of the value of the project, in  addition to which the customer makes progress payments during the  project execution. This significantly decreases our risk and financing  requirements related to these projects. We continually assess our cus- tomers creditworthiness and ability to meet their obligations. As a rule,  we do not finance customer projects. We have adjusted our capacity and cost structure in order to main- tain our competitiveness. Also our suppliers have strongly adjusted  their capacity during the past two years and it is possible that now  with the demand picking up suppliers ability to supply raw materials,  components and subcontracting services may have weakened, which  may result in delivery problems. If the recovery of the global economy  is interrupted, the markets for our products may contract, which may  lead to tightening price competition. Securing the continuity of our operations requires that sufficient  funding is available under all circumstances. We estimate that our cash  assets totaling EUR 1,051 million and available credit facilities are suf- ficient to secure short-term liquidity. Our committed credit facility, with  five year maturity, is available for withdrawal and amounted to EUR 500  million. The average maturity for our long-term debt is 2.8 years. Less  than one third of our long-term debt will mature by the end of 2011.  There are no prepayment covenants in our debt facilities that would  be triggered by changes in credit ratings. Some of our debt facilities  include financial covenants related to capital structure. We fully meet  the covenants and other terms related to our financing agreements. The levels of net working capital and capital expenditure have a fun- damental effect on the adequacy of financing. We have developed our  practices and the supporting information systems relating to managing  net working capital and we expect that these will improve our ability  to control movements in our net working capital as delivery volumes  experience an upswing. As a result of these investments we estimate to  be well-positioned to keep our capital expenditure at a moderate level  in the coming years. At the end of 2010 we had EUR 880 million of goodwill on our bal- ance sheet which is mainly related to business acquisitions made over  the last 10 years. We conduct impairment tests regularly once a year  and more frequently if needed, and have not detected any impairment.  The sensitivity tests performed in connection with the annual impair- ment test indicated that there could be risk of impairment for the  goodwill allocated to the Fabrics business acquired in 2009 in case our  business environment would adversely differ from our assumptions.  However, we do not believe that the assumptions used in the sensitiv- ity tests are likely to be realized in the near future. Changes in labor costs, the prices of raw materials and components  can affect our profitability. Currently there are also high inflationary  pressures. On the other hand, some of our customers are raw material  producers, whose ability to operate and invest may be enhanced by  strengthening raw material prices and hampered by declining raw  material prices. Currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial finan- cial risks. Exchange rate changes can affect our business, although the  wide geographical scope of our operations decreases the impact of any  individual currency. In general, uncertainty in the economy is likely to  increase exchange rate fluctuations. We hedge the currency exposures  that arise from firm delivery and purchase agreements. the United states Department of Justice   has closed its investigations related to the 2006   subpoena received by Metso In July 2010, Metso was informed by the Antitrust Division of the United  States Department of Justice that it had closed its investigation of the  rock crushing and screening equipment industry. In late 2006, Metso  Minerals Industries, Inc. had received a subpoena from the Antitrust  Division of the United States in which it called us to produce certain  documents related to an investigation of potential antitrust violations.  No further action has been brought against any party. Personnel At the end of the year, we had 28,593 employees, which was 5 percent  and 1,427 employees more than at the end of 2009 (27,166 employees  on December 31, 2009). Taking into account the impact of the acquired  and divested businesses the increase in the number of personnel is 714  people. On a comparable basis, the number of employees increased by  over 700 employees in Mining and Construction Technology which is  preparing for continued upswing in the business volumes. The number  of employees decreased in Paper and Fiber Technology by about 100  people. The amount of personnel grew most in the South and Central  America with high activity levels especially in the mining business.  The share of our personnel in emerging markets increased to 34  percent (31%). During January–December, we had an average of 27,585  employees. Mining and Construction Technology employed 36 percent, Energy  and Environmental Technology 21 percent, Paper and Fiber Technol-  78   Metso Financial Statements 2010  BoaRD oF DiRectoRs' RePoRt www.metso.com ogy 36 percent, and Valmet Automotive, shared service centers and  Group Head Office 7 percent of our personnel. The countries with the  largest numbers of personnel were Finland, China, the United States,  Sweden and Brazil. These countries employed 67 percent of Metsos  total personnel.

We also developed our employee  performance and development processes and carried out Metsos inter- national training programs with special focus on fostering leadership  skills and Metso-wide collaboration. In 2010 we continued the global implementation of our occupational  health and safety monitoring system, OHS Monitor, and at the moment  there are 18,000 Metso employees within the sphere of the system. All  observed risks related to occupational health and safety are collected  into the OHS Monitor and by analyzing them our target is that similar  incidents can be prevented. Our long-term target is zero occupational  accidents. The salaries and wages of Metso employees are determined on the  basis of local collective and individual agreements, employee perfor- mance and job evaluations. Basic salaries and wages are complement- ed by performance-based compensation systems. In 2010, altogether  EUR 1,106 million were paid in salaries and wages (EUR 991 million in  2009). Indirect employee costs were EUR 319 million in 2010 (EUR 303  million in 2009). corporate Governance statement  We have prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement of 2010  which follows the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Gov- ernance Code for listed companies. It also covers other central areas  of corporate governance. The statement is presented in this Annual  Report on pages 149–164. changes in top management In August, Metsos Board of Directors appointed Mr. Matti Khknen,  M.Sc. in Engineering, as the new President and Chief Executive Officer  of Metso Corporation and Metso Group.

Financial targets and dividend policy In connection with our annual strategy process in August, our long- term financial targets were evaluated and kept unchanged. Decisions of the annual General Meeting Our Annual General Meeting on March 30, 2010 approved the Financial  Statements for 2009 and decided to discharge the members of the  Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the  financial year 2009.

The Annual General Meeting also ap- proved the proposal to amend Article 8 (notice convening a meeting)  of the Articles of Association. The AGM decided that a dividend of EUR 0.70 per share will be paid  for 2009. The dividend was paid on April 13, 2010. The AGM elected Jukka Viinanen Chairman of the Board and Maija- Liisa Friman Vice Chairman of the Board. Erkki Pehu-Lehtonen and  Mikael von Frenckell were elected as new members of the Board. The  Board members re-elected were Christer Gardell, Yrj Neuvo and Pia  Rudengren. The AGM decided that the annual remunerations for Board mem- bers would be EUR 92,000 for the Chairman, EUR 56,000 for the Vice  Chairman and EUR 45,000 for the members and that they be paid EUR  600 for each meeting they attend, including committee meetings.

The Board  members acquired the shares from the market within two weeks after  the publication of the first-quarter 2010 interim report on April 29, 2010.  Altogether 5,580 shares were acquired, which is 0.004 percent of total  amount of Metso shares. There are no specific principles for the owner- ship of the above-mentioned shares. The auditing company, Authorized Public Accountants Pricewater- houseCoopers Oy, was re-elected as our auditor until the end of the  next AGM. The AGM decided to establish a Nomination board of the AGM to  prepare proposals for the following AGM regarding the composition of  the Board and director remuneration.

Share Ownership Plan for 2009–2011 (SOP 2009–2011) In October 2008, the Board of Directors approved a share ownership  plan for the years 2009–2011. The plan has one three-year earnings  period and required participants personal investment in Metso shares  at the beginning of the program. Any possible reward from the plan  requires continued employment with Metso and reaching the financial  targets set for the plan. At the end of 2010, the plan had 88 participants  and the rewards that can be paid correspond to a maximum of 369,925  Metso shares. Members of the 2010 Executive Team may receive a maxi- mum of 77,400 shares as share rewards. Share Ownership Plan for 2010–2012 (SOP 2010–2012) In October 2009, the Board of Directors approved a similar kind of  share ownership plan for the years 2010–2012. The plan has one three- year earnings period and required participants personal investment  in Metso shares at the beginning of the program. Any possible reward  from the plan requires continued employment with Metso and reach- ing the financial targets set for the plan. At the end of 2010, the plan  had 91 participants and the rewards that can be paid correspond to  a maximum of 339,350 Metso shares. Members of the 2010 Executive  Team may receive a maximum of 77,400 shares as share rewards. Share Ownership Plan for 2011–2013 (SOP 2011–2013) In September 2010, the Board of Directors approved a share ownership  plan for 2011–2013. The plan includes one three-year earnings period.  The plan requires participants personal investment in Metso shares  at the beginning of the program. Any possible reward from the plan  requires continued employment with Metso and reaching the financial  targets set for the plan. At the end of 2010, 74 people had confirmed  their participation in the plan and the rewards that can be paid cor- respond to a maximum of 251,698 Metso shares. The shares for the  plan are acquired in public trading and therefore the plan will not have  diluting effect on the share value. Members of the new Executive Team  (as of March 2011) may receive a maximum of 77,400 shares as share  rewards.

Excluding  the impact of exchange rate translation, net sales would have declined  by 2 percent. In the mining business, net sales grew 10 percent and in  the construction business 4 percent. The services business net sales  increased 12 percent and accounted for 51 percent of the segments net  sales (49% in 2009). Mining and Construction Technologys EBITA before non-recurring  items was EUR 264.8 million (non-recurring items are analyzed in the  Financial result section), i.e. 11.8 percent of net sales in January–  December (EUR 201.6 million and 9.7% in 2009). Improved capacity  utilization rates contributed positively to the profitability, while on the  other hand, profitability was weakened due to the 4 percent underlying  increase in selling, general and administrative expenses when prepar- ing for higher market activity and delivery volumes in 2011.  80   Metso Financial Statements 2010  BoaRD oF DiRectoRs' RePoRt www.metso.com Operating profit (EBIT) for January–December was EUR 290.4 million,  i.e. 13.0 percent of net sales (EUR 198.8 million and 9.6% in 2009). EBIT  includes positive non-recurring items of EUR 32.3 million net, while in  2009 non-recurring items strengthened the EBIT by EUR 1.2 million. Orders received by Mining and Construction Technology in January– December grew 48 percent from the comparison period and totaled  EUR 2,457 million. Orders received grew in all geographical regions.  Orders from mining customers increased 61 percent and orders from  construction customers 25 percent. Orders received from emerging  markets grew almost 80 percent and totaled 61 percent of all the seg- ments orders received (51% in 2009). New orders received in January–  December included grinding equipment deliveries for the Kinross Gold  goldmine in Brazil, mining equipment for Tiscos iron ore processing  plant in China and mining and minerals processing equipment and  services for Nordic Mines new gold ore processing plant in Finland. The  increase in services orders was 26 percent. The order backlog strengthened 30 percent during the year and  totaled EUR 1,356 million at the end of December (EUR 1,041 million  on December 31, 2009). At the end of December our order backlog  included mining equipment orders that are subject to uncertainties,  primarily related to delivery schedules, of around EUR 50 million.

Excluding the impact of exchange rate transla- tion, net sales would have declined by 10 percent. Net sales declined 8  percent in the Power business, 4 percent in the Automation business  and 5 percent in the Recycling business. The services business net sales  increased 6 percent and accounted for 39 percent of the segments net  sales (35% in 2009). Energy and Environmental Technologys EBITA before non-recurring  items was EUR 139.0 million, i.e. 9.7 percent of net sales (EUR 147.4 mil- lion and 9.7% in 2009). Successful execution of large delivery projects  had a positive impact on profitability, whereas the decline in net sales  had a negative impact. Operating profit (EBIT) for January–December declined and was EUR  111.4 million, i.e. 7.8 percent of net sales (EUR 118.1 million and 7.8% in  2009). The EBIT includes EUR 7.9 million non-recurring expenses (non- recurring items are analyzed in the Financial result section) primarily  related to capacity adjustment actions (non-recurring expenses EUR 11.1  million in 2009). Orders received by the segment increased 18 percent on the com- parison period and totaled EUR 1,528 million. Orders received increased  in all of the business lines. Major orders received include biomass boil- ers for Bomhus Energi in Sweden, RWE npower renewables in the UK  and for 4Ham Cogen in Belgium. In addition, several automation orders  for power plants, pulp mills, paper, board and tissue lines as well as oil  and gas projects were received. In the Recycling business we received  several sizable metal and solid waste recycling shredder orders. The  increase in services orders was 35 percent. The order backlog at the end of 2010, EUR 1,158 million, was 12  percent higher than at the end of 2009. The order backlog includes  projects worth about EUR 90 million with uncertain delivery schedules.  The uncertainty is mostly related to the deliveries of power boiler and  automation technology for Fibrias pulp mill project in Brazil.

Excluding the impact of  exchange rate translation net sales would have grown by 26 percent.  The growth in net sales came from all business lines. The comparable  net sales growth, i.e. excluding the impact of exchange rate translation  and the acquired Fabrics business, was 16 percent. The net sales of the  services business increased 35 percent and accounted for 41 percent  of the net sales (41% in 2009). The growth in the services business net  sales excluding the acquired Fabrics business line was 9 percent. Paper and Fiber Technologys EBITA before non-recurring items was  EUR 107.6 million, i.e. 5.8 percent of net sales (EUR 71.3 million and 5.1%  in 2009). The improvement in profitability resulted primarily from the  strengthened profitability in the services business and from strong net  sales growth. Fourth quarter profitability was negatively impacted by  delivery mix both in the capital and services part of the business and  by an increase in provisions in some projects where new technologies  were launched. Operating profit (EBIT) for January–December was EUR 70.3 million,  i.e. 3.8 percent of net sales (EUR 0.8 million and 0.1% in 2009). The EBIT  includes non-recurring items (non-recurring items are analyzed in the  Financial result section), which weaken the EBIT by a total of EUR 8.4  million (non-recurring items in 2009 weakened the EBIT by EUR 54.8  million). Overall, the value of orders received by Paper and Fiber Technology  increased 41 percent and was EUR 1,947 million. New orders from paper  and board customers decreased 6 percent and orders from the pulp  industry were up 131 percent on the exceptionally weak comparison pe- riod. Orders from tissue customers grew 81 percent. The increase in ser- vices orders was 55 percent (24 percent without the Fabrics business).  Among the orders received in 2010 were board-making technology and  machinery for Cheng Loong in Taiwan, for Saica Containerboard in the  UK as well as for Zhejiang JiAn in China, a fine paper line for APRIL Fine  Paper (Guangdong) in China, a kraft pulp mill for Japanese Oji Paper to  China and the main technology for Ilim Groups new kraft pulp mill in  Bratsk, Russia. At the end of December, the order backlog was EUR 1,559 million.  Around EUR 240 million of the order backlog include uncertainties,  which relates to the pulp mill project for Fibria in Brazil, for which the  delivery schedule is still open.

Metsos nomination Board proposes eight members   to the Board of Directors The Nomination Board established by Metsos Annual General Meeting  proposes to the next Annual General Meeting, which is planned to be  held on March 30, 2011, that the number of Board of Directors members  is eight. The Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that  the present members of the Board of Directors Mikael von Frenckell,  Maija-Liisa Friman, Christer Gardell, Yrj Neuvo, Erkki Pehu-Lehtonen,  Pia Rudengren and Jukka Viinanen would be re-elected. In addition, it  is proposed to elect Ozey K. Horton, Jr as a new member of the Board  of Directors. The Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting  that the annual remuneration payable to the members of the Board  of Directors be equal to the remuneration payable to the current  members of the Board of Directors based on the decision of the Annual  General Meeting 2010, however, with the change that the remunera- tion payable to the Chairman of the Audit Committee be equal to the  remuneration payable to the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors:  EUR 92,000 for the Chairman of the Board of Directors, EUR 56,000 for  the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and for the Chairman of  the Audit Committee, and EUR 45,000 for each member of the Board of  Directors. In addition, the Nomination Board proposes that a meeting  fee in the amount of EUR 600 shall be paid for those members whose  place of residence is in Nordic countries, EUR 1,200 for those members  whose place of residence is elsewhere in Europe and EUR 2,400 for  those member whose place of residence is outside of Europe for the  meetings attended, including the meetings of the committees of the  Board of Directors. The Nomination Board proposes that 40 percent of  the annual remunerations are paid in Metso shares acquired from the  market. The shares shall be acquired directly on behalf of the Board  members within two weeks from the release of interim report for   January 1 – March 31, 2011. The Nomination Board notes that a personnel representative will  participate as an external expert in the Metso Board meetings also in  the next Board term within the limitations imposed by Finnish law.  The new Board of Directors will invite the personnel representative as  its external expert in its organizing meeting after the Annual General  Meeting. Kari Jrvinen acted as the Chairman of the Nomination Board and  the other members were Lars Frberg, Matti Vuoria and Harri Sailas.  Jukka Viinanen was the Nomination Boards expert member. short-term outlook We estimate that the gradual recovery will continue in most of our  customer industries this year. In the emerging markets the outlook  continues strong. The uncertainty caused by the budget deficits in  several European countries and the United States, availability of fund- ing and fluctuations in the exchange rates may, however, slow down  the recovery, especially in Europe and North America. We anticipate  that the improving capacity utilization rates of our customer industries  will support our services business, and most of our customers are  expected to gradually regain their confidence to invest in existing and  new capacity. Metal prices have continued to increase primarily due to strong  demand in China and India as well as stabilization of the US economy,  together with tight supply in several metals such as copper and iron  ore. The number of quotations for equipment and projects from min- ing companies has strongly increased since the beginning of 2010,  especially during the latter half of the year. This has had a clear positive  impact on our orders so far, and we expect stronger activity in larger  projects this year since the industry players have confirmed significant  capital investment programs for the coming years. Due to the strength- ening demand for minerals and our large installed equipment base, we  expect demand for our mining services to continue strong. In the Asia-Pacific region and Brazil strong economic growth con- tinues and infrastructure construction projects are maintaining good  demand for construction equipments. We anticipate that demand for  equipment used in aggregates production by the construction industry  in Europe and in North America will gradually start to recover in 2011  thanks to the delayed replacement cycle but still remain weak. We  estimate that demand for our services business for the construction  industry will remain satisfactory. Demand for power plants that utilize renewable energy sources is  expected to be good in Europe and North America in 2011. Several  European countries and the United States have published targets to  increase the use of renewable energy and this is expected to support  demand for our power plant solutions fuelled by biomass and waste.  However, uncertainty in the financial markets and pending poli- cies over support mechanisms for renewable energy may delay final  decisions in some of the projects under negotiations. Demand for the  power plant services business is expected to be good. We estimate that demand for our automation products will con- tinue to be good in 2011, as the oil, gas and petrochemical industries  increase their investments due to the improvement in energy prices  and demand. Demand for automation products in the pulp and paper  industry is also expected to develop favorably. Demand for our services  business for automation solutions is expected to be good. We expect the demand for metal and solid waste recycling equip- ment to be satisfactory. Demand for recycling equipment services is ex- pected to continue improving over the coming quarters as the capacity  utilization rates of our customers plants and equipment improve. Demand for new fiber lines, rebuilds and pulp mill services has clear- ly recovered from the low levels of the past few years. We expect the  fiber line equipment market to continue to be active in 2011 with a tight  competitive environment for large new projects. Demand for paper  and board lines is expected to be satisfactory and for tissue lines good  in 2011. We expect the improved capacity utilization rates of the paper  and board industry to boost the demand for our services business.  82   Metso Financial Statements 2010  BoaRD oF DiRectoRs' RePoRt www.metso.com Based on the development in 2010 and assuming that the gradual  recovery of the global economy will continue, we estimate that our  net sales in 2011 will grow over 10 percent compared to 2010 and EBITA  before non-recurring items will improve. Our estimate is based on our  order backlog of EUR 4.0 billion at the end of 2010, which contains  orders worth about EUR 3.1 billion for 2011. The estimates for our financial performance in 2011 are based on  Metsos current market outlook and business scope as well as foreign  exchange rates similar to the end of 2010. Board of Directors proposal for the use of profit The Parent Companys distributable funds totaled EUR 1,525,868,957.58  on December 31, 2010, of which the net profit for the year was  EUR 264,850,234.96. The Board of Directors proposes based on the balance sheet to be  adopted for the financial period ended on December 31, 2010, that a  dividend of EUR 1.55 per share be distributed. The proposed dividend  takes into consideration Metsos strong financial position and dividend  policy. Furthermore, it should be noted that the dividend paid in 2009  was 25 percent of earnings per share because of the financial mar- ket turmoil at that point of time. The dividend is paid to a shareholder who on the record date  April 4, 2011 is registered as a shareholder in the companys share- holders register maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd.

The main customer industries operate  in mining, construction, power generation, automation, recycling as  well as in pulp and paper industries. Metso Corporation is a publicly listed company and its shares are  listed on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd under the trading symbol  MEO1V. Metso Corporation is domiciled in Finland and the address of  the Group Head Office is Fabianinkatu 9A, 00130 Helsinki, Finland. These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by  the Board of Directors on February 3, 2011 after which, in accordance  with Finnish Company Law, the financial statements are either ap- proved, amended or rejected in the annual shareholders meeting. Basis of preparation and changes in accounting policies The consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by  the EU include the financial statements of Metso Corporation and its  subsidiaries. There are no differences between IFRS standards and  interpretations as adopted by the EU, as applied in Metso, and IFRS as  written by the IASB. From January 1, 2010 onwards Metso has applied prospectively IFRS 3  (Revised), Business combinations, which requires expensing of transac- tion costs. In addition, all payments to purchase a business are to be  recorded at fair value on the acquisition date, with some contingent  payments subsequently remeasured at fair value through income state- ment. Goodwill may be calculated based on the parents share of net  assets or it may include goodwill related to non-controlling interests.  The impact of the revised standard has been expensing of direct acqui- sition costs amounting to less than EUR 2 million, which under previous  standard would have been capitalized in the acquisition cost. From January 1, 2010 onwards Metso has applied IAS 27 (Revised),  Consolidated and separate financial statements. The revised standard  requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to  be recorded in equity if there is no change in control. They no longer  result in goodwill or gains and losses. The standard also specifies the  accounting when control is lost. Any remaining interest in the entity is  remeasured to fair value and a gain or loss is expensed. Subsequent to  revised standard, Metso has recognized a gain of EUR 8 million directly  under shareholders equity in 2010. From January 1, 2010 onwards Metso has applied the amendment to  IAS 38 Intangible assets, which clarifies the requirements under IFRS 3  Business combinations regarding the accounting for intangible assets  acquired in a business combination and allows for the combination of  intangible assets with equal economic useful life to one asset group.  The adoption has not impacted the business combinations done in2010. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, re- quires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the  reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the re- ported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost conven- tion, except for assets and liabilities classified as fair valued through  profit and loss, available-for-sale investments, financial instruments  held for trading and derivative instruments, which are recognized at  fair value.  Principles of consolidation Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements  of the Parent Company and each of those companies in which it owns,  directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, over 50 percent of the voting  rights or in which it is in a position to govern the financial and operat- ing policies of the entity. The companies acquired during the financial  period have been consolidated from the date Metso acquired control.  Subsidiaries sold have been included up to their date of disposal. All intercompany transactions, balances and gains or losses on  transactions between subsidiaries are eliminated as part of the  consolidation process. Non-controlling interests are presented in the  consolidated balance sheets within equity, separate from the equity  attributable to shareholders. Non-controlling interests are separately  disclosed in the consolidated statements of income. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition  method. The purchase consideration of an acquisition is measured at  fair value over the assets given up, shares issued or liabilities incurred  or assumed at the date of acquisition. The purchase considerations for  acquisitions realized prior to 2010 include also related direct acquisition  costs. For each acquisition the non-controlling interest in the acquiree,  if any, can be recognized either at fair value or at the non-controlling  interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets. The excess  acquisition price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognized  as goodwill (see also intangible assets). If the purchase consideration is  less than the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired,  the difference is recognized directly through profit and loss. Transactions with non-controlling interests are regarded as transac- tions with equity owners. In case of purchases from non-controlling in- terests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant  share of the carrying value of net assets acquired in the subsidiary is  recorded in shareholders equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non- controlling interests are also recorded directly in shareholders equity. notes to the Consolidated  Financial Statements 1 ACCounTIng PRInCIPleS      Metso Financial Statements 2010  89  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com Associated companies and joint ventures The equity method of accounting is used for investments in associ- ated companies in which the investment provides Metso the ability to  exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies  of the investee company. Such influence is presumed to exist for invest- ments in companies in which Metsos direct or indirect ownership is  between 20 and 50 percent of the voting rights. Investments in as- sociated companies are initially recognized at cost after which Metsos  share of their post-acquisition retained profits and losses is included  as part of investments in associated companies in the consolidated  balance sheets. Under the equity method, the share of profits and losses of associ- ated companies and joint ventures is presented separately in the  consolidated statements of income.  Investments in joint ventures in which Metso has the power to jointly  govern the financial and operating activities of the investee company  are accounted for using the equity method. segment reporting Metsos operations are divided into three operating segments: Mining  and Construction Technology, Energy and Environmental Technol- ogy, and Paper and Fiber Technology, the performances of which are  regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, in Metso the  Board of Directors, to decide on allocation of resources and to assess  the performance.  The performance of each segment is reported in the notes using  same measurements and subtotals as reported to the chief operating  decision maker. One key indicator of performance is EBITA (Earnings  Before Interest, Taxes and Amortization). In 2010 the performance is  further being analyzed by excluding from EBITA items qualifying as  non-recurring, such as capacity adjustment costs, outcome of material  intellectual property rights disputes, gains and losses on disposal  of listed shares and gains and losses on business disposals, business  prospection and acquisition costs and other infrequent events, as these  items reduce the comparability of the segments performance from  one period to another. For comparative purposes the performance of  previous years is presented in the reporting segment note using the  new measurement. The accounting policies applicable to the segment reporting are the  same as those used for establishing the consolidated financial state- ments. Foreign currency translation The financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Parent  Companys functional currency and Metsos presentation currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange  prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the end of the accounting  period, unsettled foreign currency transaction balances are valued at the  rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Trade flow related  foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in other operat- ing income and expenses, unless the foreign currency denominated  transactions have been subject to hedge accounting, in which case the  related exchange gains and losses are recorded in the same line item as  the hedged transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses associated  with financing are entered as a net amount under financial income and  expenses. The statements of income of subsidiaries with a functional currency  different from the presentation currency are translated into euro at the  average exchange rates for the financial year and the balance sheets are  translated at the exchange rate of the balance sheet date. This exchange  rate difference is recorded through Other Comprehensive Income/Ex- pense (OCI) in the cumulative translation adjustment line item in equity.  The translation differences arising from subsidiary net investments and  long-term subsidiary loans without agreed settlement dates are recog- nized through the OCI to the cumulative translation adjustments under  equity. When Metso hedges the net investment of its foreign subsidiaries  with foreign currency loans and with financial derivatives, the transla- tion difference is adjusted by the currency effect of hedging instruments  which has been recorded, net of taxes, through the OCI in equity. When  a foreign entity is disposed of, the respective accumulated translation  difference, including the effect from qualifying hedging instruments, is  reversed through the OCI and recognized in the consolidated statements  of income as part of the gain or loss on the sale. Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognized in the balance sheet at fair value  and subsequently measured at their fair value at each balance sheet  date. Derivatives are designated at inception either as hedges of firm  commitments or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedge), or as hedg- es of net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), or  as derivatives at fair value through profit and loss that do not meet the  hedge accounting criteria. In case of hedge accounting, Metso documents at inception the  relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items in  accordance with its risk management strategy and objectives. Metso  also tests the effectiveness of the hedge relationships at hedge incep- tion and quarterly both prospectively and retrospectively. Derivatives are classified as non-current assets or liabilities when the  remaining maturity exceeds 12 months and as current assets or liabili- ties when the remaining maturity is less than 12 months. Cash flow hedge Metso applies cash flow hedge accounting to certain interest rate  swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and to electricity forwards. Metso designates only the currency component of the foreign cur- rency forward contracts as the hedging instrument to hedge foreign  currency denominated firm commitments. The interest component  is recognized under other operating income and expenses, net. The  gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the currency forward  contracts is recognised in the income statement concurrently with  the underlying in the same line item. The effective portion of foreign  currency forwards hedging sales and purchases is recognized in the net  sales and the cost of goods sold, respectively. The gain or loss relating  to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate  borrowings is recognised in the income statement within financial  items. Both at hedge inception and at each balance sheet date an  assessment is performed to ensure the continued effectiveness of the  designated component of the derivatives in offsetting changes in the  fair values of the cash flows of hedged items. Metso assesses regularly the effectiveness of the fair value changes  of the electricity forwards in offsetting the changes in the fair value  changes of the underlying forecasted electricity purchases in different  countries. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the elec- tricity forward contracts is recognised in the cost of goods sold. The effective portion of the derivatives is recognized through OCI  in the hedge reserve under equity and reversed through OCI to be  recorded through profit and loss concurrently with the underlying  transaction being hedged. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective  portion of the derivatives is reported under other operating income  and expenses, net or under financial items when contracted to hedge  variable rate borrowings. Should a hedged transaction no longer be  expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognized  under equity is reversed through OCI to profit and loss. Net investment hedge Metso hedges its net foreign investments in certain currencies to  reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations. The hedging instru- ments are mainly foreign currency loans and foreign currency forward  contracts. Both realized and unrealized exchange gains and losses  measured on these instruments are recorded, net of taxes, through OCI  in a separate component of equity against the translation differences  arising from consolidation to the extent these hedges are effective. The   90   Metso Financial Statements 2010  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com interest portion of derivatives qualifying as hedges of net investment is  recognized under financial income and expenses, net. Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.  These instruments, which have been contracted to mitigate risks arising  from operating and financing activities, comprise foreign exchange  forward contracts, currency and interest rate options, interest rate  swaps and swap agreements for nickel. Changes in the fair value of  interest rate swaps are recognized in interest expenses. Changes in the  fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts are mainly recognized  in other operating income and expenses. However, when the foreign  exchange forwards have been contracted to mitigate the exchange  rate risks arising from foreign currency denominated cash and from  financial instruments used for cash management, the changes in  fair value of the derivatives are recognized in financial income and  expenses, net. Changes in the fair value of other derivative instruments  such as commodity instruments are recognized in other operating  income and expenses, net.  Fair value estimation of derivative instruments The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts is determined  using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. The  fair value of the interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of  the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. The  fair value of the commodity forwards and swaps are based on quoted  market prices at the balance sheet date. The fair value of options is  determined using Black-Scholes valuation model. employee benefits Share-based payments Metso has share-based incentive plans for its key personnel.  The equity-settled share awards are valued based on the market  price of the Metso share as of the grant date, and recognized as an  employee benefit expense over the vesting period with corresponding  entry in other reserves of the equity. The liability resulting from the  cash-settled transactions is measured based on the market price of the  Metso share as of the balance sheet date and accrued as an employee  benefit expense with corresponding entry in the current liabilities until  the settlement date.  Market conditions, such as the total shareholder return upon which  vesting is conditioned, is taken into account when estimating the fair  value of the equity instruments granted. The expense relating to the  market condition is recognized irrespective of whether that market  condition is satisfied. Non-market vesting conditions, such as operating profit and earn- ings per share targets, are included in assumptions about the amount  of share-based payments that are expected to vest. At each balance  sheet date, Metso revises its estimates on the amount of share-based  payments that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision to previ- ous estimate is recognized through profit and loss with corresponding  adjustment to equity and current liabilities, as appropriate.  Pensions and coverage of pension liabilities Metso has several different pension schemes in accordance with local  regulations and practices in countries where it operates. In certain  countries, the pension schemes are defined benefit plans with retire- ment, disability, death, and other post retirement benefits, such as  health services, and termination income benefits. The retirement ben- efits are usually based on the number of service years and the salary  levels of the final service years. The schemes are generally funded  through payments to insurance companies or to trustee-administered  funds as determined by periodic actuarial calculations. In addition, certain companies within Metso have multi-employer  pension arrangements and defined contribution pension schemes. The  contributions to defined contribution plans and to multi-employer and  insured plans are charged to profit and loss concurrently with the pay- ment obligations. In the case of defined benefit plans, the liability recognized from the  plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation as of the bal- ance sheet date, adjusted by the fair value of the plan assets and by the  unamortized portion of past service cost. Independent actuaries calcu- late the defined benefit obligation by applying the projected unit credit  method under which the estimated future cash flows are discounted to  their present value using the interest rates approximating the terms of  the pension engagement. The cost of providing retirement and other  post retirement benefits to the personnel is charged to profit and loss  concurrently with the service rendered by the personnel. Actuarial gains  and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial  assumptions and amendments to plans are recognized through OCI in  shareholders equity. Revenue recognition Revenues from goods and services sold are recognized, net of sales taxes  and discounts, when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  are transferred to the buyer or when legal title of the goods and respon- sibility for shipment has been transferred to the buyer. The transfer of  risk takes place either when the goods are shipped or made available  to the buyer for shipment depending on the terms of the contract. The  credit worthiness of the buyer is verified before engaging into a sale.  However, if a risk of non-payment arises after revenue recognition, a  provision for non-collectability is established. Percentage-of-completion method Sales and anticipated profits under engineering and construction con- tracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion basis. The stage of  completion is determined either by units of delivery, which are based on  predetermined milestones and on the realized value added (contract val- ue of the work performed to date) or by the cost-to-cost method of ac- counting. Estimated contract profits are recorded in earnings in propor- tion to recorded sales. In the cost-to-cost method, sales and profits are  recorded after considering the ratio of accumulated costs to estimated  total costs to complete each contract. Subcontractor materials, labor and  equipment, are included in sales and costs of goods sold when manage- ment believes that Metso is responsible for the ultimate acceptability of  the project. Changes to total estimated contract costs and losses, if any,  are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Service revenue Revenues from short-term service contracts are recognized once the  service has been rendered. Revenues from long-term service contracts  are recognized using the output method. Trade-ins Sales against which trade-ins are accepted are recorded at contract price.  Any reduction between the agreed trade-in price and its recorded value  in the inventory is recognized in cost of goods sold concurrently with  the sale. Government grants Government grants relating to acquisition of property, plant and equip- ment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset and they  reduce the depreciation charge of the related asset. Other government  grants are deferred and recognized in profit and loss concurrently with  the costs they compensate. Emission rights and trading Metso has received emission rights under the European Emission Trading  Scheme. These rights, for the recognition of which there are no authori- tative rules, are recognized as government grants at acquisition price  and as they have been granted free of charge their acquisition value is  nil. They are being consumed concurrently with CO2 emissions over the       Metso Financial Statements 2010  91  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com compliance period. Any excess of rights is disposed of and the gain is  recognized under other operating income. Should the emissions made  exceed the initially allocated rights, additional rights are acquired at  prevailing market price and recognized as cost in the costs of goods  sold.    other operating income and expenses, net Other operating income and expenses, net, comprise income and  expenses, which do not directly relate to the operating activity of  businesses within Metso or which arise from unrealized and real- ized changes in fair value of foreign currency denominated financial  instruments associated with the operating activity, including forward  exchange contracts. Such items include costs related to significant  restructuring programs, gains and losses on disposal of assets, except  for those qualifying as discontinued operations, and foreign exchange  gains and losses, excluding those qualifying for hedge accounting and  those, which are reported under financial income and expenses, net.  Additionally, non-recoverable foreign taxes, which are not based on  taxable profits, are reported in other operating income and expenses,  net. These include for example foreign taxes and/or suchlike payments  not based on Double Tax Treaties in force. income taxes Income taxes presented in the consolidated statements of income  consist of current and deferred taxes. Current taxes include estimated  taxes corresponding to the Group companies results for the financial  year, and adjustments to taxes for previous years. A deferred tax liability or asset has been determined for all tempo- rary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their  amounts in financial reporting, using the enacted tax rates effective for  the future years. The deferred tax liabilities are recognized in the bal- ance sheet in full, and the deferred tax assets are only recognized when  it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profit against which  the asset can be utilized. No deferred income tax is accounted for if  it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction  other than a business combination. No deferred tax liability has been recognized for undistributed earn- ings of domestic subsidiaries (i.e. Finnish) since such earnings can be  transferred to the Parent Company without tax consequences. Metso  does not provide deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of  foreign subsidiaries, except in situations where Metso has elected to  distribute earnings, which become subject to additional non-recover- able taxes triggered by a distribution. earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attribut- able to equity shareholders of the Parent Company by the weighted  average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding  own shares. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by including the potentially  diluting ordinary shares to the weighted average number of ordinary  shares in issue excluding own shares. The potentially diluting ordinary  shares are related to the share ownership plans targeted to Metsos key  personnel.  Fixed assets Fixed assets comprise intangible assets and property, plant and equip- ment. Intangible assets Intangible assets, which comprise mainly goodwill, trademarks, patents  and licenses, are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortiza- tion and impairment loss, if any. Goodwill and intangible assets with  indefinite useful lives, such as brands, are not amortized, but tested  annually for impairment. Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets  with a definite useful life is calculated on a straight-line basis over the  expected economic lives of the assets as follows: Patents and licenses  5 – 10 years Computer software  3 – 5 years Technology  3 – 15 years Customer relationships  3 – 12 years Other intangibles (incl. order backlog)  < 1 – 15 years Expected useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and if  they differ significantly from previous estimates, the remaining amorti- zation periods are adjusted accordingly. The carrying value of intangible assets subject to amortization is re- viewed for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  A previously recognized impairment loss may be reversed if there is a  significant improvement to the circumstances having initially caused  the impairment, however not to a higher value than the carrying  amount, which would have been recorded had there been no impair- ment in prior years. Impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives The carrying  value of goodwill for each segment and of other intangible assets with  indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually or more frequently for im- pairment, if the facts and circumstances, such as declines in sales, op- erating profit or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business  environment, suggest that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  The testing of goodwill is performed at the cash generating unit level,  whereas the testing of other intangible assets with an indefinite useful  life is either performed as part of a cash generating unit or separately  if the asset generates independent cash flows. The annual testing may  be performed using previous years recoverable amounts of the cash  generating units if there has not been any significant changes to the  assets and liabilities of the cash generating unit, if in the previous test- ing the recoverable value clearly exceeded the carrying values tested,  or if the likelihood that the current recoverable value would be less  than the current carrying value of the cash generating unit is remote.  Metso uses a discounted cash flow analysis to assess the fair value of  goodwill or of another intangible asset subject to testing. A previously  recognized impairment loss on goodwill is not reversed even if there is  a significant improvement in circumstances having initially caused the  impairment. Research and development Research and development costs are  mainly expensed as incurred. Research and development costs com- prise salaries, administration costs, depreciation and amortization of  tangible and intangible fixed assets. Development costs meeting cer- tain capitalization criteria under IAS 38 are capitalized and amortized  during the expected economic life of the underlying technology. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accu- mulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Land and water areas  are not depreciated. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected  useful lives of the assets as follows: Buildings and structures  15 – 40 years Machinery and equipment  3 – 20 years Expected useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and if  they differ significantly from previous estimates, the remaining depre- ciation periods are adjusted accordingly. Subsequent improvement costs related to an asset are included in  the carrying value of such asset or recognized as a separate asset, as   92   Metso Financial Statements 2010  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com appropriate, only when the future economic benefits associated with  the costs are probable and the related costs can be separated from  normal maintenance costs. Metso reviews property, plant and equipment to be held and used  by the company for impairment whenever events and changes in  circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not  be recoverable. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and  capital gains and losses on their disposal are included in other operat- ing income and expenses, net. Previously recognized impairment on  property, plant and equipment is reversed only if there has been a  significant change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable  amount, however not to exceed the carrying value, which would have  been recorded had there been no impairment in prior years. Capitalization of interest expenses The interest expenses of self- constructed investments are capitalized in Metsos financial statements.  The capitalized interest expense is amortized over the estimated useful  life of the underlying asset. Leases Leases for property, plant and equipment, where Metso has  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as  finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the  lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present  value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated  between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental  obligations, net of finance charges, are included in long-term debt,  and the interest element is charged to profit and loss over the lease  period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases  are depreciated over the useful life of the asset or over the lease period,  if shorter. Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the lessor retains a  significant portion of the risks and rewards, are classified as operating  leases. Payments under operating leases are expensed as incurred. Financial assets and liabilities Metso classifies its financial investments into the following categories:  assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, loans and  receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification is  determined at the time of the acquisition depending on the intended  purpose. Assets at fair value through profit and loss comprise deriva- tives and financial instruments designated as at fair value through  profit and loss upon initial recognition. Available-for-sale financial assets are further classified into available- for-sale equity investments and available-for-sale financial investments.  Loans and receivables include loans and other interest bearing receiv- ables and other receivables, which are not interest bearing. Purchases and sales of assets and liabilities at fair value through  profit and loss, and loans and receivables are recognized or derecog- nized on the trade date, i.e. the date Metso commits to purchase or sell  the asset. Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are  recognized on the transaction date at fair value including transaction  costs.  Financial assets are presented as non-current when their maturity  exceeds one year. At each balance sheet date, Metso assesses whether there is objec- tive evidence of an available-for-sale financial asset or of a group  of assets under this category being impaired. In case of prolonged  significant decline in the fair value of such an asset compared to its  acquisition value, the accumulated net loss is reversed from equity and  recognized in the income statement. Assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss Financial instruments held for trading, which are fair valued through  profit and loss, comprise investments in financial instruments, e.g.  bonds, commercial papers and time deposits with various maturities  exceeding three months. The instruments are fair valued quarterly and  the change in fair value is recognized through profit and loss. Gains and  losses at disposal and impairment, if any are recorded in profit and loss.  Derivatives that are not designated as hedges do not meet the hedge  accounting criteria, and are fair valued quarterly through profit and loss.  Gains and losses at disposal are recorded in profit and loss. Available-for-sale equity investments Available-for-sale equity investments include mainly shares in publicly  listed companies. Available-for-sale equity investments are carried at fair  value, based on quoted closing prices as of the respective balance sheet  date. Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are  recognized through OCI in the fair value reserve of equity. Gains and  losses at disposal and impairment, if any, are recorded in the profit and  loss and the accumulated change in fair value previously recorded in the  fair value reserve of equity is reversed through OCI. Unlisted shares, for  which fair values cannot be measured reliably, are recognized at cost less  impairment, if any. Available-for-sale financial investments Non-current available-for-sale financial investments Available-for-sale  financial investments, which are reported under non-current assets and  which have been contracted as part of the cash management of Metso,  comprise investments in financial instruments, e.g. bonds, commercial  papers and time deposits with maturities exceeding one year or with an  undefined maturity and which Metso plans to hold for more than one  year. The instruments are fair valued quarterly and the change in fair  value is recognized through OCI in the fair value reserve of equity. Gains  and losses at disposal and impairment, if any, are recorded in profit and  loss and the accumulated change in fair value previously recorded in the  fair value reserve of equity is reversed through OCI. Current available-for-sale financial investments Available-for-sale  financial investments, which are reported under current assets, comprise  highly liquid investments, which have been contracted as part of the  cash management of Metso and which do not qualify as cash and cash  equivalents. They are fair valued quarterly and the change in fair value  is recognized through OCI in the fair value reserve of equity. Gains and  losses at disposal and impairment, if any, are recorded in profit and loss  and the accumulated change in fair value previously recorded in the fair  value reserve of equity is reversed through OCI. Loans and receivables  Loan and other interest bearing receivables comprise interest bearing  trade and loan receivables. Loans and receivables are initially recognized at fair value including  transaction costs. Subsequently they are recognized at amortized cost  using the effective interest method. They are subject to regular and  systematic review as to collectability. If a loan receivable is estimated to  be partly or totally unrecoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for  the shortfall between the carrying value and the present value of the  expected cash flows. Interest income on loan and other interest bearing  receivables is included in financial income and expenses, net. inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of historical cost calculated on average  cost basis or net realizable value. Costs include purchase costs as well as  transportation and processing costs. The costs of finished goods include  direct materials, wages and salaries plus social costs, subcontracting  and other direct costs. In addition, production costs include an allocable  portion of production and project administration overheads. Net realiz- able value is the estimated amount that can be realized from the sale of  the asset in the normal course of business after allowing for the costs of  realization. Inventories are shown net of a reserve for obsolete and slow-moving  inventories. A reserve is established and a corresponding charge is taken  to profit and loss in the period in which the loss occurs based upon an       Metso Financial Statements 2010  93  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com assessment of technological obsolescence and related factors. Trade-in equipment received is recorded as inventory at the lower of  cost or net realizable value. trade receivables Trade receivables are recognized at original invoice amount to custom- ers and reported in the balance sheet, net of provision for doubtful re- ceivables. The provision, which is expensed under selling, general and  administrative expenses, is recorded on the basis of periodic reviews  of potential non-recovery of receivables by taking into consideration  individual customer credit risk, economic trends in customer industries  and changes in payment terms. Bad debts are written off when official  announcement of receivership, liquidation or bankruptcy is received  confirming that the receivable will not be honored. If extended payment terms, exceeding one year, are offered to  customers, the invoiced amount is discounted to its present value and  interest income is recognized over the credit term. cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and other liquid  investments with initial maturity of three months or less. assets classified as held-for-sale Non-current assets and discontinued operations are classified as held- for-sale and stated at the lower of carrying value and the fair value less  cost to sell, if their carrying value is recovered principally through a sale  transaction rather than through a continuing use. A discontinued operation results from the managements decision  and commitment to dispose of a separate business for which the relat- ed assets, liabilities and operating results can be distinguished both op- erationally and for financial reporting purposes. When specific criteria  for the held-for-sale classification has been met, the non-current assets  are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell,  and non-current assets subject to depreciation or amortization are no  longer amortized. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classi- fied as held-for-sale are presented in the balance sheet separate from  assets and liabilities related to continuing operations as of the date the  operation qualified as discontinued. The results of discontinued opera- tions, net of taxes and the gain or loss on their disposal are presented  for all periods separate from continuing operations in the consolidated  statements of income. Balance sheet data from periods preceding the  qualifying disposal decision is not reclassified. issue of new shares and own shares Transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or  options are shown net of their tax effect in equity as a deduction from  the proceeds. Own shares valued at historical acquisition price are deducted from  equity. Should such shares be subsequently sold or reissued, the con- sideration received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs  and related income tax, is recorded in the equity. Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors are not recognized in the  financial statements until they have been approved by the sharehold- ers in the Annual General Meeting. long-term debt Long-term debt is initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction  costs incurred. Debt is classified as current liability unless the Group  has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at  least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Capitalization of transaction costs   related to issuance of debt instruments Transaction costs arising from issuance of debt instruments are includ- ed in the carrying value of the debt and amortized using the effective  interest method over the period of the respective liability. Capitalization of transaction costs   related to modification of debt instruments Transaction costs arising from modification of debt instruments are in- cluded in the carrying value of the debt and amortized using the effec- tive interest method over the remaining period of the modified liability  provided that the new conditions obtained through the modification  do not substantially differ from those of the original debt. The assess- ment of whether the conditions are substantially different is based on  a comparison of the discounted present value of the cash flows under  the new terms and the present value of the remaining cash flows of  the original financial liability. Provisions Provisions, for which settlement is expected to occur more than one  year after the initial recognition, are discounted to their present value  and adjusted in subsequent closings for the time effect. Restructuring and capacity adjustment costs A provision for restructuring and capacity adjustment costs is recog- nized only after management has developed and approved a formal  plan to which it is committed. Employee termination benefits are rec- ognized after the representatives of employees or individual employees  have been informed of the intended measures in detail and the related  compensation packages can be reliably measured. The costs included  in a provision for capacity adjustment are those costs that are either in- cremental or incurred as a direct result of the plan or are the result of a  continuing contractual obligation with no continuing economic benefit  to Metso or a penalty incurred to cancel the contractual obligation. Re- structuring and capacity adjustment expenses are recognized in either  cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses de- pending on the nature of the restructuring expenses. Should there be  a Metso or segment wide restructuring program, the related costs are  recognized in other operating income and expenses, net. Restructuring  costs can also include other costs incurred as a result of the plan, which  are recorded under other operating income and expenses, net, such as  asset write-downs.  Environmental remediation costs Metso accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation  obligations when such losses are probable and can be estimated reli- ably. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation  obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the  remedial feasibility study. Such accruals are adjusted as further infor- mation develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmen- tal remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when  their receipt is deemed virtually certain. Warranty costs An accrual is made for expected warranty costs. The adequacy of this  accrual is reviewed periodically based on an analysis of historical expe- rience and anticipated probable warranty liabilities.  94   Metso Financial Statements 2010  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com As a global company, Metso is exposed to a variety of business and  financial risks. Financial risks are managed centrally by the Group  Treasury under annually reviewed written policies approved by the  Board of Directors. Treasury operations are monitored by the Treasury  Management Team chaired by the CFO. Group Treasury functions as  counterparty to the operating units, manages centrally external fund- ing and is responsible for the management of financial assets and ap- propriate hedging measures. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and  hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the operating units.  The objective of financial risk management is to minimize potential  adverse effects on Metsos financial performance. sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis figures presented in connection with different finan- cial risks are based on the risk exposures at the balance sheet date. The  sensitivity is calculated by assuming a change in one of the risk factors  of a financial instrument, such as interest or currency. It is not likely  that the future volatility of a risk factor will develop in accordance with  the test assumptions and that only one factor would be impacted.  When calculating the sensitivity, Metso has chosen to use market  conventions in assuming a 100 basis point variation in interest rates,  10 percent change in foreign exchange rates and in commodity prices  because this provides better comparability from one period to another  and information on the volatility to users of financial statements. Metso  is aware that such assumptions may not be realistic when compared  to past volatility and they are not intended to reflect the future. Metso  has chosen not to use past volatility as this could mislead the users of  financial statements to assume the analysis reflect managements view  on the future volatility of the financial instruments.  liquidity and refinancing risk   and capital structure management Liquidity or refinancing risk arises when a company is not able to  arrange funding at terms and conditions corresponding to its credit- worthiness. Sufficient cash, short-term investments and committed  and uncommitted credit facilities are maintained to protect short- term liquidity. Diversification of funding among different markets  and adequate number of financial institutions is used to safeguard  the availability of liquidity at all times. Group Treasury monitors bank  account structures, cash balances and forecasts of the operating units  and manages the utilization of the consolidated cash resources.  At the end of 2010 (end of 2009 respectively) cash and cash equiva- lents amounted to EUR 645 million (EUR 727 million), available-for-sale  financial investments to EUR 347 million (EUR 209 million), financial  2 FInAnCIAl RISk MAnAgeMenT instruments held for trading EUR 59 million (EUR 40 million) and com- mitted undrawn credit facilities to EUR 500 million (EUR 500million).  The five year revolving credit facility was renewed in 2010. Liquidity risk management as described here excludes trade receiv- ables (both interest and non-interest bearing) and similar financial  instruments, as they are not considered active risk management tools  within the responsibility of Group Treasury. Similarly, non-interest  bearing liabilities such as trade and other payables are not included in  liquidity management.  Metsos refinancing risk is managed by balancing the proportion  of short-term and long-term debt as well as the average remaining  maturity of long-term debt. The tables below analyze the repayments  and interests on Metsos liabilities by the remaining maturities from the  balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. Detailed information of balance sheet items is presented in other  notes to consolidated financial statements. Capital structure management in Metso comprises both equity and  interest bearing debt. As of December 31, 2010 the equity attribut- able to shareholders was EUR 2,049 million (EUR 1,783 million) and the  amount of interest bearing debt was EUR 1,373 million (EUR 1,576 mil- lion). The objectives are to safeguard the ongoing business operations  and to optimize the cost of capital. Metso has a target to maintain a  solid investment grade credit rating. The credit ratings as at December 31, 2010: Moodys  Baa2 Standard & Poors   BBB / A–2 There are no prepayment covenants in Metsos financial contracts  which would be triggered by changes in credit rating. Financial  covenants included in some loan agreements refer to Metsos capital  structure. Metso is in compliance with all covenants and other terms of  its debt instruments.  Capital structure is assessed regularly by the Board of Directors and  managed operationally by the Group Treasury.  Capital structure ratios are included in financial indicators for years  2006–2010 on page 137 in these financial statements. The formulas for  calculating the financial indicators are presented on page 138.  interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises when changes in market interest rates and inter- est margins influence finance costs, returns on financial investments  and valuation of interest bearing balance sheet items. Interest rate risks  are managed through balancing the ratio between fixed and floating  Maturities as of December 31, 2009  EUR million <1 year 1 – 5 years >5 years Long-term debt Repayments 173 1,103 231 Interests 65 158 27 Short-term debt Repayments 69 - - Interests 1 - - Trade payables 605 - - Other liabilities 460 - - Interest rate derivatives 4 5 2 Total 1,377 1,266 260 Financial guarantee contracts 3 Maturities as of December 31, 2010 EUR million <1 year 1 – 5 years >5 years Long-term debt Repayments 388 761 195 Interests 66 116 9 Short-term debt Repayments 29 - - Interests 1 - - Trade payables 815 - - Other liabilities 568 - - Interest rate derivatives 2 5 2 Total 1,869 881 205 Financial guarantee contracts 1      Metso Financial Statements 2010  95  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com interest rates and duration of debt and investment portfolios. Ad- ditionally, Metso may use derivative instruments such as forward rate  agreements, swaps, options and futures contracts to mitigate the risks  arising from interest bearing assets and liabilities. The interest rate risk  is managed and controlled by the Group Treasury and measured using  sensitivity analysis and duration of long term debt. The Macaulay Dura- tion of long term debt was 1.6 years on December 31, 2010 (2.0 years). At the end of 2010 the balance sheet items exposed to interest rate  risk were interest bearing assets of EUR 1,063 million (EUR 993 million)  and interest bearing debt of EUR 1,373 million (EUR 1,576 million). Of the  total of the interest bearing debt 74 percent (77%) was denominated in  EUR. The basis for the interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is an aggregate  group level interest rate exposure, composed of interest bearing assets,  interest bearing debt and financial derivatives, such as interest rate  swaps and options, which are used to hedge the underlying expo- sures. For all interest bearing debt and assets to be fixed during next  12 months a one percentage point (100 basis points) move upwards  or downwards in interest rates with all other variables held constant  would have an effect on Metsos net interest expenses, net of taxes, of  EUR /+ 3.0 million (EUR /+ 2.9 million). A one percentage point (100 basis points) move upwards or down- wards in all interest rates with all other variables held constant would  have following effects, net of taxes, in income statement and equity: EUR million 2009 2010 Effects in  income statement +/ 0.9 +/ 0.7  equity /+ 0.1 /+ 1.7 The effect in the income statement comprises the changes in the fair  value of financial instruments which are directly recognized through  profit and loss. The effect in the equity is comprised of the changes  in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets and derivatives  qualifying as effective cash flow hedge instruments for long-term float- ing rate debt. Foreign exchange risk Metso operates globally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in  several currencies, although the geographical diversity of operations  decreases the significance of any individual currency. About 60 percent  of Metsos net sales originate from outside euro zone; the main curren- cies being EUR, USD, SEK, BRL, AUD and CNY.  Transaction exposure Foreign exchange transaction exposure arises when an operating unit  has commercial or financial transactions and payments in other than  its own functional currency, and when related cash inflow and outflow  amounts are not equal or concurrent.  In accordance with the Treasury Policy, operating units are required  to hedge in full the foreign currency exposures on balance sheet and  other firm commitments. Future cash flows denominated in a currency  other than the functional currency of the unit are hedged with internal  foreign exchange contracts with the Group Treasury for periods, which  do not usually exceed two years. The majority of the hedged future  currency cash flows relate to foreign currency denominated order  backlog. In addition, units can hedge anticipated foreign currency  denominated cash flows. Group Treasury monitors the net position of each currency and de- cides to what extent a currency position is to be closed. Group Treasury  is however responsible for entering into external forward transaction  whenever an operating unit applies hedge accounting. Upper limits  have been set on the open currency exposures managed by the Group  Treasury; limits have been calculated on the basis of their potential  profit impact. To manage the foreign currency exposure Group Treasury  may use forward exchange contracts and foreign exchange options. Total foreign exchange transaction exposure on December 31 was as  follows: EUR million 2009 2010 Operational items 418 627 Financial items 172 136 Hedges 243 447 Total exposure 3 45 This aggregate group level currency exposure is the basis for the sensi- tivity analysis of foreign exchange risk. This exposure, net of respective  hedges, is composed of all assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies, projected cash flows for unrecognized firm commitments,  both short- and long-term sales and purchase contracts and antici- pated operational cash flows to the extent their realization has been  deemed highly probable and therefore hedged. This analysis excludes  net foreign currency investments in subsidiaries together with instru- ments hedging these investments. Assuming euro to appreciate or  depreciate ten percent against all other currencies, the impact on cash  flows, net of taxes, derived from the year-end net exposure as defined  above, would be EUR /+ 1.2 million (EUR /+ 0.3 million).  Transaction exposure is spread in about 30 currencies and as of De- cember 31, 2010 the biggest open exposures were in USD (45%) and SEK  (15%). A 10 percent appreciation of USD would have an effect, net of  taxes, of EUR +5.9 million. A corresponding effect on SEK would be EUR  2,0 million and on any other currency would be less than EUR 1 million. A sensitivity analysis of financial instruments as required by IFRS 7,  excludes following items: projected cash flows for unrecognized firm  commitments, advance payments, both short- and long-term purchase  contracts and anticipated operational cash flows. The table below  presents the effects, net of taxes, of a +/ 10 percent change in EUR  foreign exchange rates: 2009 2010 EUR million total USD SEK others total Effects in  income statement  +/ 4.3 +/ 9.2  +/ 1.0 +/ 0.9 +/ 11.1  equity +/ 24.8 +/ 18.6 +/ 6.8 +/ 5.6  +/ 31.0 Effect in equity is the fair value change in derivatives contracts qualify- ing as cash flow hedges for unrecognized firm commitments. Effect  in income statement is the fair value change for all other financial  instruments exposed to foreign exchange risk including derivatives,  which qualify as cash flow hedges, to the extent the underlying sales  transaction, recognized under the percentage of completion method,  has been recognized as revenue. Translation or equity exposure Foreign exchange translation exposure arises when the equity of  a subsidiary is denominated in currency other than the functional  currency of the parent company. The major translation exposures are  in CNY, USD and BRL, which altogether comprise around 60 percent  of the total equity exposure. Metso is not extensively hedging equity  exposure except USD. As of December 31, 2010 Metso had hedged  97percent (82%) of USD denominated net investments to reduce the  effect of exchange rate fluctuations. Currently hedging instruments are  foreign currency loans. A sensitivity analysis of financial instruments includes foreign cur- rency loans qualified as net investment hedges. A 10 percent change in  EUR/USD foreign exchange rate would have an effect of EUR 17.6mil- lion (EUR 17.2 million), net of taxes, in equity. commodity risk Metso is exposed to variations in prices of raw materials and of sup- plies including energy. Metso units identify their commodity price  hedging needs and hedges are executed through the Group Treasury   96   Metso Financial Statements 2010  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com using approved counterparties and instruments. For commodity risks  separate overall hedging limits are defined and approved. Hedging is  done on a rolling basis with a declining hedging level over time.  Electricity exposure in the Scandinavian units has been hedged  with electricity forwards and fixed price physical contracts, which are  designated as hedges of highly probable future electricity purchases.  Hedging is focused on the estimated energy consumption for the next  twelve-month period with some contracts extended to approximately  three years. Execution of electricity hedging has been outsourced to  an external broker. As of December 31, 2010 Metso had outstanding  electricity forwards amounting to 755 GWh (640 GWh).  To reduce its exposure to the volatility caused by the surcharge for  certain metal alloys (Alloy Adjustment Factor) comprised in the price of  stainless steel charged by its suppliers, Metso has entered into average- price swap agreements for nickel. The Alloy Adjustment Factor is based  on monthly average prices of its components of which nickel is the  most significant. As of December 31, 2010 Metso had outstanding nickel  swaps amounting to 486 tons (252 tons). The following table on the sensitivity analysis of the commodity  prices based on financial instruments under IFRS 7 comprises the net  aggregate amount of commodities bought through forward contracts  and swaps but excludes the anticipated future consumption of raw  materials and electricity. A 10 percent change upwards or downwards  in commodity prices would have following effects, net of taxes: EUR million 2009 2010 Electricity – effect in equity +/ 1.7 +/ 2.5 Electricity – effect in income statement +/ 0.2 +/ 0.2 Nickel – effect in income statement  +/ 0.2 +/ 0.6 As cash flow hedge accounting is applied, the effective portion of  electricity forwards is recognized in equity. The ineffective portion is  recognized through profit and loss. Hedge accounting is not applied  to nickel agreements, and the change in the fair value is recorded  through profit and loss. Other commodity risks are not managed using financial derivative  instruments. credit and counterparty risk Credit or counterparty risk is defined as the possibility of a customer  or a financial counterparty not fulfilling its commitments towards  Metso. Metsos operating units are primarily responsible for credit risks  pertaining to sales and procurement activities. The units assess the  credit quality of their customers, by taking into account their financial  position, past experience and other relevant factors. When appropriate,  advance payments, letters of credit and third party guarantees are used  to mitigate credit risks. Group Treasury provides centralized services  related to customer financing and seeks to ensure that the principles  of the Treasury Policy are adhered to with respect to terms of payment  and required collateral. Metso has no significant concentrations of  credit risks. The maximum credit risk equals the carrying value of trade and loan  receivables. The credit quality is evaluated both on the basis of aging of  the trade receivables and also on the basis of customer specific analysis.  The aging structure of trade receivables is presented in note 19.  Counterparty risk arises also from financial transactions agreed upon  with banks, financial institutions and corporates. The risk is managed  by careful selection of banks and other counterparties, by counterparty  specific limits and netting agreements such as ISDA (Master agreement  of International Swaps and Derivatives Association). The compliance  with counterparty limits is regularly monitored.  The maximum amount of financial counterparty risk is calculated as  the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets, derivatives and cash  and cash equivalents on the balance sheet date. Fair value estimation For those financial assets and liabilities which have been recognized at  fair value in the balance sheet, the following measurement hierarchy  and valuation methods have been applied: Level 1 Quoted unadjusted prices at the balance sheet date in active  markets. The market prices are readily and regularly available  from an exchange, dealer, broker, market information service  system, pricing service or regulatory agency. The quoted mar- ket price used for financial assets is the current bid price. Level  1 financial instruments include debt and equity investments  classified as financial instruments available-for-sale or at fair  value through profit and loss.  Level 2 The fair value of financial instruments in Level 2 is determined  using valuation techniques. These techniques utilize observ- able market data readily and regularly available from an  exchange, dealer, broker, market information service system,  pricing service or regulatory agency. Level 2 financial instru- ments include: 	 Over-the-counter derivatives classified as financial assets/ liabilities at fair value through profit and loss or qualified for  hedge accounting.  	 Debt securities classified as financial instruments available- for-sale or at fair value through profit and loss. Level 3 A financial instrument is categorized into Level 3 if the calcula- tion of the fair value cannot be based on observable market  data. Metso had no such instruments in 2009 or in 2010.

These estimates and judgments, based on historical evidence  and plausible future scenarios, are continually evaluated. Following  assets and liabilities include a high degree of management estimate  and assumptions and their carrying value can therefore materially differ  from current value in the next financial year. trade receivables Metsos policy is to maintain a provision for bad debt based on the  best estimate of the amounts that are potentially uncollectable at the  balance sheet date. The estimates are based on a systematic, on-going  review and evaluation performed as part of the credit-risk evalua- tion process. As part of this evaluation, Metso takes into account the  history of collections, the size and compositions of the receivable  balances, current economic events and conditions and other pertinent  information. inventory Metsos policy is to maintain a provision for slow-moving and obsolete  inventory based on the best estimate of such amounts at the balance  sheet date. The estimates are based on a systematic, on-going review  and evaluation of inventory balances. As part of this evaluation, Metso  also considers the composition and age of the inventory as compared  to anticipated future needs. Revenue recognition Metso delivers complete installations to its customers, where the  moment of signing a sales contract (firm commitment) and the final  acceptance of a delivery by the customer may take place in different  financial periods. In accordance with its accounting principles, Metso  applies the percentage of completion method (POC method) for rec- ognizing such long-term delivery contracts. In year 2010, approximately  37 percent of the net sales were recognized under the POC method,  which is based on predetermined milestones and where the revenue  is recognized based on the estimated realized value added or on the  cost-to-cost method. A projected loss on a firm commitment is recog- nized through profit and loss, when it becomes known. The estimated  revenue, the costs and profit, together with the planned delivery  schedule of the projects are subject to regular revisions as the contract  progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates are charged  through profit and loss in the period in which the facts that give rise to  the revision become known. Although Metso has significant experi- ence using the POC method, the total costs estimated to be incurred  on projects may change over time due to changes in the underlying  project cost structures, which may ultimately affect the revenue recog- nized. Therefore, the POC method is not applied for recognizing sales  commitments where the final outcome of the project and related cost  structure cannot be pre-established reliably.  hedging of foreign currency denominated   firm commitments Under Metso hedging policy units have to hedge their foreign currency  risk when they become engaged in a firm commitment denominated  in a currency different of their functional currency, the commitment  can be either internal to Metso or external. When a firm commitment  qualifies for recognition under the percentage of completion method,  the unit applies cash flow hedge accounting and recognizes the ef- fect of the hedging instruments in the OCI until the commitment is  recognized. Though Metso has defined the characteristics triggering  a firm commitment, the final realization of the unrecognized commit- ment depends also on factors beyond management control, which  cannot be foreseen when initiating the hedge relationship. Such factors  can be a change in the market environment causing the other party to  postpone or cancel the commitment. To the extent possible manage- ment tries to include in the contracts clauses reducing the impact of  such adverse events to its results.  accounting for income taxes As part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial state- ments, Metso is required to estimate the income taxes in each of the  jurisdictions and countries in which it operates. This process involves  estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing  temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items,  such as deferred revenue and cost reserves, for tax and accounting  purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities,  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet. The likelihood  for the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income is  assessed, and to the extent the recovery is not considered likely the  deferred asset is adjusted in accordance. Significant management judgment is required in determining the  provision for income taxes and the deferred tax assets. Metso has  recorded net deferred tax assets of EUR 118 million as of December 31,  2010, adjusted by EUR 10 million for uncertainties related to its ability to  utilize some of the deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of operat- ing losses carried forward and deductible temporary differences for  certain foreign subsidiaries and the final outcome of tax audits in some  subsidiaries. The adjustment is based on Metsos estimates of taxable  income by country in which it operates, and the period over which  the deferred tax assets will be recoverable based on estimated future  taxable income and planned tax strategies to utilize these assets. In the  event that actual results differ from these estimates, the deferred tax  asset needs to be adjusted in coming financial years. The final outcome  may also be affected by future changes in tax laws applicable in the  jurisdictions where Metso operates. allocation of purchase price to acquired assets  In accordance with the accounting principles, the purchase price is al- located to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities the excess being  recognized as goodwill in the balance sheet. Whenever feasible, Metso  has used as a basis for such allocations readily available market values  to determine the fair value to be recognized. However, when this has  not been possible, as often is the case with non-current intangible  assets and certain assets with no active markets or available price  quotations, the valuation has been based on past performance of such  asset and expected future cash generating capacity. The appraisals,  which have been based on current replacement costs, discounted cash  flows and estimated selling prices depending on the underlying asset,  require management to make estimates and assumptions of the future  performance and use of these assets and their impact on the financial  position. Any change in Metsos future business priorities and orienta- tions may affect the planned outcome of initial appraisals. impairment testing The carrying value of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite  economic life such as goodwill is tested annually or more frequently if  events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value  may not be recoverable. The carrying values of property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets, subject to depreciation and amortiza- tion are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indications that  their carrying values could exceed their value in use or disposal value if  disposal is considered as a possible option.   98   Metso Financial Statements 2010  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com Triggering events for impairment reviews include the following: 	 Material permanent deterioration in the economic or political envi- ronment of the customers or of own activity 	 Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected  future performance 	 Significant changes in Metsos strategic orientations affecting the  business plans and previous investment policies The policy related to the impairment tests is based on numerous  estimates. The valuation is inherently judgmental and highly suscep- tible to change from period to period because it requires Metso to  make assumptions about future supply and demand related to its  individual business units, future sales prices and achievable cost sav- ings. The value of the benefits and savings expected from the efficiency  improvement programs are inherently subjective. The fair value of the  cash generating units is determined using a derived weighted average  cost of capital as the rate to discount estimated future cash flows. This  rate may not be indicative of actual rates obtained in the market. In  the annual goodwill impairment test, a 0.5 percentage point reduction  in the terminal growth rate applied for determining the fair values of  the cash generating units would have reduced the total value of units  tested by 4 percent and would not have caused impairment. A second  sensitivity test with a two percentage point increase in the discount  rates combined with the lower terminal growth rate would have  reduced the fair values by 21 percent causing the carrying value of the  Fabrics business line to exceed the net present value of cash flows by  EUR 34 million. Reserve for warranty and guarantee costs The warranty and guarantee reserve is based on the history of past  warranty costs and claims on machines and equipment under warranty.  The typical warranty period is 12 months from the date of customer  acceptance of the delivered equipment. For larger projects, the aver- age warranty period is two years. For sales involving new technology  and long-term delivery contracts, additional warranty reserves can be  established on a case by case basis to take into account the potentially  increased risk.  Pensions  In accordance with IAS 19, the pension benefit expense is based on as- sumptions that include the following: 	 A weighted average expected return assessed in the beginning of the  financial year on plan assets. Actual return on plan assets may differ  significantly based on market activity. 	 An assumed discount rate based on rates observed in the beginning  of the financial year to be used in the calculation of the current year  pension expense and pension liability balance. This rate may not be  indicative of actual rates realized in the market. 	 Estimated rates of future pay increases. Actual increases may not  reflect estimated future increases. Due to the significant change in  the Groups structure and the uncertainty of the global market place,  these estimates are difficult to project. The actuarial experience that differs from the assumptions and changes  in the assumptions results in gains and losses, which are recognized in  the OCI. A one percentage point increase in the expected return on plan  assets would have reduced pension benefit expense by approximately  EUR 3 million, and a one percentage point decrease in the expected  return on plan assets would have increased pension benefit expense by  approximately EUR 3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. share-based payments Share-based payment plans and related incentive programs include  vesting conditions such as targets for operating profit, earnings per  share and total shareholder return, and service year requirements  subsequent to the grant date. The maximum share reward is in relation  to each participants annual salary. At each balance sheet date, the  management revises its estimates for the number of shares that are ex- pected to vest. As part of this evaluation, Metso takes into account the  changes in the forecasted performance of the Group and its reporting  segments, the expected turnover of the personnel benefiting from the  incentive plan and other pertinent information impacting the number of  shares to be vested. Financial instruments  In accordance with the disclosure requirements on financial instruments,  the management is obliged to make certain assumptions of the future  cash in- and outflows arising from such instruments. The management  has also had to assume that the fair values of derivatives, especially for- eign currency denominated derivatives at balance sheet date materially  reflect the future realized cash in- or outflow of such instruments.

The acquisition complements Valmet  Automotives service offering in line with its strategy in convertible  engineering and manufacturing services and particularly in compo- nent manufacturing. The purchase consideration for the transaction  amounted to EUR 33 million (EUR 24 million net of cash), the direct  acquisition costs, which were expensed and reported under other oper- ating expenses, being less than EUR 2 million. Metso did not recognize  any goodwill on the transaction. The fair values presented in below  table are preliminary. The consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31,  2010 includes the impact of the acquired business with net sales of EUR  12 million and a net loss of close to EUR 1 million. The currency transla- tion impact relating to the acquired net investment reported under  other comprehensive income/expense was immaterial. The Karmann  business was consolidated to Metso from November 21, 2010 onwards  and is reported under Valmet Automotive in the segment note. Had the  business been acquired on January 1, 2010 the increase to Metsos net  sales, including the holding period, would have been roughly EUR 170  million. An estimate of whole year net income impact to Metso is not  possible as the business was managed by administrative receivers and  certain parts of the business were acquired as separate assets. In July Metso acquired the service business of Wyesco of Louisiana  L.L.C., in Louisiana, USA for a purchase price of EUR 3 million. This busi- ness, which was consolidated from July 19, 2010 onwards into the Paper  and Fiber Technology segment, is a diverse repair service provider  for pulp mills and related industry. The net sales and the net income  impact to Metso are immaterial.

The total transac- tion value was EUR 215 million whereof EUR 206 million was compen- sated by offering 8,593,642 new Metso shares representing 95.2% of  Tamfelts shares and votes. Prior to the transaction, Metso held Tamfelt  shares worth EUR 4 million i.e. 2.8% of Tamfelts shares and votes. The  remaining 2.0% of Tamfelts shares, amounting to EUR 4million, were  redeemed in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act and Metso  paid the redemption price with the interest accrued thereon in Sep- tember 2010. The transaction value included EUR 5 million in expenses  and transfer taxes related to the acquisition. The transaction value, together with the shares already held,  exceeded the net assets of Tamfelt by EUR 117 million. The fair value  allocations are presented in the table hereafter. The goodwill of EUR  73million from the transaction was split in 2010 between the new  Fabrics business line for EUR 33 million and Paper business line for EUR  40million, reflecting the value of assembled workforce, significant syn- ergy benefits and widened business portfolio offering Metso potential  to expand its operations into new markets and customer segments. Had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2009, Metsos net sales  would have increased by EUR 130 million. The calculation of pro forma  net income of the acquired business would be impractical considering  the effects of the acquisition cost.

The company is fully  consolidated into the Energy and Environmental Technology segments  Power business line. In October Metso acquired M&J Industries A/S, a Danish manufac- turer of mobile and stationary products for solid-waste crushing. The  company was integrated into the Recycling business line of Metsos  Energy and Environmental Technology segment.  During 2009 Metso acquired in China Kromatek (Shanghai) Co. Ltd.,  with a chromium plating business and in Oregon, USA a division of Pa- cific/Hoe Saw&Knife Company with a coater, creping and doctor blade  business. Both businesses were combined into Metsos Paper and Fiber  Technology segment.

Year ended December 31, 11 DISPoSAlS oF BuSIneSSeS In November 2010 Metso sold its 60 percent holding in Valmet Dura Oy,  Finland, from its Paper and Fiber Technology segment. This transaction  had no material impact on Metso.  In April, 2010 Metso divested the Flexowell conveyor belt operations  in Germany to ContiTech Transportbandsysteme GmbH. Flexowell was  part of Metsos Mining and Construction Technology segment. Metso  recognized a small gain on this divestment. In May 2009, Metso sold Metso Paper Turku Works Oy in Finland to  Stairon Oy. The company manufactures air systems for the pulp and  paper industry and it was part of Metsos Paper business line. The sale  had no significant impact on Metso. In January 2009, Metso sold the composites manufacturing business  and related assets in Oulu, Finland, to xperion Oy for a consideration of  EUR 2 million. The unit was part of Metsos Paper business line.  In September 2008, Metso divested the shares in Sweden-based  Metso Foundries Karlstad AB to a group of financial investors repre- sented by Primaca Group Oy. Metso will continue as a minority owner  with a 16.7 percent holding in Heavycast Oy, a new company to which  the Primaca Group transferred the acquired shares. The value of the  transaction was approximately EUR 15 million, and Metso recognized a  small tax-free capital gain from the sale. The divested business was part  of Paper and Fiber Technology segment. In May 2008, Metso sold its spreader roll manufacturing business and  related assets located in Nokia, Finland to a group of Finnish investors.  They continued the business under the name of Finbow Oy. The divest- ment was not material for Metso. The divested business was part of  Paper and Fiber Technology. In January 2008, Metso concluded the divestment of its Panelboard  business. The panelboard operations in Nastola, Finland and Sundsvall,  Sweden were divested to the German company Dieffenbacher GmbH +  Co. KG. The transaction price was EUR 2 million.  None of these businesses qualified as separate business line within  Metso, hence was not classified as discontinued operations.

The future amortization expense is expected  to amount to EUR 23, EUR 19, EUR 17, EUR 14 and EUR 12 million for the  years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.  110   Metso Financial Statements 2010  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com Goodwill and impairment tests In the year ended December 31, 2010, the total amount of goodwill was  EUR 880 million equal to 42% of the equity. As at December 31, 2009,  the goodwill amounted to EUR 863 million being equal to 48% of the  equity. The goodwill arising from business acquisitions is allocated as of the  acquisition date to cash generating units expected to benefit from the  synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or  liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. The goodwill from  acquisitions done in 2010 was allocated to Paper and Fiber Technology.  The final goodwill of EUR 73 million arising from the Tamfelt acquisi- tion realized in 2009 was allocated in 2010 to the Fabrics business line  (Tamfelt business) for EUR 33 millions and to Paper business line for EUR  40millions to reflect latters expected synergy benefits and improve- ment in profitability gained from the acquisition. Both business lines are  included in the Paper and Fiber Technology. If Metso reorganizes its reporting structure by changing the composi- tion of one or more cash generating units to which goodwill has been  allocated, the goodwill is reallocated to the units affected based on  their relative fair values, which correspond to the present values of the  cash generating units cash flows at the time of the reorganization.  Metso assesses the value of its goodwill for impairment annually or  more frequently, if facts and circumstances indicate a risk of impair- ment. The assessment is done using fair value measurement tech- niques, such as the discounted cash flow methodology. The testing is  performed on the cash generating unit level to which the goodwill has  been allocated. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is  based on value-in-use calculations. In the discounted cash flow method,  Metso discounts forecasted performance plans to their present value. The performance plans, which include four years of projection, are  calculated in the annual strategy process and subsequently approved  Summary of assumptions and impacts of change in assumptions to present values: Sensitivity tests Reduction of present values *) EUR million Derived weighted average  cost of capital applied Terminal growth rate 1.2% Increase of discount rate by 200bp,  terminal growth rate 1.2% 2009 Mining and Construction Technology 12.0% 3% 17% Energy and Environmental Technology 11.4 – 12.6% 3% 17% Paper and Fiber Technology 10.5 – 11.5% 4% 19% Total 10.5 – 12.6% 3% 17% 2010 Mining and Construction Technology 10.7% 4% 21% Energy and Environmental Technology 10.1–10.4% 4% 21% Paper and Fiber Technology 9.7–10.7% 4% 20% Total 10.5–12.6% 4% 21%   *)  Sensitivity numbers represent the weighted average impact to segments and the total represents the impact to the combined carrying  goodwill of all segments. The sensitivity to impairment of each cash generating unit is tested by  applying a change both in the discount and terminal growth rate. The  discount rate is increased by 200 basis points and the terminal growth  rate is dropped from 1.7% to 1.2%.  A reduced terminal growth rate did not indicate any impairment  need whereas the combined effect of the two assumptions indicated  an impairment risk of the goodwill in the Fabrics business line by about  EUR 34 million. For this cash generating unit the break even point  where the discounted present value equaled the carrying value of  the net assets would have been reached with a discount rate of 10.5%  terminal growth rate being 1.7% compared to a discount rate of 9.7%  applied in the annual impairment test. Using this latter discount rate  by Metsos management and the Board of Directors. In addition to the  projection period, the discounted cash flows include an additional year,  which is extrapolated from the performance of the projection period  adjusted for cyclicality of each cash generating unit. The growth rate  reflecting the long-term average growth rate of businesses subject to  testing, was estimated to be 1.7% in 2009 and 2010. The forecasted sales  and production volumes are based on current structure and existing  property, plant and equipment used by each cash generating unit. The  assumptions requiring most management judgment are the market  and product mix. Values assigned to key assumptions reflect past  experience. Data on growth, demand and price development provided  by various research institutions are utilized in establishing the assump- tions for the projection period. The discount rates used in testing are derived from the weighted av- erage cost of capital based on comparable peer industry betas, capital  structure and tax rates. The impact of the tax is eliminated to obtain  pre-tax discount rates.  In the September 2010 annual test, the average EBITDAs (earnings be- fore interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), of the tested units for  the projection period 2010–2014 were following: Mining and Construc- tion Technology 16%, Energy and Environmental Technology 12% and  Paper and Fiber Technology 10% of net sales. As a result of the annual impairment tests, no impairment losses  were recognized in 2009 and 2010. Since the unexpected weakening  of the market prospects in the last quarter of 2008 Metso has been  performing from time to time quarterly tests with updated cash flow  projections to ensure the carrying values of its cash generating units  do not exceed the discounted present values obtained through tests.  The discount rates applied have been updated quarterly when material  changes in rates have been observed. These tests have not indicated  need for impairment loss. the average minimum EBITDA required for break even would have  been 14.7% compared to 15.2% used in the cash flow projections. Despite the results from the sensitivity tests, management believes  that no reasonably possible change of the key assumptions used would  cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its  recoverable amount.  From time to time the sensitivity tests include several cash projec- tions based on reasonable change in the future performance of a unit.  However, the impact to the fair value obtained is limited as long as  there is no permanent weakening expected for the business, which  would affect the terminal value. These projections have not led to  impairment.

The  provision also includes other costs incurred as a result of the plan, such  as environmental liabilities.  environmental and product liabilities Metso accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation  obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably calculable.  The amounts of accruals are adjusted later as further information devel- ops or circumstances change. As at December 31, 2010, environmental  liabilities amounted to EUR 2 million. They included clean-up costs for  soil and water contamination at various sites in the Unites States previ- ously operated by Mining and Construction Technology.  Metso is occasionally involved in product liability claims. As at  December 31, 2010, provisions for product liabilities amounted to EUR  3million.  Warranty and guarantee provisions Metso issues various types of contractual product warranties under  which it generally guarantees the performance levels agreed in the  sales contract, the performance of products delivered during the  agreed warranty period and services rendered for a certain period or  term. The warranty liability is based on historical realized warranty  costs for deliveries of standard products and services. The usual war- ranty period is 12 months from the date of customer acceptance of the  delivered equipment. For larger projects, the average warranty period  is two years. For more complex contracts, including long-term projects,  the warranty reserve is calculated contract by contract and updated  regularly to ensure its sufficiency. The provisions for warranty and guarantee liabilities have changed as  follows: EUR million 2009 2010 Balance at beginning of year 178 179 Impact of exchange rates 6 11 Increase for current year's deliveries 75 82 Increase for previous years' deliveries 23 27 Increase from business acquisitions 2 0 Realized reserve 77 71 Reversal of reserve / other changes 28 28 Balance at end of year 179 200 The provisions, both non-current and current, have   changed as follows during the financial year 2010: EUR million Accrued restructuring expenses Environmental and product liabilities Total Balance at beginning of year 39 12 51 Impact of exchange rates 3 0 3 Addition charged to expense 7 1 8 Realized reserve 20 6 26 Reversal of reserve / other changes 5 2 7 Balance at end of year 24 5 29 Provisions, for which the expected settlement date exceeds one year from  the moment of their recognition, are discounted to their present value  and adjusted in subsequent periods for the time effect.         122   Metso Financial Statements 2010  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com 26 ShoRT-TeRM DeBT As at December 31, EUR million 2009 2010 Loans from financial institutions 52 29 Finnish commercial paper financing 17 - Total 69 29 The weighted average interest rate applicable to short-term borrowing  at December 31, 2009 and 2010 was 5.8% and 6.7%, respectively.

The maturities  of trade payables are largely determined by local trade practices and  individual agreements between Metso and its supplier. Accrued project costs may be settled after six months depending  on the issuance of the supplier invoice when the costs arise from work  performed by third parties.  The accrued personnel costs, which include holiday pay, are settled  in accordance with local laws and stipulations. 28 PoST-eMPloyMenT BeneFIT oBlIgATIonS The companies within Metso have various pension schemes pursuant  to local conditions and practices of the countries in which they operate.  Some of these programs are defined benefit schemes with retirement,  healthcare, death, jubilee and termination income benefits. The ben- efits are generally a function of years of employment and salary with  Metso. The schemes are mostly funded through payments to insurance  companies or to trustee-administered funds as determined by periodic  actuarial calculations. Metso uses December 31 as measurement date  for its defined benefit arrangements. The discount rates applied are  based on yields available on high quality (AA rated) corporate bonds.  If such reference is not available, the rates are based on government  bond yields as of the balance sheet date. The terms of corporate and  government bonds are consistent with the currency and the estimated  term of the pension obligations.  The amounts recognized as of December 31 in the balance sheet were following: Pension benefits,  Finnish Pension benefits,  foreign Other  post-employment  benefits Total Total EUR million 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 Present value of funded obligations 16 21 292 337 - - 308 358 Fair value of plan assets 12 15 248 300 - - 260 315 4 6 44 37 - - 48 43 Present value of unfunded obligations - - 104 102 36 45 140 147 Unrecognized asset - - 1 2 - - 1 2 Unrecognized past service cost 0 1 - - 1 1 1 2 Net liability recognized 4 7 149 141 37 46 190 194 Amounts in the balance sheet: Liabilities 4 7 149 142 37 46 190 195 Assets - - 0 1 - - 0 1 Net liability recognized 4 7 149 141 37 46 190 194      Metso Financial Statements 2010  123  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com Movements in the net liability recognized in the balance sheet were as follows: Pension benefits, Finnish Foreign pension and other  post-employment benefits EUR million 2009 2010 2009 2010 Net liability at beginning of year 4 4 186 186 Acquisitions (+) and disposals () - - 1 0 Net expense recognized in the income statement 1 2 15 13 Employer contributions 1 3 20 38 Gain (+) / loss () recognized through OCI 0 4 0 11 Translation differences - - 4 15 Net liability at end of year 4 7 186 187 The amounts recognized in the income statement were as follows: Year ended December 31, Pension benefits, Finnish Pension benefits, foreign Other  post-employment benefits EUR million 2008 2009 2010 2008 2009 2010 2008 2009 2010 Service cost 1 1 2 5 7 8 1 1 1 Interes cost 0 1 1 19 20 21 2 2 2 Expected return on plan assets 0 1 1 16 15 19 - - - Amortization - Past service cost 2 0 0 - 0 0 - 0 0 Gains () / losses (+) on immediate settlements 1 0 0 0 0 0 - 0 0 Expense (+) / income () recognized in income statement 2 1 2 8 12 10 3 3 3 Actual return (+) / loss () on plan assets 1 3 1 26 32 24 - - - Year ended December 31, Pension benefits,  Finnish Pension benefits,  foreign Other  post-employment  benefits Total Total EUR million 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 Experience gain () / loss (+) on assets 2 0 17 5 - - 19 5 Actuarial gain () / loss (+) on liabilities due to change in  assumptions 0 3 17 15 2 3 19 21 Actuarial gain () / loss (+) on liabilities due to experience 2 1 2 4 2 2 2 1 Gain () / loss (+) as result of asset ceiling - - 2 0 - - 2 0 Total gain () / loss (+) recognized through OCI 0 4 0 6 0 5 0 15 The amounts recognized through OCI were following: The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognized through OCI amounted to net loss of EUR 66 million,  EUR 66 million and EUR 81 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The accumulated  amount does not include translation differences of previous years. In certain countries, companies are liable to pay a specific payroll tax on employee benefits, including on defined  benefits. To the extent the changes in the benefit obligation arise from actuarial gains and losses, the related payroll tax  is also recognized in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010  the amount of payroll tax recognized through OCI was a a gain of less than EUR 0.5 million and a loss of less than EUR 0.1  million, respectively.   124   Metso Financial Statements 2010  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com The changes in the fair value of the plan assets during the year were as follows: Pension benefits, Finnish Foreign pension and other  post-employment benefits Total Total EUR million 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 Fair value of assets at beginning of year 8 12 202 248 210 260 Adjustments for new plans covered - - 11 - 11 - Settlements 0 1 2 9 2 10 Acquisitions - - - 1 - 1 Actual return on plan assets 3 1 32 24 35 25 Plan participant contributions - - 1 1 1 1 Employer contributions 1 3 20 38 21 41 Benefits paid - - 24 25 24 25 Translation differences - - 8 22 8 22 Fair value of assets at end of year 12 15 248 300 260 315 The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets  as at December 31 were as follows: 2009 2010 Equity securities 38% 41% Bonds 41% 39% Other 21% 20% The expected return on plan assets is set by reference to historical re- turns on each of the main asset classes, current market indicators such  as long-term bond yields and the expected long-term strategic asset  allocation of each plan.

It would increase the sum  of the service and interest cost by EUR 0.3 million for 2010. A decrease  of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend would  decrease the accumulated post-employment benefit obligation by EUR  3 million at December 31, 2010. It would not decrease the sum of the  service and interest cost for 2010. The health care cost trend is assumed  to fall to 5% over the next four years by 0.75 percentage points per an- num for members over age 65 and to 5% over the next six years by 0.5  percentage points per annum for members under age 65. The mortgages given as security for own commitments relate to  industrial real estate and other company assets. The mortgage amount  on corporate debt has been calculated as the amount of corresponding  loans. The nominal value of the mortgages at December 31, 2010 was  EUR 1 million higher than the amount of the corresponding loans.  The repurchase commitments represent engagements whereby  Metso agrees to purchase back equipment sold to customer. The  conditions triggering the buy back obligation are specific to each sales  contract. The amounts in the above table comprise the agreed value in  full of each repurchase commitment.  Metso Corporation has guaranteed obligations arising in the ordinary  course of business of many of its subsidiaries up to a maximum of EUR  1,211 million and EUR 1,344 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2010,  respectively.  126   Metso Financial Statements 2010  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com 31 DeRIvATIve FInAnCIAl InSTRuMenTS EUR million Notional  amount Fair value,  assets Fair value,  liabilities Fair value,  net 2009 Forward exchange contracts 1) 1,390 21 18 3 Interest rate swaps 128 0 5 5 Option agreements Bought 13 0 0 0 Sold 6 - 0 0 Electricity forward contracts 2) 640 0 3 3 Nickel swap contracts 3) 252 0 0 0 Total 21 26 5 Notional amounts and fair values of derivative financial instruments as at December 31 were as follows: 2010 Forward exchange contracts 1) 2,137 49 30 19 Interest rate swaps 163 0 3 3 Option agreements Bought 2 0 - 0 Sold 10 - 0 0 Electricity forward contracts 2) 755 7 0 7 Nickel swap contracts 3) 486 1 0 1 Total 57 33 24 1) Some 43 percent and 52 percent of the notional amount at the end of 2009 and 2010, respectively, qualified for cash flow hedge accounting. 2) Notional amount GWh 3) Notional amount tons The notional amounts indicate the volumes in the use of derivatives, but do not indicate the exposure to risk.  30 leASe ConTRACTS Operating leases Finance leases EUR million 2009 2010 2009 2010 Not later than 1 year 46 54 3 2 Later than 1 year and not later than 2 years 37 39 2 1 Later than 2 years and not later than 3 years 25 34 1 0 Later than 3 years and not later than 4 years 22 25 1 0 Later than 4 year and not later than 5 years 17 20 1 0 Later than 5 years 79 70 2 0 Total minimum lease payments 226 242 10 3 Future financial expenses 2 0 Total net present value of finance leases 8 3 Metso leases offices, manufacturing and warehouse space under vari- ous noncancellable leases.

The Board of Directors has been identified as Metsos chief operat- ing decision maker that decides on the strategy, the selection of key  employees, major development projects, business acquisitions, invest- ments, organization and finance. The operating segments in Metso are  determined based on the reports that are delivered to the Board of  Directors and that are used to make strategic decisions. The primary  segment reporting format is based on the business segments, and  secondary on geographical areas. The operations are organized into the following three segments: Mining and Construction Technology is a leading global supplier of  technology and services for the mining and construction industries.  Our customers work in quarrying, aggregates production, construction,  civil engineering, mining and minerals processing. The segment is orga- nized in two business lines: Services and Equipment and systems. Energy and Environmental Technology is one of the leading global sup- pliers in power generation, automation as well as recycling solutions.  Our customers work in the power generation, oil and gas, recycling as  well as pulp and paper industries. Energy and Environmental Technol- ogy comprises three business lines: Power, Automation and Recycling. Paper and Fiber Technology is a leading global supplier of processes,  machinery, equipment and services for the pulp and paper industry.  The offering extends over the entire process life-cycle, covering new  lines, rebuilds and the services business. The segment is organized in  four business lines: Paper, Fiber, Tissue and Fabrics.   Group Head Office and other is comprised of the Parent Company and  shared service centers in Finland, Sweden and Canada as well as hold- ing companies in several countries. Valmet Automotive is reported as a  separate business. Metsos businesses are global in scope with operations in over 50  countries. The main market areas are Europe and North America, which  account for over half of net sales. However, Asia and South America are  becoming increasingly important. Metso has production on all conti- nents. The principal production plants are located in Finland, Sweden,  France, Germany, Canada, the United States, China, India, South Africa  and Brazil. Transfer pricing in intra-Metso transactions is primarily based on mar- ket prices. In some cases, cost-based prices are used, thereby including  the margin (cost plus method). The financial performance of the segments is measured through their  ability to generate operating profit and earnings before interest, tax  and amortization (EBITA) both in absolute figures and as percentage  of net sales. Since 2010, the performance is also measured based on  EBITA before non-recurring items, the previous years are presented in   accordance. The effect the non-recurring items have on cost of goods  sold, selling, general and administrative expenses as well as other  income and expenses, net, is presented in the segment information.  Financial income and expenses, net, and income taxes are not allocated  to segments but included in the profit (loss) of Group Head Office and  other. The treasury activities of Metso are coordinated and managed  by the Group Treasury in order to utilize the cost efficiency benefits re- tained from pooling arrangements, financial risk management, bargain- ing power, cash management, and other measures. Tax planning aims at  the minimization of Metsos overall tax cost and it is based on the legal  structure and the utilization of holding company structure as applicable. Segment assets comprise intangible assets, property, plant and equip- ment, investments in associated companies, joint ventures, available-for- sale equity investments, inventories and non-interest bearing operating  assets and receivables. They exclude interest bearing assets, including  also cash and cash equivalents, income tax receivables and deferred tax  assets, which are included in the assets of Group Head Office and other. Segment liabilities comprise non-interest bearing operating liabilities  and exclude income tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities, which are  included in the liabilities of Group Head Office and other. Interest bear- ing liabilities are not allocated to segments, but included in the liabilities  of Group Head Office and other. Non-cash write-downs include write-offs made to the value of notes,  receivables, and inventories and impairment and other write-offs  recognized to reduce the value of intangible assets, property, plant and  equipment and other assets. Gross capital expenditure comprises investments in intangible assets,  property, plant and equipment, associated companies, joint ventures  and available-for-sale equity investments including additions through  business acquisitions. Information about Metsos reportable segments as of and for the years  ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 is presented in the following  tables.  130   Metso Financial Statements 2010  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com EUR million Mining and  Construction  Technology Energy and  Environmental  Technology Paper  and Fiber  Technology Valmet  Automotive Group Head Of- fice and other Eliminations Metso total 2008 External net sales 2,565 1,731 2,039 65 -

Metsos management does not, however, expect that the outcome  of these lawsuits, claims and disputes will have a material adverse  effect on Metso in view of the grounds presented for them, provisions  made, insurance coverage in force and the extent of Metsos total busi- ness activities. Metso is also a plaintiff in several lawsuits. Pending asbestos litigation As of December 31, 2010, there had been a total of 964 complaints alleg- ing asbestos injuries filed in the United States in which a Metso entity  is one of the named defendants. Where a given plaintiff has named  more than one viable Metso unit as a defendant, the cases are counted  by the number of viable Metso defendants. Of these claims, 324 are still  pending and 640 cases have been closed. Of the closed cases, 110 were  by summary judgment, 414 were dismissed, and 116 were settled. The  outcome of the pending cases is not expected to materially deviate  from the outcome of the previous claims. Hence, management believes  that the risk caused by the pending asbestos lawsuits and claims in  the United States is not material in view of the extent of Metsos total  business operations. subpoena from U.s. Department of Justice requiring  Metso to produce documents On July 2, 2010 Metso was informed by the Antitrust Division of the  United States Department of Justice that it has closed its investiga- tion of the rock crushing and screening equipment industry. Metso  Minerals Industries, Inc., which is part of Metso Corporations Mining  and Construction Technology, received a subpoena from the Antitrust  Division of the United States late 2006. The subpoena called for Metso  Minerals Industries, Inc. to produce certain documents related to an  35 lAwSuITS AnD ClAIMS investigation of potential antitrust violations in the rock crushing and  screening equipment industry. We cooperated fully with the Depart- ment of Justice during the investigation. No further action has been  brought against any party. lawsuits related to intellectual property rights In May 2010, Australian Federal Court entered an order related to the  protection of Metsos certain intellectual property rights. The court  confirmed the settlement agreement according to which the respon- dents paid to Metso, without admitting liability, a compensation in the  amount of approximately EUR 14 million.  In June 2010, a lawsuit involving the protection of certain Metso intel- lectual property rights, Metso versus FLSmidth-Excel LLC, Excel Foundry  & Machine, Inc., et al., United States District Court for the Eastern  District of Wisconsin, was settled. According to the settlement agree- ment, FLSmidth-Excel LLC and Excel Foundry & Machine, Inc., without  admitting liability, have paid to Metso compensation in the amount of  approximately EUR 19 million. Otherwise the settlement agreement is  confidential. In December 2010, a jury at New York court gave a verdict in a favor  of Metso and awarded damages to Metso in the amount of about EUR  12 million in a patent lawsuit Metso versus Powerscreen International  Distribution Ltd (today known as Terex GB Ltd), Terex Corporation,  Emerald Equipment Systems, Inc. et al. and also found that the infringe- ment is willful, therefore potentially allowing Metso to collect multiple  damages. The court ruling is expected to be received in spring 2011 at  which point total compensation for damages payable to Metso will be  known. In the event the court ruling is appealed, the final outcome of  the lawsuit would be expected by 2012. Metso will book the compensa- tion in its financial results only when the final outcome of the lawsuit is  clear, earliest in 2011. 34 AuDIT FeeS Year ended December 31, EUR million 2008 2009 2010 Audit 2.7 2.5 2.5 Tax consulting 1.8 1.7 2.0 Other services 1.1 0.8 1.0 Total 5.6 5.0 5.5      Metso Financial Statements 2010  135  notes to the consoliDateD Financial stateMents www.metso.com 36 new ACCounTIng STAnDARDS ias 24 (Revised) IASB has published IAS 24 (Revised), Related Party Transactions, which  simplifies the disclosure requirements for government-related entities  and clarifies the definition of a related party. The revised standard still  requires disclosures that are important to users of financial statements  but eliminates requirements to disclose information that is costly to  gather and of less value to users. Disclosures about transactions with  government-related entities are required only if they are individually or  collectively significant. IAS 24 (Revised) has been endorsed by the European Union and it  becomes effective for annual financial statements for periods begin- ning on or after January 1, 2011. Metso will apply the standard for the  financial year beginning on January 1, 2011. iFRic 14 (amendment) IASB has published IFRIC 14 (Amended), Prepayment of minimum  funding requirement, which aims to correct an unintended conse- quence of IFRIC 14. As a result of the interpretation, entities are in  some circumstances not permitted to recognise some prepayments for  minimum funding contributions as an asset. The amendment remedies  this unintended consequence by requiring prepayments in appropriate  circumstances to be recognised as assets. The amendment has been endorsed by the European Union and it  is effective for annual financial statements for periods beginning on or  after January 1, 2011. Metso will apply the revision for the financial year  beginning on January 1, 2011. ias 34 (amendment) IASB has published an amendment to IAS 34 Interim financial report- ing. The change provides guidance to illustrate how to apply disclosure  principles in IAS 34 and add disclosure requirements around the cir- cumstances likely to affect fair values of financial instruments and their  classification, transfers of financial instruments between different levels  of the fair value hierarchy, changes in classification of financial assets  and changes in contingent liabilities and assets. The amendment should be endorsed by the European Union in the  first quarter of 2011 and it is effective for annual financial statements for  periods beginning after January 1, 2011. Metso will apply the amend- ment in 2011. None of these revisions and amendments will have a material impact  to Metsos financial statements. iFRs 9 IASB has published a new standard IFRS 9 Financial instruments:  Recognition and measurement. The standard represents the first mile- stone in the IASBs planned replacement of IAS 39. It addresses simpli- fies classification of financial assets and requires them to be measured  either at amortized costs or at fair value. The next steps will involve  reconsideration and re-exposure of the classification and measurement  requirements for financial liabilities, impairment testing methods for  financial assets, and development of enhanced guidance on hedge  accounting. In October 2010, IASB published the second part of IFRS 9 Financial  Liabilities – Classification and Measurement according to which the  accounting and presentation for financial liabilities shall remain un- changed except for those financial liabilities for which fair value option  is applied.

The new shares and the own shares held by the company may  be issued to the companys shareholders in proportion to their  current holding; or by means of a directed issue, waiving the  pre-emptive subscription rights of the shareholders, if there is  a weighty financial reason for the company to do so, such as to  develop the capital structure of the company or to finance or carry  out future acquisitions, investments or other arrangements related  to the companys business or as part of the companys incentive  program. A directed issue can only be executed without payment  if there is an especially weighty financial reason for the company to  do so, taking the interests of all shareholders into account.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence  about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the  report of the Board of Directors. The procedures selected depend on  the auditors judgment, including the assessment of the risks of materi- al misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. opinion on the consolidated Financial statements In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and  fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash  flows of the group in accordance with International Financial Reporting  Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU.  opinion on the companys Financial statements   and the Report of the Board of Directors  In our opinion, the financial statements and the report of the Board  of Directors give a true and fair view of both the consolidated and the  parent companys financial performance and financial position in accor- dance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of the  financial statements and the report of the Board of Directors in Finland.

SEE LINKS  AND  Main features of the internal control   and risk management systems pertaining to  the nancial reporting process Our internal control mechanism seeks to ensure compli- ance with applicable EU-laws, regulations and our oper- ating principles as well as the reliability of nancial and  operational reporting. Furthermore, the internal control  mechanism seeks to safeguard our assets and to ensure  overall eectiveness and eciency of our operations to  meet Metsos strategic, operational and nancial targets.  Our internal control practices are aligned with Metsos  risk management process. The goal of risk management  in Metso is to support our strategy and the achievement  of our objectives by anticipating and managing poten- tial threats to and opportunities for our business. The  discussion below focuses on internal control and risk  management related to the nancial reporting process.  SEE LINK  Metsos operating model of internal control and risk  management related to nancial reporting is designed  to provide sucient assurance regarding the reliability  of nancial reporting and the preparation of nancial  statements in accordance with applicable laws and  regulations, generally accepted accounting principles  (IFRS) and other requirements for listed companies. The  overall system of internal control in Metso is based upon  the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsor- ing Organizations (COSO) and comprises ve principal  components of internal control: the control environ- ment, risk assessment, control activities, information and  communication, and monitoring. Control environment Our Board of Directors bears the overall responsibility  for the internal control over nancial reporting. The  Board has established a written formal working order  that claries the Boards responsibilities and regulates  the Boards and its committees internal distribution of  work. Furthermore, the Board has appointed an Audit  Committee, the primary task of which is to ensure that  established principles for nancial reporting, risk man- agement and internal control are adhered to and that  appropriate relations are maintained with the companys  auditors. The responsibility for maintaining an eective  control environment and the ongoing work on internal   www.metso.com METSO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 2010     Metso Annual Report     control as regards the nancial reporting is delegated to  the CEO. Our internal audit function reports all relevant  issues to the Audit Committee and the CEO. The function  focuses on developing and enhancing internal control  over the nancial reporting in Metso by proactively con- centrating on the internal control environment and by  monitoring the eectiveness of the internal control. Our  internal steering instruments for nancial reporting pri- marily comprise Metsos Code of Conduct, Internal Con- trol Policy, Internal Control Standards, Treasury Policy  and our accounting policies and reporting instructions,  which dene the accounting and reporting rules, and  Metsos denition of processes and minimum require- ments for internal control over nancial reporting.  Risk assessment  Metsos risk assessment as regards nancial reporting  aims to identify and evaluate the most signicant risks  aecting the nancial reporting at the Group, report- ing segment, unit, function and process levels. The  assessment of risk includes, for example, risks related to  fraud and unlawful activities, as well as the risk of loss or  misappropriation of assets. The risk assessment results  in control targets through which we seek to ensure  that the fundamental requirements placed on nancial  reporting are fullled. Information on the develop- ment of essential risk areas and the activities executed  and planned in these areas as well as the measures to  mitigate them are communicated regularly to the Audit  Committee.  Control activities  We have established an internal Metso Compliance  Program to ensure the correctness and credibility of our  nancial reporting and compliance with our govern- ance principles in all our units. Its purpose is to create  a coherent control environment at Metso by imple- menting proper, internal control principles for dierent  business processes and to share internal control-related  best practices. The program stems from the listing of  Metsos share in the United States until  and the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requirements we complied  with in conjunction with the listing. The Metso Compli- ance Program aects all our units and is more exible  and in some respects more comprehensive than SOX  reporting. In line with the SOX requirements, our control  standards dene the basic level for internal controls  that all units must achieve. Our internal audit function,  assisted by trained Metso testers from dierent parts  of our organization, is responsible for the testing of the  units. Unlike with the SOX system, independent auditors  do not issue a separate statement on the functionality  of our internal controls, although in their work they do  widely utilize the documentation created in conjunction  with the Metso Compliance Program.  Our Internal Control Standards are designed to en- sure that local management in every Metso unit designs  and eectively implements the most important monitor- ing procedures related to selected key nancial and  business administration processes in all Metso units. This  is complemented with proper segregation of key duties  and management oversight controls in the organiza- tions. Properly established internal control mechanisms  safeguard us also from possible misconduct. Internal  Control Standards list the control standards for selected  business processes, which are sales and project busi- ness, procurement, payroll, inventory, treasury, nancial  reporting, xed assets and IT systems. For each of these  processes, the tasks that must be segregated are also  listed. The units document the control activities in use  for each of their respective key business process. In  Metsos Compliance Program the eectiveness of the  monitoring procedures are assessed and tested of. The  program also requires correction of any shortcomings.  Metsos Compliance Program was completed by the  end of  as originally planned in . In line with the  program, the total of  units were tested, the majority  of the most signicant twice. After retesting,  units  fully passed the requirement level of Metso Compliance  Programs controls.  The program continues in . The most important  change is to integrate internal audit and compliance  testing into a single package. In terms of control require- ments, there will be more emphasis on the key business  issues. Sustainability and worksite safety will be part of  the Metso Compliance Program requirements. Addition- ally, the new systems adopted by Metso will enable  signicantly more eective control procedures, which  will also be taken into consideration in the program. Information and communication In order to secure an eective and ecient internal  control environment, we seek to ensure that Metsos  internal and external communication is open, transpar- ent, accurate and timely. Information regarding internal  steering instruments for nancial reporting, i.e. account- ing principles, nancial reporting instructions and the  disclosure policy are available on Metsos intranet. We  arrange training for our personnel regarding internal  control issues and tools. Metsos CFO and the head of  internal audit report the results of the work on internal  control as a standing item on the agenda of the Audit  Committee. The results of the Audit Committees work  in the form of observations, recommendations and pro- posed decisions and measures are reported to the Board  after every Audit Committee meeting. Monitoring  The eectiveness of internal control related to nancial  reporting is monitored by the Board of Directors, the  Audit Committee, the CEO, Group management, internal  audit, and the management of the reporting segments  and Group companies. Monitoring includes the follow  up of monthly nancial reports, review of the rolling  estimates and plans, as well as reports from internal  audit and quarterly reports by independent auditors.  Our internal audit annually assesses the eectiveness of  Metsos operations and the adequacy of risk manage- ment and reports the risks and weaknesses related to  the internal control processes. Internal audit compiles  an annual audit plan, the status and ndings of which it   Current informa- tion about Metsos  management  www.metso.com/ management  Additional informa- tion about Metsos  management,  p. –  A more detailed  description of Metsos  risk management is  presented on pages  – and on our  website   www.metso.com/ risks LINKS &  NOTES  www.metso.com METSO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 2010    Metso Annual Report  regularly reports to Metso management, auditors and  the Audit Committee. Furthermore, our internal audit  and independent auditor meet regularly to coordinate  the monitoring eorts.  In monitoring we focused on the management of  net working capital, cost structure competitiveness and  the functioning of the new ERP systems.   Compliance with laws and code of conduct In all our operations we seek to comply with applicable  laws and statutes as well as generally accepted practices.  Additionally, our operations are guided by Metsos Code  of Conduct, internal policies and guidelines as well as  values. Our Code of Conduct describes Metsos corporate  culture, commonly accepted practices and commitment  to compliance with laws and regulations. They support  Metsos responsible operations, sustainability and our  success. The foundation of our Code of Conduct is the  UNs Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UNs  Global Compact initiative, which we have endorsed, and  the International Labor Organizations (ILO) declaration  on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. When  applicable, the OECDs Guidelines for Multinational En- terprises are also incorporated into our Code of Conduct.  We require that each one of our employees is familiar  with the legislation and operating guidelines of their  own areas of responsibility. Business management is  responsible for the internal control of the operations  in their respective sector. In conjunction with internal  audits, we strive to ensure that everyone in the unit be- ing audited is familiar with and compliant with the laws,  regulations and principles relating to their own work.  In addition to Metsos management, the due course of  operations is monitored by the Boards Audit Commit- tee, which reports any misconduct to the Board. Internal audit  Metsos internal audit assesses the eciency and  appropriateness of our operations and examines the  functioning of internal controls. It seeks to ensure the  correctness of nancial and operational reporting,  compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and  proper management of the companys assets. In  we  included certain controls related to occupational health  and safety and environmental aspects within the sphere  of internal audit.  Additionally, internal audit proactively encourages  the development of risk management in Metsos various  operations. The head of internal audit reports adminis- tratively to the CFO, but has direct access also to the CEO  and to the chairman of the Audit Committee.  SEE LINK 1  Reporting suspected nancial misconduct Our guidelines on the prevention of nancial mis- conduct dene how suspected misconduct should  be reported, how it is investigated and how the issue  proceeds. Metso employees are encouraged to report  suspected misconduct to their own supervisors, to  other management or, if necessary, directly to internal  audit. Additionally, Metso employees and partners can  report suspicions of nancial misconduct condentially  via the Whistleblower channel, which is maintained by  an independent party. The report can be submitted in  several languages via the Internet, by phone or by email,  and anonymously if necessary. Suspected misconduct  is investigated immediately and condentially. Internal  audit decides on how the matter will be investigated  and reports the suspicion to the Audit Committee. The  legal aairs and HR functions together implement any  measures consequential to the misconduct.  We received eight reports of suspected nancial  misconduct via the Whistleblower channel. Additionally,  internal audit received three direct contacts. Upon more  careful investigation, one of the suspicions was classi- able as misconduct. There were no cases of misconduct  revealed in conjunction with internal audits. The cases  of misconduct were reviewed by the Audit Committee  in line with our guidelines on reporting misconduct. The  cases did not have signicant impact on the nancial  results we reported. Auditors According to the Articles of Association, Metso has one  auditor, which must be a rm of public accountants cer- tied by the Finnish Central Chamber of Commerce. The  Boards Audit Committee prepares the auditor selection  process. Since  the policy when electing the auditor  has been that the aggregate duration of the consecu- tive terms of a principal auditor may not exceed seven  years. This means that Metsos principal auditor Johan  Kronberg can act in that capacity no later than for the  audit of nancial period . There are no term limits  regarding the duration of the auditing rm. The auditors  statutory obligation is to audit the companys account- ing, the Board of Directors report, nancial statements  and administration for the nancial year. The parent  companys auditor must also audit the consolidated  nancial statements and other mutual relationships  between Group companies.  In conjunction with our annual nancial statements,  the auditor gives Metsos shareholders an Auditors  Report as required by law. The auditor reports primarily  via the Audit Committee and at least once a year to the  Board. The Audit Committee evaluates the performance  and services of the independent auditors each year and  decides if there is a need to arrange an open tender  process.  PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy, Authorized Public Ac- countants, has been our auditor since . In , the  principal auditor was Johan Kronberg, who has been the  companys principal auditor since . Our auditor was  last time put out to tender in .

Our permanent insiders are not permitted  to trade in Metsos issued securities during the  days  immediately prior to the publication of a Metso interim  review or nancial statements release. The ownership of  Metso securities by statutory insiders (insiders subject  to the disclosure obligation) and their interest parties  is public. Statutory insiders include the Chairman, Vice  Chairman and members of the Board of Directors, the  CEO and his deputy, the principally responsible auditor  of a rm of public accountants and Executive Team  members. Additionally, Metso also has permanent  company-specic insiders and separately identied  project-specic insiders whose securities ownership  is not public. We update the register of our statutory  insiders in the Euroclear Finland Ltds Sire system, where  information on the ownership of securities can be ob- tained directly from the book-entry system.  SEE LINKS 2 AND 3 Management remuneration  The objective of remuneration at Metso is to encourage  our employees as individuals and as team members to  achieve the set nancial and operational targets and  to strive for excellent performance. Remuneration is  aligned with Metsos nancial performance, internal and  external references and observing remuneration levels  for similar positions among peer companies. Metsos  remuneration package for executives includes a com- petitive salary and employee benets according to local  market practices, short-term incentives based on pre- dened annual performance indicators and long-term  incentives that align the interests of the key executives  and shareholders. Remuneration of the Board The Annual General Meeting decides on the remunera- tion to the members of the Board for one term of oce  at a time. The Annual General Meeting in  decided to  keep the fees paid to Board members unchanged, and  the annual fees are:   Chairman of the Board EUR ,  Vice Chairman of the Board EUR ,  Other Board members EUR , In addition, a fee of EUR  per meeting is paid to all  Board members for each Board and committee meeting  they attended.

The  Board members acquired the shares from the market  within two weeks of publication of the rst-quarter   interim report on April , . Altogether , shares  were acquired, which is . percent of Metsos total  share capital. There are no special terms or conditions  associated with owning these shares. Shares acquired in  this conjunction by individual Board members are listed  in the table below.

The Board members are not covered  by Metsos bonus plans, share-based incentive schemes  or pension plans. Decision making process and main principles of  remuneration of the CEO and other Executive Team  members The Board of Directors decides on the remuneration,  benets and other terms of employment of the Presi- dent and CEO. The Boards Remuneration and HR Com- mittee decides on the compensation and benets of  the other Executive Team members based on the CEOs  proposal and general principles approved by the Board. The remuneration of Executive Team members,  including the CEO, comprises a monthly total salary  (including monthly salary and customary fringe benets  such as a car, a mobile phone and, in some cases, an  apartment) as well as both short- and long-term incen- tives. Short-term incentives are annual performance  bonuses decided by the Board. As long-term incentives,  the Executive Team members are included in share own- ership plans that are decided and implemented by the  Board and for which share repurchase and share issue  authorizations are obtained from the Annual General  Meeting. There are no options outstanding or available  from any of Metsos prior option programs. Currently,  we do not have guidelines on what portion of the an- nual total base salary executives should invest in Metso  shares. Additionally, management benets include a supple- mentary dened contribution pension plan for all mem- bers of the new Executive Team (as of March , ) with  the exception of President and CEO Matti Khknen,  who has a dened benet pension plan. President and  CEO Jorma Eloranta had a company-paid supplementary  dened benet pension plan, which enabled him to   Internal Audits  Charter   www.metso.com/ audit  Ownership and  trading information  of Metsos insiders  www.metso.com/ insiders   Metsos corporate go- vernance principles  www.metso.com/ governance  Detailed information  about Board member  remuneration is  available in the Notes  to the Financial State- ments, p. – LINKS &  NOTES  www.metso.com METSO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 2010    Metso Annual Report  retire at the age of . The Board has outlined that no  new supplementary dened benet pension plans will  be introduced. Performance bonuses The Board annually conrms the terms and targets  of our performance bonuses. The amount of bonus  payment, if any, is based on achieving set nancial  performance targets, such as EBITA and cash ow, of  Metso and/or the business in question. In addition to  these, also individual and/or team targets are used.  The Remuneration and HR Committee evaluates the  achievement of the predened targets of the CEO and  other Executive Team members. For the CEO and for  other Executive Team members, the maximum annual  performance bonus is currently – percent of their  annual total salary. Share-based incentive plans The Board decides and implements Metsos share-based  incentive plans, which are part of the remuneration  and commitment program for Metso management.  The purpose of the plans is to align the goals of Metsos  shareholders and management to enhance the value  of the company. The plans also aim to ensure commit- ment of  management and to oer them a competitive,  ownership-based reward scheme. For years –  we implemented share-based incentive plans in which  Metso shares were allocated to the participants based on  achieving targets set for operating prot. Now we have  share ownership plans in place that require participants  also to make a personal investment in Metso shares. Share Ownership Plan 2009–2011 In October , the  Board approved a share-based incentive plan for our  management, Metso Share Ownership Plan –.  The plans purpose is to commit our CEO, MET members  and management to our company and to enhance its  value. Participation in the plan requires a personal in- vestment in Metso shares. The plan includes one three- year earning period, which began on January ,   and will end on December , . The Board targeted  the plan initially to about  persons in management  position, of which  were participating at the end of  . Members of the  Executive Team may receive a  maximum of , shares as share rewards. At the beginning of the earnings period, the  participants invested in , Metso shares (initial  investment) and the rewards that can be paid on the  basis of the plan correspond to a maximum total of  , Metso shares. The reward from the plan consists  of grants of the base matching shares and performance  shares. The amount of base matching shares is based on  Metso share price development and it can be . or .  times the number of shares in the initial investment. The  potential reward in the form of performance shares is  based on the combination of Metsos Total Shareholder  Return (TSR) over the three-year period and on the  annual earnings per share (EPS) in –. If the TSR  is zero or negative over the three-year period, no perfor- mance shares shall be distributed. The maximum ratio of  the performance shares for the CEO is six, for the other  MET members ve and for other participants four times  of the number of shares in the initial investment. In ad- dition to meeting the performance targets, receiving the  reward requires that the participant holds the initial in- vestment for the entire earning period and is employed  by Metso until the reward payment. The amount of the  possible reward earned will be determined after the   nancial statements are published. The rewards will be  paid in Metso shares in the rst half of . In coun- tries where the employer has a payroll tax withholding  obligation, Metso can pay a maximum of  percent of  the reward in cash instead of shares. Any shares earned  must be held for a minimum of one year after the reward  payment. The shares for the plan are acquired through  public trading, and therefore the incentive plan will have  no diluting eect on the share value. Share Ownership Plan 2010–2012 In October  the  Board approved a similar share-based incentive plan for  management, Metso Share Ownership Plan –.  The plan includes one three-year earning period, which  began on January ,  and will end on December ,  .

Dec 31, 2010  www.metso.com ASSURANCE REPORT     Metso Annual Report     Independent Assurance Report  Translation from the Finnish Original  To the management of Metso Corporation We have been engaged by the Management of Metso  Corporation to perform a limited assurance engagement  on the information on economic, social and environ- mental responsibility disclosed in Metso Corporations  annual sustainability reporting for the period of January  ,  to December , . The annual sustainabil- ity reporting (hereinafter Sustainability Reporting)  consists of sustainability information disclosed in the  Annual Report  of Metso Corporation and the  Metso Sustainability Results  online publication, as  disclosed on Metsos website. The scope of the Sustain- ability Reporting covers the entire Metso Group. Managements responsibility  The Management of Metso Corporation is responsible  for preparing the Sustainability Reporting in accordance  with the Reporting criteria as set out in Metso Corpora- tions own documented standards and the G Guidelines  of the Global Reporting Initiative. Practitioners responsibility Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sus- tainability Reporting based on our work performed. Our  assurance report has been made in accordance with the  terms of our engagement. We do not accept, or assume  responsibility to anyone else, except to Metso Corpora- tion for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions  that we have reached. We conducted our work in accordance with the In- ternational Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE)   Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or  Reviews of Historical Financial Information. This Stand- ard requires that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the assurance engagement to  obtain limited assurance whether any matters come to  our attention that cause us to believe that the Sustain- ability Reporting has not been prepared, in all material  respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria. We have not been engaged to provide assurance on  amounts or other disclosures relating to the prior report- ing periods presented in the Sustainability Reporting. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence- gathering procedures are more limited than for a  reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less  assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance en- gagement. An assurance engagement involves perform- ing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts  and other disclosures in the Sustainability Reporting.  The procedures selected depend on the practitioners  judgment, including an assessment of the risks of mate- rial misstatement of the Sustainability Reporting.  Our work consisted of, amongst others, the following  procedures:   Making interviews with senior management of Metso  Corporation.  Assessing how Metso Group employees apply Metso  Corporations reporting guidelines and procedures.  Visiting Metso Corporations Head Oce as well as six  production units in Brazil, China, Finland, Germany  and Czech Republic.  Interviewing employees responsible for collection  and reporting of the information presented in the  Sustainability Reporting at Metso Group level and at  the dierent production units where our visits took  place.  Inspection of relevant documents and systems for  gathering, analyzing and aggregating the informa- tion presented in the Sustainability Reporting as well  as tests on a sample basis.  Assessing the data consolidation process of the  information presented in the Sustainability Reporting  at Metso Group level. Conclusion Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing  has come to our attention that causes us to believe that  the Sustainability Reporting has not been prepared, in all  material respects, in accordance with the Reporting cri- teria. Our assurance report should be read in conjunction  with the inherent limitations of accuracy and complete- ness for sustainability information. This independent  assurance report should not be used on its own as a basis  for interpreting Metso Corporations performance in rela- tion to its principles of corporate responsibility. Helsinki, February ,  PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy Johan Kronberg            Sirpa Juutinen Authorised Public Accountant   Partner         Sustainability &           Climate Change  www.metso.com RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT    Metso Annual Report  Risk management Risk management is an integral part of our  operational management: we anticipate oppor- tunities for and threats to our operations and  thereby support our strategy and the achieve- ment of our objectives. Eective risk manage- ment ensures continuity of our operations also  in changing circumstances. In 2010 the global  economic recovery downsized the threats re- lated to our operating environment. However,  the budget decits of several European coun- tries and the United States, the growing ina- tion pressures, particularly in emerging markets,  and the uctuations in currency exchange rates  fueled the uncertainty in the global economy.  We dene risks as uncertainties, which, if materialized,  can either positively or negatively impact our chances  of achieving our goals. Uncertainties can be caused by  unexpected events or changes in circumstances. We  assess the signicance of a risk as a combination of prob- ability and consequences of the occurrence. By taking  calculated strategic-, operational- or nance-related  risks, we can strengthen our business opportunities. In  contrast, hazard risks that materialize have a negative  impact on our operations. We can manage some risks on  our own, while other risks are beyond our control, and  we can only prepare for them.  Our risk management focus is on proactive measures  and securing our operations, and on limiting adverse  impacts and utilizing opportunities. We map and assess  risks systematically and adjust our operations when  needed. In mapping risks, which is part of our annual  strategy process, we analyze the potential positive and  negative impacts on our business and nancial position  during the assessment year and on the three subse- quent years.  Regardless if we had prepared ourselves for it,  the threats may materialize, and have a signicant  adverse impact on our business, nancial situation and  operating result or on the value of our shares and other  securities. We aim to reduce the nancial impacts of  any adverse events and to restore operations to normal  as quickly as possible. In addition, we have prepared for  possible risks through insurance schemes. We estimate  that our overall level of risks is currently at a manage- able level in proportion to the scope of our operations  and to the practical measures available. Risk management responsibilities  Our risk management principles are approved by Metso  Board of Directors. The Board also oversees that the  planning, information and control systems in place for  risk management are sucient and support our business  objectives. The Boards Audit Committee assesses the  adequacy of risk management and ensures that it is con- sistent with the requirements by our operating environ- ment and our corporate governance principles. The Risk Management Team is comprised of rep- resentatives of our businesses and our CFO. The team  annually conrms the risk management programs of  our businesses and ensures that they focus on relevant  issues in terms of our operations. The Groups Risk  Management function oversees the implementation  of the risk management program and principles and  develops common risk management procedures and  guidelines. Business management is responsible for  identifying and managing risks in their respective area  as part of their operations. Group Treasury manages our  nancial risks and secures the availability of equity and  debt nancing with competitive terms. Group Treasury  works in cooperation with the businesses and centrally  manages external funding. Additionally, it is responsible  for managing nancial assets and for hedging related to  our nancial risks. Risk management focus areas and   development The recovery of the global economy downsized the  threats related to our operating environment and  nancing in . The budget decits in many European  countries and in the United States as well as uctuations  in currency exchange rates fueled uncertainty, but de-  www.metso.com RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT     Metso Annual Report     mand in the emerging markets clearly grew. We estimate  that the gradual recovery will continue in most of our  customer industries this year. We estimate that the high share of our net sales de- rived from services and emerging markets will diminish  the negative impacts of potential market uncertainties.  We evaluate our risk management practices based  on the new ISO  standard for risk management.  The standard sets general content requirements and  practices for the comprehensive risk management of  companies. Our risk management fullls the relevant  requirements of the new standard.  Our property insurance company conducted audits  in  of our units, and we worked with our insurance  broker to assess the risk management functionality  in nine of our units. We enhanced the centralized and  systematic assessment of business interruption risks and  took into use a global training and auditing procedure  related to transportation insurance. To secure sucient  resources, we reviewed and further specied the risk  management resourcing needs of our business seg- ments. In IT risk management we centralized the audit- ing measures for server environments. As a part of the  common ways of operating, we compiled social media  guidelines aimed at securing our brand and reputation  in the new social media environment.  In risk assessment we updated the risk map to cor- respond with our current business environment.  The exceptionally high number of crisis situations  related to natural phenomena required a lot of crisis  management measures during the year. Our top priority  in these situations is to secure the safety of people. Ad- ditionally, we focused on expanding the use of Metsos  crises management-related practices to all our key mar- ket areas. Individuals responsible for crises management  and crises communications as well as regional coordina- tors for crises situations were appointed for the dierent  geographical regions.   In the coming years we will deepen our analyses of  risks. A special challenge is in the assessing the interde- pendencies of dierent risks. We will also enhance our  internal risk management communications by using the  intranet, arranging training and by increasing the audit- ing conducted by insurance companies.  We have started preparing for the EUs Environmen- tal Liability Directive aimed at creating a common liabil- ity system to prevent and remedy damage to animals  and the environment.

We want  capital market participants to use this information to  form a balanced view of Metso as an investment, says  Johanna Henttonen, Vice President, Investor Relations.  In recent years the dialogue has increased also in inves- tor relations: we regularly gather and analyze market  information and investor feedback for use by our top  management and our Board of Directors. We seek to provide correct, adequate and current  information regularly and impartially to all market par- ticipants. During the year we travelled  days with top  management to meet with investors in Europe and the  United States, adds Marja Mkinen, Investor Relations  Manager. Additionally, we arranged a two-day Capital  Markets Day seminar in Helsinki. Some  analysts  and investors from Helsinki, Stockholm and London  attended the event. During the year we met over   professional investors and analysts, and we participated  in eight investor seminars around the world. IR Coordinator Anu Haapamki describes the daily  activities of investor relations: We are responsible for  investor communications as well as daily contact with  investors. The easiest way to arrange a meeting with a  Metso executive or investor relations representative, is  to contact me. We organize all investor meeting requests  centrally, and we aim for promptness, transparency and  good service.
