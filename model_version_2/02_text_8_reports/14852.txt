On our  18th anniversary we are proud to  be a leading and innovative law firm  that has always been firmly committed  to delivering excellent legal advice,  to the quality of our professional  management  and  organisation  and, lastly, to the human quality  of our project.

The concepts  underlying the sustainability policy of  Abreu Advogados are transparecy,  dialogue and innovation which shape the way we interact with all our stakeholders and  the decisions we make in respect to all the areas of our activity. Because we feel that transparency is  beneficial to all interested parties and  although we are the first and still the  only Portuguese law firm to do so,  we once again publish our economic  performance.

THIS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT AIMS TO: Whilst reading this Report, please bear in mind that: For the second sustainability report we relied on the objective reflection made by our Panel of External  Stakeholders, which contributed enormously to determining the relevance of the content of this report. The independent panel of stakeholders were also requested to analyse this report, whose opinion is  reflected on pages 29 to 31. This analysis constitutes a major asset in the process of improving the             reporting quality.  In two years we strengthened the dialogue with our main stakeholders, which turned out to be very          enriching to our sustainability policy and to the improvement of our performance. This report was drawn up based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and, relying on the information and the data we were able to  provide, we ranked ourselves at application level B.

This report is published at a time when the whole country is being called upon to pay the price for past          unsustainable decisions. At a time when we finally realize — in the most difficult way and because we  are being compelled to do so by our international creditors — how important it is to build a Country that is              economically viable, ecologically correct, socially just and culturally diverse (to use the concept of sustainability  according to Wikipedia). The feeling of change that out of necessity is currently being lived in Portuguese society is also affecting      corporate organisations, particularly law firms, as players in the Legal Sector. The firms 18th anniversary, celebrated in 2011, reflects its commitment towards change and innovation,      mirrored in the quality of the legal services provided, in the deeply humanistic view of the relationship with  each and every one of its team members but also of demand in their performance, in the clear and unequivocal  investment in conciliating private and professional life, in the clear understanding of the importance of method  and sound management, and above all, the reaffirmed conviction of creating an Institution that endures far  beyond the generation that founded it. It was this commitment - strengthened by a clear choice of a path where sustainability is a means, not merely  an end — that brought us where we are today and which, in a highly competitive market, allowed us to change  what started out as being a young lawyers adventure into a truly distinctive project of law and into one of the  largest Law Firms in the country. For all this, we will be back in a couple of years with our third Sustainability Report.  6 : ENTERVIEW ENTERVIEW with Miguel Castro Pereira Managing Partner of Abreu Advogados Does the firms sustainability policy make it more competitive in the market?  Abreu Advogados Sustainability Policy makes the firm more sustainable and therefore more competitive! The  adoption of best practices in the management of the firm and in the provision of our legal services contributes  to our economic and social sustainability. Best practices that materialise in the optimisation of all available  resources and its strictly ethical use in the definition of the means to be used and goals to be achieved,  leaving an internal and external mark that is recognised by the Team and by the market (internal and external  Clients).   Well, nothing can be more competitive than achieving (and keeping) this recognition and because of that  ensure the projects sustainability, as the Teams and the markets first choice.   The country will be experiencing hard times due to the difficult economic situation. How will Abreu  Advogados respond to the challenges ahead? Will there be choices? Above all, Abreu Advogados will ensure the sustainability of its project. In order to do so, the firm will have to  anticipate the consequences of the economic situation, by taking the necessary measures to safeguard its  strength. Abreu Advogados needs to focus more on the efficiency of the provision of its services which could  imply a more business orientated use of resources. Will this mean that sustainability will be cast  aside?  On the contrary, it will mean that sustainability is achieved through the ethical use of resources and through  the definition of objectives in rendering services to Clients, as a start, whilst simultaneously enabling the firm  to provide what at Abreu Advogados has real effective added value: legal services.  Those will be our opportunities to influence society: the rendering of services to Clients respecting ethical  standards and the firms intervention in society within the context of the specific objectives of our activity - Law  and Justice. By communicating them, providing them, applying them, influencing decision makers towards  their materialisation in the daily life.  ENTERVIEW : 7 As legal consultants do you think that in the next two years youll be able to give your Clients an  added contribution? Abreu Advogados has always integrated well with its Clients, going beyond a mere working relationship  unaware of their reality. Our status as providers of external services to a wide range of domestic and foreign  clients allows us to access and participate in numerous experiences which we may use to our Clients benefit. We believe that, in addition to the excellence of the legal services we provide, we are also able to bring added  value to our Clients by sharing good practices and, when relevant, raising awareness of sustainability issues  regarding their businesses and projects. This is where our added value lies and this is where we can leave  our mark, obtaining the recognition that it is essential to the sustainability of our project. Sustainability is increasingly being considered as having a positive impact in attracting and retaining  talent and as a key factor in the involvement of the team because people are interested in working in  companies committed to sustainable development. Do you feel this is the case in Abreu Advogados? Sustainable development is definitely part of Abreu Advogados DNA, as a condition for continuing to exist.  And, when we get down to it, it will be this condition that will attract players who are looking for more than just  an immediate relation between work and pay, but who seek recognition both internally and externally. Well,  this recognition is not achieved without committing to a joint project that goes beyond the individual and, thus,  each individual understands that it can only be achieved with the whole. It is the union of all that will ensure  Abreu Advogados sustainability and has made its development possible. Three wishes for the next two years Strictness in the use of resources, objective recognition for the added contribution of any social and economic  player and, above all, a shared vision of continuity of the project  For Abreu Advogados and for Portugal!  1 18 YEARS OF SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OUR DNA OUR STRATEGIC VISION INNOVATIVE BY LAW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Angola In Association  with FBL  Advogados Mozambique In Association with Ferreira Rocha & Associados OPorto Madeira Lisbon Head-Office AB Offices Clients 10 : 18 YEARS OF SUSTAINABLE GROWTH Abreu & Associados, Sociedade de Advogados, R.L. is a Portuguese  law firm founded in 1993. On our 18th anniversary we are proud to be  a leading and innovative law firm that has always been firmly committed to  the excellence of the legal services we render our Clients, to the quality  of our professional management and organisation and, lastly, to the   human quality of our project. Some of the largest companies operating  in Portugal, as well as an increasing number of international entities  are part of the firms Client portfolio. The extent of our performance   entails an increasing responsibility in the light of the growing challenges  brought by globalisation to all economic and social  stakeholders. OUR DNA 18 YEARS OF SUSTAINABLE GROWTH We are known as ABREU  ADVOGADOS and, informally,  as, AB  2010 In a flash AB one of the largest law  firms in Portugal 232 Team Members 164 Lawyers 68 Administrative  Staf Associations with two law frms in Angola and in Mozambique 1/4 of our  clients are  from abroad 3 ofces 16ME  Total Turnover 3ME  Net Results Lisbon Oporto Madeira Volunteer  work Pro bono legal assistance 779 hours 1870 hours 18 YEARS OF SUSTAINABLE GROWTH : 11 Organisations are often faced with the question of how they view their  future. In the current economic and social situation, characterised by  the uncertainty of the global and, most of all, national recovery, we feel  it is of the utmost importance to reflect on who we are, which principles  define us and what values guide us. At Abreu Advogados we believe  that the vision, the mission and the values that guide our path are clear  and make up the backbone of the firms DNA.  OUR STRATEGIC VISION The vision we have of the Law and of the future of Abreu Advogados  is based on the common interest in creating a solid Institution, ethically  correct and which embraces different generations. We wish to continue  to grow in a sustained and consolidated manner, focused on our core  values, without ever forgetting the principles that guide us. Our Vision We understand our mission is to provide legal services that are guided  by the values of excellence and Client satisfaction, coupled with a  responsible practice of law, abiding by high ethical standards, ensuring  accuracy and high quality at all times. Our Mission Our Values Excellence because Justice is the other side of perfection, all legal  assistance that is imperfect is necessarily an injustice. Quality because the true level of an organisation and of the services  it provides must always be objectively assessed and accredited by  an independent party and according to the highest standards. Ethics because if what is fair is good, there is nothing good that is  not well done and done in good faith. Accuracy because it is the antidote to indifference and all that is  undifferentiated. Solidarity because the name of each person is also the name by  which the office is known.  12 : 18 YEARS OF SUSTAINABLE GROWTH Abreu Advogados culture is made up of shared values and behaviours  put into practice by each person. The team work and sense of  belonging that define us result from a culture based on dialogue and  transparency shared by the entire firm: we are characterised by an  open door policy, where dialogue is encouraged, without barriers. We  believe this culture, which we identify as being AB culture, also makes  perfect sense in the relationship with our external stakeholders. This  is extensively exemplified by the publication of the firms financial  information - still the only firm to do so in the Portuguese legal sector -  and in the creation of a Panel of External Stakeholders. The AB Book of Principles, establishing the principles and rules of  conduct, is our most recent initiative as a way of encouraging that our  core values are put into practice in everyday life. Our culture is also based on the strive for excellence, which makes us  seek innovation, present in all areas of the firm: from a governance  model with differential institutional rules, implementation of a Quality  Management System to Sustainability Reports in the legal sector. Above everything else is the respect for the individual, because only a  person that feels respected will be willing to give its best service to the  firm. We are therefore bound to guarantee adequate conditions for the  personal and professional fulfilment of all team members. In such a competitive activity as the practice of law and in an increasingly  global social economic context, the lawyers capacity to provide  innovative legal services is put to the test. Training and investment in  knowledge management are, for this reason, crucial instruments to  ensure sound and up-to-date knowledge and to create value for the  Client.

The principle one partner-one vote guarantees equal voting rights,  regardless of seniority; Partners retire at the age of 65, or, after this age, on completing 10  years with the firm; Partners do not have successor rights. Outstanding legal services must be based on a management model.  Ours in particular is based on the standardisation of the modus  ope-randi of the Firm accredited under the Portuguese ISO 9001:2008  Certification Standard. We were the first Portuguese law firm to obtain  ISO 9001 Quality Management System accreditation. This investment  was a strategic priority to ensure the firms sustainable growth.  Likewise, we have also implemented a Risk Management System  which has been integrated in our Quality Management System. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Organisational Quality Based on our Institutional goal, we designed a governance model  based on distinctive rules: Governance Model  We have incorporated some distinc- tive rules in our governance model: This model has an added  difficulty, inasmuch as the leading  law firms have always been  known for their partners.

We adopted risk management as a planning and corporate  management philosophy, and as such it will be integrated by our  Quality Ma-nagement System. This was a highly participated internal process, involving reflection and  analysis. A team was selected to whom 8 questionnaires were sent,  based on which we were able to identify the main risks inherent to the  firms activity.

WE ARE WHAT WE DO   The quality of the services we provide and the professional merit of our  Lawyers, founded on an ethical and responsible practice of the Law, is  rewarded with prestigious international awards. Abreu Advogados and  its Lawyers are also recommended in several legal publications and  international legal directories. Recognition We highlight FT Innovative Lawyers Reports recognition for our  innovative work. This Report aims to distinguish law firms for the  innovation of their work and solutions presented in the field of Law. Now  in its fifth year, this Report is considered to be one of the top legal rankings  in Europe, for the accuracy and sobriety of their research work. In 2009, Abreu Advogados was recommended by the Financial Times  Innovative Lawyers Report for the drafting of a Master Agreement for  Derivatives (Contrato-Quadro de Instrumentos Financeiros Derivados- OTC) subject to Portuguese law, together with some of the largest  Portuguese banks. In 2010, the firm was ranked thirteen in the top 15 of Continental  Europe, thanks to its role in the setting up of a local Association for  Derivatives – Associao Portuguesa de Instrumentos Financeiros de  Derivados (APIFD), a ranking which so far Abreu Advogados has only  shared with other international law firms. In 2011, Abreu Advogados was distinguished by RSG Consulting and  Iberian Lawyer magazine, with the award for Innovation by a  Portuguese Law Firm. This award seeks to recognise the firms results  in the 2009 and 2010 editions of the Financial Times Innovative  Lawyers Report. For the second year running (2009-2010), Abreu Advogados is the only  Portuguese Law Firm in the British Legal Awards shortlist for European  Legal Team of the Year. The British Legal Awards are the most important  and prestigious awards worldwide.  This nomination is the recognition of the work of Abreu Advogados in  the creation of APFID. GIVING AND RECEIVING ABREU ADVOGADOS PORTUGUESE CORPORATE TAX LAW  FIRM OF THE YEAR 2009 WE ARE WHAT WE DO : 19  We advocate the Environment and Sustainability | By Manuel de Andrade Neves and Jos Eduardo Martins 20 : WE ARE WHAT WE DO Lawyers, Partners of Abreu  Advogados and Co-Heads of the  Public Law and Environmental  Law Practice Area (APDP&A) Manuel de Andrade Neves Jos Eduardo Martins At Abreu Advogados we advocate the Environment and Sustainability in general. This is not a mere slogan  and it is no coincidence that we have put such statement on the cover of both reports. This practice results  from a long road travelled in protecting and promoting the respect for the environment. We were the first to embrace this cause, in the early nineties, by studying Environmental Law and disseminating,  interpreting and implementing sustainability. Along the way, we also looked inwards into our practices but, and above all, we never lost sight of an active  citizenship engagement for the protection of the environment by raising our Clients awareness of the respect  for the environment and the rights of future generations beyond the requirements of the rules and regulations  then in force. Amongst ABs partners are some of the founders of the first Environmental NGOs in Portugal, and possibly  because of this we always felt that the existing rules and environmental legislation contained, more often than  not, minimum levels of respect for the environment, and consequently, we have always encouraged higher  levels of protection and have developed - quite successfully, we believe – a pedagogical practice before our  Clients. The examples of this are quite a few. Whenever we are at a public discussion of a master plan or the licensing  or environmental assessment of a plant or property, or discussing the extent of a specific environmental  responsibility, we can proudly say that we represent whoever wants to do the least harm to the natural  resources, or the one who least of all shirks the responsibility of its recovery. Internally speaking, also on the influence of our Public Law and Environmental Law Practice Area we  implemented toner cartridge and used battery recycling, the use of recycled paper and the reduction of  greenhouse gas emissions. In this shoemakers house the son doesnt go barefoot  protecting the environment is part of our culture.  The teleology behind most of the environment and spatial planning laws is not, for most of the women and  men who work at the firm, a nuisance or a fancy invention  but rather obligations of citizenship we are quite  happy to fulfil. We advocate Environment and Sustainability. It is what we do, it is who we are.  INNOVATIVE BY LAW.

The criteria of profitability and productivity should be dependant on  criteria of sustainability. For this reason we believe that the practice of  law should be conducted in a transparent way, committed to offering its  Clients legal services of the highest ethical and quality level, with  respect for the people, for the environment and for the future  generations. The concepts underlying the sustainability policy adopted by Abreu  Advogados are transparency, dialogue and innovation which shape the  way we interact with our stakeholders and the decisions we make in  respect to all areas of our activity. When an organisation shows how it  works, it is standing up for its values. These are essential to the  success of a sustainability project.

The in-house team that makes up this group is multi-disciplinary, with  representatives from the key practice areas of the firm.  26 : WE ADVOCATE SUSTAINABILITY Given the importance we give in placing the sustainability strategy in  the core of our activity, in 2011 we decided to institutionally reinforce  the working group by integrating it into the firms governance model  under the new name of Sustainability Committee and choosing a  partner to chair the Committee. Miguel Teixeira de Abreu, Founding  Partner and Chairman of the Board of Directors, holds this position.  His task is to guarantee an adequate implementation of the strategy  adopted by the firm. Abreu Advogados Sustainability Report was the first of its kind in  the legal sector. How was it received? It was an important step, one which we felt strongly about when we  decided to do it and this feeling grew to certainty as we began to  receive several positive opinions, after the publication of the Report.  For our Team Members this feedback was something to be proud of  since we had cleared the way in our line of activity. This initiative was  also well received by Clients and Partners who applauded our transparency. Overall, how do you see these two years of work towards  sustainability?  The first two years were the beginning of a long way to go. We  invested in sustainability actions related with our activity, developed  dialogue opportunities within the sector, stimulated an internal debate  on the subject and reinforced the relationships with our partners, in  terms of sustainability. It was a period of evolution and learning, during which we tried to direct  our efforts to what really matters holding an unshakeable belief: this is  an unavoidable path. Supervise the development of the activities and initiatives within the  sustainability project; Propose an action plan for the approved actions; Monitor and implement the action plan and the approved actions; Communicate, internally and externally, the strategy and the  actions developed by the firm under the sustainability project; Report to the head of sustainable development at the firm. Its mission is to: Maria Joo Teixeira de Abreu Head of the Sustainability Working Group and General Manager  WE ADVOCATE SUSTAINABILITY : 27 Knowing that an organisation wishes to abide by high standard  values, consciously aware that it is part of a society, a country and a  global world, is becoming ever more a basis for building the future.  The upheaval we have been witnessing is proof enough: we have to  build on solid ground. You have set up a Panel of External Stakeholders, which is a  rather uncommon involvement initiative in Portugal. What do you  have to say about this? As representatives of the stakeholders, this Panel has been extraordinarily  enriching for us. We must have an outside view if we really want to  make a difference, and in that sense the suggestions of the Panel are  very important to our strategy and to our continuous improvement.  Several interests are at stake in a society that is increasingly informed  and critical about what affects it. Understanding that imbalance in a  relationship may be either damaging or beneficial, bring both risks and  opportunities and generate more or less sustainability is the rationale  behind this initiative. What are the priorities of the Working Group to Sustainability for  the future, bearing in mind that we are living particularly difficult  times?  In a sustainability policy, we need to balance the three pillars: economic,  social and environmental. We are all being challenged to specifically  focus on the economic pillar, but it should not unbalance the other  two. Particularly because when you get down to it, in the long run, the  social and environmental impacts today will become economic  impacts tomorrow. Its not easy to discern what really matters in such  a troubled, fast moving and superficial world, and the future pressures  will not be any less than the current ones. We believe that the role of  sustainability is to raise awareness to these matters, with courage,  focus and transparency. Bearing this in mind, we have set the following priorities: 1) continue investing in dialogue and deep reflection with the stake- holders; 2) invest in what really matters; 3) work harder towards  aligning Abreu Advogados sustainability policy with its strategy;  4) change mentalities in order to change behaviours, inasmuch as  sustainable behaviours call for a change in direction: from linear to  systematic, from fragmented to complex and from independent to  interdependent; and lastly 5) find the balance between the various  interests, putting people at the heart of what we do.  28 : WE ADVOCATE SUSTAINABILITY How do you see the road travelled since the publication of the  first Sustainability Report?  The lesson that teaches us that every single endeavour begins with a  single first step is indeed true. In this case AB took off with a very big  first step. Which, while worthy of indisputable merit, also creates an  unavoidable obligation. So what I can say in regard to the road AB has  already travelled is that, so far, it has neither stopped nor lost its way. What would you say are the biggest challenges to overcome in  this line of activity?  In line with what has consistently been its practice in less troubled  times, the greatest challenge of all will be to maintain a holistic attitude  when faced with the various topics of its intervention in the sustainability  fields, by creating the conditions that will enable to remain faithful to  our commitment in these present times and in a near future despite the  many sacrifices we will be called to make. What is missing to make this line of activity sector more receptive  to give account of their work and to create corporate social  responsibility strategies (beyond pro bono legal services)? Only one thing is missing: will. Paulo Teixeira Pinto  Of-counsel with Abreu Advogados and  Quality Assurance Ombudsman When, back in 2008, we committed to having a sustainable structured  management, we decided to invite an external group of representatives  from several quadrants of our stakeholders to contribute with their  insight and reflection towards Abreu Advogados corporate social  responsibility strategy. They met with the internal sustainability working  group to analyse and comment the firms commitments and to evaluate  the content and quality of the sustainability reports. In February 2011, the second meeting took place, at which time an  assessment was made of the firms sustainability performance and  previous years commitments, and suggestions for the topics addressed  in this report were given. We believe that transparency and  sharing of ideas bring us closer to  what is relevant for our  stakeholders. AN OUTSIDE VIEW  WE ADVOCATE SUSTAINABILITY : 29 External Group for Sustainability 1.

Main conclusions and recommendations of the Panel of External Stakeholders ABs performance in sustainability has been very positive and differentiating but still reveals potential for  improvement. AB was a pioneer in this challenge and as such benefits from some advantages. AB should try to find out  the perception its stakeholders have of its performance in sustainability. This is a process that once started theres no stopping. The firm must know its DNA, emphasise that  culture and continue with the process. It was recommended that Team Members should have greater involvement in the sustainability strategy of  the firm, by encouraging and making them feel a part of it, particularly by requesting them to come up with  ideas. It was recommended that AB should have a clearer view of its sustainability strategy, directing it towards  business, the creation of value for the Client and the improvement of the Justice system itself. It was suggested that the next Sustainability Report should continue to be transparent, reporting some of  the difficulties experienced by the firm in this area. For the future it will be essential to define what sustainability represents for AB and to focus energies and  resources. Sustainability in the firms identity has to be objective and simple in order to convey the message clearly.  30 : WE ADVOCATE SUSTAINABILITY Comments on this Report Pedro Mendona The progress made since the publication of the first Sustainability Report is rich and enriching: AB  lives its values and was able to explore new paths. This Report is the chemical precipitation from the  progress made: vision and convictions, reflection and assessment, determination and objectives set. I  would highlight the work done to mobilise the Team Members: meets the firms DNA, enriches contents,  extends the number of players and may expand into the society in general the apostles who will be  preaching the good news. Its a moral duty to make the world a better place. Lus Barreto Xavier This report reflects Abreu Advogados commitment towards its Team Members, its Clients and the  Community. A large law firm that sees itself as an organisation whose inter-generational sustainability is  based on a current effort, particularly focused on quality (specifically human and professional quality and  of the governance system), openness (transparency, social responsibility) and environmental concerns.  It is worth noting the humanistic culture and the conciliation between professional demand and personal  achievement Henrique Pinto A high quality sustainability report is necessarily the report that is made in the name of Justice and not in  the name of the Law, as Justice, unlike the Law, according to the French philosopher, Jacques Derrida, is  not deconstructible. In this sense, the report will be more or less true depending on whether all voices were  heard, particularly the least obvious ones, and those that are so frequently beyond the ethical values and  standards of any society, group of clients or certification company. Thus, what I find most enriching in this  second sustainability report of Abreu Advogados is that, in addition to revealing greater sustainability than  in 2009, the orchestra that performs has larger and an increasing number of instruments and voices. The  point being that there is no truth in sustainability, if you dont say it of plurality.      Lus Rochartre Game changers is the expression that comes to my mind when I try to put into words my first impression of  ABs second sustainability report. The exercise of transparency and accountability of this report will remain a  national benchmark. If technical competence and economic performance are essential for a firm to succeed,  they are much more needed to ensure its continuity. Values and credibility make up the fundamental luggage  for a long journey and continued success, and its achievement depends as much on the organisation as on its  stakeholders. This report was subjected to a critical review by the External Group. Here is a summary of their opinions:  WE ADVOCATE SUSTAINABILITY : 31 Nuno guas The concision of the contents and the structure of the document, together with the clarity of the graphic  information presented make this report better than the first in terms of communication efficiency, resulting  in an even greater transparency. I first read the draft of this report in my computer in approximately half an hour, and immediately felt I  apprehended most of the information it conveyed, a fact I was able to confirm when, at a later stage, it  was discussed. This was the first time this has happened to me with such a comprehensive document. In turn, I was just left with an appetite to find out more about the Risk management System, hoping it  will happen in the future.   Antnio Carmona Rodrigues Abreu Advogados Sustainability Report is, in my opinion, a safe step towards maturity in the sustainable  activity which the firm so rightly decided to initiate. This maturity can be seen not only in the content but  also in the form, which is straightforward and objective. Furthermore, it seems apparent that the continued  efforts made by the firm and by its Team Members in this field are increasingly becoming part of the firms  DNA. As small notes of reflection for the future, and in regard to the energy spectrum of the firms activity, it  seems that the component for flight travel may have a certain potential for improvement, possibly by  making more use of the new communication technologies. Likewise, the energy consumption of the three offices may be improved after careful and detailed analysis  of the value of each item.  4 TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE  2009-2010 ADDED VALUE OUR CLIENTS UNDER A PARTNERSHIP PERSPECTIVE MANAGING TALENTS AB4ALL AB GOES GREEN  The Road to Sustainable Development  at Abreu Advogados AB grows from 185 to 229 Team Members In keeping with our growth strategy  policy — to remain within the top  Portuguese law frms — in January  of 2009 we integrated the largest  Law Firm in Madeira. Our total  Team Members grew  from 185 to 229 AB joins a  Partnership Initiative  against Corruption In 2009 AB joined 27 national  organisations in an initiative aimed  at alerting the business world  to the fght against corruption.  The adhesion to this global  initiative was achieved through  a letter to the United Nations  Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon AB wins the "Sustainable  Development Award 2010" Abreu Advogados' sustainability  policy received the Sustainable Development  Award 2010, from Portuguese-French  Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  This award aims to reward the adoption  of sustainability strategies by Portuguese  and French companies in the Portuguese  market, assessing them on their Environmental, Social and Economic  policies, and commitment towards  Innovation and Quality AB participates in a school  project of legal literacy AB joined the Forum Estudante magazine  in the project "Let Justice be Done",  to teach the students of Portuguese Secondary  Schools the fundamentals of law and justice.  Teachers the students of 84 Portuguese schools,  were taught by our Lawyers, and in the end,  mock trials were organised with the  help of district judges from several  cities where the schools were  located and held in relevant  courtrooms. Training Sessions  on Sustainability to all  AB Team Members Several awareness sessions took place throughout the year and in all three  ofces to all AB Team Members to raise awareness about sustainability  and to instigate moments of  refection and personal  development. 34 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010  AB in Pilot Test  for a sustainable  performance index AB was the only (Portuguese) law frm to  participate in a study on the suitability of an  index proposed by the Corporate  Sustainability Observatory, an initiative  promoted by BCSD (Business Council  for Sustainable Development) in Portugal.  With this index, this BCSD   aims to analyse the sustainable  development of its members AB increases its  billing by 33 per cent Despite the worsening of 2008  economic and fnancial situation,  AB's billing increased by 33  per cent in relation  to 2009 AB invited an external group of the  main stakeholders to contribute with their  critical opinion and analysis towards  the improvement of the CSRs strategy.  The frst meeting was characterised  by an enriching and open  dialogue and  very positive  suggestions AB performance  assessed by Sustainability  External Group Towards an  improved environmental  performance in the ofces AB committed to a strategy of carbon  emissions neutrality with the aim of  evaluating the three ofces' carbon  footprint and taking action towards  energy efciency. By joining the  e)mission neutral certifcation the  frm commits to ofsetting all  inevitable emissions  by 2012. Abreu Advogados  launches Children's Book  on Legal Literacy In order to start sowing the seeds for a  responsible citizenship, AB invested in  writing a book, where the basic principles of  justice and the functioning of society are  explained in a very reader friendly and  entertaining way. The Book was distributed  on the International Childrens Day  in an exclusive edition of the  Portuguese newspaper  Dirio Econmico. Members of CAIS  have access to periodic free legal advice Given the increasing need for  legal advice by the benefciaries of CAIS Association, and under  the protocol signed between both  institutions, AB started providing  pro bono legal assistance  on a fortnightly basis. Conference on practice of  law, clients and sustainability AB, in co-operation with BCSD Portugal  and GCI, hosted an innovative conference  entitled "Sustainability: The Challenge to its  Reputability" in which leaders of the  entrepreneurial and legal communities  debated the contribution of legal  consultants towards corporate  sustainability, fostering  dialogue among  stakeholders.

ADDED VALUE Despite the global recession that started at the end of 2008, in 2009 we integrated the largest law firm in  Madeira. We invested in areas we feel represent an added value to our Clients, we created new products and  new services, offsetting for the loss of market share in other areas and adapted to the markets new demands.  As a result, in 2010, we were able to maintain virtually the same turnover as in 2009, i.e. 33% above the 2008  turnover. As a result of our growth and the need to compensate for impairment losses, by reinforcing the provision for  doubtful Clients, the total operating expenses increased by 41% since 2008. Turnover Expenses Bearing in mind the difficult  period of crisis were going  through, we need a very efficient  allocation of resources to  achieve productivity and  efficiency gains which in turn  will ensure economic and  financial sustainability. Miguel Castro Pereira Managing Partner Portugal was confronted with recession combined with the lack of liquidity of the market and a worsening of  the public deficit, situations which have also affected Abreu Advogados. As a result of these external  factors, in 2010 the firms net profit declined. Consequently, and in line with what is happening in the corporate  sector, internal measures were immediately reinforced in order to cut down on costs and increase our levels  of productivity and cost effectiveness, so that we may overcome as best we can the effects of this adverse  economic situation. Financial Results  TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 37 We provide a high quality service to our Clients while maintaining strict  ethical standards. We are committed to providing accurate, accommodating  and innovative solutions to our Clients. We regularly host seminars and  training sessions for Clients and publish articles, sharing our expertise  in different fields of the law to assist our Clients in adopting best  practices and in managing their risk in a more efficient manner.  Furthermore, we have an extranet facility for our Clients in the Debt  Recovery Department, providing them direct access to their files. OUR CLIENTS AS OUR PARTNERS Our Clients profile Diagnostic of Clients Satisfaction - Listen to improve Abreu Advogados Client portfolio includes some of the largest  Portuguese companies and multinational companies operating in  Portugal, in very different sectors, as shown in the graph. Fulfilling the commitment undertaken in our first sustainability report  and in line with our goal, we continue to invest daily in Client  satisfaction. Obtaining feedback from our Clients is an ongoing project, one which  is of the utmost importance to the firm. The process through which we  measure and gauge Client satisfaction is, we believe, one of the best  means of monitoring the provision of our services, inasmuch as it gives  us structured and comparative information on the Clients real needs  and expectations. Based on this information we are able to take action  to improve the quality of our services. The mechanism we use to gauge Client satisfaction is based on: Annual Service Quality Survey; Compliments and Complaints. Turnover  by activity Telecommunications, Media and Technology Services and Others Construction and Real Estate Health State / Public Entities Chemical Products and its Derivatives Consumer Products and Retail Private Clients Financial Institutions Infrastructures and Transports Automotive Industry Industry Hotels and Leisure Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries 3% 7% 7% 7   1% 3% 17% 10% 8% 3% 3% 6% 11% 9% 4%  2010 Global results Annual Service Quality Survey Comparative analysis of the evaluation assessment of all the  parameters: By activity Survey parameters Our proposal for legal services Adequacy of the proposal to the Client's needs Articulation with the reality and Client's methods Service provided Quality of the documents provided  / Clarity and accuracy of the information provided Professional ability Perception of Client's needs Availability Initiative Professional and personal attitude Quality / Efciency of solutions provided Overall satisfaction with services rendered Index of the Results Questionnaires sent Responses received Responses received Questionnaires sent 38 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 Annual Service Quality Survey Listening to our Clients on a regular basis has been a most effective  means of monitoring the service being provided and gives us other  type of elements which can be useful in creating opportunities for future  work, allowing us to make a distinction between Clients real needs  and wishes. Furthermore, we are convinced that the use of an online form, sent  via our website, is a good way to receive feedback from our Clients  as some of them feel more at ease and comfortable to express their  opinions. The evaluation scale varies  from NA (Not Applicable),  1 (Unsatisfactory), 2 (Satisfactory),  3 (Good), 4 (Very Good) and 5  (Excellent).  TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 39 Questionnaires were sent to a sample of approximately 8% of the firms active Clients, including Clients who  have submitted complaints in the previous year. The average level of satisfaction for both years was 4.27 (on a scale from 1 to 5, 5 being excellent), an  indicative result that our services meet the high expectations of our Clients.  We were particularly pleased with the positive assessment given by the Clients to our professional and  personal attitude, to professional ability and quality of documents produced / clarity and accuracy of  information provided. We will continue working to improve the parameters that were not quite so highly assessed, as initiative, our  proposal for legal services and adequacy of the proposal to the Clients needs. In the 2010 survey, we decided to also obtain our Clients opinion on our sustainability policy. 33% of the  Clients feel that it is important for the firm to have a sustainability policy and 6% congratulated the firm for its  first sustainability report. Compliments  We keep in our Quality Management System a record of the compliments/spontaneous demonstrations of  satisfaction with the firms performance.  We decided to include this result in the annual performance review of our Lawyers and Of-Counsels. Complaints  We keep a record of all Clients complaints since 2001 after our first ISO 9001 Quality Management System  accreditation. We consider this to be essential in the management of the relationship with our Clients. In 2009/2010 we received a few complaints from Clients, mainly related to the following: Fees;  Response time;   Failure to send documentation: invoices/receipts;  Failure to comply with deadline agreed with the Client; Client follow-up;  Legal solution provided.  In the light of the feedback received it is important that we continue to work in this area and adjust our services  to accommodate each Clients needs.  40 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 One of the commitments of improvement already taken is the  develo-pment of a Client Relationship Management (CRM) strategy  to develop a closer relationship with Clients, reinforcing the necessary  skills to ensure their involvement and loyalty. At the service of the sustainability of the Clients business How can legal consultancy contribute towards Clients reputation and  risk reduction? This matter is becoming more important as the context  where companies operate becomes more complex as a result of global  competitiveness and, more recently, of the economic upheaval. To encourage dialogue around this topic with Clients and the legal  sector Abreu Advogados hosted together with BCSD Portugal,  supported by GCI and Inspire, a conference entitled Sustainability:  The Challenge to its Reputability. The speakers debated the sustainability challenges companies are  facing and the contribution that legal consultants may bring towards a  sustainable growth. How can the Conference Sustainability: The Challenge to its  Reputability contribute to a reflection on the change of vision  companies are being called upon to do?  This conference dealt with some issues which are different from other  similar events as, to begin with, it would not have been obvious for a  law firm to launch a debate on the subject and this was quite innovative.  Furthermore, it was most important and unique in the launching of the  issue of reputation, which is a very serious and sensitive one, as some  known examples attest. In your opinion, what contribution can the legal sector bring to  the sustainable growth of companies? The Law is an activity sector where there are quite a few individual  practitioners. Consequently, the very concept of owning an entrepreneurial  activity is relatively new and this might have led to raising awareness  about sustainable development. I believe there are two fundamental  lines of thought: on the one hand, and from an internal perspective,  a law firm is in essence a company like any other, to which social  responsibility concepts apply.  Francisco Snchez  Chairman of the Board of Directors  of Efacec Keynote Speaker at the Conference  TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 41 On the other hand there is the external dimension of the service provided  to the Client, where there are two aspects which may significantly  contribute towards sustainable development. Companies need to  establish and promote desirable behaviours, through codes of conduct  or ethics. In this context, law firms may make a strong contribution to  the development of this type of tools. The other aspect: has to do with  the fact that sustainable development actions almost always begin with  the launching of a good practice. They then become more widespread  and in some cases may even end up in a legal imposition. This is yet  another perspective in which a law firm could play a proactive role  by assisting their Clients in drawing up internal regulation for their  companies. These two lines of thought lead to the conclusion that  the role of lawyers is obviously difficult to replace. With your long career and experience, how would you assess  the performance of Portuguese companies as they steer toward  sustainability?  I find that the evolution is quite positive and already a considerable  one. From one year to another it is possible not to feel any significant  evolution, but the accumulated results, if we consider several years,  are quite relevant. My feeling is that people and organisations have  developed a more structured reasoning, their approach became more  professional. Sustainability Reports have helped to address topics  that before did not come up for discussion. As such, I believe we have  taken on the challenge. And now, the consolidation of these concepts  will depend on the implementation of the decisions. To what extent can the Conference Sustainability: The Challenge  to its Reputability contribute to the reflection on the change  of vision on what is being asked from law firms and on the role  companies play in demanding this change, in order to move  toward sustainable development? I believe this was a major step and its a pity so few initiatives bring  people to such reflection. Unfortunately, the legal community in Portugal  is still out of touch with the issue of sustainability and I believe that if  companies as clients demand a paradigm shift from their law firms, the  (necessary) change will eventually occur more rapidly.  Margarida Couto  Lawyer, Partner of Vieira de Almeida &  Associados The speakers at the Conference  were distinguished business- men (Paulo Pereira da Silva,  from Renova; Jos Morgado,  from Inapa and Jos Joaquim  Oliveira from IBP Portugal)  and lawyers (Joo Rosado  Correia, from Garrigues; Luis  Pais Antunes from PLMJ and  Margarida Couto from Vieira  de Almeida & Associados). The  keynote speaker was Francisco  Snchez, chairman of the Board  of Directors of Efacec and  former president of EDP.  42 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 There is a growing consensus that law firms need to know their  Clients social responsibility context. With this in mind, how do  you feel legal consultants can best contribute towards promoting  their Clients social responsibility? By developing corporate social responsibility in a wide range of topics (such  as environmental responsibility, waste management, carbon market, fair  trade and sustainable procurement, ethic codes and anti-corruption rules,  privacy protection, etc.), which involve an important legal component, I  believe lawyers can have a very important role in strengthening their  Clients social responsibility practices, for instance, by identifying risk and  opportunities.   Where do we stand today? What are your hopes for the future?  I believe Portugal still has a long way to go and its still far behind  international best practices, and we all have a responsibility to  contribute to a change. Except for the large companies, which are  already follo-wing best practices, and some smaller companies that  have already fully understood the importance of this matter, its still  not a topic to which companies in general (including law firms) give  the importance it deserves. The demand for high standards of conduct Many of our Clients already have adopted sound sustainability policies  that include supplier selection processes based on social, economic  and environmental development criteria. Consequently, we are increasingly  being invited to present our approach on social responsibility. One of  the questions we are asked, mostly by international Clients, is on  our policy to fight corruption. This topic becomes even more relevant  as the scope, from a geographic point of view, of a law firms global  work increases.  We believe this issue involves an acting principle, in itself decisive  to promote sustainability, relating to the decision to work in certain  countries which, under the terms defined by the United Nations or by  Transparency International (global civil society organisation leading the  fight against corruption), have a high level of corruption. At AB, we feel that co-operation in this context through ethical business  practices, is educational and proves it is possible to attain results with  transparency and integrity.  TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 43 Following our commitment in 2009 to the 10 principles of UN Global  Compact, in 2010, Abreu Advogados together with more than 30  companies and other Portuguese business entities joined the Partnership  Against Corruption Initiative (PACI), and was one of the signatories of  a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the fight  against corruption. In this appeal, we encourage a more ethical  beha-viour in investments and in business competition. In this initiative you appeal to a more effective action in the fight  against corruption. In your opinion, what are the priorities? Before answering your question, I would like to put this issue in  an international perspective. Transparency International, through  Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) — an annual publication that  ranks 178 countries around the world by their perceived levels of  corruption — puts Portugal in 32nd place worldwide, with a CPI  score of 6 (on a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (highly clean) and  in nineteenth place in Europe. If we compare only the 13 countries in  the Euro zone, Portugal is ranked eleventh, ahead only of Italy (ranked  twelfth with a CPI of 3.9) and Greece (ranked thirteenth, with a CPI of  3.5). Looking at these numbers it is obvious that Portugal needs to be  more effective in the fight against corruption. As far as the legal sector is concerned, the top priority must be to  expedite and streamline legal proceedings, particularly criminal  procee-dings, where the dragging of cases and prescription of  crimes, which sometimes end up being the case, creates a sense of  impunity that needs to be tackled. Given that corruption is a great obstacle to sustainable  development, what can legal consultants do to reduce corruption,  bearing in mind their role in the context of legislation, regulation,  drawing up of contracts, litigation, etc.?  Criminal investigation is exclusively vested in the Public Prosecution  Office, whereas the fight against corruption rests with the criminal  police, within the scope of the powers delegated by the Public  Prosecution Office. Lawyers, as players of the Justice sector, should  seek to create clear laws that promote private enterprise, and strive to  reduce State red tape. Pedro Pais de Almeida  Partner and Member of the Executive  Committee of Abreu Advogados Partnership against Corruption  44 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 MANAGING TALENTS People are at the forefront of our business. Their commitment, knowledge  and creativity are the main assets of the Firm and guarantee the excellence  of the work we provide our Clients. Integrating and retaining the best  professionals and creating conditions for professional and personal  achievement are our top priorities. Career Plan;  Training Programme;  Management system and performance assessment;  Team Spirit;  Policy that promotes a balance between professional and  personal time. Our people management policy is based on five pillars: Our annual trainee recruitment policy follows a very simple strategy:  we want to recruit the future partners of Abreu Advogados. The  identification and attraction of talents, their hiring, training and  overseeing are therefore fundamental. At Abreu Advogados, professionals are recruited under criteria of merit  and non-discrimination, in particular on the basis of age, gender, race,  religion or disability. Since 2009, with the aim of improving the human resources management  policy, we implemented some measures of which we highlight the  following: We set up an annual mechanism to gauge employee satisfaction; We implemented internal communication and awareness measures  to reinforce our institutional identity and culture; We set up a career plan for our administrative staff, to accommodate  the needs of the firm and the expectations of the employees. Portugal has taken a few significant steps in this direction, for instance,  through some of the initiatives contained in the SIMPLEX programme,  which also constitute ways of fighting corruption, inasmuch as they  considerably reduce red tape. Even so, there is a lot of work still to be  done, especially to expedite legal proceedings.

In 2009, we had an outstanding level of participation: 76%. However, in 2010 this percentage fell to 48%. This  difference will lead us to make an additional effort in raising the Teams awareness to the importance of this  evaluating instrument toward the improvement of the human resources policy. The questionnaire is made up of 27 parameters, rated on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).  In order to allow for a general reading of results, we selected the seven parameters with the highest and lowest levels of satisfaction. Overall, the results show that the Team made a positive evaluation of  the firms performance, meaning that we managed to meet their  expectations. The increase in satisfaction from one year to the next  also reflects that we were able to adjust some aspects of our human  capital management practices. Global Level  46 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 Reinforce our identity and sense of belonging Gauging our perception of sustainability  We believe that the sharing of common values by all employees is what distinguishes and strengthens an  Institution. At Abreu Advogados we are particularly attentive to the promotion of cohesion and common identity  and culture, since these aspects of behavioural context need to be anchored in order to put down roots. In view of the exponential growth of the firm in these past two years, the management of the corporate identity  became more difficult, calling for the need to reinforce some measures of communication and involvement  measures, particularly the following: In order to gauge the level of perception and involvement of the Team, we  decided to include two aspects related to Abreu Advogados sustainability  policy in our diagnostic parameters. Said parameters were very positively  evaluated, registering an increase from 2009 to 2010, which we believe  were the result of several awareness-raising actions undertaken following  our commitment in the first sustainability report.  The top ranked parameters, notably, pride in being part of the team  and motivation to help to create success, are in our opinion most  important criteria for the sustainability of an organisation. These results  show that the efforts we have put into the institutional philosophy and  the attention paid to the people paid off and that we are moving in the  right direction. The aspects that were rated less positively were adjusted from 2009 to  2010 and in six of the seven parameters the satisfaction level increased.  Although not reaching the levels we consider to be satisfactory, we are  also aware of the fact that in organisations in general these parameters  are usually the ones that have the lowest ranking. The fact that we  have a management and performance evaluation system, a training  policy and benefits that allow for a greater balance between career  and personal life, demonstrate our concern in ensuring that our  Team Members enjoy the best conditions in which to conduct their  professional activity. Higher satisfaction level Lower satisfaction level In-house training on sustainability; Reinforcement of internal values and organisational culture.  TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 47 In-house training on sustainability Testimonials of those who attended It all began with a small fish being left on the desk of each Team Member  with the following message: Save your golden fish! The solving of the  enigma and the search for an aquarium no one knew existed were the  expected reactions to this teaser that invited people to participate in  an in-house training on sustainability. This training was developed in  collaboration with the Instituto do Empreendorismo Social (Institute for  Social Entrepreneurship), given their know-how on sustainability, and  was attended by Team Members from our three offices. Amongst the concepts that were transmitted in these sessions,  particular emphasis was placed on the notion that the imperative  of sustai-nability lies on individual responsibility and that we should  value the pursuit of affection and happiness — in detriment of more  economics-based options - as the ground for the construction of a  better world. These training sessions have contributed to deepen the concept of  sustainability in itself and to foster the sense of belonging to AB as an  institutional project that aims to contribute, through each and every  Team Member, to becoming a better firm in all aspects of its activities. In-house awareness-raising is  a challenge of sustainability Miguel Castro Pereira Managing Partner  3 Sessions in the Lisbon, Oporto  and Madeira offices, 94 Team  Members Q1: Did the training session make you more aware of the challenges  sustainability places on the organisations and on each one of us?

We were able to open up peoples mentalities. I understood that  sustainability is also very important for our children and grand children. A2: Here we have an excellent working philosophy, of humanism. We had a  sustai-nability campaign with little fishes. Everyone got a fish and the aim of the  campaign was to find out to what extent people would feel responsible for its care.  Generally, everyone put the fish in an aquarium bought for the purpose, which  at first no one knew already existed. This parable led us to the question of  sustainability and made us more aware of the underlying responsibility. A2: Abreu Advogados is following a more general responsibility path, which includes  environmental initiatives, as the ecological footprint diagnostic. This is obviously not  an easy path, and the fact that we are going through a financial crisis doesnt help.  We notice, for instance, a certain degree of instability and that people are having  more problems in running their lives. But I feel that our Human Resources will find a  way to deal with issues of sustainability. Ana Paula Paiva  Secretary, Lisbon A1: Not completely. The training session made people reflect whether the lives they  have are the most adequate one or they should consider undergoing a profound  change, giving work a more secondary role. As interesting as this session may  have been my expectations were more related to sustainability under a corporate  perspective and not to sustainability under a personal perspective. A2: I believe the initiatives the firm has been developing are the right ones and  have been very efficient. Ive had a very positive feedback of most of the initiatives,  mainly Justice for All and the childrens book. I think in future we should continue  working on projects that bring visibility to the firm. Nuno Barbosa  Partner, Oporto A1: There was a particular episode that left quite an impression on me. From  the concept of sustainability in its relation with the human aspect: I particularly  remember the following: not to neglect interaction with people, with family, despite  our professional work. We were asked a series of questions and one of them was:  How long has it been since you last spoke to your grand parents? This question  stayed on my mind and when I got home, I found myself compelled to call my  grandmo-ther. Her response was a sign for me. As it had been a while since I had  last called her, she asked me Is something wrong? This unsettled me. Knowing  that Abreu Advogados was intervening in the projects Let Justice be Done and  Learning to Take Action, I made myself available. This decision was undoubtedly  influenced by the training sessions. Andr Rijo  Associate Lawyer, Lisbon  TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 49 A1: Yes. One of the challenges companies are facing is that of improving the social  and environmental impacts, in order to increase competitiveness, and opening the  door to new business opportunities with clients who are looking for ecologically  concerned suppliers. By contributing towards sustainability, Abreu Advogados will  also take advantage from these opportunities, inasmuch as people are increasingly  concerned about the environment and society and tend to choose partners who  share the same concern. A2: By investing in the Team Members, by providing training that proves to be  worthwhile both to the firm and individuals, by supporting a good cause and  encou-raging its employees to participate in local volunteer activities, Abreu  Advogados is contributing to Sustainability. Ecologically speaking, there is great  concern in recycling paper and toner cartridges and reducing paper consumption. Patrcia Pires Bernardo  Secretary, Oporto A1: Abreu Advogados contributes by accepting and reacting favourably to  employees needs and requests in this area. Also the training sessions in this area. A1: I believe that the concept of sustainability is a fundamental basis to makes us  stand out and differentiate from our competitors. A2: We are all aware of the need to balance our family and personal life with our  professional life. However, the training given, with a practical vision and the force of  a personal testimony, gives great strength to the personal decision to take this issue  into consideration. A2: I view its path as a very positive one, inasmuch as Abreu Advogados continues  to invest in quality improvement, meeting Clients demands with speed and  efficiency, continuing to grow in a solid and sustained way. Paula Silva  Receptionist, Madeira Paulo Gouveia e Silva  Partner, Madeira  50 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 Reinforcing internal values and culture - The Book of Principles Due to the recession, these are atypical times for most organisations  and Abreu Advogados is no exception. Several financial measures had  to be implemented in order to ensure sufficient robustness to face the  different risks, such as the lack of liquidity resulting from outstanding  payments from Clients or the expected continuation of the markets  contraction. This context, along with the increase of the firms  dimension, calls for another type of robustness – that of the common  identity, of the values. Although the results of the satisfaction surveys showed a strong sense  of belonging to this project, we believe it is important to strengthen this  institutional spirit. Among several initiatives, we highlight the creation of a Book of  Principles that embodies the values, the culture and the governance  model of Abreu Advogados, to which all Team Members were invited to  adhere. Purposely, we did not opt for a compulsory registration, which  is standard procedure with codes of conduct. With the Book of  Principles the purpose was to explain each concept and to give an  easy to understand content to each chosen word used in principles in a  way that is easy to comprehend and apprehend. Times of crisis are ideal to  understand what does and what  does not sustain a business  organisation. The Book of  Principles aims to ensure that  everyone works towards a  common goal, making the  Institution grow. This aspect is part of the firms  sustainability, because I believe  an organisation cannot depend  on one, two or three people  or even a generation. The  generation that follows must,  in the least, be as qualified as  the one that preceded it. Miguel Teixeira de Abreu Chairman of the Board of  Directors The whole is greater than  the sum of its parts. A transparent career plan  helps to attract and retain  professionals. A career plan for the administrative area A career plan for the administrative staff is being set up, according to  which everyone will know the professional path within their functions  and the career opportunities that are available to them. This is the  result of an important objective of global consolidation of the human  resources structure, since until now professional evolution was only  systematised for Lawyers. Information and awareness-raising sessions are being planned for all  the Administrative Staff on the functioning of the career plan.  TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 51 Creating a structured policy of pro bono legal services and of the  global community service; Raising awareness among youth on Justice and Citizenship.  AB FOR THE COMMUNITY As a result of the commitments undertaken in the first sustainability  report, our contribution to the community, which began long ago, is  centred on two great objectives: Creating a structured policy of community support - AB4ALL Since 1996, ABs Lawyers have been assisting social solidarity institutions  pro bono. Considering the extent of this support (more than 4500 hours  of volunteer work in 2007 and 2008), AB decided to structure these  initiatives under a common and global project, as a functioning internal  network, which would also include the Administrative Staff. Giving preference to the development of this project in an engaged  way, we set up an enlarged committee responsible for the conception  of the project, which was later replaced by a smaller committee that  guaranteed its execution. AB4ALL was the name which was given  to this committee as a result of an open vote to all Team Members,  through the firms intranet. As part of the AB4ALL programme, the partnerships with the Academia  dos Champs, CAIS and Instituto de Empreendorismo Social are  particularly relevant. Abreu Advogados is one of Academia dos Champs founding  associates because it strongly believes in its social project, and has  ever since been rendering the legal services necessary to the fulfilment  of its objectives. Pro bono legal services Protocols signed with Academia dos Champs, Cais and Instituto de  Empreendorismo Social  Abreu Advogados, when  requested to do so, continues to  provide legal assistance to several  entities, such as:  Academia dos Champs;  Associao Passo a Passo;  Ferno Ferro Parish; Fundao Alter Real;  ANDC - Microcredit;  BCSD Portugal;  IES – Instituto de  Empreendorismo Social  and CAIS Association. Likewise, we continue to respond  to all the individual situations we  deem special. Numbers of pro bono legal  services in 2009-2010 117 lawyers 3196 hours of work The practice of law is a  profession which, in itself,  gives an important contribution  in tackling one of the problems  Portuguese society is facing:  the difficulty in accessing  justice by a large proportion of  the population.  52 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 What impact do you think this regular support will have on the  beneficiaries of CAIS? First and foremost, I hope it will bring people closer to justice which is  often so distant and expensive, and that they may, through this regular  assistance, learn to trust it more. Furthermore, I hope that doing or  abiding by what is legally correct will contribute towards a significant  improvement in the living conditions of those who, being extremely  poor and fragile, find themselves deprived of their duties and rights or  of an active role in society. As you know, this free legal advice partnership with CAIS is  particularly important within AB4ALL. How do see the joint work  done so far and what are your expectations for the future? Beginnings are always difficult. Sometimes its not easy to conciliate  the wait which is essential for rebuilding lives and the hurry of what is  valuably calculated per second. But were on the right track. My wish  at this present future is that when faced with lives that have no value,  clients wont give up on themselves and lawyers wont give up on their  clients and that both manage to find room for learning and sharing. www.academiadoschamps.org The Academia dos Champs aims to guarantee, through sports,  temporary or permanent supervision of children considered at risk  or living under unfavourable socioeconomic conditions, taking into  account their physical, intellectual and emotional needs, while  promoting the childs reintegration in society, through training  sessions, tournaments, travelling and possible inclusion in trainers  courses, allowing them to develop a sport-related professional activity  or otherwise related with the Association. The long-standing partnership with CAIS was reinforced by the setting  up of periodic (fortnightly) free lawyer consultation service to its  members, as a result of the success and the needs which emerged  from the Free legal advice day, held annually on the initiative of the  Portuguese Bar Association to which Abreu Advogados also adhered. Henrique Pinto  Executive Director of CAIS  TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 53 In regards to the IES project, Abreu Advogados provides legal training  to their employees and supports several of its entrepreneurship projects  and, in return, the Institute offers training sessions on sustainability –  three of which took place in 2010 – to all our Team Members. What type of legal services does IES need and what has been  Abreu Advogados contribution in this regard? IES needs legal assistance to draw up the Protocols that govern our  relationships, to manage our human resources matters and to  adjust our legal structure to meet the challenges of growth. In all of this  we have had Abreu Advogados full and active support in all matters  involved. In some specific cases they have also assisted throughout  the implementation of good practices we support on the ground. This  assistance is integrated in our Expert Consultations programme, that  is, the clarification of specific legal and tax queries, arising from the  initiatives with a strong social impact which we support and which  Abreu Advogados has always available to clarify. What do you think is the result of this project and what are your  expectations for the future?  Having Abreu Advogados lawyers as members of IES has been a  most gratifying experience. We hope itll continue to grow and bear  fruit, both with us and with the initiatives we work for. Numbers of the project 81 secondary schools 1600 students 60 tutor-lawyers 377 hours volunteer work School Project Let Justice be Done. Raising awareness among youth on Justice and Citizenship In 2010, AB joined the Forum Estudante magazine in the project Let  Justice be Done, undertaking to bring awareness to the students of  Portuguese Secondary Schools of the fundamentals of law and justice. The project consisted in the preparation of the simulation of a court  trial, in which students analysed a specific case which dealt with youth  related themes, such as bullying, car accidents, social networks,  violence in a relationship and graffiti. Each case was assisted by a  tutor-lawyer from Abreu Advogados, responsible for helping the teacher  and the students during the preparation stage, from the beginning of  the school year until the simulation day with particular emphasis on the  defences and prosecutors arguments. The cases of role play game  reached their final stages and were tried in the local Court House. Miguel Alves Martins  Executive Director of IES   54 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 Childrens Book on Legal Literacy In order to start sowing the seeds for a responsible citizenship, AB  published a book childrens, which explains with funny and provocative  questions, why laws exist, who makes these laws and who follows  them. The book was symbolically launched on the 2010 International  Childrens Day, and 25000 copies were distributed free of charge in an  exclusive edition of Diario Econmico, a Portuguese daily newspaper,  our partner in this initiative. Likewise, these books were also offered to  our Team Members and Clients. Given the fact that the approach of this subject with the children was  quite innovative in Portugal, the book was also donated to some  schools and libraries that contacted us and were interested in using it  to raise childrens awareness about citizenship. What was the importance of Abreu Advogados contribution  towards the school project Let Justice be Done?  It was absolutely essential. Always there from the very start, Abreu  Advogados contribution was crucial in defining the project model, in the  production and in the validation of the cases and texts for the project Let  Justice be Done. The tutor-lawyers, in a very generous and dedicated  manner, assisted each one of the teachers heading the project in the  development of their working programme. This way the teachers  abilities were complemented by the lawyers abilities. The teachers  repeated compliments to the skill and enthusiasm of Abreu Advogados  lawyers were recurrent. This contribution was even more outstanding if  you think that the schools involved were from all over the country, with  different socio-economic backgrounds, which required from the  tutor-lawyers a great capacity to adapt. Abreu Advogados is  undoubtedly linked to the success of this innovative initiative. AB – What do you expect to accomplish through this project?  The Let Justice be Done Programme is a pioneer intervention in  Portugal as far as the civic education of the fundamentals of law and  justice for young students is concerned. Seeking to give a contribution  – however minimal – to solving the crisis in justice, by training better  informed and more knowledgeable future citizens, this initiative involved  a strong partnership, boosted by Forum Estudante magazine, and under  the patronage of the President of the Republic. Rui Marques  Director of the Forum Estudante  Magazine  TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 55 The project in numbers 24 Team Members 200 hours of volunteer work 480 students of elementary  schools School Project How does this Work? Learning to Take Action Project Abreu Advogados organized its first initiative of support and professional  guidance to final year student groups. With this project, we aimed to show  pre-university students how a law firm works and how the actual  practice of the law is done, whilst encouraging juridical literacy. During  a week, a group of students from a secondary school visited Abreu  Advogados every afternoon and were accompanied by the heads of  the several practice areas of the firm, in a direct and daily contact with  the firms routine. We participated in the school programme Learning to Take Action   hosted by the Portuguese Junior Achievement Association that aims  to develop the entrepreneurial spirit within the younger generations,  enabling all Team Members to offer work hours to the students of the  schools that adhered to the project, sharing their professional and life  experiences and instil learning values and personal development. Alexandra Courela,  Associate Lawyer with AB This projects main impact was that I feel it made me grow as a person  and that I accomplished something. For 90 minutes during 6 days, I was  transported to the reality of a problematic school, in precarious premises, with  difficult adolescent students, as they are called, and many other stereotypes  we are used to hear about. It was this contact with a completely new world, a  world where I encountered dedicated and committed teachers, teenagers  fighting against fate and anxious to challenge the odds citizens with  a sense of justice learnt the hard way. What I tried to convey them was that  they had to continue dreaming and believing – that being a lawyer, a doctor, a  journalist or a football player was in their hands and all it is needed is work. I  hope one of them believed in me – I believe in them. Ndia Fonseca,  Human Resources Department As I work in the firms Human Resources Department, I hoped to have set an  example, as we truly value social responsibility. It is something we emphasize  in our welcoming speech whenever a new Team Member is hired. I believe  AB also set the example of being responsible towards both the society and  the Team Members, by allowing Team Members to offer company time to this  project. This type of project is a part of ABs culture.   56 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 One of the greatest impacts of our activity is the amount of electricity we  consume, the home-workplace travels and business travels, which are  the main generators of greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, we  decided to take responsibility for this impact on the climate. Our greatest investment in this respect was to devise in cooperation with  e)mission, a carbon emission reduction strategy whereby we commit to  measure, reduce and, in the future, offset the carbon footprint. Carbon emissions neutralisation Project In our first Sustainability Report, we committed to improving the  environmental performance of our offices. In addition to our 3 Rs + S  policy – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Shred, we wish to go further in  environmental management. We undertook to assess the impact of our  activity on the environment, and take, in a more systematised way, the  necessary action to reduce pollution factors. AB GOES GREEN Abreu Advogados signed a cooperation protocol with Casa da Amrica  Latina (Latin America House), undertaking to provide six-month legal  training on an annual basis to a law graduate student from a Latin- American university. The firm will define the training programme, provide trainers and  working space, and oversee the trainees performance keeping in mind  their professional integration. The agreement also includes a  scholarship fund throughout the duration of the training period. This  protocol was signed in 2010 and aims to straighten the ties with the  members countries of the association and to promote Portuguese Law  and Portuguese practice of law. Legal Training Initiatives Protocol signed with Latin America House for legal training   Carbon Footprint Air Travels In tCO2e Emissions/Source Per Team Member Water Electricity Car Travels  Daily mobility Home-Work-Home Train Travels Paper and  Toner Cartridges TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 57 Measure Three of the primary sources  of emission were energy  consumption, business travel  – mostly by air – followed by  home-office-home travel. Overall, our carbon footprint reduced by 9%, due to a significant  improvement in the electricity emission factor by EDP (Portuguese  power utility), as a result of an increase in the production of  renewable energies in Portugal (reduction by  33% of emissions  amounts, from 341g CO2/kWh in 2009 to 230g CO2/kWh in 2010).  Although we consumed 1% more electricity, with this emission  reduction at source, we emitted less 32% of CO2. Energy Consumption  Carbon Footprint per mobility tCO2e/Team Member per office Oporto 0.65 Lisbon 0.54 Madeira 0.28 58 : TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 There was a 29% per cubic meter reduction in water consumption, but  overall our carbon footprint increased by 133%. This was due to an  update of the emission factor from one year to the other. In 2009, the  factor only took into account the emissions from drinking water supply  (0,93kgCO2/m3), whereas in 2010, wastewater impact was also  measured (totalling 3,03kgCO2/m3). By applying an estimate for 2009 to wastewater emissions, we would  have produced 7.8 tons of CO2 which, compared to 2010 levels, would  still account for a 29% emission reduction. Water Consumption Based on an online survey with 121 responses, we were able to  assess the firms mobility per office. We concluded that the  emissions per capita were lower in Madeira, due to the substantially  closer distances travelled between home and work, when compared to  the Lisbon and Oporto offices.  In Lisbon, the average is lower than in Oporto, due to a greater use of  public transport, possibly because there is a larger network. Team Members Mobility As far as professional travelling is concerned, the opening of an office  in Madeira contributed to a significant increase in inter-office travelling.  Furthermore, in 2009, the need to bring people from the three offices  closer to ABs culture led to the creation of an inter-office exchange  programme, which increased air travel and consequently our carbon  footprint. Also worth a mention is the fact that the strategic association  with a Mozambican law firm Ferreira Rocha & Associados, in 2010,  also led to an increase in air travel. Professional Travelling Despite having made a remarkable effort in reducing paper use in 2007  and 2008, in the past two years we registered an increase in overall  consumption. On the one hand, this was due to the opening of the  Madeira office and, on the other hand, to the provision of legal services  which implies an intensive use of paper as in the case of Due Diligences  and Debt Collection. It is worth mentioning that there are internal factors related with an  efficient use of resources by Team Members which can be controlled  by Abreu Advogados, while there are external factors which vary  according to the type of work being done, and procedures associated  therewith, which are far more difficult to manage and control. Paper Consumption  Carbon footprint per area (per square metre) tCO2e/Team Member per Team  Member per area TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE 2009-2010 : 59 With e)missions assistance we created performance indicators, per  Team Member and per square metre, to provide a comparative  analysis of the offices. Electricity and water performance indicators were calculated for each  office in order to monitor carbon performance over the next years. Reducing Our goal is to reduce by 10% our carbon emissions by 2012, through  a more efficient and rational use of the resources. We are aware that  there are external factors that may make this goal objectively more  difficult to achieve, such as business travelling or a specific kind of  service requiring a greater use of resources but, nonetheless, we know  that a change in behaviour will be a relevant factor to make a  difference. Therefore, in 2011 and 2012, we will be launching a  communication campaign to encourage Team Members to adopt good  environmental practices at their workplaces and in their daily lives. Raising Awareness to Change In 2012, we will be monitoring performance indicators in order to  calculate the amount of carbon emissions and ascertain the level of  reduction we are able to reach. In regards to the carbon emissions  that cannot be reduced, we commit to neutralising them through an  investment in carbon generating projects, oriented to energy efficiency,  renewable energies and clean technology. At the same time that we are applying a sound internal environmental  responsibility, we consider that we should also play a proactive role in  society and towards our stakeholders. For this reason, we supported the  energy Efficiency Barometer and the Energetic Efficiency Portal (www. portal-eificienciaenergetica.com.pt), which identify new methodologies,  promote best practices and improve citizens and companies awareness  on environmental preservation. We also joined Legal Sector Alliance,  a movement of some of the largest law firms in the United Kingdom,  supported by the Law Society, committed to adopting environmental  sustainable practices in the legal sector.
