Sustainability Progress Report 2011  Why Route 2  The role of business in society is changing. For  Maersk Line this provides a welcome opportunity  to challenge the way we think about our business   - and the industry we are part of. It forces us to plot  a better, more sustain able course. We call this new  path Route 2. It is a shorthand for our journey to  become a stronger, more profitable and sustain- able company.

At a glance  In Maersk Line we are 25,000 people  with 325 offices in 125 countries around  the world. Our fleet of more than 600  ships sail every major trade lane on the  globe, and make about 35,000 port  calls every year. Maersk Line is the larg- est shipping company in the world with  a global market share of 15%. Absolute reliability Maersk Line is an integral part of the   supply chains of thousands of compa- nies. Our goal is to help our customers  optimise their supply chains. Ensuring  that our customers cargo arrives safely  and on time is at the core of this.  Working closely with customers, we have  introduced the concept of absolute   reliability in shipping. Our new service,  Daily Maersk, offers daily vessel depar- ture times from four Asian ports to three  ports in northern Europe with an on-time  guarantee. Reliability is at the heart of our business  model. We are consistently ranked as  the most reliable carrier among the  worlds 20 largest shipping lines by   independent third parties.  Putting customers first One of our key goals is to transform the  customer experience in the container  shipping industry. We believe that taking  out the complexity in dealing with ship- ping lines will go a long way in improving  the customer experience.  Our progress is based on strategic part- nerships and close collaboration with  key customers, and an eagerness to   constantly improve our service offerings  through innovation and optimisation. Energy efficient shipping Shipping accounts for 3-4% of man-made  CO2 emissions worldwide1. While con- tainer shipping is by far the worlds most  energy efficient means of transporting  goods over long distances, it is overall  still a large source of greenhouse gases.  We work to reduce Maersk Lines im- pact significantly, improving and inno- vating our way towards lower CO2  emissions, cleaner water and air, and  more responsible lifecycle manage- ment of our vessels. Our goal is to be a low impact shipping  line and maintain our leadership in energy- efficiency.  Enabling global trade Maritime transportation has been, and  continues to be, at the core of interna- tional trade, accounting for around 90%  of globally traded goods.  At any given point, the largest shipping  lines transport more than 3% of the  globes gross national product2. This  makes Maersk Line one of the key   enablers of the global economy. A posi- tion that brings great opportunities,  but also responsibilities.

While these trends  influence our business in many ways,  we would like to also see our role as  actively working to shape the future  of some of these global issues. We are uniquely placed to do so. We are  starting to evaluate the kind of scenarios  these issues will present over the next  20-30 years. And we are forming our   response accordingly.  Economic development  and trade Global economic output has developed  rapidly alongside population growth.   Between 1990 and 2010 global GDP   has grown from USD 25 trillion to USD  75 trillion3. An important element within this eco- nomic growth is that patterns of trade  are shifting from the developed world to  emerging economies. In the last five  years, emerging markets have been   responsible for 80% of GDP growth   and overall represent half of all GDP,  compared to a third 30 years ago4. Trade between emerging economies is  also a growing trend, with trade between  BRICs nations growing from USD 21.6  billion in 2001 to USD 154.5 billion in  20095. In the last 50 years, international trade in  manufactured goods has increased over  100 times, from USD 95 billion to USD 12  trillion6.  Containerisation has helped accelerate  this trade growth. Today around 90% of  global trade uses sea transport7. Maersk  Line is the biggest shipping line in the in- dustry. We play a significant role in the  global marketplace connecting custom- ers with new markets.  Trade shifts demand change  We expect the volume of goods moving  from	Asia	to	North	America	and	Europe	to	 continue to increase. Simultaneously, raw  materials from Latin America, Oceania and  Africa will increase to supply Asian  manufacturing industries. As the GDP  of countries on these continents rises,  the returning trade flow will also grow.  Asia will become an increasingly impor- tant customer as well as a producer.   Intra-Asian trade will therefore increase  significantly. The shipping industry has  a major role to play in supporting these  trade flows and making sure they are  managed effectively. We will need to  partner with governments, ports and  customers to ensure that infrastruc- ture and capacity bottlenecks do not   hamper prosperity and cause unwanted  impacts. Economic development  and poverty This recent history of global economic   development has created significant   benefits, particularly in the alleviation of  poverty. It has taken China only 20 years  (1991-2010) to double its average per  capita income from USD 2,000 to USD  4,260 and India only 10 years to increase  its per capita income from USD 329 in  1991 to USD 1,265 in 20108. The global  middle class grew to 1.8 billion people  between 1980 and 2009, an increase of  700 million, and is anticipated to grow   by 3 billion more in the next 20 years9. Exports growth and access to global   markets help raise the living standards  of many people, but many economies  are still held back by poverty and a lack of  healthcare and education.  The environment and  natural resource constraints It is impossible to talk about economic  development without recognising the  significant consequences this has   already had and will continue to have for  the environment and the amount of  natural resources available on the planet. New	trends	in	trade	flows	will	have	important	implications	 for our industry and the means by which we will support  global trade most effectively. For example, increasingly   unbalanced trade flows will challenge the utilisation of  ships if some exports cannot be paired with a returning  load, thus resulting in empty backhauls and logistical  waste. Shipping lines are constantly looking to optimise  shipments to avoid empty capacity. Capacity optimisation  will become increasingly important to maintain high   energy efficiency per container in global shipping.

Ecosystems are already under  pressure, such as clean fresh water,   agricultural soil, forests and fisheries.   Unless countries and industries reduce  their footprints significantly, climate  change is likely to impact the ability of  the world community to deliver economic  growth for the long term.  The global transportation business  generates significant levels of green- house gas emissions. At present, this  is a reality until alternative fuels and  new energy sources are commercially  available and scalable. Our business has  a key role to play in supporting the  transition to more environmentally  sustainable forms of energy.

Maersk Line is a founding member of  the Sustainable Shipping Initiative  (SSI) alongside leaders from across  the shipping industry and respected  NGOs	WWF	and	Forum	for	the	Future.	 The SSI aims to leverage members  ambition and position to deliver more  sustainable value chains and plan how  shipping can contribute to - and thrive  in â€“ a sustainable future. Case for action In May 2011, the SSI launched a Case  for Action which highlights the global  challenges facing the shipping indus- try over the next 30 years and the risks  and opportunities they will bring. Key  trends include new patterns of world  trade, shifting global economic and  political power, rising fuel costs and  changing customer demands. Step changes towards 2040 Following	this,	in	November	2011	the	 SSI launched its Vision for 2040. This  outlines key areas of action and spe- cific work streams to help the industry  respond to these trends. These include:  	 Financing	 new	 technology	 to	  increase efficiency, diversify the  energy sources used in shipping  and radically reduce greenhouse  gas emissions. 	 Reducing	the	lifecycle	impact	of	 container ships by designing   vessels that can be recycled more  efficiently and that use fewer  hazardous materials. 	 Producing	 a	 "standard	 of	 stand- ards" to drive improved sustaina- bility performance in place of the  disparate range of sustainability  standards currently governing  the industry. 	 A	step	change	in	energy	techno logy innovation and uptake, with  key opportunities and barriers  identified and improvements made  in the level of consultation between  shippers. The first set of work streams will be  launched during 2012 and Maersk Line  aims to play a key role in making this  vision for the industry a reality.

It is exciting to follow the developments  of many global organisations, including  some of our biggest customers, who are  revising their business models to improve  what are seen as systemic rather than  industry-specific challenges. We welcome this development and  want to play our part in it. Similar to our  customers, we recognise that we are   unable to tackle the issues in isolation.  Collaboration and partnerships are  forming across sectors, across industries  and between public and private sectors.  We too are seeking ways to collaborate  and examples include our participation  with the World Economic Forum, Sus- tainable Shipping Initiative and innova- tive programmes with customers where  the objective is the optimisation of supply  chains and creation of shared value. It makes sense for us to take the lead in  our industry given our size, position and  support of the A.P. Moller â€“ Maersk  Group. Our operations require large- scale investments, often spanning 25-30  years. Our investments need to generate  value for the long-term, and on many   different parameters. It is this outlook  for long-term economic growth and  shared value - along with our commit- ment to drive industry-wide change that  makes us uniquely positioned to be part  of a solution.    SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 10  About the report This is the second sustainability pro- gress report from Maersk Line. It re- ports on the progress we have made  in 2011 against our strategy and  commitments and captures the ini- tiatives that moved us forward on  our journey to become a more sus- tainable company.  Introducing Route 2  This year we have structured our report  in a way that reflects the broadening  scope of our strategy â€“ under the heading  'Route 2'. From the launch of Daily Maersk  to the creation of a joint vision for   the industry, the testing of algae-based   biofuels and various innovative customer  partnerships, Route 2 captures the broad  path that we are taking in partnership  with our stakeholders.  In the report we address the fact that our  business is inextricably entwined with the  major drivers of the changes the world  will see. We have set out to actively re- spond to these challenges. In the report  we discuss how we go about that and  what we have achieved.  We dont pretend to have all the answers,  but we are committed to report on the  progress we make in a transparent and  balanced way. At the same time, we see  this report as a good opportunity for en- gaging our stakeholders in issues and  challenges that we cant solve on our own.   This report also tries to reflect the sense  of change Maersk Line is driving and  what it will mean for our customers, our  own business and society as such.    At the heart of the report are five chapters: 	 Better	trade	(1842)	looks	beyond	our	 industry's current business models  and explores the opportunities and  impacts of addressing some of the  world's key challenges in global trade  including resource scarcities, pover- ty alleviation and environmental pol- lution.    	 Service	excellence	(4664)	reports	on	 our work to improve our customers  supply chains by making our offerings  more reliable, simple and sustainable. 	 Low	impact	shipping	(6686)	captures	 the progress we have made in reduc- ing the impact of our fleet on the envi- ronment, peoples health, biodiversity  and finite resources.  	 Supply	 chain	 innovation	 (8898)	 ex- plores some of the new approaches  we are developing with logistics  partners to improve our own and our  customers supply chains and deliver  on shared ambitions. 	 Workplace	sustainability	(100117)	brings	  it all back home, with a review of how  we are making sure Maersk Line is a  great place to work - safe, inspiring  and rewarding too. I hope you enjoy reading about Route 2,  and as ever, welcome your feedback on  our progress and how we can go further.

It provides a  snapshot of our performance in  2011 and the work we have done to  improve our services and overall   financial, social and environmental  performance. Even though Maersk Line is more   competitive and responsive to customer  needs than ever, we faced a significant   financial loss in 2011. On top of   relentless turbulence in the global   economy,  overcapacity  and  the   downward trend in freight rates put  pressure on our bottom-line result. Overall, the global liner shipping industry  faces some fundamental challenges. It  is not profitable. It is extremely volatile.  And it is to a large extent still perceived  as a commodity business.  That needs to change. At Maersk Line,   we have set out to transform liner   shipping. The launch of Daily Maersk was  an important milestone in 2011. We will  continue to innovate our products and  services to help our customers optimise  their supply chains and save cost.  Today, the environmental impact of   running our fleet of 600 container ships  is significant in absolute terms. It is a   challenge we do not take lightly. In 2011,  our absolute air emissions increased  with the expansion of our fleet.   Improving our energy efficiency is key to  reduce our impact, and we are building  on solid performance. Since 2007, we  have reduced our CO2 footprint per   container by 15.6%. Introducing Route 2 Industry specific challenges and pressing  global issues such as climate change,  population growth and food security   demand important change in the way   we and many of our customers operate.  Business as usual is not an option.   Our view of a more sustainable future  and the actions to get there are captured   under the heading Route 2. This is our  way of suggesting that there is a better  alternative; one that is both profitable  and sustainable.  I am proud of how much Maersk Line   has achieved over the last year. I would  particularly like to highlight the following  to you: 	 	Maersk Line improved customers  supply chains by providing the most  reliable shipping services in the   industry - at a lower environmental  footprint per container compared  both to the industry average and our  own 2010 performance levels. 	 	Maersk Line's fuel switch programme  reduced sulphur emissions by 65- 95%	 in	 11	 ports	 in	 Singapore,	 New	 Zealand and Sweden.   	 	Maersk Line became a safer place to  work with relatively fewer accidents.   	 	We partnered with customers,  governments, suppliers and others in  improving local infrastructure and   increasing trade in emerging markets. 	 	We supported communities in need  through active relief aid involvement  in Japan, Horn of Africa, Liberia and  the Philippines. 	 	We are investing for the future by  testing biofuels and investing in   exhaust gas cleaning technology  and ballast water treatment sys- tems. We look to minimise our im- pacts for the long term by integrat- ing Cradle to Cradle methodology  into ship building activities and inno- vating ship and container designs.   	 	We concluded 2011 with record high  top quartile employee engagement  â€“ a fundamental prerequisite for  driving the changes that are needed  in Maersk Line and the industry we  are part of.  I hope you enjoy reading the report and  that our 2011 performance will spur   demand for even more innovation, greater  transparency and positive change in 2012.

Moller - Maersk  Executive Board, and CEO of Maersk Line INTRODUCTION SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 16  Better trade Fighting  corruption Developing  and supporting  communities Maersk Line's main container businesses   collectively spent more than USD 2 million on  donation and sponsorship activities in our local  communities, not counting the value of in-kind  donations such as employee time, freight and  container donations. Maersk joined the Logistics Emergency Team  (LET). 14 Maersk employees were trained to be  deployed	as	support	to	the	UN	in	the	event	of	 large scale disasters. Maersk Line was active in relief aid support  in Japan, the Philippines, Horn of Africa and  Liberia. Supporting  legal trade  Maersk Lines Know Your Shipper program  was piloted in two countries.  Maersk Line launched a global company   reporting site for misdeclared, illegal and   undesired commodities. Maersk Line trained 19,740 employees in anti- corruption (77% of Maersk Line personnel). Maersk Line reached out within the shipping   industry and formed the Maritime Anti-corrup- tion	Network	(MACN)	together	with	like	minded	 industry players. Goals Enable emerging  market trade growth Partnerships for  better trade   Maersk Line grew its cargo volumes to and from  emerging markets by 15%. Maersk	 Line	 joined	 the	 New	 Vision	 for	  Ag riculture to help our customers in the   agricultural sector enhance global food   security, improve environmental sustainability  and advance economic opportu nities. Maersk Line published its first socio-economic  study on the implications of unlocking trade in  an emerging market. Progress in 2011 Supporting the sustainable  development of industries Maritime transportation has been, and continues to be, a key  vehicle of global trade accounting for around 90% of globally  traded goods.    At any given point, the largest shipping lines transport more  than 3% of the globes gross national product10. This makes  Maersk Line one of the key enablers of the global economy â€“  bringing great opportunities as well as responsibilities.   There has been much debate over the past decades on the   benefits and downsides of global trade. On one hand, global  trade has been instrumental in lifting economies into the   modern age and creating wealth for millions of people all   over the world. Yet, the enormous wealth generated over   the last few centuries still remains out of reach for many and  has brought with it significant degradation of our natural   environment.   As we move towards a scenario with increased resource  scarcities, pollution and higher population, we recognise that  business as usual will not be sufficient. We are committed  to finding new ways of boosting economic activity and pro- moting social progress without damaging the environment.  To that end, we are working together with our customers,  civil society and regulators to support the sustainable devel- opment of industries and their supply chains.  STOP CORRUPTION SUGAR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION EMPOWERING FOR TRADE DISASTER RELIEF & PREPAREDNESS SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 19 SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 BETTER TRADE BETTER TRADE 10  World Shipping Council, 2009; IMO, 2009   Unilever has a bold ambition to double its business  and halve its environmental impact and has under- pinned this ambition with the Unilever Sustainable   Living Plan; nothing less than the basis of a new   business model. Quite simply, the only way we will  achieve our ambition is by working in partnerships with  all our stakeholders â€“ from suppliers to NGO's.   Unilever products are sold in more than 180 countries.  We have a strong presence in emerging markets, some  of which suffer from poor infrastructure. Supply chain  collaboration plays a crucial role to become faster,  more cost efficient and more sustainable in our end to  end operation. We are looking to others outside our   industry to help us improve this. Our partnership with  Maersk Line is a great example. The focus of this   partnership is on improving and leveraging services   in shipping but also on issues such as sustainable  sourcing of raw materials, which depends on critical  infrastructure. Value chain collaboration offers oppor- tunities to win in common markets and support a   sustainable growth model for us and our partners. Simon Smith Vice President, Logistics, Unilever Enabling emerging  market trade growth The centre of gravity of the world  economy is shifting, with more  countries making a significant con- tribution to global output than ever  before.  This is gradually reducing the impor- tance of the G7 group of economies,  transforming global trade flows, and  creating new growth opportunities for  Maersk Line and our customers. Since 1990, global trade has increased  four-fold, and trade between emerging  markets has grown twenty-fold.  Our success now and in the future is very  much linked to the further success of  these growing markets. At the same  time, Maersk Line can play an instrumen- tal role in linking these economies more  effectively to key trading partners all  over the world.  New	 transport	 corridors	 are	 emerging,	 especially between Asia and Africa, Asia  and South America, as well as between  Asian markets.  At Maersk Line we are adapting our prod- ucts and services towards the new reality.

It works as a conveyor belt  with consistent transportation time on  any day of the week.  Rumba The service connects South America   directly to the Middle East and India.   It comes with a high reefer capacity and  offers loading points at key ports in Brazil  and wide coverage in the Mediterranean  and Middle East. It is ideally suited to  serve the protein market between Brazil  and the Middle East as well as resin,  plastic, textile and fruit exporters. SAMMAX The vessels connect East Coast South  America and Asia and call key ports in  Brazil. With their high number of reefer  plugs, the SAMMAX vessels provide our  customers with global reefer expertise.  The vessels are highly efficient and tailor- made for customer demand and needs  in these high growth trades. In 2012  SAMMAX vessels will also be deployed  in Europe connecting major ports in Bel- gium,	Netherlands,	UK	and	Germany	to	 East Coast South America. WAFMAX The vessels are deployed on the trade  between Far East Asia and West Africa.  They are described in detail on page 24-28. SAMMAX DAILy MAERSK RUMBA WAFMAX Unique services and ships to emerging markets  MAXimising West Africas  trade potential Maersk Line is introducing 22 new  container ships to West Africa.   Designed to enable higher port pro- ductivity in West Africa, the WAF- MAX vessels help reduce important  barriers for continued trade growth  in the region.   Africa rising Africas economy is growing rapidly. Over  the past decade six of the worlds ten  fastest-growing countries were African  and in the period 2011-2015, seven of the  top 10 fastest growing economies will  be in Africa. West Africa stands out in this  respect. In 2011, Ghana's economy was  predicted to be the fastest growing in the  world	and	in	Nigeria	annual	growth	has	 been around 9% during the last 10 years.11 Significant challenges remain for Africa  as large inequalities continue to persist  in income and human development.  While economic growth is likely to reduce  the proportion of the population living  on less than USD 1.25 a day, the African  Development Bank estimates that pov- erty will remain a fact of life for around a  third of the people living in Africa for the  next 40 years. The Bank concludes that  Africa needs a long-term average of 7%  annual GDP growth across the continent  for poverty to decline significantly. Barriers to growth In West Africa, ports and container ter- minals are among the least efficient and  most congested in the world. Dwell times  â€“ the time between a container is   discharged from a vessel and till it exits  the port facilities â€“ are nearly quadruple  those of Asian ports12.   Low port productivity contributes to  high trade cost and inflated pricing   of consumer goods. Transportation and   logistics costs in West Africa are in fact  among the highest in the world and   imported goods are out of reach for  many West African consumers. At the  same time, the economy continues to be  heavily dependent on commodity exports  of oil and mineral reserves, resulting in a  significant outflow of empty containers.  Ultimately, the West African population  bears the costs of the current system  and its inefficiencies.  Introducing WAFMAX  In response to the trade growth between  Far-East Asia and West Africa, Maersk  Line is upgrading its services to West   Africa by introducing 22 new container  ships from 2011-13. The WAFMAX ves- sels are the biggest container vessels to  ever serve the region. They can carry  4,500 containers (TEU) and have been  designed specifically to accommodate  the lower drafts in West African ports  and enable a more efficient operation. The WAFMAX effect on port and terminal operations The WAFMAX vessels will support im- portant ports and terminal operators in  West	Africa	such	as	Apapa	in	Nigeria	and	 Tema in Ghana in increasing their capacity  and turnaround times. By reducing   vessels waiting time in the ports and  enabling faster discharging and loading  of containers, the WAFMAX vessels will   enable speedier trade flows in and out of  West Africa, at a lower cost for all stake- holders involved.  As the majority of the container ships  currently calling West African ports are  relatively small in size (between 1,700â€“  2,500 TEU) and unable to meet the spe- cific conditions of  the ports, the waiting  time spent getting in and out of West  African ports is significant.  Besides delivering almost twice the  number of containers in one vessel call,  the physical dimensions of the WAF- MAX vessels along with an automated  container lock feature enables faster  discharge of containers and can provide  a safer working environment for port  stevedores.  Improvements still needed Important challenges remain to be   addressed in order for West African  communities to benefit from the full  WAFMAX effect. Among other things,  this includes overcoming the current   capacity constraints in West African  ports to meet future growth; making the  customs declaration processes more   efficient and transparent; improving  and expanding the inland transportation  network; and upgrading the logistics  planning capabilities of the many small to  medium sized West African businesses. The environmental and human health impacts  While environmental pollution and emis- sions from trade remains a peripheral pri- ority for many people living in West Africa,  environmental impacts of trade are not  negligible and a significant share of this  derives from maritime transportation.  One major pollutant from shipping is sul- phur dioxide, causing acidification and  impacting the health of the people who  live close to ports. The port of Apapa is  located within 2 km of the city-centre of  Lagos and the port of Tema is located ap- proximately 5 km from the city-centre of  Tema. More than 12 million people live  within a radius of 25 km of the two ports.  Due to the port productivity benefits and  the increased efficiency of the WAFMAX  vessels, sulphur emissions will decrease  by 20% in Apapa and 13% in Tema from  2013 onwards.  While of a more global nature, CO2 emis- sions from shipping on the Far East Asia  â€“ West Africa trade are also significant.  West African customers using the WAF- MAX vessels will however be able to   reduce CO2 emissions of their goods by up  to 30% compared to the industry average.  11  International Monetary Fund 12  Harding, Plssonand Raballand, 2007 BETTER TRADE BETTER TRADE SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 25 SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 24  The WAFMAX effect â€“ Highlights  A study by Copenhagen Economics looked  into the current and future impacts of the  WAFMAX vessels in Ghana (Tema) and  Nigeria	 (Apapa)	 and	 estimated	 the	 fol- lowing effects of the WAFMAX vessels  by 2013: WAXMAX features 	 Capacity:	4,500	containers	(TEU) 	 Length	and	stability	designed	for	more	cranes	to	operate	at	the	same	time.

Reduced transportation and logistics costs Transportation and logistics costs in  West Africa are among the highest in  the world. By 2013, WAFMAX can help  bring down shipping, inventory and con- gestion costs by USD 131 million per  year in Apapa and USD 80 million per  year in Tema to the benefit of shipping  lines and West African importers and  exporters. Increased trade potential Increased trade is a key vehicle of GDP  growth and a necessary condition for  poverty alleviation in West Africa.  Based on the estimated increase in port  productivity, the WAFMAX has a poten- tial to increase trade flows by USD 760  million	per	year	in	Nigeria	and	USD 490  million per year in Ghana by 2013. Reduced environmental footprint Increased trade in and out of West Africa  means increased emissions of both local  and global pollutants. The introduction  of WAFMAX will reduce absolute sul- phur dioxide emissions in the ports by  20% per year in Apapa and 13% per year  in Tema compared to a situation without  WAFMAX.  Furthermore, the WAFMAX  vessels will have a 30% lower CO2 foot- print per container moved compared to  the industry average on that trade. Catalysts for trade and economic growth in West Africa In 2011, container volumes between Far  East Asia and West Africa grew by 25%,  mainly due to large GDP growth in Ghana.  In comparison, container volumes grew  by approximately 6% between Europe  and West Africa. For the coming 1-2 years, growth in   container volumes are expected to   continue but at more moderate levels  due to lower economic growth in West  Africa with an estimated 9% in 2012  and 5% in 2013. Chinas need for resources and commod- ities is a key driver of increased trade  flows between Far East Asia and West  Africa along with growing demand for  lower-priced Chinese products in growing  West African markets such as Ghana  and	Nigeria. West African ports and terminal op- erators face one of the most chal- lenging environments in the world,  negatively impacting their efficiency.  By 2013, WAFMAX will reduce port  turnaround time by up to 20% per  year in Apapa and up to 12% per year  in Tema â€“ or approximately 1 full day  saved per vessel call.

Mohammed Hassan Fouani Managing	Director,	Fouani	Nigeria	Limited For	Nigerianbased	importer	of	electron- ics, Fouani, transportation time and reli- ability are key to the success of the com- pany. Fouani imports its products from  Asia and assembles them locally before  distributing them to its more than 1,200  customers nationwide. For this purpose,  the company is highly dependent on the  timely arrival of its goods.  Sometimes delays in the port of Apapa  can be as high as 20-30 days. For cus- tomers with a turn-over of USD 10 million  per month, the financing costs of keep- ing an extra 30 days inventory can  amount to a cost of more than USD 2 mil- lion per year based on a 20% interest  rate	which	is	the	going	rate	in	Nigeria.	 In cooperation with our partners in key  West African ports, Maersk Line will be  able to deliver on-time for 75-85% of the  WAFMAX shipments in 2012 and expect  to reach 95% reliability of WAFMAX  shipments from 2013 and onwards SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 28 Partnering with ports and terminals for MAXimum effect Getting ready to receive the WAFMAX  vessels requires close collaboration   between Maersk Line and the receiving  ports and terminals in West Africa.   Examples of joint efforts include training  of pilots and stevedores along with   careful stowage planning to ensure that  the vessels are navigated safely to shore  and containers are discharged safely  and efficiently. Fixed berthing windows  are key to bring down waiting time and  help terminal operators prepare for the  large incoming volumes of the WAFMAX  vessels. In some ports such as Walvis Bay in   Namibia	 dredging	 has	 already	 been	  conducted to accommodate a fully  loaded WAFMAX vessel. In the port of  Tema, an important milestone was  reached in October 2011 when the termi- nal delivered an all time high productivity  of 64 container moves per hour on a  WAFMAX vessel.  fouani  Partnerships  for better trade As we grow our business in emerg- ing markets, we have the opportunity  and responsibility to create value on  social, environmental and economic  parameters.  We have embarked on this journey by   exploring opportunities for partnerships  with customers and relevant stakehold- ers where we can leverage the positive  impacts of our business to promote sus- tainable development of key industries.  One industry where we believe we can  make a difference is agriculture.  Better trade through  sustainable agriculture Agriculture is one of the key industry   sectors driving emerging market growth.  Commodities related to agriculture and  forestry, refrigerated cargo and food  and beverages make up approximately  40% of Maersk Lines global cargo. Agricultures importance will grow in the  coming years. On current projections, by  2050, global food production will need to  increase by 70% to feed the planets 10  billion people. Accounting for 70% of   water use and up to 30% of the global  greenhouse gas emissions, the sector  significantly contributes to and is threat- ened by environmental degradation. At  the same time, no other sector is more  instrumental in fulfilling the essential  needs of the global population, facilitat- ing economic development and fuel- ling growth, especially in developing  and emerging markets.  Supporting	NVA	goals To engage in these vital global debates,  during 2011, Maersk Line became a  member	of	the	New	Vision	for	Agricul- ture	(NVA).	NVA	is	a	privatesector	led	 initiative under the World Economic  Forum which aims to increase the   contribution of the agriculture sector  to global food security, environmental  sustainability and economic opportunity.

The company employs  138,000 people in 63 countries.  Cargill emphasises the need for cre- ating global food and energy supply  chains in a responsible manner. For  Cargill, food security depends on is- sues such as sustainable production,  efficient use of markets and trade.  For the global food system to be- come more productive, sustainable  and reliable, agricultural raw materials  need to be grown where resources  provide the greatest production effi- ciency and can be renewed so that pro- duction can continue for many years.  Trade and infrastructure play a criti- cal role for food security to the ben- efit of all parties, often across   international boundaries. Trade helps  create jobs, supports local econo- mies, raises living standards and  contributes to a more food secure  global population. Maersk Lines business plays an   important role by connecting interna- tional markets. We work together  with Maersk Line in the Sustainable  Shipping Initiative to support Maersk  Line and others in doing exactly that  job, but with a smaller environmental  footprint. Roger Janson Business Unit Leader,  Cargill Ocean Transportation Cargill: Promoting food security and low impact trade BETTER TRADE Trade and infrastructure play a critical role for food  security. Food needs to be traded to move from   surplus to deficit areas - to the benefit of all parties,  often across international boundaries. Roger Janson Business Unit Leader, Cargill Ocean Transportation SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 33  In 2011, we offered our perspectives  on the Indian banana trade through our  first socio-economic impact study.  The study was conducted together with  the Danish research institute Applied  Economics and Health Research and  Firstline Communication. It looked at   the emerging Indian banana trade in   detail, and discussed the opportunities  and challenges associated with growing  the trade across all aspects of the Indian   banana value chain.  The banana:  food for thought Bananas are the worlds most popular  fruit. They are a staple commodity for  many developing countries and very   important to food security. They also  make up around 9% of Maersk Lines   refrigerated cargo business â€“ a trade we  expect to grow over the coming years.  Despite being the worlds biggest pro- ducer, less than 1% of Indian bananas  are exported. 80% of global banana  production currently originate from  large-scale commercial farms, but  most Indian farmers are smallholders.  Getting the same quality, economies   of scale and security of supply when  production is spread across hundreds  or thousands of farms is challenging.  Reducing food waste through  an unbroken cold chain  A key finding in our Indian banana case  study was the ability of the emerging   banana trade to significantly reduce  post-harvest waste levels through the  establishment of an unbroken cold chain  from pack-house to end-consumers. Many emerging and developing econo- mies lack sufficient cold chain infra- structure. In India, for example, around  20 â€“ 30% of locally grown fruits and   vegetables rot in transit. This amount is  equivalent to the total annual consump- tion of fruits and vegetables in the UK.  Over the course of the years, Maersk Line  has invested heavily in innovations in con- tainer technology, such as Maersk Lines  StarCare and Quest II (see page  64). These innovations mean that fruit crops  such as bananas can now travel long  distances, up to 50 days, with minimal  waste and loss of freshness, giving fruit  producers around the world new oppor- tunities to advance into new export  markets. We believe our assets and expertise  can contribute to reducing the current  waste level and realising some of the  export possibilities. We have shared our  study with exporters, buyers, authori- ties and academia who, like ourselves,  can have an impact on future develop- ments of the trade.  	 	Will	 growing	 the	 banana	 export	  be able to pull Indian small-holder   banana farmers out of poverty?

This   represents just 0.3% of all interna- tionally traded bananas. 28 % Indias share of world banana pro- duction, making it the worlds largest  banana producer. 20 â€“ 30 % The proportion of Indian fruits and  vegetables estimated to go to waste in  India due to the absence of an effective  cold chain. This amount is equivalent  to the total annual consumption of  fruit and vegetables in the UK. 3,000 Containers are per year currently ex- ported out of India - equivalent to what  is exported out of Ecuador in one week.  25 million tonnes Up to 25 million tonnes of bananas  can be freed up for consumption if the  export productivity gains are replicated  to the domestic sector. 190,000 Containers exported from India can   increase from 3,000 in 2010 up to  190,000 yearly by 2025.   USD  1.612 billion can be generated to the local economy. 96,000 jobs and more than 400,000 depend- ants. 60 % Increased earnings for farmers of  60%; with a 106% rise for workers.

To minimise these losses and extend  the shelf life of fresh produce, a cold  chain - an uninterrupted series of stor- age and distribution activities, is a criti- cal component. Maersk Line is a global leader in the de- velopment and provision of cold chains.  We offer refrigerated containers that  can transport fresh produce all the way  from the farmer to the consumer in a  cost effective way. Our cold chain skills and assets can help  producers and exporters optimise their  supply chains and reduce the amount   of food wasted during transportation,  as well as boosting the productivity and  efficiency of the food sector.

Marcel Clement Senior Manager Europe, Sustainable Value Chains, Rainforest Alliance  Supporting legal trade Globally, illegal trade undermines le- gitimate business and distorts soci- etal and economic development. As a reputable company, we recognise  that there is a risk to our brand if our ser- vices are misused to facilitate illegal trade.  While our customers are responsible for  the legality of the cargo, our stakehold- ers are increasingly demanding a more  active role from shipping lines in helping  to reduce illegal trade. However, ship- ping lines only have the right to open and  investigate a sealed container if it is esti- mated to pose a severe security or safety  risk. To reduce the risk of carrying illegal  trade, we therefore need to be smarter in  spotting any risks in our systems and  collaborating with relevant stakehold- ers to mitigate those risks.   Becoming part of the solution Some of the most challenging issues  concerning international trade go well  beyond our immediate area of control.  However, for each challenge there is also  an opportunity to become a part of the  solution. For Maersk Line, supporting ini- tiatives and developments to strengthen  legal trade is vital. This is best done by  engaging in cross-sector collaboration  with key customers, authorities and  credible third party organisations to  advance our shared agendas.  Illegal waste The UK is a major exporter of waste and  Maersk Line has worked together with  UKs Environmental Agency to reduce  the risk of shipping illegal waste out of  the country. We take it very seriously  when illegal waste is discovered in a  Maersk Line container.  At the beginning  of 2011, Maersk Line received informa- tion that we had unintentionally trans- ported about 70 containers of used tyres  to South Korea from the UK. The ship- ment was not legal and we cooperated  with the authorities to ensure that the  containers were returned to the UK. In  addition, we provided information to   enable the authorities to investigate   further and find the responsible shipper.   Illegal trade of  wildlife species Illegal trade of wildlife species under- mine countries' efforts to protect their  natural resources. Some whale and  shark species are covered by CITES, the  international convention on trade in   endangered species, and it is Maersk  Lines policy to not accept any cargos   declared as involving whale or shark.  However,	in	November	2011,	the	Danish	 newspaper Politiken informed that a  Maersk Line shipment did contain shark  meat. Following this incident, we are   improving communication of this policy  in areas where the risk of shipping shark  is high. This work will continue in 2012. Spotting the issues  at the booking stage In 2011, Maersk Line initiated a more   systematic approach towards cargo  misdeclarations and risks for potential  illegal commodities.  Reporting on inci- dents and risks in countries and captur- ing the learnings in one central platform  enables us to discover patterns, for   example with regard to the specific  trades and bookings. This type of infor- mation and intelligence is an important  next step in helping prevent illegal cargo  getting on board Maersk Line ships. We  believe that reporting these incidents  will ensure global focus on relevant   issues. The roll-out of this reporting   platform will continue in 2012. Know your Shipper The Know Your Shipper program was  piloted in 2011 to enable proactive analy- sis of commodities and shippers. This   involved dedicating internal resources to  identifying high-risk shippers and spot- ting misdeclarations. The program has  so far only been piloted in a handful   of countries, but has already provided  useful knowledge on many trade lanes.  The "Mismatch Analysis" initiative was  also launched with the purpose of   discovering shipments where reported  name and actual commodity show a   mismatch, e.g. where the shipper name  refers to biscuits and confectionary but  the commodity booked is cotton or  textiles. This analysis allows us to make  the right judgements when suspicious  cases arise.  BETTER TRADE The issue of illegal waste Illegal waste is a major concern and  poses a large risk to the public health  and the environment in destination  countries. It is estimated that, on average, approxi- mately one out of ten containers expor ted  from European international seaports   is related to waste. 10% of the waste  cargo containers is exported violating  applicable environmental rules.  On the same time, a lot of the cargo   Maersk Line carries on return routes  back to Asia (backhaul cargo) contains  waste materials, i.e. paper and metal,  that re-enter new production cycles.  Such global recycling patterns would  not be possible without cost efficient  sea freight â€“ and without it our ships  would not be fully utilised. Many   advanced recycling businesses prosper  from this opportunity.        Maersk Line has joined forces with other shipping  lines operating in the UK to reduce the risk of shipping  illegal waste. Our cooperation with the industry has been  beneficial from both ends. We want to avoid doing   unnecessary spot checks, as we know the business is  operating on a tight schedule. This cooperation has   enabled us to work more efficiently, with controls earlier  in the process. The Environment Agency for England and Wales SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 38  Fighting Corruption  Corruption has emerged as one of  the worlds greatest challenges.   Corruption has a negative impact on  countries, communities and busi- nesses impeding economic growth  and sustainable development.   In some countries corruption is perva- sive and has infiltrated most aspects of  society. Laws are not enforced uniformly  and without discrimination, and compa- nies are likely to encounter demands for  bribes or extortion attempts in meet- ings with public officials.   Facilitation payments  in shipping  The shipping sector operates with the  whole world as a workplace, and depends  on frequent interaction with public offi- cials. A big challenge in the shipping   industry is the frequent and persistent  demands  for  low  value  amounts   demanded by public officials to facilitate  port operations (so called facilitation  payments). Typically, the demands are  for cash, cigarettes or soft drinks . It is our policy to oppose facilitation  payments and work actively to reduce and  eventually eliminate them. We took sever- al  steps in 2011 to progress on this journey.  Employees  take on the fight In 2011, more than 19,000 Maersk Line  employees completed Maersk Lines   anti-corruption course. The course helped     equip employees worldwide in applying  anti-corruption measures in their local  environment. It also gave employees a  better understanding of the challenges  seafarers and employees in the most   exposed regions face every day. Employ- ees have also been provided with check- lists and guidance on how to handle a  challenging situation.   Fighting corruption is challenging the  norm in some countries. It takes exten- sive experience by employees to oppose  or minimise demands for facilitation  payments while ensuring our operation  is not being impacted.  Opposing demands in the interaction  with public servants can reduce demands  in one country and lead to severe conse- quences in another. The ship can be   detained, or in worst cases the crew can  be exposed to severe extortion situa- tions. To that end, our policy on anti- corruption recognises personal safety  as the main priority.  Open culture and  structured reporting Having a good understanding of local  challenges is an important prerequisite  for taking on the challenge. So is having a  company culture where issues are being  discussed openly to find the best course  of action. There is a lot to be gained from  best practice sharing as our seafarers  and office personnel, regardless of loca- tion, face similar challenges.  Maersk Line ships and offices are there- fore requested to submit incident reports  when they face challenging situations.  The reports also identify best practices  and suggestions for improvements that  can be implemented globally. The reports  help us leverage countries knowledge  on appropriate anti-corruption meas- ures and form the basis for prioritising  efforts and resources geographically.  Local Maersk Line organisations are also  asked to map risk areas proactively. By  increasing transparency we can verify  payments on a detailed level and over  time demonstrate reductions in facilita- tion payments. The industry gathers  to address corruption In the fight against corruption, much can  be gained when companies in the same  sector join their forces and work together. At the end of 2010, Maersk Line initiated  a discussion among like-minded ship  owners to investigate whether there  was sufficient common interest to ad- dress these challenges together. A high  level of interest led to the creation of  the	Maritime	AntiCorruption	Network	 (MACN)	 in	 January	 2011.	 Maersk	 Line	 served as the facilitator for the network  in 2011. The members of today represent  different areas of the shipping sector  with	head	offices	in	Denmark,	Norway,	 Germany, UK, US and Sweden. The	purpose	of	MACN	is	to	share	best	 practices among its members and align  policies and approaches in the field   of anti-corruption. The network also   endeavours to collaborate to address  and solve specific challenges. One of  the ambitions of the network is to seek   support from government bodies and  international organisations to target  corrupt practices in challenging juris- dictions and ways to address the root  causes. Clear policy on  anti-corruption The Maersk Groups policy on anti- corruption has a zero tolerance  for bribes. We oppose facilita- tion payments and work actively  towards reducing them with the  ultimate goal of elimination.  Our policy obligates us to work  against corrupt practices by con- stantly focusing on anti-corrup- tion measures. 19,740 employees completed Maersk Lines  anti-corruption course In 2011, we launched a mandatory  e-learning course for all Maersk  Line employees.  The course was completed by 77%  of the global organisation. In addition, face to face work- shops are continuing with the pur- pose of building capacity locally by  implementing a train the trainer  concept.

Maersk Lines community development  and support programme encompasses  three pillars: disaster relief support,   environmental protection projects and  projects that help develop new social  and economic opportunities for under- privileged communities through global  trade. These are areas where Maersk  Lines business can have the biggest  positive impact on communities, by   leveraging our core expertise through  collaborative efforts. 2011 focus on disaster relief In 2011, the world experienced a record  high number of tornadoes, unprece- dented flooding, rampant earthquakes,  disturbing volcanic eruptions and a   tsunami in Japan that no one will ever  forget.  The frequency and closeness of natural  disasters and the dreadful famine in the  Horn of Africa made strategic relief   support an important priority in 2011   and put optimal planning, on-time   delivery and employee preparedness  to the test.  Life-saving logistics  Getting the right products, to the right  place, at the right time takes on new  meaning when roads, airports, bridges,  and other logistics infrastructure are se- verely damaged or destroyed. To over- come logistics barriers and to maximise  the positive effects of our business and  expertise, Maersk became members of  the Logistics Emergency Team (LET),   together	with	Agility,	TNT	and	UPS.	 The four companies come together  when a natural disaster with an impact  on more than 500,000 people suddenly  occurs. The team coordinates transport  and storage of aid goods where there is a  need. Their efforts and expertise bridge  the resource gap during the first 3-6  weeks,	while	the	UN	and	other	aid	agen- cies are ramping up their efforts.  The logistics challenge during the first  phases of any disaster is often severe  and the response to this challenge can  make a big difference in how the disaster  impacts local communities in the long  term.  In the long term, strategic relief aid   supports social stability which again  supports the restoration of local econ- omies and growth â€“ critical societal   factors that we depend on as a logistics  company.

Earthquake and tsunami hit Japan When the massive earthquake and tsu- nami struck Japan, the Logistic Emer- gency Team stepped in and facilitated  the transportation of aid relief items.   The distribution of the relief goods was  complicated and challenging as the  earthquake and tsunami had caused  critical damage to the domestic infra- structure. During the aid relief period,  Maersk and some of its service providers  took care of the logistics response out of  the port of Qingdao in China, including  cargo handling and sorting, storage, and  inland transportation.  In spite of the Fukushima nuclear disas- ter and the series of nuclear meltdowns,  Maersk Line continued its services in the  region, as one of the few shipping lines.  We took the necessary precautions to  ensure the safety of our seafarers and  monitored the developments closely.  The efforts of our captains and crews  throughout this difficult time have not  gone unnoticed. Overall, the continua- tion of Maersk Lines services was   essential in keeping the supply chain to  and from Japan intact at a critical time.    Horn of Africa famine With famine across Somalia, Ethiopia  and	Kenya,	the	UN	partners	scaled	up	 the urgent humanitarian lifesaving   operations. Maersk Line prioritised aid  cargo to the area and prepared the   necessary capacity by reorganising its  service networks.  Existing services were upgraded with  additional ships to optimise cargo flows  to the affected areas. Maersk Line   donated cash and transportation to the  World Food Programme from Mombasa  to	 Northern	 Kenya.	 The	 donation	 con- sisted of 30 containers and corn soya  blend (a fortified nutritional food used to  combat malnutrition), as well as the  transport.

Progress in 2011 Rethinking our service In 2011 we set out to rethink our business focusing on the value  we can add to our customers supply chains. Change is necessary in shipping. We have a whole new genera- tion of customers that expect a different kind of service and  quality from us. We are committed to driving change in global  shipping so that companies around the globe can optimise  their supply chains, reduce waste and grow profitably.  Change is key as we and our customers respond to massive  global challenges such as climate change, food scarcity and  poverty. We still have a long way to go to change shipping, but  in 2011 we nevertheless made important progress, collabo- rating with customers on new game changing solutions.  Service  excellence SERVICE EXCELLENCE SERVICE EXCELLENCE INDUSTRY AVERAGE MAERSK LINE IN 2011 ! ? ? SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 47 SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011  The world is changing for our cus- tomers. Major global challenges such  as climate change and dwind ling   resources are creating a new business  environment. Concerns are rising  and companies are increasingly being  held accountable for the impact of  their products and their operations on  the environment. Many of our cus- tomers are responding to this change,  developing more sustainable prod- ucts and ways of doing business. In the drive towards a more sustainable  value chain, customers are starting to  look at production in terms of the bigger  picture. Increasingly, they are taking   responsibility for managing the entire  life cycle of their products â€“ from the way  they source raw materials, to making it  easier for consumers to recycle materials  at the end of a products life.  Part of the big picture This big picture perspective is key to cre- ating a sustainable future. But there are  still areas of the supply chain that are   difficult for our customers to measure,  or control. Up until now, transportation  and shipping of goods has been one of  those areas. At Maersk Line, we are dedicated to  helping our customers develop a sus- tainable business model by making the  supply chain more efficient, more visi- ble and easier to manage. We are doing  that in several ways by increasing sup- ply chain efficiency and reducing waste  through reliability, creating more choice  for customers through better stand- ards of transparency in our industry,  and innovating new solutions to im- prove the supply chain. Supporting a new business model We are very interested in learning from our value chain  partners, and sharing our insights and lessons learned  in the pursuit of business sustainability. Information  within the value chain is a fundamental building block for  insight, know ledge, innovation to reduce risks, costs, and  to develop value added services among value-chain  participants.  Mr. Neil McKenna Vice President, Transportation, Canadian Tire   Many of our customers, including our own company,  are starting to work with closed loop business   models. Developing closed-loop supply chains will  demand innovative collaboration among supply  chain entities, taking into account reverse resource  flows. Our business has an important role to play   in optimising the flow of products and reducing  supply chain waste.

If prod- ucts are late, they face a delivery  problem. When customers can count  on each and every container arriving  on time, supply chain cost and waste  can be reduced.  It is therefore an integral part of our  business model to be reliable and ensure  on-time delivery of customers ship- ments. In 2011 Maersk Line ranked high- est in Drewrys report on top 20 ship- ping lines schedule reliability. Maersk  Lines average global on-time delivery  score rose to 87.5% in the fourth quar- ter of 2011, an increase from 70.2%  compared to the same period in 2010,  and from 82.9% in the third quarter of  2011. Our goal is to further decrease  customers supply chain cost and waste  through a global average of 95%   on-time reliability. To this end, we intro- duced the concept of absolute reliability  by the end of last year.   Cutting supply chain waste The new service Daily Maersk offers  daily vessel departure times from four  Asian ports to three ports in northern   Europe with a guarantee of every con- tainer arriving on time. With daily depar- tures and a consistent network flow,  Daily Maersk can reduce customers   inventory buffer at both origin and desti- nation significantly. Customers can sim- ply choose to reduce their warehousing   capacity. Absolute reliability and optimal  planning also takes away the need for  last minute air freight which is costly and  has a higher footprint.  Higher profit and less CO2 Absolute reliability in shipping reduces  cost, time spent on freight management  and energy consumption. Moreover,  Daily Maersk produces 13% less CO2  per container compared to the industry  average	on	the	AsiaNorth	Europe	trade.	 And containers arriving on time are   essential to pricing and profits. Increasing supply chain efficiency through on-time reliability Weekly departures Transit times and buffers Unreliability. In the shipping industry only every second  container arrives on time No	compensation	for	unreliability   Industry average of 55.4g  CO2 per container (TEU) per km Daily departures A fixed cargo availability date Absolute reliability. All containers on 12 corridors from Asia  to	North	Europe	arrive	on	time If a container is delayed, Maersk Line will pay back $100-300   48g  CO2 per container (TEU) per km (13% CO2 less than industry average) With Daily Maersk customers can simply choose to cut out their warehousing capacity. SERVICE EXCELLENCE Without Daily Maersk With Daily Maersk Daily Maersk is a highly anticipated product offering  that will support us at present to achieve on time  delivery of our product to our distribution centre with a  fixed transportation time. This arrangement, along  with the flexibility of daily cut-offs at origin and cargo  available for pick up, assisted us currently to optimise  the planning of our supply chain.  Mats Samuelsson Global Shipping Manager, H&M SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 50 Daily Maersk helped move Maersk Line's on-time   delivery score to 94.2% in Q4 2011 on the Asia-Europe/ Mediterranean trade lane, an increase from 87.5% in  the previous quarter.  More transparency â€“ more choice in shipping The case of orange juice 16 The industry averages are only calculated once a year in May, leaving us to compare our 2011 performance with an estimated 2010 industry average.   Making the industrys environmen- tal performance 100% transparent  lays the groundwork for bench- marking.  Benchmarking is important to create  choice for our customers â€“ choice on  which services customers want to buy  and choice regarding which suppliers  they want to engage with.  We experience that customers certainly  want to have a choice about their own  supply chain impact. Lowering their   impact is important to their business  growth, risk mitigation and sustainabili- ty	 strategies.	 Nobody	 should	 have	 to	 take decisions in the dark on such impor- tant items. We believe strongly in 100%  transparency in shipping to offer more  choice and differentiated services.  More energy efficient services compared to the averages Some shipping lines do not disclose their  environmental performance, and those  that do, disclose it anonymously. We   are therefore left to benchmark our per- formance against estimated industry  averages only. Maersk Lines target is to  offer our customers services that are at  least 10% lower on CO2 compared to the   industry average, a position which Maersk  Line gained in 2010.  We estimate that our CO2 gap to the   industry average was approximately 8%  in 2011. This estimate is based on mid  2010 industry emissions data collected  by Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG).  The industry's CO2 emissions data are  released every year in May16. Checking the  carbon blind spots Ocean shippings impact on the product  lifecycle varies substantially from product  to product. As ocean freight remains one  of the most energy-efficient ways of  transporting large amounts of cargo, the  share of the impact is often relatively  small.	Nevertheless,	in	some	cases,	ocean	 shipping can make a big difference to a  products overall environmental footprint.  However, shipping remains in many   cases a blind spot in the total lifecycle  impact of products. The exercise of   collecting data from all supply chain   entities is complex and time consuming.  And as emissions from ocean shipping  fall under the category of scope 3 emis- sions, manufacturers have some times  failed to take them into account.   The shipping industry faces an impor- tant communication task in making its  scope 3 emissions more visible. We   are making progress with some of our  customers, especially where there is a  good case for lowering shippings share  of the product lifecycle impact.  Shipping remains in many cases a blind spot in the total lifecycle impact of products.  SERVICE EXCELLENCE SERVICE EXCELLENCE ? We compete on hard parameters such as reliability  and cost. To include the environment on the same high  competition parameters, we need the industry to play  by the same rules, so that our customers do not have  to make decisions in the dark. Lucas Vos Chief Commercial Officer, Maersk Line Orange juice highlights the case for  raising consumer awareness. At Tesco,  for example, oranges for its wide  range of orange juice products are  sourced from right across the world,  including places such as Brazil, South  Africa and Egypt. They are transported  over seas to processing facilities in   the UK.  Tesco reminds consumers that when  you buy a carton of freshly squeezed  orange juice, the impact on the envi- ronment can be twice as big as when  you buy one which is made out of   concentrate.    Freshly squeezed products incur the  greatest transport impacts due to the  greater mass of material required to  be transported per liter of orange juice  product. Orange juice from concentrate  requires significantly smaller quanti- ties of material to be transported to  the UK to make up the final product. Tesco has carbon footprinted over  1,000 of its own brand products. The  carbon footprinting of products  helps to identify the sources of CO2  emissions in the life cycle of the prod- ucts Tesco sells, from the growing of  the ingredients, the manufacturing  of the product, the packaging, the  processing, the transportation, stor- age in the shop to the trip to the super  market, and the way the product is  used. By identifying the key points in  the lifecycle where carbon emissions  are greatest, Tesco is better able to  make carbon reductions.  Its important to inform consumers  about the choices they have. And its  important to work together with our  suppliers to reduce the impact of  products. Our goal is to reduce our  supply chain emissions by 30% by  2020.

The challenges of getting  to 100% transparency While the industry has come a long way,  manufacturers and exporters around  the world still do not have enough   visibility into shipping lines' environmen- tal footprints to compare their perfor- mance. This is a major issue, not just for  Maersk Line and its customers, but for  the entire industry, which risks falling   behind if it fails to rise to the challenge of  making its environmental performance  transparent.  The challenges are:  	 	Customers	 have	 no	 guarantee	 that	 the data they receive is correct. In  spite of more shipping lines getting  emissions verified by an independent  third party, still too few shipping lines  invest in improving data quality. 	 	There	is	no	credible	industry	bench- mark for capturing information about  environmental performance other  than CO2. 	 	Credible	 rating	 schemes	 that	 com- municate performance in a logical,  smart way are not yet complete. 	 	Environmental	 performance	 is	 not	 yet fully integrated into all strategic  levels of decision making, such as the  industrys booking and quotation  systems.  Our vision for choice  and transparency We are pushing for a scenario where  everyone in our industry fully discloses  their carbon performance, ship by ship,  trade lane by trade lane. In this ideal   future, everyone would measure their  performance in the same way, and the  data they produce would be indepen- dently verified. If we can achieve this, environmental  performance would become hard-wired  into industry decision-making processes.  A simple A-G rating of energy efficiency  would make it easy for customers to   select and deselect services. Conse- quently, shipping companies could ex- pect customers to reward environmen- tal performance.  Moving up the ladder on verification The most important milestone was  reached in 2010 when Maersk Line   as the first shipping line got its CO2  emissions verified by an independent  third party. In 2011 we made further   progress on verification. We increased  the number of spot checks and expand- ed the scope to include more aspects of  environmental performance, such as  waste handling, ballast water handling  and energy efficient technology on  board.  The increase of vessel spot checks and  the bigger scope led to Maersk Line   becoming the first shipping line verified  in Clean Shipping Index in 2011. Canadian Tire is one of Canadas most- shopped general retailers, offering  everyday products and services to   Canadians through more than 1,700  retail and gasoline outlets from coast  to coast. Canadian Tires businesses are charged  with increasing their economic and   environmental performance through  the lens of business sustainability.  Their scope is that of the extended   value chain, transportation of products  being one out of three key segments.  To this end, Canadian Tire has created  an advanced Green House Gas model  that allows them to measure the car- bon emissions for all transportation  legs of product movements. Canadian  Tire can therefore quantify its carbon  footprint and measure the impact   of tactical and strategic operational   decisions made in its network.  Maersk Line is a global leader in sus- tainability and this model now allows  us to differentiate service providers  by their carbon emission intensity and   integrate that into our future cargo   allocation plans. Innovation is a social process, and the  collaboration of our two companies on  reducing the energy, carbon footprint  and waste in our collective value chain  will also strengthen the competitive  position of our companies, increasing  efficiency while reducing costs and   exposure to risk. Mr. Neil McKenna,  Vice President, Transportation,   Canadian Tire 748,500 ton less CO2 Maersk Line provides customers with an  environmental advantage. In 2011,  Maersk Lines 169 key customers saved  close to 748,500 ton CO2  by shipping  with Maersk Line compared to the   industry average.  The CO2  saving corre- sponds to the yearly CO2  footprint of  80,000 Brits or a USD 15,000,000 saving  in CO2 offsetting cost.   In 2013, when the first new Maersk  Line Triple-E ships will be deployed on  the Asiaâ€“Europe trade lane, the CO2  emissions per container will be half of  those of the current industry average.  The energy efficient Triple-E ships will  give consumers in Europe access to  products shipped in a more sustainable  and cost efficient way. Focusing on  energy efficiency CO2 per TEU reduced since 200715.6% Lower on CO2 than industry average8% CO2 per TEU will be reduced before 2020 - if not more! 25% Triple-E ships are expected to emit 50%  less CO2 than the current industry   average on the Asia-Europe trade 50% Differentiating service providers using advanced Greenhouse gas emissions model SERVICE EXCELLENCE SERVICE EXCELLENCE MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 57 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 56  The shipping supply chain is made  up of many different players. To make  our industry sustainable, we have to  break down the silos along the value  chain. By collaborating and sharing  information effectively, we can align  around the same sustainable goals. Our work in Clean Cargo Working Group  (CCWG) is a good example of collabo- ration across industries. CCWG is a  business-to-business forum hosted   by Business for Social Responsibility  (BSR). This important advisor helps the  shipping industry integrate environ- mentally and socially responsible busi- ness principles into transportation  management. The CCWG participants  make up more than 30 leading multi- national manufacturers, retailers, and  shipping lines, which collectively move  more than 70% of global liner shipping  capacity.  The collaborative work in CCWG helps  build a more solid foundation for sus- tainable development across the supply  chain. The group is collecting the CO2  trade lane impact from all shipping  lines, a significant milestone towards  more transparency and benchmarking.   We have a long way to go to advance   collaboration in the supply chain. The  progress made in CCWG between the  many members is at times a slow   process. Fortunately, the aspect of   inclusiveness helps ensure that the  steps forward are taken by a very  large group of stakeholders. We would  like to see more customers joining  CCWG to encourage advancement  and collaboration toward standards  and further transparency.   Advancing collaboration  across industries SERVICE EXCELLENCE It is no longer an option not to know where our products  come from, how they were produced and to whom they go.  Transport companies play a particularly important role in  fostering deeper cross-sector collaboration required to  meet growing demands for more transparency and   sustainability in the supply chain. Companies that offer  up viable solutions for transparency and choice will be   rewarded by the market. Aron Cramer President and CEO of BSR SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 59  Helping Outokumpu switch to rail One to one collaboration    In 2011, Maersk Line also advanced col- laboration with key customers on indi- vidual CO2 reduction targets. For exam- ple, we achieved an 8% CO2 reduction for  Evian bottled water which we commit- ted to in 2010 as part of the Danone   Carbon Pact programme.  Committing to common sustainability  goals is a great way of optimising supply  chains. While commitments to individu- al goals are not very widespread yet, we  believe that collaboration on concrete  targets helps build the foundation for  low impact and closed loop businesses.  We would like to see this type of col- laboration expand across industries and   supply chain parties.   From air and road to water and rail Reducing the carbon intensity generat- ed by transport by strengthening the  share of more virtuous transport is   strategic to many of our customers; for  example by replacing trucks with rail  transport wherever possible and air with  ocean freight. In 2011, we assisted several customers  in adjusting their transportation net- works to more efficient modes, helping  them reduce cost and the environmental  impact of freight.  Outokumpu is a global leader in stain- less steel manufacturing and employs  8,000 people in more than 30 countries.  Outokumpu believes that stainless  steel will play an important role in the  sustainable development of global   infrastructure. As part of long-term targets for reduc- ing CO2 emissions, targets for trans- portation have been included in the  Outokumpu Energy and Low-carbon  Programme. The choice of transporta- tion mode is an essential part of this  programme. Looking for more sustainable transpor- tation at their production plant in Aves- ta, Sweden, Maersk Line was contacted  early summer 2011. The Outokumpu  production plant in Avesta is well  equipped with industrial railway tracks  all the way up to their loading platform.  The question remained whether we  could coordinate rail transportation for  the full inland part for their overseas ex- port goods. Maersk Line made an assessment and  found a rail operator that could arrange  the container pickup with rail from pro- duction. In October 2011, containers  started to move by rail all the way from  Avesta to the ocean terminal in Gothen- burg where they load on Maersk Line  vessels. This new setup eliminates a  truck roundtrip of 240 km per move and  saves annually around 60 ton of CO2. The advanced setup is cost efficient,  removes trucks from the road and  takes out the terminal lifts from truck  to rail in Eskilstuna. SERVICE EXCELLENCE SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 60 Tetra Pak makes the processing and  packaging solution for many of the well  known food and beverage products   people consume every day. The envi- ronmental profile of those products   has been enhanced over the years   as Tetra Pak has developed leaner   food processing and filling solutions,   improved the environmental per- formance of the cartons and increased  the recycling. That helps Tetra Paks   customers reduce the impacts of   products from food processing and  packaging.  Tetra Paks environmental ambition  touches various industries in the value  chain, including shipping. Their goal of  capping climate impact across the   value chain despite company growth,  highlights the case for more sustaina- ble shipping and transportation.  Tetra Pak tracks greenhouse gas emis- sions for outbound shipments of pack- aging material. They minimise them by  avoiding air transport, using rail where  possible and by consolidating shipments. Meeting targets through supplier collaboration Our expectations for Maersk Line are that we together  go as far as we can with the well known factors of envi- ronment in logistics, like load factors, modal switches,  engine efficiencies etc. At the same time we need to  focus on innovation to secure that next generation   logistics can start to reduce the major impact that  transportation has on emissions globally. Working together with a logistics supplier that actively  works to reduce the climate impact of their own opera- tions will also help Tetra Pak in achieving our target  Robert Ingvarsson Group Transport and  Travel Manager,  Tetra Pak Maria Hellstrom Global Environment Manager, Tetra Pak SERVICE EXCELLENCE SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 61  Improving the footprint of seafood transport To offer our customers the option of  transporting live seafood by ocean  freight, we have worked together  with Aqualife A/S on a patented   logistics solution.  Aqualifes technology makes it possible  to transport up to 14 tonnes of live shell- fish in a container. They provide land  based technology for storage and ensure  the cold chain is unbroken between the  export and import markets. Together  with Aqualife and biotechnology compa- nies we have helped enable a more effi- cient mode of transport for live seafood.  Caviar from the desert  Until recently, the Royal Caviar Company  in Abu Dhabi transported most of their  sturgeon and sturgeon eggs from   Germany to Abu Dhabi by air. Maersk  Line and Aqualifes patented container  technology	 and	 Novozymes'	 micro  organisms allow the sturgeon to stay  in the same water without being harmed  by waste build-up.  The sturgeon can now be safely shipped  to Abu Dhabi by sea, saving energy and  costs. As a result we have been able to  carry out the largest-scale transport of  live fish ever, and reduced CO2 emissions  by 90% compared to conventional live  fish transportation methods.    Fresh shellfish that won't cost the earth Together with Aqualife we found better  ways to carry live lobsters and crabs  from Halifax, Canada to Rotterdam,   The	Netherlands.	Aqualifes	technology	  aerates the water the shellfish are trans- ported in, and reduces the temperature  to one or two degrees Celsius. The tem- perature makes lobsters go dormant for  the 10-day journey to Europe, reducing  problematic build-up of waste products  in the water.  Twelve containers of lobster were suc- cessfully shipped from Halifax to Rotter- dam during the development phase, and  Aqualife has set up aquaports in Halifax  and Holland to collect lobsters for distri- bution. Maersk Line started making  stops in Halifax in May 2011, transport- ing up to four containers of lobsters per  week to Rotterdam. We plan to extend  the technology to other species such as  mussels, oysters, clams, and snow crabs.  Previously all 15,000 tonnes of Canadian  lobsters that reach Europe - a market  worth around USD 215 million - were  transported by air. Ocean freight is now  a carbon and cost efficient alternative. SERVICE EXCELLENCE Today more than 5% of the world annual seafood  catch is transported by air to meet increasing consumer   demands for fresh or live seafood. With the joint efforts  between Maersk Line and Aqualife, we can accommodate  those consumer needs by displacing the air shipments  with ocean shipments and, as a direct result, minimise  the carbon impact on the global environment by more  than 90%.

Maersk Line operates the largest  fleet of refrigerated containers in  the world. Our 230,000 reefer con- tainers transport temperature sen- sitive cargo for customers around  the globe. The impact on society of  reefer containers is vast, allowing  consumers all over the world to   enjoy fresh produce at any time of  year. Recent innovations in container technol- ogy, such as Maersk Lines StarCare,  mean that fruit crops can now potential- ly travel up to 50 days with minimal loss- es and their freshness retained. Technol- ogies such as these are creating new  opportunities for our customers to reach  more distant markets without eroding  the quality of their products.  Quest II â€“ Safeguarding cargo quality at a lower impact        Some of the most sensitive commodities  such as chilled meat, live shellfish or ba- nanas depend on very precise and stable  temperatures; even the smallest fluctu- ations can impact the quality and lead to  waste. To keep our customers goods at  a constant temperature at all times,  Maersk Line has developed a new con- tainer cooling system called Quest ll; it  stands for Quality and Energy Efficiency  in Storage and Transport. The system is  innovative because it makes use of its  surroundings â€“ the weather.  The Quest II software offers a sophisti- cated control which lets cooling and heat- ing functions run only when necessary,  which in turn prevents energy loss. That  sounds simple but the system is in fact   extremely smart. It measures how much  time it is feasible to turn off cooling,   heating and reduce fan speed while main- taining the exact cargo temperature. The most sensitive cargo groups in the  chilled temperature range were selected  for laboratory testing and live trials in 2011.  It was proven that Quest II maintains   the same high quality of our customers  cargo throughout the entire journey.  Quest II builds on Quest Is success in re- ducing the reefer containers energy  consumption by 50%. With Quest II on  board, the reduction of energy and CO2  reduction is estimated to reach an aver- age of 65%.  Quest II boosts China vegetables exports  In 2011, Maersk Line invited Chinese   vegetables exporters in Janin to learn  about the features of Quest II and the  new export opportunities Quest II could  facilitate.   Quest II meant that export opportunities  were realised for producers in Janin to  new markets in Haiti, Senegal, Argentina,  Equatorial Guinea and Uruguay. Typical  import	countries	include	Russia,	Nether- lands, Brazil and Colombia.  In	2011,	Quest	II	helped	increase	North	 China vegetables exports with Maersk  Line by almost 20%.

The 2011 reduction falls short of our 2011  3% year-on-year CO2 reduction target. Our absolute CO2 emissions increased in  2011 as our fleet expanded with 70 con- tainer ships. Taking the impact out of distance Shippings significant contribution to the global economy has  not been without environmental impact. Some argue that   re-localising production and consumption is the answer.  We are not convinced that distance is a bad thing â€“ neither   for the producers worldwide looking for new markets, nor for   the products environmental sustainability. But we know that  the shipping industry needs to improve its environmental   performance substantially if it is to enable trade growth in a  low carbon economy.  Our ambition is to be a low impact shipping line, while growing  our contribution to the global economy. We need to take our  environmental impacts out of distance, and not just CO2. In   essence, that means making the distance travelled by goods  and resources irrelevant in environmental terms. Its not   as easy as it sounds, its work in progress â€“ but a change in   shipping were committed to lead.

However, absolute SOx emissions  rose with the expansion of our fleet. 3 fuel switches were implemented; in  Singapore (65% SOx	reduction),	in	New	 Zealand (80-95% reduction across 9  ports) and in Gothenburg (90% reduction). To date, Maersk Line has implemented 6  fuel switch programmes.  We formed a partnership with our   supplier  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine  Engineering Co. Ltd. (DSME) in Korea on  developing Cradle to Cradle passports  for Triple-E ships.  Together, we now have an extensive task  ahead of us to build a new material   documentation system describing the  material composition of ships to ensure  better recycling.  We committed to installing a ballast  water treatment system on all ships  being built in 2012 and onwards. We became members of the World  Ocean Council to enable marine research  and transparency on the state of the  world's oceans. SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 67 SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011  Does distance  matter? Globalisation and the reduction in  transport costs have contributed to  an exponential growth of distances  covered in supply chains. Our busi- ness plays a role in that.  Ocean shipping is the most cost efficient  means of mass-moving goods across  large distances - and the most energy   efficient mode of transportation if you  look at the impact of transportation  (km) per product (tonnes). But shipping  is nevertheless accountable for 3-4%  of the world's CO2 emissions19. Distance  does matter.  Given todays environmental challen ges,  it is understandable that people debate  whether or not there is a need for food  and other products to travel great dis- tances across the globe, as part of very  large and complex supply and demand  networks.  To this end, producers worldwide are  weighing their decisions by taking vari- ous aspects into consideration. Trans- porting and storing less and distributing  locally, for example, make sense in cer- tain situations.  While the impact stemming from trans- portation can be reduced by minimising  the distances covered in supply chains,  we believe that the needed impact   reduction across industries will not only  come from shorter supply chains. Focus on hotspots To radically reduce the environmental  impact of todays production, consump- tion and supply chains, we need to   address the material impact within each  value chain. In some cases, transporta- tion is a hotspot with a relatively high   impact on products lifecycles. In those  cases, the environmental impact can   often be reduced significantly by chang- ing transportation mode and increasing   logistic efficiency.  In many cases, transportation has a  small impact on products life cycles â€“  even in spite of great distances between  production and consumption.  That being said, distance does matter,  but cutting it is not the only answer â€“   taking out the negative impact of   'distance' is. That is the outset of Maersk  Lines environmental strategy which   focuses on addressing the environmen- tal hotspots in shipping and facilitating  smarter transportation of goods. In turn, smart transportation helps ena- ble smart and efficient production of  food and goods. Raw materials should  be grown where resources provide the  greatest production efficiency. And food  and goods need to be traded to move  from surplus to deficit areas. Our route  to low impact shipping is a commitment  to advancing efficiencies in and beyond  our own industry. LOW IMPACT SHIPPING SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 69 19 International Maritime Organization (IMO)  LOW IMPACT SHIPPING The adidas Group is reducing the environ- mental impact of transporting its prod- ucts, particularly by minimising the use  of air freight. To get the full picture of  ocean versus air, the adidas Group ran a  pilot project in 2011. They followed the  adidas Superstar IIs journey from the  factory near Dongguan, China to an   adidas	store	in	Nuremberg,	Germany.	 The project team collected all the CO2  data, from the pick-up at the factory  right through to the final product   delivery and identified which steps in  the journey contributed the most   carbon emissions. Shipping the pair of Superstars by air has  nearly 14 times the carbon emissions of  sending them by ocean freight: 5.4 kg  CO2 compared to 0.36 kg CO2. To put this  figure in context, a single person's CO2  emissions for a flight from London to  New	York	are	about	900	kg. The adidas Group compares shipping  lines performances Environmental performance has been  included in the adidas Groups tendering  process for shipping lines as a formal  criterion. Shipping lines need to submit  information on ISO 14001 certification,  environmental policy, sustainability  strategy and activities.   Air freight: 5.4 kg CO2 Ocean freight: 0.36 kg CO2 Superstar IIs energy efficient journey In recognition of our responsibility to constantly monitor  and reduce our carbon emissions, the adidas Group   is incorporating emission relevant information into   the selection process of ocean freight providers. Our   expectation is that our providers are permanently   looking into improved ways of shipping our goods with  less carbon emission but by maintaining or improving  the service levels.  Its not about meeting but exceeding  and setting new industry standards Volker Daut Head of Dest. Transport & Logistics, adidas Group SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 71  Addressing  carbon emissions Maersk Line accounts for 0.1% of  the world's CO2 emissions. In 2011,  our fleet of container ships emitted  33.8 million tonnes of CO2 to the air.  Maersk Line operates the biggest fleet of  container ships in the world â€“ more than  600 ships and about 3.4 million TEU con- tainers. Today, the environmental impact  of running a fleet this size is significant in  absolute terms. It is a challenge we do not  take lightly. In 2011, our absolute air emis- sions increased with the expansion of our  fleet. While our size comes with a sub- stantial footprint, it is also our scale and  size that will help enable our journey to- wards low carbon shipping.  We are building on solid performance.  Since 2007, we have reduced our CO2  footprint per container by 15.6%. Improving energy efficiency includes a  wide range of measures ranging from  making the most of our daily operation  and planning, using new types of tech- nologies, to innovating our ships and  container technology and designs.  Reducing fuel  consumption is key Our environmental performance is closely  tied to our consumption of fuel.  CO2 is  produced as ships use petroleum-based  fossil fuels, primarily bunker fuel, to   power the engines. In comparison with  other petroleum products, bunker fuel  is extremely crude.  Slowing down 600 ships  Today, the single biggest impact on fuel  consumption is speed. Slowing down  helps us increase energy efficiency. It also  means we can better ensure arrival at an  agreed time because the lower average  speeds give us the flexibility to speed up  if something unforeseen happens.  The way we manage our 600 container  ships and navigate them through the  oceans is thus of crucial importance to  our environmental performance. A tiny  speed increase, as little as 0.5 knot,  could increase fuel consumption by 6%,  corresponding to a cost increase of USD  340 million20.   In 2011, Maersk Line improved its fuel  consumption management system for  the global fleet. The system tracks fuel  use by each ship on every voyage and  compares real performance with an op- timum modelled performance. The dif- ferences between the two, the potential  cost and CO2 savings, and recommenda- tions on improvements are distributed  to all internal stakeholders on a monthly  basis.  Today, anyone with a significant influ- ence on fuel consumption in Maersk Line  has fuel consumption in their perfor- mance scorecard and the incentives for  fuel efficiency are very clear. Perfor- mances are compared, and a monthly  report rates each services energy effi- ciency based on an A-G rating system.  In 2011, Maersk Line reduced its fuel   consumption per container (TEU) by  2.7% this way, corresponding to a total  cost reduction of USD 135 million.      20 Calculations based on a fuel price of 600 $/metric ton. As a company dedicated to building sustainability  into everything we do, were focused on reducing our  environmental impact at every level of our supply chain,  including transportation and distribution. Through the  changes weve made in partnership with companies  like Maersk Line, we have reduced total miles traveled,  saved fuel, reduced greenhouse emissions and saved  money. This reduces cost, and our customers receive  our product in a more timely manner. Re-examining its transportation network By re-examining its transportation  network through the lens of sustaina- bility, Levi Strauss & Co. reduced green- house gas emissions by 50-60% in  2008. In 2009 the company was able  to reduce carbon emissions by more  than 700 metric tonnes and save money  while continuing to meet service levels. The contributions came from shifting  from the most carbon-intensive modes  of transport (air and trucking) to less  intensive modes, such as rail and  container ships, adopting efficient  processes and partnering with trans- portation service providers. Levi Strauss & Co. also made changes  to its international shipping routes  to reduce the carbon footprint from  transportation. As an example, the  company shifted product routing using  all-water services to the U.S. East  Coast. This reduced dependence on  trucking and increased ocean trans- portation, a more efficient mode of  transportation.

Experienced captains  can save significant quantities of fuel  through careful planning of a ships  voyage from start to finish.  We have  codified the many tricks of their trade  in our innovative fuel and cost saving  tool Eco Voyage, developed with   inputs from many of our captains.  The software recommends the most fuel  efficient voyage based on factors such as  voyage time, weather and sea conditions,  ocean current, the draught of the ship,  and the fuel efficiency of the ship at dif- ferent speeds. In 2011, our Eco-voyage tool  helped us reduce fuel consumption by 1%. Using waste heat  to power our ships Maersk Line is the first in the industry to  install waste heat recovery systems as a  standard on all new ships. A waste heat  recovery system captures the engines  hot exhaust gas to produce extra energy  for propulsion and reduces fuel con- sumption and CO2 emissions by approxi- mately 9%.  39 Maersk Line ships, including 3 chartered  ships, now have a waste heat recovery  system. 42 Maersk Line ships on order,  including the 20 new Triple-E class ships,  will all have waste heat recovery systems. Fuelling large ships  on micro-algae     We believe diversifying our fuel supply  will help us reduce our impacts further.  Using biofuels for shipping is still a   relatively new technology, but in Sep- tember 2011 our container ship Maersk   Kalmar steamed off with two tank con- tainers on the deck full of 30 tonnes of  algae-based Soladiesel. The biofuel was  used in different blends throughout the  voyage from Germany to India.  The trial, conducted in partnership with  Maersk Line, Limited (MLL) and the US  Navy,	proved	that	microscopic	algae	can	 in fact fuel large container ships. The  cost of high quality algae-based biofuel  is currently too great for regular com- mercial use, but we believe that with fur- ther development biofuels such as those  derived from algae may be possible to  use regularly for container shipping.  Triple-E class efficiency  becomes reality In 2011, we made a quantum leap in inno- vating the ship and engine designs of the  near future, ordering 20 Triple-E class  ships. The first of these 18,000 TEU ships  will be deployed in 2013, bringing with it  new economies of scale, energy efficien- cy and unprecedented environmental  performance.    New	hull,	engine	and	propeller	designs	 optimised for slow steaming mean  that CO2 emissions per container moved  by Triple-E will be approximately half  those of the current industry average  on the Asiaâ€“Europe trade. Triple-E will  give Maersk Lines customers access  to one of the most energy and cost   efficient modes of transportation in  the world.  Can ships run on algae,  straw and wood? In recent years, biofuels for transporta- tion has grown from science fiction to  something much more real. For example,  EU regulation now requires biodiesel to  be blended with diesel for road transpor- tation.   While it is technically possible for con- tainer ships to run on biofuels, price,  availability and sustainability are currently  barriers to wide scale production and   uptake of these fuels.   We need lower grade, sustainable biofu- els that can be scaled up at the right  price. We are therefore very excited that  the Danish Advanced Technology Foun- dation is funding a research platform on  developing biofuels for shipping, which  includes leading global actors in biofuel  development such as the University   of	Copenhagen,	Novozymes	and	DONG	  Energy.   As part of this platform, we will seek to  develop biofuels tailored to the specific  needs of shipping and ship engines. We  hope this will prove to be an important  first step in making biofuels for shipping  a commercial reality!

But there is also copper,  plastic, wood, glass and other minerals throughout the various bits and pieces of her 400 metre  length, all of them manufactured by hundreds of different suppliers. All of it will be documented in  the Cradle to Cradle passport. LOW IMPACT SHIPPING In 2011, Maersk Line took delivery of  18 ships. In the construction our sup- pliers used approximately 400,000  metric tonnes of steel, 2,000 tonnes  of copper, 4,000 tonnes of coatings,  1,200 tonnes of mineral wool, 400  tonnes of plastic and rubber and 80  tonnes of glass, amongst many other  materials. The sheer scale of what  we do makes material choices very  important.   Finite resource with infinite recycling potential Steel tops the list of resources we use to  maintain and grow our fleet of ships and  containers. There is around 4.7 million  tonnes of steel in our fleet â€“ equivalent  to 1,300 Eiffel Towers floating at sea. Iron for steel is a finite resource - when  it's gone, it's gone. Some projections  estimate that steel will run out in about  60 years time, some say there is enough  steel for longer than that. In any case it is  a finite resource, and extracting it is   energy intensive. Fortunately, steel can  be recycled indefinitely without signifi- cant loss of property or performance.  Reusing materials with a new passport In 2011, we sold 9 ships, some of which  had not yet reached the end of their   service life. It will be the final owner, not  Maersk Line that oversees the recycling  of these ships. But we still see it as   our responsibility to ensure that all our  ships can be properly recycled. To that  end, Maersk Lines next generation  ships, the Triple-E class, will come with a  Cradle to Cradle passport. The passport will be a comprehensive,  living document, describing the material  composition of the ship â€“ the most   comprehensive material documentation  system the shipping industry has ever  seen. With the Cradle to Cradle passport  Maersk Line is expanding the scope from  safe and effective recycling to recycling  that reuse materials to a much greater  extent.  With the development of the Cradle to  Cradle passport, the Triple-E ships will  become the first ships that function as  material-banks for the container ships of  the future.  A challenging task ahead It will not be easy to map all the individual  parts of the worlds largest ships and it  will take much of the next two years to  develop the passport. We need to en- gage with many suppliers and partners  to develop and feed data into the Cradle  to Cradle passport.  Some of this important work takes place  as part of the Sustainable Shipping   Initiative (SSI) which facilitates the   necessary collaboration and sharing of  expertise. The work stream partners   include Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine  Engineering Co. Ltd. (DSME), Carnival  Corporation, Forum for the Future and  Maersk Line.

In 2011, Maersk Line emitted 600,000  tonnes of sulphur, of which a significant  part was emitted at or in the proximity   of coasts. This makes the sulphur emis- sions (SOx) of our ships â€“ and their   impact on air quality and health â€“ an   increasingly important dimension of   our efforts to reduce impact.  After 2015, the fuel sulphur content for  any ship in an Emission Control Area22  must not exceed 0.10%. We welcome  the stricter regulation on sulphur as an  important way to reduce SOx emissions  in shipping.  There are several ways a shipping line  can reduce SOx emissions; through fuel  switching to low sulphur fuel, cleaning  the exhaust gas and using alternative   fuels. We are committed to reduce our  SOx impact beyond regulatory require- ments, and our long-term aspiration is to  drive global SOx emissions towards zero. The primary focus within our Zero SOx  programme is to reduce SOx emissions in  the proximity of port city areas. Switching to cleaner fuels In 2011, our Zero SOx programme included  3 more fuel switch programmes from  regular to low sulphur fuel. These were  implemented in Singapore, all 9 ports of  New	 Zealand	 and	 in	 Gothenburg.	 The	  immediate effect was a 65% reduction  of SOx emissions in Singapore, a 80-95%  reduction	in	New	Zealand	and	an	expected	 90% reduction in Gothenburg. In 2011, we concluded our fuel switch  programme in Houston, a successful  collaboration between the Port of   Houston Authorities, the US Environ- mental Protection Agency (EPA) and  Maersk Line. The programme saved the  ports inhabitants the exposure to 303.6  metric tonnes of SOx.   In	2012,	the	North	American	ECA20 will  become effective and consequently   reduce SOx emissions significantly. Since 2006, Maersk Line has conducted  6 voluntary fuel switch programmes  worldwide. We call them voluntary  because they go beyond regulatory   requirements.  We have committed to at least 10 fuel  switch programmes before 2015. Fuel  switches are prioritised for locations  where SOx concentrations are high and  where we can partner with ports and  other stakeholders to share the cost of  switching to cleaner and more expensive  fuels. While our fuel switch programmes have  an immediate positive effect for the   inhabitants of those ports, they are hardly  sufficient in the bigger scheme of things.  To address what we believe to be one   of the biggest issues in shipping, all   shipping lines need to cut their SOx  emissions. After all, it is SOx reductions  across the entire industry which will  make a real difference to peoples health  and the environment.  Cleaning the exhaust gas       Another way of reducing SOx is to clean  the exhaust gas from ships. After several  years investigating SOx scrubber tech- nologies, we found a feasible solution  together with BELCO. Their advanced  exhaust gas cleaning system will be   implemented on our container ship   Maersk Taurus in 2012, as a first in the  container industry.

In 2011, a partnership between Maersk  Line	 and	 NOAA	 enabled	 the	 necessary	 data and analysis for a study measuring  the impact of California Air Resources  Boards fuel-switching requirement.

Craig McLean NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research  Protecting biodiversity  When invasive species hitch a ride  from one part of the world to another  on big ships it is a major threat to   local ocean flora and fauna.  Ships carry ballast water to provide sta- bility, aid steering and control trim and  draft. But ballast water often originates  from ports and other coastal regions rich  in plankton and other marine organisms.  Discharging ballast water originating  from one marine environment into   another can introduce alien species into  a marine ecosystem, threatening its   ecological balance. To reduce the impact on biodiversity  Maersk Line discharges ballast water  midway on the journey. But as we ex- change up to 10 million cubic metres of  water every year, this measure is not suf- ficient, also not in light of anticipated  regulatory developments.  So in 2011 we committed to installing a  ballast water treatment system on all  new ships built in 2012 and onwards.   This system cleans the water thoroughly   before releasing it back into the sea.   We expect that the IMO Ballast Water  Convention will enter into force in 2012  making ballast water treatment the norm  going forward.  Using our assets to  measure ocean health As our ships are present in every   ocean they are attractive platforms for  researchers who want to measure the  ocean health using samples from all over  the globe.  In 2011, Maersk became members of the  World Ocean Council (WOC). The purpose  of the membership is to partner with like- minded companies and engage with the  scientific community to enable system- atic and regular reporting of standardised  oceanographic and atmospheric data. Our objective is to facilitate strategic  scientific programmes on our ships,  preferably sharing open source data  globally. The data also benefits Maersk  Line by improving our understanding of  ocean currents for route planning, and for  reducing our impact on biodiversity. Maersk is making significant progress in its commitment  to protect marine biodiversity, reduce the impacts of its  operations and better understand the oceans. By joining  the World Ocean Council - international ocean industry  alliance for Corporate Ocean Responsibility -  the company  is leveraging its leadership to achieve even greater results  in advancing ocean sustainability. Paul Holthus Executive Director, World Ocean Council (WOC) LOW IMPACT SHIPPING SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 86 It is estimated that at least    different species are carried in  ballast tanks around the world.  7,000  Why sustainability matters  in our supply chain Maersk Line has more than 10,000 suppliers. Our procurement  spend in 2011 was more than USD 17 billion. What we buy, how  we buy it and who we buy it from matters â€” from a corporate  and societal perspective. Especially as we operate assets with  a thirty-year lifespan. We need to think long term together  with our suppliers and partners.  Forging new links with others in the logistics chain in planning,  collaboration and R&D efforts helps us improve our perfor- mance and service offerings. Risks are reduced as standards  are improved throughout the chain. And knowledge and   expertise is leveraged for all parties involved.  Supply chain  innovation          50% of operational spend  registered in Maersk  Responsible Procurement  Programme Supplier partnerships  for supply chain  improvements   Fuel efficiency of charter  vessels on par with Maersk  Line owned vessels  (Goal: 25% CO2 reduction per  container from 2007 to 2020) Introduce sustainable  floorboards in Maersk Line  containers Suppliers accounting for 22% of our   operational spend were registered in   the programme and acknowledged our  Third Party Code of Conduct. Maersk Line worked together with  ports, terminals and authorities globally  to improve port productivity, ballast  water management and support the  development of hinterland infrastruc- ture.  Maersk Line formed a partnership with  ship owners on optimising charter   vessels' fuel efficiency by integrating  Maersk Line's performance manage- ment approach.  In 2011, the CO2 footprint of the char- tered fleet was reduced by 5.8% per   container (TEU/Km).    Maersk Line issued a new procurement  policy on container floorboards to avoid  illegally logged timber in our containers.  In 2011 we purchased 504,000 TEU   containers with floorboards adhering to  our policy's requirements and became  members of Forest Stewardship Council  (FSC).

To facilitate this, Maersk has developed  a Third Party Code of Conduct which   outlines our expectations to suppliers  and key business partners in the area of  environment, health and safety, human  and labour rights and anti-corruption.  The Code of Conduct was launched in   the second half of 2011 and is being   implemented through Maersk Lines   Responsible Procurement program. 4,700 of our suppliers are in scope for   the programme. They include ports and   container terminals, ship yards, container  manufacturers, energy companies a.o.  and represent a wide range of industries  and geographies. Our target for 2011 was to introduce the  programme to key suppliers representing  approximately 50% of Maersk Lines   operational spend.  Suppliers sign up to  Maersk Lines Responsible  Procurement Programme In 2011, we introduced the Maersk   Responsible Procurement Programme  to approximately 300 suppliers who  have subsequently  acknowledged our  Third Party Code of Conduct. They   account for 22% of our operational  spend. Another 13% has been invited to  join but has not yet registered their  companies in our system.   Going forward, we will be assigning clear  priorities for the registered suppliers  and engage actively with the suppliers  identified as high-risk vendors.  First year of implementation The Responsible Procurement program- me is still in its early days. Our commit- ment to Responsible Procurement is for  the long-term and the programme will  continue to expand over time. We are  convinced about the benefits it will bring  about and the opportunity to engage  with suppliers in long-term strategic   development.

Providing crucial infrastruc- ture for world trade, they bring about  job opportunities for thousands of  citizens, local societal development  and global wealth creation.  Ports are a part of our customers supply  chains and an essential component to  our business, our customers and nations  worldwide. They will increasingly be   involved in bringing value to the final   consumers as part of an integrated   supply chain.  If ports and their hinterland infrastruc- ture can function in a way that minimises  environmental impacts and maximise  the many societal benefits ports bring  about, the end results will benefit both  business and consumers and the local  communities through which those  goods pass.  Ships energy efficiency  depends on port performance The reliability, cost efficiency and sus- tainability of shipping lines are all closely  linked to the productivity of ports.  High port productivity, with quick load- ing and off-loading of ships, means  less time spent in port, timely depar- tures and more efficient fuel consump- tion at sea through slow steaming.   The result is a better service for our  customers at a lower cost and with  lower carbon emissions. Boosting port productivity Together with our partners in the termi- nals, Maersk Line has launched an initia- tive to boost productivity. In all simplicity  we work on site with the terminal op- erator for several weeks to determine  which actions we both can take in order  to eliminate waste and variation from  the process. It is a mutual responsibility to increase  port performance, and the benefits will  be visible to both, as well as to our   customers and the environment. Close  follow-up is key to success and this will  be an ongoing partnership. Improving supply  chain transparency Worldwide, logistics-based buildings such  as warehouses, ports and distribution  centres contribute 371 million tonnes of  CO2 each year23. Similar to shipping lines,  they depend on fossil fuels and are   almost completely powered by non-  renewable energy sources. As ports   expand, their impact on the surrounding  environment is becoming more and  more important. It is increasingly important to our cus- tomers that they are able to measure  their environmental and social impacts  throughout their supply chains. By  measuring their own impacts, ports can  play an important role. More integrated,  transparent supply chains allow cus- tomers to identify opportunities for   performance improvements across the  entire value chain. Port performance on CO2, SOx,	 NOx,  water and waste will increasingly sup- plement the typical hard selection crite- ria that shipping lines apply, such as cost,  productivity, capacity, draft and safety.  Because many of the issues are similar in  our industries, there is a strong case for  collecting and sharing data along the  value chain.  To this end, Maersk Line advocates a  standardised approach to measuring  the environmental footprint of the   terminal operations. Programmes like  the Sustainable Shipping Initiative and  Clean Cargo Working Group can help to  establish performance benchmarks,   enabling ports to commit to goals for   improvement. Partnerships with  ports and terminals SUPPLY CHAIN INNOVATION         23  Low-carbon, high growth, 2011,  by TATA Consultancy Services SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 92 Soren Rodgaard Thomsen General Manager, Terminal Strategy, Maersk Line We see immense opportunity in further improving our  vessels fuel efficiency, and a crucial element of success  is productivity and reliability during port stays, especially  in light of increasing vessel sizes. Looking at the devel- opment over the last 10 years, we have unfortunately  seen that our average vessel call size is increasing at a  higher pace than productivity, i.e. we are on average  staying more time in port. Amongst other issues, this  is detrimental to our fuel spend, and hence we will work  even closer with our business partners in the terminals  to reverse this trend.  Indonesia is an important exporter  of oil and gas, electrical appliances,  plywood, textiles and rubber. As an  archipelago country of more than  17,000 islands, Indonesia relies on  seaports for exports and imports. The port productivity of the Indonesian  main ports is considered slower com- pared	 to	 most	 ASEAN	 countries,	 with	 many of the commercial ports and hin- terland infrastructures suffering from  limited capacity and congestion.  Tanjung Priok Port, the biggest sea port in  Indonesia, is the gateway for more than  60% of the countrys containerised cargo  throughput. The region consists of more  than 2,500 manufacturing companies,  including	the	likes	of	Mattel,	Ikea,	Nike,	 Adidas, LG and Samsung. It is becoming  the biggest industrial area in the country. Indonesia initiative to reduce logistics cost In 2011, Indonesia proposed an initiative  to reduce the uncertainty of lead time  and logistics cost stemming from infra- structure challenges for the business  players and the shipping industry. The national initiative concerns a new  dry port in Cikarang â€“ the first such port  in Indonesia. A dry port is an inland inter- modal terminal directly connected by  road or rail to a seaport. It operates as   a centre for the transshipment of sea  cargo to inland destinations. Dry ports can play a key role in promoting  economic development in inland areas  by integrating regional transport and   logistics into international networks. The aim of the dry port is to improve the  nations trade flows by bringing the port  to the manufacturing neighborhood.  Maersk Line was consulted for the devel- opment of the project. We shared best  practices and collaborated with the   assigned project partner from the gov- ernment, Jababeka Group, to maximise  the value of the dry port for the shipping  industry and our customers.   Better access to global markets Besides facilitating a modal shift from  road transport to lower carbon rail, our  cooperation and participation in the pro- ject has meant that we can today offer  our customers better access to global  markets and help Indonesia become  more internationally competitive. Maersk Line was the first shipping line to  connect Cikarang Dry Port with other  ports of call around the world. Unilever  was the first customer we served using  the dry port. The case of the Indonesian  dry port SUPPLY CHAIN INNOVATION         When infrastructure challenges impede  international trade flows and our service,  we have an opportunity to contribute with  logistics expertise and push for positive  national developments. We are thrilled  to be part of this success story which  has leveraged our business and created   social and economic value for Indonesia  and customers worldwide. Jakob Friis Sorensen President Director of Maersk Line, Indonesia SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 95  Maersk Line does not discharge any  waste in the ocean except for organic  waste. This means that adequate re- ception facilities must be available  in the ports to ensure safe and   responsible handling of waste. In 2010, we developed a standard oper- ating procedure describing how the ven- dors in ports should handle the sludge  and garbage disposed of by our ships.  We rate the vendors based on this proce- dure. In 2011, 37 of 159 vendors were  rated red by our organisation as they did  not live up to the standards described in  our operating procedures.      The exercise on following up on red   flagged vendors is in its early stage.   In 2011, we made some progress by   conducting four workshops with port   authorities in Rotterdam, Antwerp,   Singapore and Hong Kong to understand  the barriers and possibilities for safe  waste disposal. Rotterdam and  Antwerp lead the way  Rotterdam and Antwerp are rated  green in our rating system because they  handle sludge and waste in an environ- mentally safe way. Our ratings testify to  the two ports consistent leadership  on safe waste handling activities. They   continue to raise the bar and now work   to improve the performance of port   reception facilities even further.   We recommend our ships not to dispose  of sludge and waste in 'red' rated ports.  To improve the standards in these ports  we are sharing best practices from   Rotterdam and Antwerp.   Getting more ports on board In 2011, we defined a pilot project to map  the performance of 12 deep sea ports in  north Europe. Rotterdam and Antwerp  will be used as role models to ensure that  sludge and waste is handled safely in all  of the north European ports.  The pilot project will also be used to guide  ports in the rest of the world on how to  improve port reception facilities ensuring  sludge and waste is handled in the best  possible way. Engaging with ports  on waste handling SUPPLY CHAIN INNOVATION         Ship owners join fuel optimisation drive About two thirds of the container  fleet sailing under the Maersk flag   is owned by other companies, and  chartered by Maersk Line. So the  performance of these container ships  is important to meeting our target of  reducing CO2 by 25% per container  from 2007 to 2020. On average, Maersk Line owned vessels  are estimated to be around 5-10% more  fuel efficient than the chartered fleet.  Our goal requires collaboration and coor- dination as the chartered fleet is covering a  diverse group of around 80 different com- panies including major and minor players. Our long-term goal is to boost the char- tered fleets energy efficiency to the level  of Maersk Line owned ships. Our experi- ence shows that major efficiency gains  can be made from factors such as the  tuning of engines, choice of hull paint,  and timing and quality of hull and propel- ler cleaning.  Extending our performance  management approach  In 2011, we took an important step by ex- tending Maersk Lines performance man- agement approach to the chartered fleet.  The ship owners welcomed our initiative  and request to supply performance and  other data about their vessels. The data  was used to develop theoretical models  of performance for every type of ship â€“  and baselines against which real perfor- mance can be compared.  In 2011, Maersk Lines reporting system  was installed on the first 140 charter  ships. The first batch of Energy Efficiency  Scorecards was published in the begin- ning of 2012.  Maersk Lines reporting system and  scorecard setup enables benchmarking  between vessels, meaning owners can  compare how sister ships within their  fleet are performing. Though Maersk  Line carries the cost of the bunker fuel,  owners will be incentivised to perform  well so that they have good results to   report when charters are renewed.  In 2011, the CO2 footprint of the   chartered fleet was reduced by 5.8%   per container (TEU/Km).    SUPPLY CHAIN INNOVATION         We are pleased to join Maersk Lines fuel efficiency   optimisation drive. It came at a good time for us, soon  after the launch of our new environmental department  charged with improving our environmental performance.  Our joint project challenges us to focus on performance  in new and radical ways. Mark Rawson Environmental Manager, Zodiac Maritime Agencies Ltd SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 97 SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 96  There are 17 million containers in cir- culation in the world today, about  10% of them owned by Maersk Line.  Hardwoods sourced from tropical  forests still form an important com- ponent of containers. They provide a  durable flooring system, but bring  unwanted social and environmental  impacts where the source of the  timber is unclear.    In 2011, following three years of research  into alternatives together with Maersk  Container Industry (MCI), we made the  decision to end the purchase of containers  using uncertified tropical hardwood  floors - a component currently consuming  between 1.2-1.5 million cubic metres of  hardwood annually.    Certified wood,  recycled  plastic or bamboo We created a new procurement policy,  requiring that containers floors must  come from responsibly-managed hard- wood forests certified by the Forest  Stewardship Council, or from alternative  materials, particularly bamboo and recy- cled plastic.   MCI produced its first FSC-labelled   container for Maersk Line in Dongguan,  China in April 2011. The container is fit- ted with hardwood floor from certified  responsible forestry. MCI has now com- missioned several thousand containers  with these replacement materials.  We expect to buy a further three million  such containers in the next five years.   A large proportion of our container fleet  will thus have sustainable floorboards  within a relatively short time span. Certi- fied floors will be in all Maersk Line con- tainers within 18 years, the typical life- time of a container. In 2011, Maersk Line became members  of FSC. Reducing the impact  of containers It is the policy of Maersk Line that   all orders for production of dry and  special containers must comply with  the standards for container floor   materials, as described below and in  order of the following priorities: 1.	 Nonwood	recyclable	or	sustainable	    waste product container flooring     such as recycled plastic. 2. FSC certified hardwood floor, which     entails both the wood and the     supply chain must be FSC certified. 3. Bamboo floor. 4.	 Nontropical	 wood	 species	 from	    controlled, responsible forestry,     such as birch and larch. As a direct result of the new policy,  non-certified tropical hardwood will  no longer be accepted.

Highly engaged employees deliver a whole  different level of customer service, with a  different energy and motivation. They are  more willing to exceed expectations and  better equipped to make the right deci- sions. Engaged employees mean happier  customers and better results. Every year we measure employee en- gagement. Our employee engagement  survey assesses employee attitudes  and perspectives towards the company,  leaders and the overall work environ- ment across the organisation. Last year,  97% of our 25,000 employees globally  provided their feedback. Employee engagement increases again  Efforts to maintain high engagement  paid off with an employee engagement  score of 77% (percentage of employees  responding in favour of four selected   engagement statements), a major im- provement on the previous years 71%.  Top quartile engagement in comparable  industries is at 76%.  The number of employees being ex- tremely satisfied with Maersk Line as a  place to work increased to 84% - an all  time high and higher than the top quartile  of comparable industries. The employee  feedback improved positively across all  55 survey statements by 4% in average. Sustainability affects employee engagement Maersk Line employees continue to   respond very favourably toward the  companys efforts to develop sustainably. This year the statement my company is  making a genuine effort to be socially  and environmentally responsible beat  all other statements at a favourability  rate of 91%.  Managers are more effective  The annual survey reveals that 88% of all  employees have a good relationship  with their manager. The figure is closely  linked to the manager effectiveness  scores which increased by 2 percentage  points to 83%.  Manager effectiveness include leader- ship skills such as living the values, giving  timely and relevant feedback, supporting  open two way communication and em- ployee development. The voice of seafarers The employee engagement survey for  seafarers includes questions related to  the daily vessel operation. In 2011, 53% of  5,847 seafarers responded, filling out the  WORKPLACE SUSTAINABILITY survey on paper. Their engagement score is  lower compared to that of office staff  but improved from 59% to 65% over 2011.  The highest scoring category is Safety &  Security, and environmental considera- tions were rated highly positively as well.  On the lower end of the scale are items  such as satisfaction with the support  from the Crewing Manager (56%), the  management of relief times (58%), feel- ing positive about career opportunities  (62%) and the quality of the food served  on board (63%). Taking action on employee feedback Based on the survey results we have  identified Career & Development as one  of the most important improvement   areas across the organisation.  Moreover,  every manager is asked to hold a feed- back session in order to discuss the  survey input with his or her team, and  subsequently follow up with appropriate  and timely action.  Employee engagement is viewed as a  fundamental factor for all aspects of  company success in Maersk Line.   Employee engagement is therefore an  integral part of our leaders perfor- mance scorecards.   WORKPLACE SUSTAINABILITY Our commitment to sustainability is a good compass  and source of motivation.

In Maersk Line the integration is being  driven from many different functions   in the company. There is no doubt that  our leaderships commitment to sustain- ability has been a key driver of the   progress made so far.   CO2 reduction in  personal scorecards  In Maersk Line, CO2 reduction is on the  scorecard of senior management as well  as our CEO. During 2011, Maersk Line's  former CEO, Eivind Kolding was tasked  with reducing CO2 emissions per con- tainer moved by at least 3%. To that end, Maersk Lines fleet manage- ment function has been successful in   incentivising fuel and CO2 reduction  throughout the organisation.  Managers  performances are compared, and a  monthly report rates each services   energy efficiency based on an A-G rating  system. In 2011, Maersk Line reduced   its fuel consumption per container (TEU)  by 2.7% this way.    Articulating our value proposition Delivering best environmental perfor- mance is an integral part of our value  proposition to customers. Employees  ability to articulate how Maersk Line   can add value is essential to increase   demand for more responsible and envi- ronmentally efficient shipping services. In 2011, the commercial organisation  launched a campaign to help the sales  force engage with customers on the  long-term strategic value Maersk Line  can bring to customers supply chains.  The goal is to focus customer meetings  on factors that help bring our customer  success, for example waste reduction  through on-time reliability and a lower  supply chain footprint.  Training for employees In 2011, we  worked to increase the general  awareness and understanding of the  sustainability issues inherent to our busi- ness.

Our monthly safety report  shows the reported injuries for each  field of activity. It helps our organisa- tion examine trends and prioritise   efforts. In 2011, some of the highest  injury and risk areas were Manual   handling and Maintenance.  Manual handling includes a wide range  of manual handling activities, such as  lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling or car- rying. In 2011, manual handling injuries  increased from 21 to 29 cases. That is  concerning as manual handling often  results in back injuries affecting longer- term personal health and wellbeing.  In 2011, we registered a 40% increase in  injuries occurring during Maintenance  activities. In the Maintenance category  the highest risk area is maintenance  work on pressurised equipment. Equip- ment containing a liquid or gas under  pressure (such as boilers and steam  heating systems) must be handled with  extreme care. Minimising risks when  working with pressurised equipment will  therefore continue to be a focus area.

Mooring is the operation of secur- ing a container ship to a fixed quay or  berth by means of mooring lines or ca- bles. To improve our safety performance  in 2011 we launched a Safer Mooring  campaign on our ships.  In 2011, injuries occurring during moor- ing operations decreased by 30%.   We are not satisfied with the fact that  injuries still occur during this critical  task and will continue our focus on safe   mooring operations in 2012.  Taking near-miss reporting to the next level In 2011, we launched a campaign to   improve the reporting of near misses on  ships. A near miss is an unplanned event  that did not result in injury, illness, or  damage â€“ but had the potential to do so.  Only a fortunate break in the chain of  events prevented the injury.  Recognising and reporting near miss   incidents can make a major difference to  the safety of our employees. History has  shown repeatedly that most accidents  were preceded by warnings, near acci- dents or narrow escapes.  In	 2011,	 a	 Near	 Miss	 Safety	 Campaign	 helped us get reporting of near misses on  the radar. Subsequently, near miss reports  increased from 5,518 reports in 2010 to  13,148 reports in 2011, an increase of  240%.  Following up on near misses When a near miss report is submitted by  a ship, it is reviewed by the Marine Stand- ards department who provides assis- tance to the crews in preventing the near  miss from happening again. Captains  can view their near miss statistics and  compare it to their peers. The statistics  help the crews spot trends and risk areas.  The commitment of the crews to report  on near misses is essential to our safety  culture. It helps us create an open culture  in which we share risk assessments,  best practices and action plans in a   responsible manner. When an injury happens on board Safety meetings are held every month  on all Maersk Line ships to discuss safety  performance and decide on proactive  measures. When an injury does happen  it is crucial that it is being thoroughly   investigated and measurements are  taken to prevent it from happening  again. When an injury report is submit- ted by a ship, the injury is discussed in  detail with Marine Standards and subse- quently an action plan is made. In 2011,  Maersk Line added extra human re- sources to ensure sufficient following up  on injury reports. Port authorities inspect Maersk Line ships During the last two years we have seen  an increase in Port State Controls (PSC).  The trend is more frequent and detailed  inspections. The inspection is performed  by PSC officers who go on board to verify  that the condition of the ship and its  equipment comply with international  conventions, and that the vessel is  manned and operated in compliance  with applicable international law.  In 2010, PSC officers inspected 194 ships  through 265 inspections. In 2011, the   number increased to 202 vessels and  494 inspections.  In 65% of the inspec- tions, no deficiencies were recorded.    As a consequence of more rigid PSC in- spections, we launched several initiatives  to guarantee improvement. We have de- veloped guidelines on preventing deficien- cies, and findings in PSC audits are shared  across the fleet. We initiated a bench- mark study together with Boston Con- sulting Group who looked at our PSC per- formance. The report shows that we are  on par with the container industry aver- age for PSC deficiencies, which is approxi- mately one deficiency per inspection. In spite of having increased our focus on  PSC inspections we unfortunately had  five ship detentions this year. Avoiding fatigue through rest hour reporting  Crew members on Maersk Line ships  must get the rest time required by law.  Compliance with rest hour rules remains  a priority. We are following the principles  issued by the ILO 180 Convention to  monitor the hours of work and rest.   In 2011, we took several initiatives to   ensure the limits are not being violated.  A Rest Hour Awareness Campaign was  launched to improve the rest hour plan- ning on vessels. Captains and crews  have been trained in rest hour planning,  and rest hour reports are issued on a  monthly basis.                                                               say they receive relevant  safety training agree that Maersk Line is  committed to employee safety feel that Safety rules are  consistently enforced on board Voice of our seafarers WORKPLACE SUSTAINABILITY WORKPLACE SUSTAINABILITY 89% 90% 93% 0 46 40 54 251 200 13148 FATALLITY LOST TIME INJURIES RESTRICTED WORK ACCIDENTS MEDICAL TREATMENT CASES FIRST AID CASES DAMAGE TO PROPERTY NEAR MISSES Giving more attention to the bottom of the pyramid (near misses) helps us in our goal to eliminate the top of the pyramid (accidents and fatalities).

The refriger- ated containers exploded on three  separate occasions in Itajai, Brazil  and Cat Lai, Vietnam.  After a thorough investigation, we  found out that the explosions were  caused by contaminated refrigerants  allowing an otherwise inert system   to react violently. Together with the  main producer of the refrigerants we  located the main source to be a coun- terfeit product. We reached out to other shipping lines  through the industry association, the  World Shipping Council (WSC) and sub- sequently also the Container Owners'  Association (COA), and later on to  reefer machinery manufacturers, leading   forensic and test institutes amongst  others with the objective of sharing  knowledge and best practices in com- bating this threat.  Steps to prevent the issue from recur- ring have been taken with further initia- tives in the pipeline, for example the   development of new testing methods  and procedures. We hope that the indus- try continues to collaborate on preven- tative measures to restore safety and  confidence in the reefer container trans- portation industry. The issue of overweight containers  Overweight containers pose safety  risks to people and assets throughout  the entire transportation chain. They  remain a serious issue in almost all   regions and trades.  In the shipping industry wrongly declared  containers cause issues in vessel plan- ning and stowage. If there are too many  overweight containers stowed on deck, a  ship may lose stability and even capsize.  WORKPLACE SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 114  WORKPLACE SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 116 Addressing security risks Dealing with the threats of piracy Piracy continues to pose a consider- able impact on our seafarers and  business in general. The constant  threat impacts the safety and well- being of our employees, our service  and cost. Countering piracy remains  a high priority.  According to the International Chamber  of Commerce there have been 421   pirate attacks and 42 hijackings world- wide in 2011. Though many of these   incidents originate from armed robbery  stealing cargo or personal belongings  from crews, the majority is aimed at   hijacking crew, ships and cargo for   ransom. Most of these attacks occur in  the waters surrounding the failed state  of Somalia.  By the end of 2011, 10 ships and some  170 seafarers were held hostage by  Somali pirates.  The impact of piracy is  devastating in many ways Piracy from Somalia has a negative   impact on stability in East Africa as a  whole and causes a number of problems  locally, regionally and globally. First and foremost piracy is a threat to  the merchant seafarers who risk being  attacked, wounded, taken hostage or  killed whilst transiting the waters to  maintain global trade. Piracy has a con- siderable economic impact to global, re- gional and local economies, which suffer  from increased cost on import and ex- port. Piracy is also a threat to the environ- ment as it forces speed increases and  thereby creates higher air emissions.     According to private risk assessment  provider MaRisk, piracy around Somalia  resulted in 213 attacks and 30 hijackings  in 2011. Though the number of success- ful hijackings have been halved compared  to 2010, the number of attacks have not  decreased. The main reasons for this are  believed to be the increased efforts initi- ated by the shipping industry and the  continued international political will to  fight piracy. The better cooperation and  information sharing among the naval   entities and the industry also contrib- utes to the reduction of piracy attacks.  However, the present international activi- ties have not deterred the pirates from  attacking merchant vessels and incen- tives for piracy remain high in Somalia. Anti-Piracy Coordinator As a result of the development in piracy  activities in 2010, Maersk Line decided   to top already in-place initiatives by   employing a dedicated person to head  our Anti-Piracy coordination and to be   Maersk Lines point of contact regarding  piracy related issues.  The position as Anti-Piracy Coordinator,  which is believed to be the first of its kind  within the shipping industry, is also   responsible for Maersk Lines strategic  approach to fight piracy and for coordi- nation with international partners. Ship Protection Measures Prior to applying defensive measures   on ships, a thorough voyage risk   assessment is conducted in order to   define the specific protective measures  to be applied on the individual vessel  e.g. razor wire, extra lookout, safety  gear and safety drills.   The shipping industry is increasingly  finding it necessary to use armed guards  on vessels to ensure the safety of the  crew. However, arming merchant vessels  deals only with the symptoms of piracy  and is not a long term solution to the root  causes. 85% say Maersk Line is committed to  security (e.g. against piracy, theft  and armed robbery)  Voice of seafarers WORKPLACE SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 117 Maersk Line is in favour of the introduc- tion of mandatory weighing of contain- ers prior to loading. That would ensure  correct weight declarations and help  shipping lines reduce accidents and  loss of containers. We support and   encourage the International Maritime  Organisation (IMO) to establish such   legal requirements. Containers overboard There is a public perception, including  within the International Maritime   Organisation (IMO) and the EU Com- mission, that around 10,000 containers  are lost overboard container ships   every year.  If true, the safety and environmental risk  would be substantial. The container   carrier industry association therefore  assembled data for the past three years.  They arrived at an average annual loss of  approximately 675 containers, including  those resulting from single catastrophic  elements (defined as 50 and more   containers lost in a single event). Over the past five years, Maersk Line,   in comparison, lost on average 42 con- tainers annually. While severe weather  conditions can have an impact, some  can also be attributed to human error.  Overall, we have been able to maintain a  relatively low figure because of careful  and systematic checks and procedures  from the time of accepting the booking  until the container is physically loaded on  board. Our personnel and service provid- ers at land and sea will continue to spot  and isolate containers that may have   potential safety risks.  We are making progress in forming an  industry wide initiative that will help  shipping lines know the exact gross  weight of containers before loaded   on board our ships. Knowing the exact  weight on board will help us further   reduce the number of containers lost  overboard. Our overall objective remains  zero containers overboard. Safe Transportation In 2011, Maersk Line launched   a saftey training programme   for employees to highlight how   actions or non-actions on land   affect the safety of those at sea.  The course was completed by  548 employees.  Promoting comprehensive  and internationally led engagement In 2011, we continued our efforts in  keeping piracy on the international  agenda through engagement in senior- level counter piracy conferences in  Dubai and London. We actively engage  with organisations such as Combined  Maritime	Forces,	NATO	Shipping	Centre	 and Maritime Security Centre, Horn of  Africa as well as other high-level inter- national stakeholders. We continue to exchange information,  experiences and policies regarding piracy  with the two major shipping companies,  MSC and CMA CGM. Our three compa- nies represent approximately 36% of  container shipping worldwide; united we  have a strong voice keeping momentum  towards fighting piracy.  Finally, we maintain our good relations  with authorities, facilitate training of  special forces and continue to discuss  potential solutions to piracy with politi- cians, ship owner associations and   international partners. WORKPLACE SUSTAINABILITY Attacks Attempted attacks No single actor can successfully fight piracy alone â€“ the  root causes creating piracy can only be solved through  a comprehensive and international led engagement. Henrik Ehlers Kragh Head of Anti-Piracy Coordination, Maersk Line  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 118 Piracy attacks 2011 Source: MaRisk 2011 The threat of terrorism  On September 11, 2001, combating   the threat of terrorism became the   U.S. Customs and Border Protections  (CBP) number one priority.  On that day, the movement of goods  and people into the US came to halt.  Shortly after 9/11, CBP developed   the Customs-Trade Partnership against  Terrorism (C-TPAT) as the first coordi- nated response between industry and  government to secure US borders.  The C-TPAT program is a joint initiative  between CBP and trusted partners   including US importers, terminal oper- ators, shipping lines, and other supply  chain entities focusing on securing   the international supply chain. The   C-TPAT program is also considered the   restart mechanism of international  trade, should any future attack occur.  C-TPAT re-validation of Maersk Line and Safmarine  While a voluntary agreement, the C-TPAT  program has gradually evolved into   an industry standard, which many of  our customers include in their service   contract requirements. Maintaining  our membership in good standing is  important in order to retain and attract   business.  In 2011, Maersk Line and Safmarine suc- cessfully renewed its C-TPAT member- ship following a re-validation effort by  U.S. Customs trade security specialists.  WORKPLACE SUSTAINABILITY A.P.

We can- not, should not and do not operate in  a vacuum.  We are sensitive to the expectations and  pressures from our ever growing stake- holder universe and therefore engaging  in open exchange is no longer something  we consider optional, but increasingly a  license to operate.  For this reason, Maersk Line sought out  and further developed strong bonds  with our primary stakeholders through  strategic partnership and network en- gagement. We also actively engaged  more broadly in dialogues with acade- mia,	government,	thinktanks	and	NGOs.	 To maximise the benefits of partner- ships, we implemented a stakeholder  strategy that will continue to form the  backbone of our engagement in the  years to come.  Our stakeholders have encouraged us to  further challenge ourselves, raising the  bar on our performance and highlighting  areas for improvement. Innovation net- works and scientific partnerships have  increased the span and depth of our  knowledge pool allowing for better stra- tegic planning. Exchanges with regula- tors and key government actors have  brought us closer to creating a level   industry playing field. Strategic customer  partnerships have helped us to better  understand customer needs, enabling  targeted product and service innova- tion. Finally, thought leadership dia- logues in cross-industry forums have  generated new visions for what our   industry could aspire to in the future.

WHAT DO OUR STAKEHOLDERS THINK?  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2011 MAERSK LINE ROUTE 2 125 In 2011, the Maersk Group commis- sioned independent survey organi- sation Globescan to carry out a brand  reputation survey of all Maersk busi- nesses including Maersk Line.  Globescan asked a group of 400 stake- holders drawn from customers, employ- ees,	 NGOs,	 investors,	 government	 and	 media their impressions of Maersk Line  and its competitors. It's been good to  learn that Maersk Line is generally well  perceived and 80% of our stakeholders  would be happy to recommend us.  Globescan also asked respondents  what issues they felt were most impor- tant to Maersk's brand and reputation,  and how Maersk Line is performing. We  were encouraged to find we are doing  well on many of their priority issues - not  least our innovation capability, quality  service, financial strength and high safe- ty standards â€“ factors which have long  been key priorities within Maersk. Their  belief in our ability to open new markets  gives us confidence in our plans to ad- vance emerging markets trade. But our stakeholders were less con- vinced in other areas â€“ for example our  commitment to integrate sustainability  into investment decisions, and the level  of transparency we offer.  On different human resource issues,   we still have some way to go, with some  employees being concerned about the  reward structure and whether their voic- es are being sufficiently heard. This is important feedback. As our sus- tainability strategy enters its third year,  we are aware that we need to continue to  improve our employee and customer  value proposition, and engage more  openly with stakeholders so that we   understand their concerns and they can  see the changes we are making. As a   result we are building our efforts in   these areas and focusing harder on com- munication, stakeholder engagement  and relationship building. Globescan's conclusion was that our  solid business fundamentals support   a strong reputation, and that our sus- tainability strategy could strengthen it   further. Delivering on Sustainable Shipping Initiatives joint vision  for our industry will help drive needed change in operating  models - thereby allowing economies to grow, trade to  develop and social wealth to spread. Maersk Line has a license to act boldly on the global  stage. With that comes high expectations that extend  beyond the balance sheet. Maersk Line is seen as an   organization that not only can, but indeed should, play a  lead role in connecting people and markets to advance  global development. We think that will only benefit the  company in the long term.
