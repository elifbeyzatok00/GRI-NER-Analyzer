Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2010 CSR Report 2010 NEC Fielding, Ltd. IT is a new-age lifeline toward harmony  with people, communities,  and the environment Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2010 CSR Report 2010 NEC Fielding, Ltd. IT is a new-age lifeline toward harmony  with people, communities,  and the environment  Message from the President 1 A company marked by vitality based on human  resource development and dialogue, that  continues to grow with society As President of NEC Fielding, Ltd., I would like to thank  you for taking a look at our companys CSR Report 2010. It has always been our management style to engage  in activities driven by customer satisfaction (CS) and  corporate social responsibility (CSR). On the CS front,  we aim to rank clearly first in our industry through a  wider and swifter provision of supporting services for  use of IT systems that act as lifelines underpinning  socioeconomic capabilities, and with higher levels of  reliability and convenience. We also strive to propose IT  systems that will help to make the information  society more friendly to people and the earth. As for CSR, we are keenly aware of the mounting  needs and expectations in society at large for corporate  enterprises in this regard. These may be exemplified by  the release of a new international standard for social  responsibility (ISO 26000), the rising requirements for  preparation of business continuity plans in the event of  the outbreak of pandemic influenza and major disasters,  and the calls for corporate action to protect biological  diversity in line with the agenda of the 10th Meeting of  the Conference of Parties to the Convention on  Biological Diversity (COP 10) held in Nagoya in October  2010. Under these circumstances, we are taking action  not only to fulfill our obligations to society in all  directions and in all fields, but also to formulate our  second CSR Medium-term Plan toward our goal of  continuing to be a company that people trust and praise. Vitality deriving from people and dialogue In our view, the most important factor in our CS and  CSR activities is our human resources. We take pride in  supporting society as a whole through IT systems, and  feel confident thanks to the trust placed in us by  customers and communities for the aggregate of our  activities. In addition, we feel a sense of mission about  taking active approaches on all sorts of social issues,  not to mention our constant supply of security and  comfort to society through the IT support services that  are our main line. We develop human resources who  are equipped with all of these elements, and the vitality  born of interpersonal dialogue is the force driving our  growth. At present, we are placing emphasis on and  practicing dialogue in all in-house scenes in line with a  policy encompassing all employees, myself included.  The encounter of different perspectives breeds  communication and awareness of new things which, in  turn, encourages the further growth of individuals and  mutual collaboration among employees. We believe  this cycle helps to make the foundation of our  management even more solid. All-points CSR activities Grounded in this reinforcement of our management  foundation, our second CSR Medium-term Plan posts  all-points CSR activities as our basic policy, and  represents our determination to be a company that  remains trusted and praised by all of its stakeholders.  To this end, we are committed to maintenance of the  social infrastructure through our business proper, strict  compliance with all laws and regulations, and sure  discharge of our responsibilities in areas such as  preserving the transparency of our business. These basic  requirements are joined by proactive steps to resolving  issues in society and communities (such as alleviation  of environmental impact) through the activities of the  Fielding Philanthropy Club and work in our business.

This infrastructure-supporting role  is performed not only by customer engineers* (CEs),  who work directly with the customer, but also the  technicians and staff backing their activities. Our  employees feel a special gratification and joy knowing  that their own activities are actually supporting society. While renewing the sentiment of gratitude toward  the society and even individual customers who give us  this joy together with our employees, I hope that we  remain the kind of company that always continues to  grow with its customers. In our endeavors to this end, I ask for your  continued constructive advice and even more generous  support. * Customer engineer: An engineer that supports the customers use of their  IT system. We have around 4,300 customer engineers throughout Japan,  and they provide a range of support services.   The NEC Fielding CSR Report 2010 covers its CSR activities as  defined in the five aspects of CSR activities, based on its unique  CSR concept of the CSR Management Framework. Scope of the report  Period: The report summarizes the results and data regarding our  CSR initiatives during fiscal 2009 (April 2009 to March 2010).  Organizations: The report mainly focuses on the activities of NEC  Fielding, Ltd., but also includes its group companies in some  sections (                       ). Any scope of information covering  specific organizations is referred explicitly on each relevant  section. Making the report easier to read and understand We have changed the content and layout of the report so as to  make it much easier to read and understand for our stakeholders*.  Unfamiliar technical or specialized words are noted with a*  symbol, and explained immediately after the word.  A                         mark is placed on the relevant pages which  takes the reader to further information on other pages of the  report. Environmentally-friendly printing We have adopted the environmentally-friendly printing method to  produce the CSR report, using the followings;   CPT (computer-to-plate) technology which allows exposing of  printing plates directly and eliminates the need for film;  Vegetable-oil based inks which help to reduce air pollution; and  FSC-certified paper which guarantees it comes from responsible  sources managed to meet the social, economic and ecological  needs.

The term  previously referred to a shareholder or customer in principle. However, as  the concept of CSR has permeated in our society, it became widely thought  that the term should include all parties who affect or are affected by  corporate activities, such as suppliers and other business partners, local  communities, non-profit organizations (NPOs), employees, and future  generations. We at NEC Fielding are committed to discharge our accountability to all our  stakeholders from the perspective of CSR, and thereby developing  synergistically with our society.

Office Participation in the neighborhood clean- up deepens my awareness of being a  member of the local community and  gives me a graphic sense of actually  contributing to it (for information on the  clean-up activities at all offices  nationwide,                      ). In addition, it refreshes my body,  which felt like sleeping before I start  work, and gave me a lift on the job that  dayor at least I think it did. 5 Corporate Summary START Environment Society Employment Market G/A Environment Society Employment G/A Environment Society Society Market Market G/A Environment Society Employment Market G/A Environment Society Employment G/A Environment Society Society Market Market G/A Society Employment 8:00 AM Arrival  at the office CSR Check! CSR Check! Special Feature A Customer Engineers Day CSR activities permeating daily work NEC Fieldings main line is supporting services for IT systems, the lifelines of the new age. Each and  every one of our employees goes about his or her daily work with a sense of pride, confidence, and  mission about our role in supporting the social infrastructure. Our customer engineers, who number  about 4,300 nationwide and deal directly with customers in their work, engage in CSR activities in  various other scenes with the awareness that their very work constitutes CSR activity. Let's look at  the typical day of one of these customer engineers. The figure at right shows the CSR activity field in which the  activities conducted by the CE lie in the particular span of time. * G/A = governance/accountability CSR Check! Cleaning up the neighborhood Today is the day on which we clean up the  neighborhood of the office once a week. I always get  to the office 15 minutes early, but today I came a little  earlier and helped to clean up the sidewalks and  parks in the area of the office. see page 55  Customer sites Even things people think they  understand are driven home better when  we all recite them in unison (for  information on the priority reminders,                       ). The office-specific  reminders for recitation are determined  at monthly office meetings. We also  believe that having employees propose  reminders from their point of view is  important for heightening awareness. We are introducing eco cars  (                      ) toward the goal of having  all company cars replaced with eco  models by the end of fiscal 2014. As of  the end of fiscal 2009, eco cars  accounted for 91% of the company fleet. NEC Fielding services some 5.3 million  IT systems at about 290,000 companies  nationwide. These services are provided  by our customer engineers, who number  about 4,300.                      for the maintenance  formation. Continued use of superannuated UPS and  batteries could possibly cause accidents.  On their visits to customer locations, CEs  are instructed to check the service life of  equipment and fulfill their obligation to  explain things by making notices and  proposals if the life is exceeded. 6  Special Feature: A Customer Engineers Day Environment Society Employment Market G/A Environment Society Employment G/A Environment Society Society Market Market G/A Society Employment Environment Environment Market Employment G/A Environment Society Employment Market G/A Environment Society Employment G/A Environment Society Society Market Market G/A Society Employment Environment Environment Market Employment G/A Environment Society Employment Market G/A Environment Society Employment G/A Environment Society Society Market Market G/A Society Employment Environment Environment Society Employment Market G/A Environment Society Employment G/A Environment Society Society Market Market G/A Society Employment Environment Environment Market Employment G/A 9:00 AM Travel to  customer sites 8:30 AM Morning  gathering (Start of work) CSR Check!

Reciting priority reminders Besides conveying the necessary items of  communication, our morning gatherings are devoted  to reciting priority reminders for prevention of  incidents and accidents. These priority points include  some that are specific to each office and some that  are common to all offices that particular month.

Preventive maintenance through periodic work This is the main work of a  customer engineer. IT  systems are the lifelines  supporting the social  infrastructure. Work at  customer sites gives me a  sense of fulfillment and  responsibility about actually  sustaining society. Product safety activities A check of the customers system revealed that it  was using a UPS* whose service life was over. I  explained how this could lead to an accident, and was  told that they would consider replacement. see page 64 see page 29  Office Customer sites 7 Corporate Summary Environment Society Employment Market G/A Environment Society Employment G/A Environment Society Society Market Market G/A Society Employment Environment Environment Market Employment G/A Environment Society Employment Market G/A Environment Society Employment G/A Environment Society Society Market Market G/A Society Employment Environment Environment Market Employment G/A Employment G/A Environment Society Society Market Market G/A Society Employment Environment Environment Market Employment G/A Environment Society Employment Market G/A Environment Society Employment G/A Environment Society Society Market Market G/A Society Employment Environment Environment Market Employment G/A 11:00 AM Return to  the office 12:00 PM Lunch break 1:30 PM Responding to  a service call CSR Check! CSR Check! CSR Check! CSR Check! Besides group class, employees can get  instruction at their own desks through  web learning. The curricula ranges from  technical instruction needed to maintain  and improve capabilities as a customer  engineer to education required for action  and behavior as a conscientious adult  (                      ). To alleviate environmental burden imposed  by business activities, the company is  adopting eco cars and EnepalTM  computers, and promoting reduced use of  transportation means through discussion  via videoconference systems  (                      ). The practice of turning off  lights during the lunch break is performed  at all sites as something all can do. For information on approaches to  information security,                     . Another important role of CEs is to make  proposals to customers. Although the  specific sales activities are generally  performed by personnel assigned  exclusively to them, comments by CEs  who are trusted by customers can  occasion deals (for information on  EnepalTM computers,                    ). Taking a class (web learning) I returned to the  office and finished  the paperwork from  the visits, so I took a  class for which a  designation had  come until the noon  break. Because I  take the class  through the web education system, I can get the  instruction right at my desk. Next week, I plan to take  get some technical instruction in a group class. Turning off the lights in the office During the lunch break, we turn off the lights on the  floors to lighten impact on the environment, even just  a little. Protecting customer information An instruction for trouble-shooting came in from a call  center. The customer seems to need a new hard disk  drive (HDD). HDDs must be carefully handled  because they store the customers precious  information. I put a security lock on the old HDD so it  cannot be read, and then take it with me. I make sure  to perform a virus check when removing test media  from the site and also after use at the customer site. Proposal of environmentally-friendly PCs The customers computers are old and consume a lot  of electricity. I was told that they are taking active  steps to mitigate environmental problems, and  therefore intend to  advise them to  switch to EnepalTM  models, which  consume little power  and have power- saving software built  right in. see page 45 see page 64 see page 57 see page 25  Local community Office 8  Special Feature: A Customer Engineers Day 4:00 PM Return to  the office 5:30 PM Group Meeting The CE job also  requires stamina,  but I think the  most important  thing is a smile. My  workplace is  staffed with  pleasant but  hard-working  people from my  superior down, and everyone works with a  smile and a business-like attitude. I believe  this is because we all communicate  thoroughly with each other in the workplace  discussions and in our routine work. This  naturally also applies to dealings with  customers. I always try to keep a smile on  my face when meeting or making reports to  customers, but to be all-business on the job.

CSR Check! CSR Check! Extra activity Saturday The work record data base contains entries of  information on work performed for customers  nationwide (5.3 million systems at 290,000  companies). This information serves as the basis for  analysis of trends by system type and phenomenon,  and is extensively utilized for management of the  quality and safety of products and work. The photo shows employees from the Dotoh  Branch Office of the Hokkaido Branch  Division who participated in the 24-hour  endurance race using ordinary street  bicycles. Besides being a form of social  contribution, the race is also a form of  recreation that heightens the sense of  togetherness at the office (for information on  social contribution activities,                         ). Paperwork I returned to the  office and did  paperwork such  as entering the  days work into  the work record  data base and  processing the  return of parts  after replacement. Discussion in the workplace Today, we had our monthly group meeting. At the  same time, we held the workplace discussion to talk  about things such as priority reminders, activities of  social contribution, and improvement of the  workplace environment as well as items of  business communication. Because employees are  often out of the office visiting customers during  the day, the meeting is generally held in the  evening. There is a lively exchange of ideas for  making the workplace and work better.  It was busy again today, but I accomplished a lot.  Im ready to do my best again tomorrow. Participation in local events Although today is Saturday, there is a civic event for  which I have helped to make preparations with some  other colleagues beginning about six months ago. It  is volunteer work, but I am going to enjoy  participating as well. see page 51  Corporate Summary 9 Management Philosophy Scheme, Corporate Principle,  and Charter of Corporate Behavior Using Fielding activities* to facilitate new dynamism and business expansion for our customers,  whilst also contributing to the creation of a stable and prosperous society.

A global leading company building  the information society friendly  to humans and the Earth with innovation NEC Fielding aspires to be a best partner  continuing to create valuable services  and to support the information society friendly to humans and the Earth NEC Group Vision 2017 NEC Group Vision 2017 and Mission Statement * Mission Statement: A clear statement of the companys mission and a promise to stakeholders.   Information and communications technology (ICT) is a lifeline supporting todays social infrastructure, and has become indispensable for the efficient and safe  operation and control of all sorts of socioeconomic functions. NEC Fielding is committed to helping customers utilize their ICT systems with ease and peace of mind.  To this end, it provides services in accordance with NEC Vision 2017, which is aimed at evolution into a global leading company building the information society  friendly to people and the Earth with innovation. More specifically, it offers services in ICT support through its network of service sites operating around the clock,  365 days a year (as of the end of March 2010, these sites numbered 439 in Japan and seven in two other countries). It may also be noted that expectations of  companies in the international community are no longer confined to the output of their business; they extend to demands for action to assist the resolution of social  issues. Besides supporting the Global Compact as an international standard and discharging its corresponding mission, NEC Fielding aspires to be a company whose  employees all act with a sense of pride, confidence, and mission, and are trusted by society. The Global Compact was advocated by Kofi Annan, then the  United Nations Secretary-General, in January 1999 to address  issues arising with globalizat ion. The companies subscribing to  it are called upon to support and practice universal principles  covering ten items in the four fields of human rights, labour  standards, the environment, and anti-corruption (see the list at  right). In June 2004, NEC Fielding  became the 15th Japanese company  to announce its support of the Global  Compact. As of July 30, 2010, the  member companies numbered more  than 8,000 worldwide and 115 in  Japan. NEC Fielding works for rigorous  compliance with the Global Compact  and its principles among its employees  and is engaged in vigorous activities  based on them.  CSR of NEC Fielding  11 TOPICS 1   Stakeholders Meeting We held a tour of the NEC Nakagawara  Technical Center to promote understanding  of NEC Fieldings business, and got a lot of  feedback as well Holding of the CSR Report 2009 Feedback  Meeting On January 13 (Wed.), 2010, we held the CSR Report  2009 Feedback Meeting. This meeting was the third in  a series which began in December 2007, and was the  first to include a tour of the NEC Nakagawara Technical  Center. Together with the meeting, the tour helped to  deepen understanding of NEC Fieldings business  among the participants. The meeting produced a frank and extended  exchange of views on issues based on the contents,  such as the types of activities of social contribution  befitting NEC Fielding. We take the opinions voiced at  this meeting seriously as valuable advice, and plan to  reflect them in the preparation of CSR Report 2010 as  well as in efforts to raise the level of CSR activities  themselves even higher.  Date:  Wednesday, January 13, 2010  Location: NEC Nakagawara Technical Center  Program: (1) Tour of the NEC Nakagawara  Technical Center   (2) CSR Report 2009 Feedback  Meeting  Participants (affiliations are as of the time of the meeting)  Takashi Togawa (Hirayama Ikuo Volunteer Center,  Waseda University)  Mitsukuni Ishihara (Waseda University) Midori Asano (Waseda University) Yuki Manabe (Keio University) Satoshi Ida (Keio University) Yoshinori Tsunai (Nishi Kanto Branch Division) Hirokazu Ueda (Shibuya Branch Office, Tokyo Branch  Division) Tatefumi Kushibe (Assistant General Manager, CSR  and Internal Auditing Division) Overview of the CSR Report 2009 Feedback Meeting Located in the city of Fuchu, Tokyo, the Nakagawara  Technical Center occupies an area of 3,769.5 m2, and is  equipped with facilities for employee training and  education.  TOPICS 1   Stakeholders Meeting 12 Tour of the NEC Nakagawara Technical Center NEC Nakagawara Technical Center The CSR Report 2009 Feedback Meeting was  preceded by a tour of the Nakagawara Technical Center.  The Center contains the Customer Support Center (call  center), which handles first contact with customers and  is attached to the Eastern Japan Customer Support  Division, and a unit in charge of technology and  research. It is also used as a facility for training and  educating employees, and functions as the central  facility of technical activities at NEC Fielding. Introduction to call centers at the heart of our  business The tour began with orientation in which participants  were given a profile of the company and introduced to  the routine operations  of a call center and  support formations.  Next, the group  moved to the  aforementioned call  center and watched,  through the window,  the activities of the  operators (former  customer engineers),  who field calls from customers around the clock, 365  days a year. In the interest of more accurate response,  the conversations between the customers and  operators are committed to text by a voice recognition  system. All of the participants were engrossed by a  demonstration of conversation being put into writing in  real time. After the tour, the participants were given a  presentation on employee education and training. They  entered a technical training room which is ordinarily off  limits to unauthorized personnel, and viewed an actual  training session. The tour presumably provided a  glimpse of the business activities of NEC Fielding that  cannot be communicated in their entirety in the CSR  Report. Comments by tour participants Confirmation of a company that can be trusted Mr. Takashi Togawa I read both the 2008 and 2009 editions of the CSR  Report in the last two years, and got the impression  that NEC Fielding is an extremely trustworthy company.  My impression was corroborated by the tour of the call  center and observation of the education and training  session this time, which were very worthwhile. Corporate enthusiasm you could feel Mr. Mitsukuni Ishihara I had imagined that the call center would be staffed  with a group of part-timers. But at NEC Fielding, I saw  professionals who knew the actual situation striving to  provide the best services. I could just feel their  enthusiasm. The tour erased my preconception. Empathy with the human-centered stance Ms. Midori Asano Working at a call center must entail a lot of stress, but  the operators seemed to be going about their job in the  special booths with plenty of leeway. I sensed the  concern for the environment in which the employees  work, and it struck me as a very good thing. It  confirmed the human-centered activities noted in the  Report. A company where one would like to work Mr. Yuki Manabe It was the second time for me to participate in the CSR  Report Feedback Meeting. The tour of the Technical  Center this time was very valuable for getting a better  picture of the company. It showed me that NEC  Fielding was really putting resources into and emphasis  on education. This is a welcome stance as viewed from  my perspective as a student. I imagine the company is  a place where anyone would want to work.  Conveyance of earnestness about the CSR Report Mr. Satoshi Ida The Report struck me as very well put together, but did  not give me a firm grasp of what the company was  doing. The tour this time gave me a good idea of the  companys business and its need for preparing the  Report in earnest. As such, it was really worthwhile. The employee conducting the tour played the role of a customer making a call  to the center. An operator took the call, and the demonstration continued until  the conversation ended. We promoted participants understanding  of our business through company profile  DVD and other materials.  CSR of NEC Fielding  13 (1) Social problems surrounding NEC  Fielding (2) Significance of corporate involvement  in activities of social contribution CSR Report 2009 Feedback Meeting Exchange of opinion in search of activities befitting NEC Fielding After the tour of the NEC Nakagawara Technical Center, Takashi Miyamoto, the director responsible for CSR, opened  the CSR Report 2009 Feedback Meeting with remarks in which he thanked the participants and asked them for a  lively exchange of opinion. The participants, who had read the Report by themselves in advance, discussed advisable  avenues of CSR activity, particularly as regards social contribution. This section presents a brief outline of opinions on  three themes. Ms. Midori Asano Koichi Ueda Mr. Satoshi Ida Mr. Mitsukuni Ishihara Linkage with the community in units of offices All companies are being asked to  maintain good ties with the local  community. NEC Fielding has  about 400 locations nationwide,  and I think this is one of its key  features. I believe it would be a  good idea for each office to  develop activities of social  contribution adapted to the host  community. This will presumably  deepen their ties with the  community and make NEC  Fielding even stronger. Passing things on to children as tomorrows  principals I think NEC Fielding could do  something for our children, to  whom the future belongs, as a  company engaged in IT support  business. One home delivery firm  is holding classes in traffic safety  at a kindergarten on a volunteer  basis. We, too, definitely should  be able to pass something on to  children by drawing on our IT  support technology and other  features. As I see it, this is our  No. 1 task. Strength for closing the digital divide Takefumi Kushibe In todays society, the digital divide is  steadily widening. This is a problem that  must be resolved in the future. For us at  NEC Fielding, IT is at the core of our  business and our field of greatest  competence. Precisely for this reason, I  believe resolution of the digital divide is a  task we must address as part of our  mission. CSR as presenting opportunities for growth So far, I think companies have  considered CSR activities a cost.  Lately, however, corporate views  of them have been changing. One  telecom firm developed a mobile  phone especially for the aged and  challenged persons as part of its  CSR activities, and improved its  performance as a result. As this  indicates, CSR presents  companies with opportunities. At  NEC Fielding, our very existence is linked to social  contribution. I believe we could become a more  interesting firm if we made full use of our IT support  capabilities in areas such as initiatives for disaster  response. Need for social contribution through the business Corporate social responsibility has come to the fore  because of widening recognition  on the corporate, citizen, and  global levels that companies  cannot subsist unless they  discharge their responsibilities as  members of society. Companies  are now being asked to find their  own distinctive ways of fulfilling  these responsibilities. I think that,  ideally, development of our  business in a sustainable form  would in itself constitute fulfillment of CSR and be  linked to social contribution.  Continued focus on the HRD Through involvement in volunteer  work, people build their character  and grow as human beings.  Participation in social contribution  activities helps to develop human  resources. The Fielding  Philanthropy Club is nothing less  than a variety of human resource  development. I regard it as an  organization that conveys the  character of the company, and  hope it always remains in action. Need for action with an awareness of other  countries In regions such as Asia and  Africa, there are still many  countries without a decent IT  infrastructure. The installation of  IT infrastructures in such  developing countries could in  itself make a big contribution to  the society and expand business  prospects. I think you ought to  take a look at other countries  around the world instead of  confining your vision to Japan. Social contribution based on our main  business In my view, when all is said and  done, it would be advisable to  develop social contribution linked  to our main business, which  would also be in keeping with the  personality of our company. NEC  Fielding does business  nationwide, and almost all of the  ordinary work makes use of the  car. A switch to eco models for  company cars therefore appears  to be a viable step. It could immediately be taken and  would benefit both the society and the environment. 14 (3) Social contribution activities    befitting NEC Fielding NEC Fielding established the  CSR Committee and launched  CSR activities in 2003, and  began publishing the CSR  Report in 2006. The Report has  been prepared through a process  of trial and error, and we hold the  meeting to read it as an occasion  for hearing the views of external  parties on matters such as the advisable contents. This  meeting, which was the third in the series, gave us the  opportunity to discuss questions such as the proper  modes of social contribution for NEC Fielding and the  nature of CSR activities themselves as well as how the  Report should be prepared. CSR activities will never be  finished. We intend to continue working to raise the  quality of the Report and the activities by reflecting the  views gathered from our stakeholders through this  meeting and other venues. (Posts as of the time of the meeting) Desire to heighten the quality of the Report  and even activities through the meeting Takefumi Kushibe  Assistant General Manager, CSR Management Promotion Div. As I see it, CSR should not be  viewed in isolation. We are  engaged in IT support business  and various other corporate  activities, and all of them  constitute CSR. Companies  engaged in CSR activities are  trusted by society and further  extend their business with the  backing of this trust. Furthermore, the expansion of  their business leads to development of their human  resources. The continuation of this genuinely upward  spiral for sustained advancement may be equated  with CSR discharge. Considering the matter in light of  the opinions you voiced today, I realized all over again  that, for us, fulfillment of CSR lies in raising the quality  of our corporate activities, developing our human  resources, and responding to the needs of society. In response to the opinions of participants CSR activities as linked to an upward  spiral for growth Hisashi Owada, General Manager, CSR Management Promotion Div. Mr. Takashi Tokawa Mr. Yuki Manabe Yoshinori Tsunai TOPICS 1   Stakeholders Meeting  We launched CSR activities upon instituting the CSR  Committee in May 2003 and formulating our CSR  Activity Policy in December of that year. To reinforce  our setup for CSR activity promotion, the Committee  was superseded by the CSR Promotion Division* in  April 2005. This made it possible for us to lead all units  in the Company with management integrating CSR  elements, and to construct a setup for systematic and  ongoing fulfillment of our corporate mission. In February 2010, we formulated our second CSR  Medium-term Plan to achieve all-points CSR  activities. * Renamed to CSR Promotion Division in April, 2010 Promotion Phase of  CSR Activities (2007-2010)   CSR  Committee     CSR    Promotion  Division       CSR and      Internal    Auditing  Division       CSR      Management    Promotion  Division March 1957   The Company founded April 2000   Name changed to NEC Fielding, Ltd.

Our Fundamental CSR Policy History of our CSR activities * Stakeholder: please refer to page 3.  We think that all corporate activities should fall under  CSR activities. In our recognition, a company should seek to  develop itself in the following steps: first, the state of  an ordinary company which fulfills its basic responsibility  by heightening profitability (economic responsibility)  through its compliance with applicable laws and  regulations (compliance responsibility) and healthy  business activities; second, the state of a earning  company which is able to pay high compensation and  dividends (economic duty); third, the state of a reliable  company with fulfilling work which conducts fair,  honest, and environment-conscious businesses (ethical  duty); and the last, the stage of a superior and  praiseworthy company which makes social contributions  through its business activities to create a better society  (social contribution duty). NEC Fielding is striving for top corporate value by  fulfilling its basic responsibilities as a foundation,  steadily undertaking conscientious activities on sound  growth of business, and steadily fulfilling its social  contribution duties.

In the field of business continuity plans (BCP), we were particularly praised not only for our  own BCP preparation but also for our both diverse and proactive approaches to development of BCP support as a business activity. In dealings with customers, we won high ratings for our diverse action related to CS, products/services, and related laws and regulations. At the same  time, there were expectations for measures in areas such as construction of a management system for complaint processing and announcement of  the status of improvement. In dealings with suppliers, we are required to act based on labor conditions and employment environment standards on  the fronts of supplier selection and support. We received a high praise overall for our efforts for human rights and preparation of employee-friendly workplaces. However, we also received some  negative comments on needs for improvement in the aspects of employer responsibility (i.e., the low rate of women in managerial positions indicating  issues related to sexual equality) and human resource performance (insufficient provisions available for free choice of lifestyle). We were given high marks for our activities in line with the priority fields, such as establishment of the Fielding Philanthropy Club and support for  volunteer work by our employees, the companywide support for fields tied to the main business in times of disaster, and the activities for tree-planting  and education. For the future there are expectations for further improvement of activities in China, which will become an important overseas market. In connection with our management system, we won high ratings for the certification of all offices at all domestic Group companies under ISO 14001  and our regular program of environmental education. In regard to environmental targets and plans, however, there were some suggestions for greater  involvement with local residents and environmental NPOs as well as integration of overseas Group companies in activities. In the aspect of  environmental performance, we also received high marks for our routine concern for the environment, green purchasing and procurement, recycling,  and various other initiatives. At NEC Fielding, we categorize all CSR activities into a  CSR management framework with five fields:  governance and accountability; market; employment;  social contribution; and the environment.  We create clear indices for activities in each field,  and advance the five aspects of CSR activities within  this framework. CSR management framework Morningstar Japan K.K. (Morningstar) is a joint venture between  Softbank Finance Corporation and Morningstar Inc. in U.S. and  provides comprehensive financial information, including the  evaluation of equity investment trusts. Morningstar also publishes  the MS-SRI Index (Morningstar Socially Responsible Investment  Index), an index composed of selected SRI shares and was jointly  developed with the Center for Public Resources Development, a  non-profit think tank & consulting firm, as one part of its efforts  to actively promote business related to socially responsible  investing (SRI). When selecting companies to be included in the  index, companies are comprehensively evaluated in regards to  both responsibility and creativity in five fields—governance/ accountability, market, employment, social contribution, and the  environment. Liquidity of shares is also taken into consideration. We have been selected as one of the 150 companies in the  MS-SRI Index since July 2003 up to present (fiscal 2010), and  continuously granted A as an overall rating since fiscal 2004.  18 CSR Management — 2 *1   Internal Auditing Office was reorganized as the Internal Auditing Division, an independent first-tier division in April, 2010. *2   First-tier divisions refer to branches, business promotion divisions, and corporate staff divisions, which manage sales locations (branch level).

It may also be noted that enactment of the Financial Instruments and  Exchange Act in 2006 made solid arrangements for internal control a natural  obligation of listed companies, and this made compliance even more  important for us. In response, besides tightening internal control* by  constructing a system for segregation of duties, our Division has launched a  full-fledged program of sales compliance education. The segregation of duties provides systemic assurance for compliance,  but it cannot perform this function unless the employees in direct contact  with customers are all aware of its importance and act accordingly. It has  been four years since the program started, but the in-house awareness of  what each employee has to do to tighten compliance is still somewhat  lacking. So far, we have placed priority on enhancing knowledge of laws and  regulations. For the future, I would like the education to also assist  proposals in sales activities for tightening compliance at customer sites.  This would encourage employees to be more active about taking classes.  As a result, it should have the effect of heightening awareness of  compliance throughout the company and help to better the corporate  culture. Masateru Yamasaki   General Manager, Sales Governance Div. Keener awareness of compliance linked to  proposals to customers Setup for checking compliance 19 * Internal control: In general, it refers to controlling, monitoring and guaranteeing the reliability of  operations within a company, through standardization and documentation of these processes, in order  to monitor illegal behaviors and ensure a sound business environment.

In response, we  decided to separate business processing work from the  sales locations, to have the entire business process  managed and controlled at the Sales Governance  Division. This accomplished a setup for internal control  based on the segregation of duties.    Construction of the setup to reinforce  compliance, and related activities April 2005  Launch of the project for segregation of  duties October 2005 Leading establishment of the Tokyo and  Osaka Business Centers April 2006  Simultaneous opening of nine Business  Centers across the country September 2006 Start of sales compliance education March 2007  Institution of the Sales Governance Division   Change of Business Center name to BC  Center April 2008  Establishment of the Yokohama BC Center April 2009  Establishment of the Income  Accounting Center in Tokyo July 2009  Establishment of the Income  Accounting Center in Osaka Sales compliance education NEC Fielding conducts group seminars for sales  compliance education. There are both basic and  advanced seminars. The basic seminars are held for  sales personnel in the manager class, and take up  specific cases in areas such as dealings with  customers and performance of internal procedures.  They are aimed at raising levels of compliance  awareness and knowledge. The advanced seminars are  held for personnel on the level of office heads, and  impart key points in management of sales employees. In addition, all sales personnel receive basic  education in sales compliance in the form of e-learning. In recent years, the establishment of the system of  segregated duties based in the BC Centers has led  to a rise in the compliance awareness of sales  personnel. Partly because I was placed in a position  of guiding subordinates, I wanted to get more  knowledge in this area, and so decided to enroll in  the program of sales compliance education. The  seminar I attended was based in actual cases that  facilitated understanding, and enabled me to  reconfirm important points of contracts linked  directly to business, for example. It goes without saying that people have to  observe the law. But to do so, they must have a  good knowledge of it. With knowledge, they can  also offer advice to customers and say no to  unreasonable requests from customers that could  violate the law. I now see that to observe the rules  of compliance is to protect yourself and, by  extension, your company. As a result of my transfer to the Sales Governance  Division in April 2009, I began serving as an  instructor in the sales compliance seminars along  with my regular duties in the Examining Department  in October of the same year. Before that, I had had  absolutely no teaching experience. When I was first  leading a seminar by myself, I felt a lot of pressure  and was so nervous that I had trouble sleeping the  night before. These days, I am trying to find ways of  getting the students to accept compliance with a  positive outlook while drawing on the experiences I  had when I was working in sales. Once they understand what compliance  demands, employees can also understand how they  should act. Similarly, management by superiors  becomes clear-cut, and subordinates can go about  their sales activities with peace of mind. For this  reason, I encourage people to make sure and read  the internal rules before taking the seminar. By so  doing, the instruction will better ring a bell with  them and their awareness as sales personnel will  change a degree.

As for the results of the fiscal 2009 activities, in  the field of information security, we continued  efforts to heighten employee awareness with a  digital covenant. In the field of business  continuity planning (BCP), we made an external  disclosure concerning our BCP premised on  outbreak of pandemic influenza, which we  began to prepare in fiscal 2008. For the future, we see a need  for reinforcement of  governance throughout the  NEC Fielding Group. To this  end, we intend to take steps  including enhancement of  awareness in the management  layer on the Group level and  information-sharing. Our company has a board of directors and a board of  corporate auditors. We also introduced a scheme of  corporate officers, in order to ensure swifter decision- making and more efficient supervisory and monitoring  functions of the board of directors. The board of directors holds provisional meetings  when needed as well as regular monthly meetings. It  reviews and discusses important issues prior to  meetings, thus enabling more flexible and appropriate  management decisions. In addition, to clarify the  management responsibilities, the tenure of directors is  limited to one year.  The board of corporate auditors, on the one hand,  meets six times a year. Our corporate auditors and an  accounting auditor (KPMG AZSA & Co.), as well as our  internal audit division (Internal Auditing Division) work  in close collaboration with each other, through exchange  of information related to audit activities as needed. Ensuring corporate governance of subsidiaries  We send directors and corporate auditors to our  subsidiaries, and provide guidance and support in  creating a legal-compliance framework, in order to  ensure corporate governance of our subsidiaries. Our  internal audit division (Internal Auditing Division) also  audits our subsidiaries, providing guidance and  recommendations for improvements as necessary. Setup of corporate governance* * Corporate governance: A framework for monitoring corporate  management. Specifically, it has functions to monitor the management who  are committed to manage their company with the goal of maximizing  shareholders interest. These functions include setting targets for the  management, evaluating and monitoring their performance to produce  reasonable shareholders value.

This step is allowing the company  to strengthen both coordination and horizontal  deployment of information among concerned units, for  better governance. We have established an internal control system, which  consists of various types of systems such as a risk  management system and information security system,  under our Basic Policy on Construction of the Internal  Control System determined in accordance with Article  362, Paragraph 5 of the Companies Act of Japan. Back-office operations such as processing orders,  sales, and payments were previously carried out at  branches and sales offices. In order to establish the  segregation of duties, we have relocated all back-office  works from sales locations to business compliance  centers (BC Centers) located in nine sites around Japan. In fiscal 2009, we established the Income  Accounting Center, a dedicated unit for handling of  incoming payments, to enhance control and increase  efficiency. Instatement of the unit system Constructing an internal control* system Establishing the segregation of duties by  separating back-office operations * Internal control: Please refer to page 19.  Pursuant to Article 362, Paragraph 5 of the  Companies Act of Japan, we have determined  the following basic policy with respect to  systems (internal control systems) set forth in  Article 362, Paragraph 4, Item 6 of the  Companies Act, as well as in Article 100,  Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Ordinance for  Enforcement of the Companies Act. Under such  basic policy, we ensure appropriateness of, and  constantly review, improve, and enhance our  business operations, according to changing  conditions of social, economic, and other  aspects in our business environment. Roles of BC Centers Governance/ accountability  Review of the Crisis Management Committee NEC Fielding is considering a review of the Crisis  Management Committee, which is at the core of its risk  management system. The Committee has had a  membership of qualified personnel selected by each  organizational unit. This is going to be replaced with a  membership consisting entirely of corporate officers  and subsidiary presidents, in the interest of more  prompt management judgments and decisions in the  face of risks. It has also been decided to establish  ad-hoc examination subcommittees to address specific  risks as bodies ancillary to the Committee. This will  permit the study and drafting of more initiatives tailored  more closely to the particular type of risk. Cases of risk actualization in fiscal 2009 and their  handling Fiscal 2009 unfortunately saw the actualization of risks in  forms such as loss of employee ID and access security  cards as well as mobile phones and other items. In response, besides continuing to implement the  conventional steps (e.g., web education about  information security and protection of personal  information, rigorous checking and wearing of straps to  hold employee ID and access security cards and mobile  phones, and security settings on mobile phones), we  issued priority reminders for attention to prevent risk  actualization throughout the company and had  employees recite them at morning gatherings in each  workplace, in order to enhance awareness.

It is an operations-management  methodology for effectively minimizing unforeseen damages from all types  of threats, at the minimum cost.   Approach to risk management* To avoid management crisis, we focus on the following  initiatives:   1. Increase the degree of penetration of risk  management and expand the risk management  system;   2. Provide measures to follow up and reduce  existing risks;   3. Identify new risks and provide measures to  prevent them;   4. Decide divisions in charge of managing  recognized risks and debate collateral measures  (such as insurance); and 5. Conduct periodic risk assessments.   see page 26  Anti-pandemic measures In response to the spread of H1N1 influenza in 2009,  NEC Fielding implemented the following measures to  curtail infection among its employees to the minimum,  in light of its role as a firm maintaining socioeconomic  capabilities.

In fiscal 2009, we created a new BCP to respond to  a new influenza pandemic, and released it within and  outside the company. * BCP (business continuity plan): A plan (document) indicating policies and  procedures for ensuring the continuity of the companies business in the  event of natural disasters, terrorism, or other unforeseen events. Approach to BCPs* 1. Place the highest priority on checking the safety  of employees and their family, providing aid  and support, and preventing secondary  disasters. 2. Create a system that allows the resumption of  operations*1 on the following day after a  disaster hits. 3. Create a system that allows the resumption of  business*2 on the second day after a disaster  hits. *1 Resumption of operations: resume minimal in-house  operations, including receiving damage reports *2 Resumption of business: actively call on customers and fully  resume business following the recovery of customer systems NEC Fielding established the following basic policy  on response to H1N1 (highly virulent) influenza.  Placing top priority on safeguarding the lives of  our employees and others, the policy is also aimed  at discharge of our social responsibilities. 1. Place top priority on assurance of the safety of lives  and maintenance of health. 2. Continue with the work of supporting IT systems,  which are used to maintain socioeconomic  functions, upon implementation of maximum  measures to assure employee safety. 3. Even for IT systems which have no connection with  maintenance of socioeconomic functions, make a  maximum effort to continue support; provided that,  there may be cases to reduce or discontinue such  support activities, depending on the pandemic  situation. 4. Cooperate with assurance of safety in the local  community. Governance Structure — 2 Governance/ accountability Business continuity training We have begun  business-continuity  training sessions in  order to verify the  validity of our BCPs,  and ensure that all  divisions are aware  of these plans. We conducted  the training in February 2009, envisioning that a  Tonankai earthquake and a Nankai earthquake occurred  in series amid a new influenza pandemic. We started by  setting up a disaster headquarters following the  earthquakes, confirming the safety of employees, and  confirming the state of damages at our customers  sites, after which we practiced phases from the  recovery of our work sites to the recovery of our  customer systems. With the President and all directors  and senior management below him attending, the  exercise was conducted with all our business sites  nationwide connected via teleconference and radio. Moving forward, we plan to conduct training  continuously, in order to attain further improvements in  our BCPs reflecting the outcomes of the training.

Such rules include maintaining  information security they should be careful in daily work  routines. In fiscal 2009, our employees again made a  digital covenant that they fully understood the rules  they had to adhere to, thereby raising thorough  compliance awareness within the company. We are often entrusted with customers information  assets while doing maintenance work for their  information systems and network. Therefore, we  consider risks related to information security and  personal information protection as substantive CSR  risks that need to be managed carefully, and  continuously make efforts to eliminate them. To prevent the occurrence of any accidents related  to information security, we have established an  information security management system based on our  Information Security Basic Policy, thereby promoting  prevention measures at the companywide level. In 2001, we formulated our Personal Information Protection  Policy. Since then, we have been working to protect  personal information under the companywide management  system for personal information protection, which is  supervised by the President. In each division, we appoint a  person in charge of personal information protection as well  as a person in charge of divisional promotion of personal  information protection, in order to make all employees aware  of personal information protection activities.  We have acquired the official certification  of Privacy Mark (P mark) in 2002, and passed  the renewal examination of the certificate in  2008. Approach to information security Approach to protection of personal information To protect the information assets entrusted to us by our  customers and transaction partners as well as those of  our own, and to contribute to socioeconomic  advancement through supply of better goods and  services, NEC Fielding has determined the following  basic policy on information security, and hereby  proclaims its commitment to practicing this policy. 1. We shall establish a setup for information security  management and strive for proper management of  information assets. 2. We shall instate and apply in-house rules in accordance  with this basic policy. 3. We shall provide education required for assurance of  information security.  4. We shall take appropriate human, organizational, and  technical measures, and endeavor to prevent information  assets from incurring improper access, leakage, alteration,  loss/theft, destruction, hindrance to use, or other damage. 5. In the event of a security problem involving information  assets, we shall immediately ascertain the cause and take  action to curtail any damage to the minimum. 6. We shall observe all laws, agreements with customers,  and social norms related to information security. 7. We shall constantly review the aforementioned activities  and strive to improve them. * Information Rights Management (IRM): A tool provided by Microsoft  Office 2003 for preventing information leaks.

Each promoter  cooperates with a staff member concurrent with the  CSR Management Promotion Division, to assist the  implementation of schemes and measures set out by  the CSR Management Promotion Division at all levels  of the company. Deployment of priority reminders In fiscal 2009, we began issuing reminders related to  corporate ethics and information security for the  purpose of making practices in accordance with rules  into habits on the personal level, toward the larger goal  of eliminating the actualization of potential risks. All  organizational units in the company are notified of these  priority reminders every month. Each reminder is a haiku-form phrase concisely  stating a type of act in line with the corporate rules.  They are recited on a daily basis with a view to  preventing the occurrence of incidents and accidents  on the level of individual employees.   Examples of priority reminders  Scribbled fax numbers cause mistakes  Make sure to check belongings after nights out  Always check computers for viruses after holidays Distribution of Fielding Pocketbook We provide a Fielding Pocketbook to all our employees.  This prescribes activity guidelines and basic policies  such as the NEC Fielding Charter of Corporate Behavior  and the NEC Fielding Group Code of Conduct. Email magazine and case sheet We issue and disseminate to all directors and  employees the Corporate Behavior Email Magazine  which provides various topics, examples of other  companies, laws and ordinances, etc. relating to  corporate ethics and compliance, as well as the  Corporate Conduct Case Sheet which explains our  internal rules based on examples, in order to share  information within the Group. Corporate ethics promotion system Educational activities to raise awareness of corporate ethics Corporate Ethics/Compliance Themes of activities  As in fiscal 2008, the main  activity themes in fiscal  2009 were rigorous  adherence to and  promotion of the dictates  of corporate ethics and  compliance among all  units and individuals in the  Group as a whole. Results of activities Challenges In addition to the regular measures to foster  awareness of the importance of attention in this  area, the fiscal 2009 activities led to the start of  deployment of the priority reminders throughout  the company every month to make the practices a  habit. The major themes beginning in  fiscal 2010 will presumably be  the continued reinforcement of  information-sharing throughout  the Group and measures to raise  awareness in the management  layer for effective application of  compliance rules in their  respective divisions.

In fiscal 2009, we  launched activities to raise  the quality of this  information provision even  higher. 1. We promptly submitted our financial statements  and quarterly reports as documents whose  disclosure is stipulated in law, as well as financial  report summaries, corporate governance reports,  and other documents in accordance with the  Securities Listing Regulations of the TSE. 2. We actively disclosed information whose disclosure  is not required by law but which influences  investment decisions, such as earnings  presentation materials and fact sheets. 3. To encourage a better understanding of NEC Fielding,  we provided more information on our website, and  prepared and distributed our annual report, Fielding  Communication Report, and various other tools. Besides working for prompt  and proper information  disclosure, we are going to  disclose information that  will deliver even higher  levels of satisfaction to  investors. In addition, we  intend to improve events for  individual investors in order  to increase their  opportunities to learn about  NEC Fielding. We shall endeavor to continually provide our  shareholders and investors in a timely,  accurate, and fair manner with information on  our business activities as well as major matters  of execution and decision-making, which may  affect appraisal of our investment value. 1. We shall provide information on the actual facts of  our management that are deemed necessary for  shareholders and investors to make their decision  on their shareholding (investment decision). 2. In disclosure of information related to future  orientations, we shall append a statement of  caution (i.e., safe harbor statement) specifying  factors that could make targets unattainable.   Information disclosure IR (investor relations) activities Method of information disclosure We disclose information in a way that complies with  the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act,  Companies Act, and the rules for timely disclosure of  TSE. Our financial statements, quarterly reports, etc.  are registered on the EDINET system managed by the  Financial Services Agency. Furthermore, we register  major matters stipulated in the rules for timely  disclosure of TSE on the TDnet system managed by  TSE and make an announcement of such matters to the  press through the Kabuto Club (the reporters club  within TSE). Voluntary disclosure   We shall actively disclose information that does not fall  under the scope of legal requirements but is deemed  important for investment decisions by shareholders and  investors concerning our operations, or necessary for  enhancing their understanding of our company.  Tour of corporate facilities for  institutional investors and analysts In December 2009, NEC Fielding conducted a tour  of its facilities for institutional investors and  analysts. The participants were taken through Aru  Parts Kawasaki, our hub facility for distribution of  maintenance supplies. The functions of the Yamato  Techno-center (Repair Division) were consolidated  into Aru Parts Kawasaki in September 2009 for the  purpose of shortening repair lead time and  improving efficiency in various work processes. The  presentation in the tour centered around the effects  of the consolidation and the nature of the activities  for production innovation. It was understood by the  participants, with some institutional investors and  analysts making favorable remarks to the effect that  the consolidation  heightened the  investment value.  We plan to hold  more tours to give  more investors a  solid grasp of our  business. NEWS 2009 28 Governance/ accountability Since most of our business activities are based on  business-to-business (B2B)* transactions, we do not  have a high degree of recognition among the general  public. Based on this understanding, we are proactively  working on IR activities to help our shareholders and  individual investors properly understand our businesses  and activities. Publication of the annual report We publish an  annual report as a  tool for giving  institutional  investors and  analysts an  understanding of  our company. It is  full of information  on our performance and finances required for analysis  of our company, and presents details of basic  management policy, growth strategy, and business  activities that may be difficult to ascertain when viewed  from the outside. The report has been rated as  conveying the thinking of top-layer management and  being of great value for investment decisions. We  intend to continue furnishing institutional investors and  analysts with even more useful information through the  report. Interactive communications via the Fielding  Communication Report We publish the Fielding Communication Report  semiannually and send it to our individual shareholders.  This aims to deliver messages from the President,  company information, business activities, financial  results, etc. by creating contents easy to read and  understand. On the Shareholder Questionnaire section, we  introduce opinions and questions from shareholders as  well as answers to these questions, thus leveraging this  report as a tool for interactive communication with  them. Investor relations website We prepared a  Investor  Relations website  in order to augment  our provision of  information to  them, and are  otherwise striving  to improve our  accountability  provisions. The website also posts IR news and other  information announced by NEC Fielding in the IR  Library section, to report on our business activities. In  addition, it has streaming footage of earnings  presentations and information meetings for individual  investors, so that visitors can actually hear the voices of  our executives. We also send information to registered investors by  e-mail.

IT systems are now  underpinning socioeconomic systems in all fields. NEC Fielding has  developed personnel able to cope with the diversifying technology, provided  services meeting the wants and needs of the diversifying customers, and  built relationships of trust with them. We now care for 5.3 million systems at  about 290,000 firms. We are determined to deepen these ties of trust with our existing  customers and forge similar bonds with new ones. To this end, it is surely  essential to place even more emphasis on activities on the front lines  (meaning the individual customer sites) and continue to offer human  resources and services developed even more from the customers  perspective. Over the coming years as well, NEC Fielding is committed to supporting  the social infrastructure by supporting front-line IT systems across the country. In this age, lifelines and socioeconomic functions  cannot be maintained without IT systems. NEC Fielding  provides services in periodic preventive maintenance to  see that these IT systems remain operable 24 hours a  day, 365 days a year. It also engages in work to  Service setup to support the IT infrastructure of contemporary society maintain customer systems and the socioeconomic  functions supported by them, so that all members of  society can go about their activities in comfort and with  peace of mind.

Support of IT systems by CEs is the core  business of NEC Fielding. The Maintenance  and Operation Business Division, to which I  belong, is the unit in charge of this  business. We support the strengthening  and expansion of ties of trust between CEs  and their customers through operations such as the creation of  service menus, preparation of service assortments, incorporation  of products of other vendors into the maintenance menu, and  assistance for the conclusion of contracts for support. The prevailing theme of supporting the socioeconomic  infrastructure amounts to nothing other than the activities of our  CEs across the country. We are determined to support their  activities as much as we can.

Communication Fiscal 2009 Future Themes of activities  Results of activities Challenges We promoted our  companywide campaign  called No.1 in Customer  Satisfaction—Far Ahead of  Others Challenge. Particular  emphasis was placed on  activities of human resource  development to improve  powers of technical expertise,  communication, and  problem-solving among CEs  active on the front lines. 1. In a program for basic reinforcement of work, CS  trainers at service locations accompanied CEs to  customer sites to furnish them with guidance and  support. 2. To bolster communication with customers, we  conducted a seminar utilizing the interactive  customer talk system*. 3. To improve matters in the initial phase of trouble,  we promoted a campaign for swift notification to  customers (of the date and time of visit for  response) when receiving reports of trouble. Technical capabilities and  powers for proposal of  solutions at customer sites  still have room for  improvement. We are going  to put more effort into  development of human  resources for on-site  measures and take other  action to meet the  expectations of our  customers. Bringing our customers security and gratification  through Fielding activities* The groundwork of our business is on-site operations  (fieldwork) at our customers premises. We put the  highest priority on providing services that will give our  customers a sense of security and make them think we  are a reliable crew always be available and ready to help  in solving their problems. We employed the mechanism of ISO 9001 PDCA cycle  to our CS promotion activities. Companywide policies  and measures related to CS promotion are examined at  the CS Improvement Council and the Team of No.1 in  Customer Satisfaction—Far Ahead of Others  Challenge, and then conveyed to each division. The CS  Promotion Division and a quality promoter assigned to  each organizational unit take initiatives toward practical  implementation of these measures within the unit.  Furthermore, at the Divisional Activity Reporting  Meeting held quarterly, the top management will check  the progress in implementing measures in each block  and branch division, where all the CS promotion  activities are put in practice. We have frequent contact with our customers, totaling  of 4.18 million times this year. The information we  acquire from them, such as opinions and requests, is  our most precious asset. We apply it to our everyday  routines in order to ensure stable and safe operations  and maintenance, as well as to achieve more smooth  and accurate provision of services. We also make full  use of this accumulated information for the  improvement of system efficiency. Our customer  engineers* (CEs) and salespersons carry a Knowledge  Note terminal (KN terminal) so that they can access and  suggest the latest information that will meet the needs  and requests of customers. * Customer satisfaction (CS): At NEC Fielding, the foundation of our  business operations is customer satisfaction; that is, offering services that  satisfy our customers, working and growing together with our customers. * Fielding activities: Please refer to page 9. * Customer engineer: Please refer to page 2. Our approach to CS*  Mechanism to improve CS Proposals to meet customer needs  CSVOICE is a channel for sharing our customers requests and  opinions. The feedback data is first recorded as CSVOICE and  subject to primary analysis; each issue is classified by types and  sent to a division concerned. Then, the division will determine  and implement specific measures to solve the issue. The data  can be accessed by other divisions and shared throughout the  company. CSVOICE CSMAIL is a database collecting information on major failures in  customer systems and cases dissatisfied with our maintenance,  as well as conditions which may cause customer dissatisfaction.  Any issue will be promptly communicated internally and within  the NEC Group via CSMAIL, to be solved in the earlier stage  under the collaboration of the entire Group. CS senior advisors are appointed on the recommendation of  corporate officers in charge of each block. After graduating from  the training program especially for them, they are sent to and  stationed at a specific block. Besides developing and supporting  the CS trainers at service locations, they transfer on-site  technology (experience, knowledge, and craftsmanship) to and  advise CEs, by way of assisting CS trainers. CSMAIL CS senior advisors Field Request is a system for improving our products, which  delivers information on product problems and product- improvement requests arising from the customers side, to the  factory/quality control division of the product vendor, via our  engineering division. As a general rule, CS trainers are nominated by the service  section heads of service locations and appointed by the  directors of service locations. After their appointment, they  undergo the program for production of CS trainers to win  qualification as such, and then put what they have learned into  practice. CS trainers instruct and develop CEs at service  locations and customer sites based on the measures to raise CS  levels at each block formulated in line with the companywide  policies and initiatives.

This product offers automatic selection  of the optimal power supply mode for the power  environment, and delivers an energy-saving benefit and  high reliability. We will engage in further  research and development  of services and products  from the CSR perspective,  taking environmental  solutions and other terms  such as eco, green,  and universal as key  words. In this way, we  strive to make a positive  contribution to society  and our customers  through our business  activities. Supporting customers security measures There are stricter regulatory requirements related to  data management and access restrictions within  companies since the Act on the Protection of Personal  Information came into effect. Leakage of information  may cause irreparable damages to a companys  clientele, reputation, etc.; therefore, protection of  information assets becomes inevitable during the  course of business activities, and companies are now  required to implement measures on enhancing internal  controls from the standpoint of managerial responsibility.  To eliminate concerns of these managements and the  personnel in charge of information systems, we support  their security measures with a range of services and  options. We also offer comprehensive solutions to our  customers who need to improve their activities through  the PDCA cycle. Information Security Consulting We support optimization of information security  management by providing a range of services, from  creating information security policies based on the  information asset lifecycle, conducting training, audit,  assessment of information security, through to improving  operational efficiency of information security systems.  Combination of services We put together combinations of solutions optimal for the  customer environment from our richly varied assortment of  products and functions, based on the existing needs,  conclusions reached in consulting, and the findings of analysis  and reports. As such, our services help to make work more  efficient and to lower risks.

Upon dismantling,  checking, and cleaning, the recovered EP cartridges are  transformed into new EP cartridges under a scheme of  strict quality control. Recovery and recycling of PRB Under the Act on the Promotion of Effective Utilization  of Resources effective in 2001, all manufacturers who  make portable rechargeable batteries (PRB) or devices  using PRB are required to recover and recycle these  batteries. Along with the enforcement of the Act, the  NEC Group became a member of the Japan Portable  Rechargeable Battery Recycling Center (JBRC), and  recovers PRB through the recycling system operated by  the center. Approaches to product safety NEC Fielding is committed to preventing the  occurrence of defects and accidents with a bearing on  the safety of not only products of its own development  but also products procured from outside or consigned  for outsourced maintenance. To this end, and also for  the purpose of appropriate measures for safety-related  accidents, we have constructed an organizational setup  and are promoting product safety activities.

Through this certification,  we are striving to further enhance our information  security and achieve more stable operations. Furthermore, we place the top priority on securing  our customer information. We have established a  complete information security management system,  including a room-entry control to prevent entries of  non-system operators, data carry-away prevention  system to prevent taking out of customer information,  and access control system to prevent unauthorized  access to data by non-system operators. We also strive to ensure the stable operation of our  customer systems through monitoring their network and  hardware and detecting problems in the early stage. Under this setup, personnel audit the work for support of  customer IT system operation provided by NEC Fielding,  and issue instructions for correction or improvement.  The aims are maintenance and continuation of service  quality meeting customer requirements, and optimization  of services for adaption to changes in work prerequisites. Owing to changes in and diversification (in respect  of market needs, technical innovation, and values) of  the environment surrounding customers, IT systems  are becoming more complex and varied. This is being  reflected in an increasing and varied segmentation of IT  services provided. To ensure that customers can patronize the  operation support services offered by NEC Fielding  with complete confidence, services are audited with  attention to dependability and continuity. The objective  is to identify problems at present and tasks for the  future, to assist ongoing improvement. Audit of service quality begins with apprehension of  the facts of service provision. The personnel ascertain  the conformance of the current service status and  objectively assess any gaps with the customer  requirements. The units providing services make the  requested corrections and improvements, and perform  the PDCA cycle to confirm that the operation support  satisfies the customers needs. The operation support services are performed to  improve the level of operation quality, lessen risks, and  assure the continuity of the customers business.

Besides  the presentation, the Seminar included a demonstration  of various cases of operation for various solutions at  adjacent exhibition sites. The exhibition sites also  contained displays and commentary on the latest  technology and Fielding solutions. These included PC verification systems using non- contact IC cards or biometrics, verification systems for  prevention of unauthorized access to PC networks, IT  assets management with excellent operability,  evidence management based on log visibility, and  information assets management for personal and other  confidential information. Active holding of BCP (BCDR) seminars We have long been  actively holding BCP  seminars. In a seminar,  we took up approaches  by NEC Fielding in  response to changes in  the management climate  and natural disasters, and  presented the actual procedure of BCP introduction.  Right at the seminar, we made simple diagnoses and  suggested BCPs that would be the best for the  participating customers, nearly all of whom had high  evaluations of the event. The seminar turned out to be  a fine opportunity for thinking about BCP with our  customers. In the future as well, we plan to actively  hold BCP seminars for contribution to the CSR activities  of our customers. Proposing CSR activities through exhibitions of  environmentally-friendly green services and  products Each year, we hold many exhibitions and events  throughout the country, and introduce our  environmentally-friendly services and products such as  EnepalTM PC, green hybrid-type UPS and green network  solution. In this way, we actively propose solutions to  support our customers CSR activities. CSR activities at exhibitions Exhibitions and events are our points of contact with  our customers, and we use them to present our CSR  activities. We recovered PET bottle caps as a part of  our activities of social contribution at nine locations  nationwide, including the Fielding Solution Fair held by  NEC Fielding in Tokyo. Many of the customers who  attended the seminars held in the Fair endorsed our  campaign to collect the caps and get vaccine to children  around the world. Besides being linked to social  contribution, the collection of a massive amount of caps  helped to increase recycling rates because of the  related presorting, and so also gave a lift to  environmental  activities. We plan to  promote further  activities of social  contribution at  future exhibitions  and events.

To prevent the occurrence of inability to make repairs due to a lack of  parts, we bolstered arrangements by centralizing the management of  maintenance and field information, and constructing a flow for  provision of information to sales personnel. 2. In the aspect of new product development, we commercialized nine  models including a maintenance support pack for hard disks  connected to LANs. 3. To augment our software support, we reinforced our assortment of  services for system restoration by adding POS to the scope, which  had been confined to PCs and PC servers. This step helped to  maintain the scale of our business. 4. We also worked to maintain the scale of our business by  incorporating support for POS systems and various other terminals  for service stations. 5. In strategy for business process reengineering, we took action to  reduce the costs of parts and materials in the context of an ongoing  campaign for production innovation. More specifically, we  consolidated the locations of our repair and logistics divisions, which  had the effect of shortening the repair lead time, and raised levels of  productivity by improving efficiency in various work processes. For stable operation of  customer systems, we must  graduate from the conventional  level of hardware maintenance  to that of platform maintenance  encompassing software  domains. For this purpose, we  have to expand the scope of our  support services by  strengthening our capabilities  for coping with the systems of  multiple vendors in cloud  computing environments. In  addition, we must continue the  campaign for voluntary  agreements and heighten  coordination with sales stores  in order to increase the number  of maintenance contracts and  thereby expand our business. Proactive Maintenance Business Stable operation We realize more stable operation of our customers IT  systems through proactive maintenance, which entails  monitoring their systems 24 hours a day, 365 days a  year, and detecting signs of problems, and taking  proactive steps. Recovery from natural disaster We quickly restore customers systems when they are  damaged by natural disasters such as earthquakes and  floods. We work with utmost effort to restore local IT  systems damaged by natural disaster by, among others,  establishing a disaster headquarters, evaluating the  damage, examining countermeasures, increasing  response personnel, and providing detail reports on the  damage. Quick response to problems We have constructed a customer support formation  that makes it possible to respond quickly and  appropriately as problems arise from customers  systems, thereby enabling immediate recovery from  the system failure.

Besides reinforcing  control of information  security, which is  assuming increasing  importance, we took  steps to combat threats  such as outbreak of  pandemic influenza. We set out to further tighten the control of information  security we have been pursuing with partner companies. For  this reason, we constructed a setup for information security  control based on close coordination between NEC Fielding  and these firms. We clearly indicated the management and operation rules  that must be observed and tightened their application through  information security managers at preregistered partner  companies. NEC Fielding has long been making studies aimed at  continued provision of services to customers even in the  event of major earthquakes or other large-scale disasters. In  this connection, we mounted approaches to be implemented  in the case of pandemics and made arrangements for  information coordination so that partner companies would be  able to exercise the same level of control. We believe it is important to promote  CSR activities as an entire group  including our partner companies, so  that our customers can patronize our  services with confidence. In keeping  with this view, we took steps with  particular emphasis on proper  corporate conduct in line with the  dictates of compliance with laws and  regulations and management of  information security as the bases of  business activity. For the future,  besides further developing these  activities, we intend to pursue  collaboration in areas such as health  & safety and human rights & labor. In order to strengthen the cooperative relationship with  partner companies, we try to explain them our current  business conditions and the future direction in every  occasion such as the business trend explanatory  meeting and the New Years greetings exchange  meeting. We also set up a discussion forum to exchange  information with our top management. We are also  holding topic-specific periodic meetings and occasional  discussion forums for each field of transaction. In fiscal  2009, again, we held the Training Course for Business  Etiquette Instructors designed for managers of our  partner companies. Sixteen people from fourteen  companies attended  the course. Aiming  to improve customer  satisfaction and CSR  together with our  partners, we will  continue to offer  training and  encourage more  partners to join. Strengthening support and expanding collaboration with partner companies Collaboration with Partner Companies Many of the goods and services we supply to our  customers rest on the materials and services we  procure from partner companies. In accordance with  our basic policy on material procurement, we intend to  promote CSR approaches through closer interaction  with these partners. NEC Fielding has many opportunities to handle  customer information. As such, we are called upon to  manage information in a manner that goes beyond  in-house security and extends to collaboration with  partner companies. In the handling of data required for work, our  security manager and that of the concerned partner  company collaborate in managing the entire process,  from data selection, entrustment, receipt, and daily  control to retrieval, return, and disposal.

Previously, they had few  opportunities for contact with the President or other executives, and we figured  many of them felt they didnt know what the companys intentions were. Under  these circumstances, we started to hold meetings for employee dialogue with the  President in 2009. It was our hope that these meetings would give employees a  good understanding of the thinking of the President, other executives, and their  peers, and that the accompanying interchange of ideas would breed a higher  awareness. Our 2010 Medium-term Plan calls for the growth of our people. To  attain this goal, it is vital to make all employees keenly aware of the corporate  policies through gatherings such as the meetings for dialogue, so that they can  draft their own medium-term plans, consider what they should do for the company,  and take action accordingly. Such approaches will further heighten the quality of  management at our company. We are currently also promoting dialogue among the employees themselves.  Gathering and networking by employees in the same generation will presumably  lead to subsequent communication, and may be expected to have the effect of  strengthening bonds both horizontally and vertically. Although the circle of  communication now centers around the executive layer, we are going to widen it by  arranging similar opportunities for the senior staff and staff in charge of units. As I  see it, this will help to make the whole company into a truly vibrant organization. Yoshinori Takasuka   Director and Senior Corporate Officer Acceleration of peoples growth through  awareness based on dialogue April 2008 saw the announcement of the NEC Group  Vision & Values. The Vision presents the targets  common to the entire Group, and the Values, the value  outlook to be shared by the entire Group. The Group is  to aim for sustained growth through attainment of the  Attainment of the vision around peoples growth two. In response, NEC Fielding formulated the Fielding  Vision & Values in June 2008, and its 2010 Medium- term Plan which centers around peoples growth in  May 2010. It is now making efforts to achieve the  Group Vision.  The holding of meetings for dialogue  at NEC Fielding originated in the  campaign for penetration of the NEC  Group Vision and Values. Upon the  inauguration of President Nakanishi in  June 2009, a major shift was made to  development as an activity distinctive to NEC Fielding.  Behind this change lay the lessening of in-house  communication. President Nakanishi put top priority on  human resources, and the movement to strengthen  communication took off after he began to hold meetings  for dialogue with middle managers as the group at the core  of the company. The primary point of this approach was to make  opportunities for dialogue. It reconfirmed the importance  of in-house communication, and constituted the first step  toward creation of a new corporate culture. In our role as  the secretariat promoting the meetings, we intend to draft  projects that will further stimulate in-house  communication.

At the meetings, I also  had the chance to exchange views  with people who belong to divisions with which I normally  have little contact. Even among employees of the same generation,  perspectives vary with the organizational unit, and the  meetings produce a diversity of opinion. The good point  overall was the constructive discussion. My honest  impression was that all the participants were giving serious  thought to the issues. In my dialogue with the President,  my nervousness was allayed by his polite replies to my  questions. The conversation ranged over a wide area, and I  found the meeting worthwhile for giving me the chance to  hear the thoughts of the top layer of management right  from their mouths. This last meeting drove home to me the  importance of communication. From now on, I hope to  actively engage in communication in the workplace.

Creating a corporate culture  that women can actively take  part in We compare poorly to the  industry average in terms of  female employment and female  managers. In order to improve  the situation, we are  aggressively taking steps to  expand the areas women are  active in, and these efforts include setting targets for  the percentage of women among new graduate recruits  and calling for each division to promote women to  management posts. Employment of people with disabilities Utilizing our network of more than 400 offices  throughout Japan, we employ people with disabilities  who want to work in their local community. From the  perspective of normalization*, we strive to have  employees with disabilities work at the same location  as other employees, and when necessary, the company  or surrounding people provide support. * Normalization: The idea that persons with and without disabilities should  live together in society without any special distinctions between them, and  that this is the best outcome. Normalization also includes programs, policies,  and the like aimed at achieving this. Employment In 2009, I was appointed to a managerial  position. I now have more responsibility,  but also get a greater feeling of  accomplishment. The change of status  has given me more to learn, and I am  enjoying the change. Currently, I am also  active as a member of the Working  Team for Promotion of Positive Action. I am determined to do  what little I can to see that women have more opportunity for  exercise of their capabilities and can continue to work as long  as they like, and with a sense of fulfillment. I want to see my  colleagues and subordinates take up the challenge of various  work by enjoying instead of fearing change. I am engaged in data processing for  response to customers and management  of the in-house website. I do volunteer  work, and am grateful to NEC Fielding  for understanding this activity and  making it easy for me to take time off to  do it. On the other hand, although the rate of employees with  disabilities meets the legal requirement, there are no programs  for training in sign language or transfer of business skills, and I  am experiencing some difficulty in raising by skill level. I think that, if each employee, whether challenged or not,  takes steps to prepare an environment for mutual sharing of  our abundance of wisdom and opinions, we could make the  company an even easier place to work.

Hiring and Employment Initiatives Fiscal 2009 Future Themes of activities  Results of activities Challenges Amid the worsening of the employment picture  and uncertainty in the business environment,  we must work to maintain and promote  employment by continued hiring. At the same  time, we must follow the activities of employees  hired in mid-career for immediate service in the  aspect of practice. Furthermore, we must  strengthen existing and mount new approaches  to employment diversity by, for example,  breeding a corporate culture that gives full play  to the talents of female employees. 1. In spite of the worsening circumstances in the  market environment, we hired a small number of  elite candidates (both newly graduated and mid- career) through a process of careful selection. 2. We actively promoted the hiring of newly graduated  people with disabilities, and brought the share of  our total number of employees occupied by the  challenged to 1.87%. 3. We appointed more women to managerial (senior  staff or managers) positions (the number increased  from 35 to 38). We are going to  redouble efforts to  hire new graduates  of immediate service  and expand the  female share of our  employees. Employee diversity  We are pushing forward with efforts to create a system  and mechanism so that business can continue in the  case of an earthquake or natural disaster, so-called  BCP* (business continuity plan). As one part of these efforts, we have introduced a  safety confirmation system for personnel so that the  company and employees families can confirm the  safety of employees in  case of a disaster.  Furthermore, we have  stored, at the offices in  each region of Japan,  items such as food,  drinking water, medicine,  blankets, and other  supplies that can be used  when a disaster hits. We are also working to  prevent the spread of new  influenza, by establishing  the internal prevention  system, stockpiling masks  and other supplies, etc. * Business continuity plan (BCP):  Please refer to page 24. Mental health seminars Mental health has  recently become a  social issue;  therefore, we held  group seminars for  section managers. Introduction of the Employee Assistance Program  (EAP) In January 2010, we instated the Employee Assistance  Program offered by Hokendohjinsha Inc. The Program  has a telephone and web contact for consultation about  various matters by employees and their families, and  also arrangements for face-to-face counseling. We  added a setup which employees can use to check their  own stress level merely by answering questions on the  web. In order to create a safe workplace environment, we  have established the Central Committee of Workplace  Safety and Health at a companywide level, and promote  activities aimed for zero accidents and incidents in the  workplace. In addition, we work on safety and health  activities, such as measures to prevent diseases, in  each region taking into consideration their local  characteristics.

We  also enhanced our  system for supporting  employees in times of  disasters and other  emergencies. 1. Incorporated basic knowledge related to mental health and  procedure for response in the workplace into the program of  position-specific training for people promoted during the year. 2. Introduced the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to promote  employees mental healthcare. 3. Strengthened the setup for safety and health management through  coordination between the Central Committee of Workplace Safety  and Health and the related committees in each block. We also  tightened provisions on priority items such as health management. 4. Bolstered the systems for business continuity and confirmation of  safety in the event of disaster, and implemented measures to  counter H1N1 influenza. We will promote  the mental and  physical health of  our employees, by  reinforcing mental- health measures as  well as  strengthening the  health management  scheme to prevent  the lifestyle  diseases, etc. Approach to BCP  Employment 43 (FY) 100 (%) 80 60 40 20 0 2007 2008 2009 71 Job satisfaction level 63 Response rate Trends in response rates of opinion survey and job satisfaction Keiko Ishii Charter of Corporate Behavior Creating an Easy-to-work-at Workplace Fiscal 2009 Future Themes of  activities  Results of activities Challenges Toward achievement of  a good work-life  balance by our  employees, we strived  to take action to create  a workplace where  employees can enjoy  working and to breed a  corporate culture  enabling employees to  feel higher degrees of  fulfillment. 1. Based on the Fielding Vision & Values, had all employees share  the outlook on values and principles of conduct to be strictly  followed by each and every one of them every day. 2. Promoted campaigns to enhance awareness of the importance of  making time for private pursuits and a setup for career support,  thereby responding to the diverse needs of our employees. 3. Conducted a campaign again in fiscal 2009 to deepen awareness  of respect for human rights, in step with Human Rights Week. The  activities included a contest for human rights slogans and the  distribution of related pamphlets. 4. Newly created the Diversity Group, under which the Working  Team for Promotion of Positive Action (18 members) was installed  and engaged in promotion activities. Although we have  emphasized approaches  with a focus on the  individual toward the  achievement of a good  work-life balance, there  are less opportunities for  employees to fraternize  in the workplace.  Measures to stimulate  communication in the  workplace are therefore  a remaining task. As a periodic communication channel between  employees and the company, an opinion survey of all  employees is conducted once a year. The 2009 survey  shows that the job satisfaction of employees has  improved for two consecutive years to 71%. The  results of the survey are used to examine system  improvements and measures to implement. Our basic stance toward protection of human rights is  clearly stated in our Charter of Corporate Behavior.  (                   ) In addition, we are promoting various types of  human rights education activities, which include human  rights training, a slogan contest, and the distribution of  human rights leaflets. These activities are centered on  the Human Rights Education Promotion Committee,  which actively works to create a discrimination-free  organization and to help all employees properly  understand the companys efforts related to the human  rights issues.

We have created a consultation center that handles a  wide range of employee consultation needs. The center plays a role in our efforts to maintain an  employee friendly workplace, improving the working  environment by enabling employees to voice feedback  and requests, seek counseling, report incidents, and  the like for topics that are difficult to raise through  ordinary channels. Flexible supporting systems relating to childbirth  and childcare Our maternity leave, childcare leave, and system of  reduced working time support employees efforts to  balance work with their private life. Around 51 employees  take childcare leave each year. Furthermore, the website  ikuchu.com has been introduced to provide  opportunities for communication among employees  who are on maternity leave or childcare leave. Promotion of positive action In fiscal 2009, the Working Team for Promotion of  Positive Action was organized with the participation of  18 persons, including female employees and managers  with female subordinates. The team considers ways of  widening the sphere of activity by female employees  and assisting their career development. Health and welfare system for use equally by all  employees NEC Fielding has instated the Benefit Station welfare  program provided by Benefit One Inc. as a setup open  equally to all employees. The program, aimed at  furnishing effective backup for employee leisure and  supporting their fulfilling life, is being used by many  employees.

Trends in training hours of CEs (customer  engineers*) Technological innovation is rapid in the IT industry, and  CEs working on the front lines of IT must keep up with  the latest technologies.  We made a major revision to the NEC Fielding CE  Training Course in 2005. This revision has made it much  more efficient to give the necessary people the  necessary training. In 2009, we provided over nineteen  days of training per CE. * Customer engineer: Please refer to page 2.

Voluntary training support system We have  established a  voluntary training  support system  from a perspective  that the employees  desire to develop  his or her  capabilities is the  basis of the  fundamental of human resource development. In this  spirit, we offer all employees opportunities for self- betterment and assume part of the expense burden.  We have prepared voluntary training courses in a  diversity of fields, including management, basic  business skills, accounting, languages, qualification  acquisition, and hobby-type areas. Programs to support human resource  development Portal site for voluntary training Contest to improve CEs technical and support skills As a company providing comprehensive IT support, it is  vital for us to improve the technical and support skills of  our CEs. That is why we launched the Best Fielding  Contest in 1998. In this contest, engineers who directly support  customers compete using their day-to-day skills. The  goal of the contest is to improve skills, ethics, and  motivation. The contest also serves to improve the  technical and support level of the entire company, by  laterally deploying the best practices gleaned from the  contest.  For this reason, the competition events and judging  criteria are revised for each contest, ensuring that it  reflects current needs and NEC Fieldings business  strategy. Overseas training for winners The Best Fielding Contest starts with preliminary  screening (written tests) held at fifteen locations  nationwide. The preliminaries are open to all  employees. In the preliminaries, CEs are selected to  compete in each subject. Around a little more than 40  CEs go on to the two-day finals. On the first day of the  finals, the competitors write reports or proposals in  accordance with the contest themes. On the second  day, the competitors participate in realistic role-playing  situations with the judges acting as a customer. The judges score the competitors, ranking them for  each subject. The winners receive a cash prize and a  medal, as well as a trip for overseas training. The  training includes a visiting tour of the world-famous IT  expo, and a visit to an IT company.

With the exception of certain big cities, our employees live in the  community where they work. The process of having individuals and  groups think about what their community needs and take appropriate  action is in accord with our Philosophy on Social Contribution Activities,  which calls for engaging in a wide variety of activities for contribution to  society, and forms the foundation of social contribution activities at NEC  Fielding. By commending individuals and groups for their activities, we hope  not only to heighten employee motivations in this area but also to induce  analogous activities in other communities and improve activity quality. In examining nominees, we consider approaches to social issues as  well as the ties with the community. We want our employees to actively  address agenda such as preservation of biological diversity and social  welfare, and to drive companywide activities following their example. Takashi Miyamoto   Director Responsible for CSR We want employees to drive companywide activities  by taking up the challenge of community relations  and social issues NEC Fielding encourages its employees to engage in  activities of social contribution for deeper relations with  the local community. It presents CSR awards (group and individual) to  groups (offices) and individual employees implementing  activities that contribute to the community while giving  them enjoyment, and assist their own advancement as  well as that of the company and the community. The  awards serve to enhance awareness in this aspect. Nomination and examination scheme, and record of commendation The process begins with the nomination of excellent  cases of contribution by various organizational units and  areas. The cases undergo a primary screening by the  CSR Management Promotion Division and a secondary  screening by the party promoting activities in each block.  The winners are selected upon a final examination at the  Corporate Officer Meeting. In fiscal 2009, there were  three winners each selected for the group and individual  awards in the first and the second half of the year.  I started this activity out of a desire  to be of some service to the city of  Fussa, where I have resided for over  20 years. The funny thing is that I am  liable to be mistaken for a police  officer due to my uniform, and high  schoolers call me officer. When directing traffic during  summer festivals, I sometimes think that the heat will get  the best of me, but the sight of the spirited lads carrying  the portable shrines on their shoulders down the street  gives me the energy to go on. The job is an unspectacular  one, but an ice-cold  beer back at home  tastes even better after  being thanked by the  people and police for  helping them keep the  doings accident-free for  another year. Winner of the individual CSR awards in the second half of FY2009 Support for the traffic safety association in Fussa Tsutomu Mizorogi (Tachikawa Parts Center, Eastern Japan Materials Support Dept., Logistics Div.)

Voice TOPICS 5   Program of Employee Commendation for Social Contribution Society For about six years now, we have been supporting the  traffic safety association in the city of Fussa, Tokyo, upon  accepting a commission from it. In this connection, we  provide surveillance and security services for traffic safety  in coordination with the municipal police department  during traffic safety week in spring and autumn as well as  at the time of the midsummer star festival, firefly festival,  and other municipal events, in addition to neighborhood  festivals, funerals, and incidence of fatal traffic accidents. Mr. Mizorogi was selected for the award in recognition  of the spirit of dedication he exhibits in his activities, his  long record of continued service, and his deep roots in the  community. For the last six years, the Branch Office has been  participating in river clean-up campaigns and supporting  the staging of events such as health walks organized  by local groups. It has also received letters of gratitude  from them for this activity. Endorsing the aim of attractive community development,  the Branch Division has continued to take part in the  Community Open Garden Campaign organized by the  Makuhari-Shintoshin Machizukuri Kyogikai (MMK;  Makuhari New City Development Council). Its employees  help to replant the planters along the main street with  different flowers with every change of season. Voice Efforts to protect the local nature  and scenery When the people of Tokushima city talk about the river,  they naturally mean the majestic Yoshinogawa. And when  they mention the mountain, they are referring to Mt.  Bizan. We find this scenery, which is among the most  beautiful in the prefecture, more appealing than any other,  and intend to go on contributing to the community by  continuing our volunteer work rooted in it. Tatsuo Kataya Office Head, Tokushima Branch Office, Shikoku Branch Division Voice We also participate in the massive clean-up activity on  Makuhari New City Clean-up Day, which is held at the  same time. While doing the work, we have a lot of fun  talking with people from other companies in the MMK.  Over the coming years, too, we hope to help prepare an  environment to enhance the image of Makuhari New City.

Efforts are being  made for both qualitative and quantitative  improvement through further stimulation  of activities by the Fielding Philanthropy  Club, and collaboration between  endeavors on the block or individual level  and those of the Club. In the Fielding Philanthropy Club, five  teams are engaged in vigorous activities  taking biological diversity as their key  word. Two other teams have launched  activities and are achieving results in the  field of social welfare. Activities of social contribution as a whole  on both the block and individual levels  had a combined duration of 61,563 hours  (for an average of 10 hours per person). The United Nations has  proclaimed 2010 to be the  International Year of  Biological Diversity. We are  going to take active  approaches for contribution  to protection of biological  diversity, mainly through  the activities of the Fielding  Philanthropy Club. We are promoting a number of companywide social  contribution programs, as well as voluntary programs  which are implemented independently at the site level  based on the five key concepts of our social  contribution tree.  We also encourage our employees to become  involved in their local communities through individual  volunteering, and actively participate in the Make-a- Difference Drive (MDD), an unified social contribution  activity of the NEC Group. Social contribution programs NEC Fieldings social contribution activities In keeping with our Corporate Philosophy and  our Charter of Corporate Behavior, we shall  engage in a wide variety of activities for  contribution to society as a good corporate  citizen.  We shall contribute to society through our business  activities.  Even in domains outside our business activities, we  shall strive to benefit local communities, and go a  step beyond volunteer activities in our efforts to make  positive contributions, in line with our commitment to  be a good corporate citizen.  As a member of the NEC Group, we shall coordinate  these activities with those of NEC.  As a member of the 1% (One-Percent) Club of the  Nippon Keidanren (Japan Business Federation), we  shall direct at least 1% of our ordinary profit to social  contribution activities.

We joined the  Japan Guide Dog Association  (JGDA) as a corporate member,  and installed donation boxes at all sites nationwide. A tour of the seeing-eye dog training center was  joined by a number of employees and their families,  helping to deepen their understanding for the  significance of this activity. Collection activities Collection activities are a part of the MDD  (                   ). We participate actively in these activities,  and have had some of the best results in the Group.  Collection activities include collecting cancelled  stamps, unneeded plastic cards, foreign coins,  misaddressed unsent postcards, and old hard tennis  balls. These items are collected and used in activities  that benefit society. Our collection activities have  earned high praise outside the company. Collected  items are donated to organizations via the NEC Social  Contribution Office, and are used for various purposes.  In addition, we called on our employees to donate, and  produced measurable results. The company itself also  donated money to JGDA, an equivalent amount of  donations collected from customers and employees via  the donation boxes. Companywide programs see page 51 Comments by participants in the tour  of the seeing-eye dog training center Voice A good experience for the whole family Although I had seen seeing-eye dogs being trained on TV,  I was surprised and moved to learn that most of the people  doing the training are volunteers. Healed by the cute dogs The tour made me realize that seeing-eye dogs depend on  support by many volunteers. I intend to discuss the matter  with my family and see if I can cooperate in some way as a  puppy worker* or family that cares for retired seeing-eye dogs. * A puppy worker is a volunteer who welcomes a puppy that may later be  trained as a seeing-eye dog into his or her home as part of the family.  53 53 Activity teams operated by club members Audit Activity team Team leader Sub leader Member Member Activity team Team leader Sub leader Member Member Activity team Team leader Sub leader Member Member Steering Committee operated by President and Secretariat Members Members Members Social Contribution Fund PR Division Fund accounting Membership fees Companys contributions Fielding Philanthropy Club Secretariat Committee chairperson Auditor Committee vice-chairperson Fielding Philanthropy Club Voice Society NEC Fielding has posted social contribution by the  company as one of the agenda of its CSR activities, and  has been pursuing such contribution through a  companywide effort, or by each office of approximately  400 locations nationwide. In recent years, volunteer  activities by individual employees have also been on the  rise, and social contribution by them is rapidly spreading. It was to add further impetus to this trend and  support the spontaneous, voluntary activities of social  contribution by our employees that we set up the  Fielding Philanthropy Club in March 2008. Besides a  qualitative improvement in these activities, the Club has  Development of human resources through social  contribution activities Through its activities of social contribution, the Fielding  Philanthropy Club develops personnel who have a broad  understanding of our involvement with the community  and society, are equipped with both related knowledge  and skills, and are endowed with a pronounced  personal magnetism in the community.  Provision of sites of activity The Club furnishes opportunities for acquiring  knowledge about social issues in areas such as  biological diversity and social welfare. It also acts as a  bridge to NPOs and other external groups where  employees can take joint action on such issues.  Backing for activities The Club provides facilities and equipment owned by  the company that are needed for the activities (such as  conference rooms, parking lots, computers, tools, and  videoconference systems), along with financial aid from  its fund.  Development of Fielding People The Club produces people who have acquired  capabilities for leadership, self-realization, and know- how for expansion of human networks and  collaboration through actual activities. Fielding People  also have an abundance of knowledge, skills, and other  features from various experiences that make them  particularly appealing members of the community. the objective of heightening our corporate value by  nurturing a highly society-oriented perspective in the  minds of our employees.  Employees and offices form activity teams with  members who were recruited via the Fielding  Philanthropy Club and work under the action plans to  handle matters brought up in respect to the coexistence  with local societies and various social tasks. As of March 2010, seven teams are engaged in  activities, while five teams are preparing to start actions  in fiscal 2010. Fielding Philanthropy Club Toshiaki Shimanoki  Secretary-General, Fielding Philanthropy Club  (and Department Manager, Planning Office,  CSR Management Promotion Div.) In fiscal 2009, we increased the number  of working teams to twelve (including  the teams in preparation) as compared  to four in fiscal 2008, and expanded the  physical scope of activity from the  Tokyo-Yokohama region to Sapporo, Osaka, and Fukuoka, for  nationwide coverage. At the same time, the circle of activity  genres was made more diverse by the addition of social  welfare, music, and community contribution to that of  preservation of biological diversity, which is the core concern. However, there are many other activities being developed  by employees in their respective areas. I want the Club to  offer comprehensive support inclusive of the financial end so  that these various activities can each be seated in a separate  team and be pursued more vigorously. Support for more vibrant activity   The Tale of the Bamboo-Cutter team The team is active in the  Sugao district of Akiruno  city, which is located in  Tokyo. The district is a  habitat for a Tokyo species  of salamander, goshawks,  and martens. The members  tend bamboo groves and forested zones that had been  neglected, and so help to preserve biological diversity.  Personal chopsticks team The team makes chopsticks  for personal use from wood  left over from thinning  operations and scrap wood.  The use of these chopsticks  raises awareness of the  importance of conserving  resources while reducing the destruction of overseas  forests and lowering emissions of CO2 in transportation.  Fielding Forest and Tree Planting Tour in Indonesia Employees began planting a  forest in the Indonesian  province of East Kalimantan  in 2006 for the purpose of  reviving and protecting  tropical rain forests. Thus  far, they have planted some  2,000 trees. To support campaigns for the protection of  orangutans, they are also planting trees that bear fruit  which orangutans eat. NEC CSR Awards 2009 Receipt of the Grand Prize in the  social contribution category For its approaches to preservation of biological  diversity, the Fielding Philanthropy Club was  awarded the Grand Prize in the social contribution  category at MDD 2009, the integrated social  contribution program of the NEC Group in fiscal  2009.

The United Nations proclaimed 2010 to be the International  Year of Biodiversity, and efforts to preserve biological  diversity have been gathering momentum internationally,  as exemplified by the declaration on biological diversity  made by the Nippon Keidanren (Japan Business  Federation) in March 2009 and the holding of the 10th  Meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Convention on  Biological Diversity (COP 10) in Nagoya, Japan in October  2010. In this context, employees are considering what  they can do, reaching out to other employees, forming  teams, and setting about dedicated activity.  Fielding People lecture This lecture series is aimed  at developing Fielding  people who have a broadly- based understanding of the  relations linking nature with  individuals and society as  well as a high environmental  awareness, and apply themselves to problem-solving  as global citizens. It is a venue for developing human  resources equipped to find solutions for social issues.  Fielding Grove maintenance team The teams activities concern  Fielding Grove, which is  located on forested land  leased exclusively for  maintenance by NEC Fielding  in a section of the Minato  Peoples Forest in the city of  Akiruno, Tokyo. The members perform thinning, trimming,  and other such work to tend the man-made forest, which  had been neglected for the preceding 25 - 30 years. Fielding Philanthropy Club activities for preservation of biological diversity  55 55 Participation in the campaign to clean  up the Tottori Sand Dunes organized  by Tottori Municipal Government  (Tottori Sales Office, Chugoku Branch  Division) Participation in the clean-up  campaign organized by the Group for  Protecting the Crying Sands of Itanki  Beach (Muroran Sales Office,  Hokkaido Branch Division) Endorsing the spirit of the Komaki  City Adopt Program, we at the  Komaki Branch Office registered for  activity under it and are participating  in the Citizen Action Day for  Prevention of Litter and a project to  condition the environment of an elementary school in the  neighborhood. In the latter project, the younger employees of  the Branch Office undertook the hard work of cleaning sand  and grit out gutters and digging to prepare flower beds. The  expression of thanks from the school principal and parents of  the schoolchildren motivated us to continue these activities. Keeping our community clean with  our own hands! Kozo Otsubo, Komaki Branch Office, Chubu Branch Division Voice Society NEC Fielding has supported the World Heritage Site  Theater, which is hosted by Asahi Shimbun and other  parties with the cooperation of the UNESCO right from  its start in 2006. We provide assistance for art projects  blending tangible cultural properties with intangible  ones (such as Noh theater, Kyogen theater, and  traditional music) on the stage of World Heritage sites  in Japan. In fiscal 2009, concerts and other events were held  at the three sites of Himeji, Kamakura, and Itsukushima.  At each of these sites, we set up special booths with  NEC Fielding has offices in more than 400 locations in  all parts of Japan. At each of these offices, employees  are engaged in various clean-up activities to help the  host community remain a pleasant and attractive place  while working to maintain good relations with it. These  activities include removal of litter from streets and  parks in the neighborhood of the office as well as  participation in campaigns for delittering rivers and  paths in hills led by NPOs and local governments. We accepted a request from a junior high school in  Tokyo for acceptance of students for a program of  workplace experience out of empathy with the purpose,  which was phrased as to give students an opportunity  to develop the capability to carve out a path for  themselves, learn responsible action, and get firsthand  experience of the importance of communication and  interpersonal ties. As a result, the Division accepted  four students for a program at Aru Parts Kawasaki.  There, the students experienced studies for production  innovation, repair of plasma and LCD panels, and  diagnosis and repair of telephones and POS systems. The Komaki Branch Office  held eco classes during the  summer vacation season for  the purpose of cultivating  eco excellence and  enhancing awareness of the  need for preservation of  nature and the environment. This session was the  fourth in the series, and was held at the Water Eco Park  in the city of Kakamigahara in Gifu Prefecture. The  children learned how to make pictures with pressed  flowers using only natural materials and toured the  aquarium containing freshwater fish.

Its hallmark is the  deepening of ties of friendship through communication in international sign  language. Society Music-loving employees of  the National Capital Area  Block organized a band. They  began practicing together in  February 2010 and  commenced activities as one  of the Fielding Philanthropy  Club teams under the name Green Band in April.  They currently give concerts at nursery schools and  other facilities for care of children. Although they  encounter difficulties in arranging schedules and finding  venues for their practices several times a month, they  remain in activity thanks to the lift provided by the  smiles on the faces of the children at the concerts. I coach kids on a youth  baseball team every  weekend. Thanks to their  hard work, the team won the  autumn tournament held in  September. I hope this  experience will serve them  in good stead into the future. (Mr. Tamura won one of  the individual CSR awards in the first half of 2009.) I participated in the  Deaflympics held in Taipei in  September 2009 as the  official cameraman for the  Japanese team. It took a lot  of stamina, but I was glad to  have the chance to support  the whole Japanese team. Since 2003, I have always taken part  in the felling of unneeded trees in the  windbreak forest Senbon Matsubara  in the city of Numazu. Besides its  beautifying effect, this work helps to  prevent crime and disasters in the  area, and gives me a chance to work  with people in the community. This is  why I got interested in participating.  (Mr. Nagai won one of the individual CSR awards in the  second half of 2009.) NEC Fielding employees volunteer to support the  staging of marathon events in various locations and  clean up after them. Employees of the Tsukuba Branch  Office ran an aid station at the 34-kilometer point in the  Tsukuba Marathon and handed water, rolls filled with  sweet bean jam, and bananas to the runners. They also  helped to clean up the area after the marathon was  over. Our employees also assisted the running of water  supply points and aid operations as well as the post- event clean-up at the Yodogawa River Citizens  Marathon and the Hokkaido Marathon. In response to the strong earthquake that struck Haiti  on January 13, 2010, NEC Fielding solicited donations  for the quake victims from its employees. The drive  gained the support of many employees and collected a  total of 428,778 yen. The money was donated to the  international emergency humanitarian aid organization  Japan Platform through NEC. Office employees assisted  the setup, guidance, and  dismantling work at venues  where coming-of-age  ceremonies were staged for  the challenged. The setup  and dismantling work was  physically demanding and tired them out, but they  forgot the fatigue when they were thanked by the  organizers on their way out.

In Japan, too,  measures to this end are being accelerated, as evidenced by the  effectuation of the amended Energy Conservation Law, which obligates  reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. NEC Fielding falls under application  of the Law, and must improve the efficiency of its energy utilization by at  least 1 percent every year. This is not an easy task. NEC Fielding has long  been making priority use of energy-saving types of equipment and taking  companywide steps to conserve electricity and resources, but we will have  to deploy even more efficient initiatives in the future. What has come to the fore under these circumstances is EnepalTM PC.  This is a green IT service of the software-as-a-service (SaaS) type newly  developed by NEC Fielding, and curtails power consumption by computers.  The Environment Management Promotion Office went with EnepalTM PC as  a new means of cutting CO2 emissions, and installed the software in some  7,000 computers in the company. The resultant reduction in power  consumption is projected to save about nine million yen per year. We have  high hopes for EnepalTM PC as a computer user ourselves and are convinced  it can also contribute to activities for CO2 emission reduction at customer  sites. High hopes for the energy-saving effects of  Enepal TM PC Hiroaki Kikuchi   Department Manager, Environmental Management Promotion Office, CSR Management Promotion Div. EnepalTM PC makes visible the amount of power  consumption by computers in the office and CO2  emissions due to power consumption. It also centrally  manages the use of a plural number of computers.  Merely by setting the target for CO2 emission  reduction, it automatically controls the amount of power  Promotion of eco activities in the office consumed by computers, in correspondence with the  use pattern of each user. In addition, it enables the  setting of targets and management of progress in units  of divisions or sections, and so helps to heighten the  environmental awareness of employees on these  levels.  EnepalTM PC was created around a system for autonomous control of IT  hardware. The technology behind it was based on a project of joint research  and development launched in 2004 by NEC, the National Institute for  Environmental Studies, and the University of Tokyo Research Center for  Advanced Science and Technology. NEC Fielding began to take part in this  project in 2008. The project set out to commercialize EnepalTM PC as a SaaS- type service, and we got the call in view of the excellence of our technology  for handling such services, as exemplified by operation of our data centers.  We were consequently assigned to the actual work of commercialization in  all phases, from proving tests to software development. In the development, we took the greatest pains to find the best way of  showing the screen to the user. EnepalTM PC makes the amounts of  computer power consumption and CO2 emissions visible to the users, but  must make them take notice. A simple display of figures will not do. I intend  to further improve the screen while incorporating feedback from users. Since its release,  EnepalTM PC has been  given high marks by  users in various quarters.  There are particularly strong needs for it in other countries. For  the future, I would like to see its application spread to external  markets and fields other than computers. Besides other IT  equipment, the application prospects include air-conditioning  systems, lighting, and other general office equipment, and even  home electronics. As this indicates, I hope to broaden the base of  our eco IT solution business. 58 Other environmentally-friendly products  and services  IT environmental assessment We perform assessments of the environment of IT systems  installed in data centers and server rooms. More specifically,  we survey and examine this environment, and make reports  and propose measures in correspondence with the  objectives (e.g., energy conservation and mitigation of  environmental problems) and results.  iSolution services These services center around our housing service, through  which customers entrust us with the operation of their  servers, and encompass all sorts of services in monitoring,  operation support, and proxy operation. These services  enable customers to reduce the CO2 emissions from their IT  systems by large amounts.  Wide-area 3Rs services (hardware removal services) We accept requests for removal of IT hardware no longer  needed from the premises of corporate customers. We have  also constructed a system for parts reuse after detachment,  checking, and repair as necessary, and are therefore  engaged in the recycling of IT hardware components. We are generally selling EnepalTM PC  to firms with at least 1,000  computers, because we figured a  number on this order would be  required considering the cost  effectiveness, but we have also been  getting surprisingly many inquiries  from companies with from 100 to 200 computers. The  outstanding feature of EnepalTM PC is the autonomous  control function that turns off power. The ability to see the  savings has a strong appeal for these customers. They  want to know how much power their computers are  actually using or wasting, and link this knowledge to energy  conservation. NEC Fielding offers many kinds of eco IT solutions. I  want to contribute to reduction of CO2 emissions by  customers and society as a whole through provision of  EnepalTM PC and other optimal means to address the  diverse energy-saving needs of each and every customer.

We set specific targets with the following five  categories as a medium-term environmental activities  plan, based on the 2010 Environmental Management  Targets. We also periodically self-evaluate the level of  achievement on these targets in order to further  improve our activities. Currently we are reviewing all target values taking  into consideration the absorption merger of NEC  Infrontia System Service Corporation in April 2009.

Environmental Performance Fiscal 2009 Future Themes of activities  Results of activities Challenges We made our efforts to prevent global  warming and reduce environmental  burden as far as possible by steps such as  conservation of resources and energy,  decrease in industrial waste, and increase  in recycling rates, for positive contribution  to the prevention and solution of various  environmental problems. 1. Reduced GHG emissions by 6% more  than our target. 2. Reduced CO2 emissions from  customers and society by 12% more  than our target. 3. Made active proposals of  environmentally-friendly services  (eco-appeal proposals). We will set our next ultra  long-term targets for the  reduction of CO2 emissions,  and work to combat global  warming.  We use a mass balance (material balance) modeling  approach that clearly displays the environmental burden  resulting from business activities, in order to measure  and improve our environmental performance. Since  fiscal 2009, we have expanded the scope of the  environmental burden monitoring to cope with the  amended Energy Conservation Law. Mass balance model Environmental accounting  The amount of CO2 emissions from manufacturing by other firms of the  materials such as maintenance parts and equipment purchased by  Fielding in each year. The calculation is based on the purchase amount for  each item and the input output tables, and applies LCA data compiled by  NEC Fundamental and Environmental Research Laboratories. The amount of CO2 emissions from the use of energies such as electric  power and gas on Fielding premises. The calculation is based on the  consumption of each energy and LCA data. The amount of CO2 emissions through recycling process of certain  materials less the hypothetical CO2 emissions that supposedly would  occur by manufacturing of such materials from raw materials instead of  using recycled materials.

In doing business, we take account of indirect  environmental burden off the company premises in all  phases, from resource procurement where we  procure maintenance parts and materials from outside  Switch to eco vehicles  In fiscal 2003, we began to make the switch to eco  vehicles, mainly for leased vehicles which make up  most of our company cars. In fiscal 2009, we took over  NEC Infrontia System Service Corporation and the  share of our fleet occupied by low-emission vehicles  dropped to 91%. We set a goal of increasing the share  to 100% by the end of fiscal 2014. Reduced CO2 emissions from customers and  society Striving to link environmental management with actual  business activities, NEC Fielding is setting targets for  and promoting such management to encourage the  transition to sustainable business. While reducing greenhouse gas emissions in  business activities, we are also pursuing reduction of  emissions from our customers and society as a whole  through our IT support services. In fiscal 2010, we set  our sights on the goal of reducing GHG emissions to  practically zero. In fiscal 2009 alone, we reduced  emissions from customers and society by 13,467 tons. suppliers, and service activities through recycling  activities. Overall CO2 emissions in fiscal 2009 were reduced  around 5% (14,000 tons) compared to fiscal 2008, to  around 247,000 tons. This is as a result of reduction in  CO2 emissions at the stage of materials procurement  and service activities, and partly a decrease in sales. In  terms of CO2 emissions per unit of output, we have  stayed in the fiscal 2008 level.

Having  been commissioned by NEC, we have built a system  for recycling parts and components of IT equipment.  Through the system, we collect used IT devices that  our customers no longer need, and remove, inspect,  and repair their parts. Our recycling volume in fiscal 2009 decreased from  fiscal 2008, as an increasing volume of IT equipment is  being sold in the secondhand markets. In October 2006, NEC Fielding launched a campaign of  production innovation. Our Repair Division, which is our  only unit engaged in production activities, and the  Logistics Division set about these activities, which  culminated in consolidation of the Yamato Techno- center into Aru Parts Kawasaki in fiscal 2009. This  move greatly lowered levels of environmental burden. The first step in the activities lay in tightening  adherence to the rules about neat arrangement and  fixing of placement locations, items, and quantities in  each work place. The second consisted of a thorough- going review and improvement in each process with a  view to constructing a smooth flow without any  backlogs. These steps succeeded in bringing a  50-percent savings of space at both locations in  addition to raising productivity and shortening lead  time. As a result, we consolidated Yamato Techno- center into Aru Parts Kawasaki in September 2009. The closure of the Yamato Techno-center thanks to  this consolidation made it possible to reduce use of  electricity and city gas, and do without the four runs  per day of truck transport between the two locations.  As a result, CO2 emissions were reduced by about 30  percent. In order to further lighten environmental burden  inclusive of logistics, NEC Fielding is going to promote  more improvement and plans to extend similar activities  to parts centers across the country in fiscal 2010. Recycling Decrease in environmental burden through activities for production innovation * Value of recycled parts is calculated based on the unit price of new replacement parts.

It will be best if  we have all parts ready at service bases where they are  needed; however, there is a limitation on types and  quantities of parts we can keep at hand. When a system problem is discovered, it is  important to deliver as soon as possible the needed  parts to the needed location for a prompt recovery. On  the other hand, if we give top priority to speed up the  delivery time, we will need more costs and energy  consumption. We thus determined to adopt the  following methods in combination to reduce our costs  and CO2 emissions.  Developed joint delivery network to supply and  collect parts  We keep a certain volume of parts stock at our parts  centers nationwide. When any parts are consumed,  they will be restocked by the next morning from the  parts supply center located in Kawasaki.  To supply parts and collect used parts, we joined  the NEC Groups production innovation activities and  developed the NEC Groups mixed-load truck network,  which connects its production plants and distribution  centers nationwide. We try to increase the efficiency of  the transportation network by sharing with other group  companies. In addition, we supply parts to our service  bases by making good use of the existing network  between them and parts centers. We have adopted a full-scale modal shift to bring  back collected used parts to the parts supply center, in  order to reduce both shipping costs and CO2 emissions.  This program is the flagship of our production  innovation campaign, and we are advancing it  throughout the company. Moving forward, we will  increase our load efficiency and reduce transportation  costs. Encouraging carrying by hand We use mainly motorcycle courier services or mini-cars  to deliver parts swiftly to service offices and customers  comparatively a short distance away. When there is  enough time, however, we encourage delivery by hand  using railways or other means of public transportation,  in order to practice delivery that is fast, safe, low-cost,  and environmentally-friendly. Because this is essentially  transportation by rail and foot, it can help to reduce  costs and CO2 emissions. We intend to continue  actively developing it. Use of Shinkansen trains (Rail Go Service) and  ship transport If there is an outage of parts at the parts centers in the  Sendai, Morioka, or Niigata area, parts must be rapidly  shipped from Tokyo. In such cases, we utilize the Rail  Go Service for transport via the Tohoku and Joetsu  Shinkansen (bullet train) lines for same-day delivery.  The service accepts orders and cargo handovers during  a long period of time between 7:00 am to 11:30 pm, so  we make active use of such convenient option. In  addition, the recovery of parts from Okinawa at the  parts supply center in Kawasaki is performed by ship  transport and NEC mixed-load trucks. Arrangements  consequently strike a balance among the interests of  environmental preservation, transport speed, and  transport costs. Express bus transport We use long-distance express buses for urgent parts  deliveries. These buses are originally meant for  passenger transport, and run regular routes traveling on  expressways. Although we cannot use this form of  transport for larger volumes, valuables, or items  requiring confidential handling, it is the perfect method  for shipping small parcels of parts to relatively remote  locations. We believe that this means of transport is safer,  cheaper, more reliable and environmentally-friendly  with a better cost performance than using motorcycle  delivery each time.  Use of special bags for shipping parts We devised and are  putting to use  special durable  bags for shipping  parts. Formerly, we  sent parts in  cardboard boxes  packed with  material to absorb  shocks. The bags  can be used over and over, and therefore greatly reduce  our use of cardboard boxes and packing materials.

Eco Excellence employees are those  who have environmental knowledge  and action capabilities, and their  achievement level can be identified  through the NEC Groups  Environmental Management  Awareness Survey.  We have achieved the foregoing target with the number of Eco  Excellence employees at 98.5% of the total, as a result of our  environmental education activities provided to all employees on  an annual basis since fiscal 2005.  The followings are the progress of our environmental education;  General education (including basic education for new  employees; basic refresh courses every three years; and  Environmental Education 2009 for all employees): 10,772  employees  Special education (for employees newly assigned to special  works): 211 employees   Manager education (for employees newly assigned to managers  and promoters for environmental management): 46 employees  Auditor education (for employees newly assigned to internal  environmental audit and environmental patrol): 51 employees  We will work actively  to enable 100% of our  employees to achieve  an Eco Excellence  level through  continuous  environmental  education, in order to  enhance our  environmental  management  capabilities through  the involvement of all  employees. We provide environmental education through TRAINS- IV (                   ), a web-based, self-directed leaning  system. All study records controlled under TRAINS-IV  are automatically incorporated into our environmental  information system. We then edit and display the status  of environmental education for each subject and  division, for further advancement of environmental  education. Management of environmental education status see page 47 * The number of people taking the refresh course differs each year, because  employees only take the course once every three years. * Each year, 100% of target students take courses.  Environmental Education / Environmental Communication 68 Environment Environmental Communication Fiscal 2009 Future Themes of activities  Results of activities Challenges We worked on to enhance our environmental  communication activities, by offering greater  amounts of information to all stakeholders in  an easy-to-understand format, in order to  gain their understanding of our environmental  management activities. In fiscal 2009, we  implemented practical education,  popularization, and action initiatives in order  to strengthen our brand power.  1. Sponsored the project for support of  sustainable education 2. Carried out the following activities to  combat global warming:   Creating the Fielding Forest   Holding the Fielding Environment Month  (solicited environmental slogans and  posters from employees and their families)  We will work to  achieve  environmental  communication  capable of providing  more information to  our stakeholders in  an easy-to- understand format. We host a slogan competition  for employees under the  theme To Live Together with  Environment as part of our  efforts to improve  environmental awareness. In  fiscal 2009, we have received  a large number of 10,528  entries. We also solicit  environmental posters  containing selected slogans  from our employees and their  families, and have received 111  entries for the same year. The highest awarded poster  will be posted at all sites of our activities for one year,  while advancing environmental initiatives. Under our medium-term environmental activities plan,  and from the perspectives of preventing global warming  and preserving the earths biodiversity, one of our  efforts is to establish a Fielding Forest on the island  of Kalimantan in Indonesia in order to recover and  restore tropical rain forests* since 2006. We have successfully planted total of 2,000 trees by  fiscal 2009. We also organized the 4th Fielding Forest  and Tree Planting Tour, aiming to provide environmental  education to raise the awareness of the importance of  global environment and foster people to protect it. This  time thirteen  employees and their  family members  participated in the  tour, observed the  forest and planted  150 commemorative  trees. Held in all parts of the country, Fielding Solution Fair  proposes optimal environmental solutions to  customers. In fiscal 2009, the Fair was held in nine  cities, and included seminars and exhibits of  environmentally-friendly products and services such as  EnepalTM PC and green hybrid-type UPS. * Tropical rainforests: Tropical rainforests, where we can find various kinds  of organism species, are said to supply half of all terrestrial oxygen. They  are currently in an extremely serious state of forest destruction, due to  forest fires and deforestation, which will cause a further increase in CO2 and  decrease in wildlife species. Fielding Environment Month Creating the Fielding Forest  Fielding Solution Fair Environmental Poster 2009 The project for support of sustainable education  distributes books that deepen understanding of the  changes currently under way in the global environment  to elementary, junior high, high, and special schools  nationwide, to prompt thought about the environment  among children as tomorrows leaders. Endorsing this  aim, NEC Fielding sponsors and supports the project. Earth Code - 4.6-billion-year prologue The global environment is constantly changing.  Born in this environment, our bodies, too, are  the results of morphological changes for  survival. Our eyes, hands, feet, bones, and  organs are still engraved with earth codes. This  book was prepared to bring the inextricable ties between the earth  itself and our selves home to readers, make us keenly aware of  how our bodies have been designed for the earths environment,  and raise consciousness that we are all organisms living together  with the earth.

I was  impressed with the stance of cherishing employees  represented by the meetings for employee dialogue,  the Employee Assistance Program, and the organization  of the Working Team for Promotion of Positive Action.  It was likewise interesting to read about the increase  in the number of teams in the Fielding Philanthropy Club,  which was inaugurated in the preceding fiscal year, and  the spread of various activities in different areas. I hope  the Report will continue to profile these diverse doings. I would give high ratings to the consolidation of  sites that brought a big reduction in CO2 emissions and  the movement for carrying parts by hand and in special  reusable bags. Though unspectacular, these are steps  in the right direction. From this information, it is clear to me that innovation  is proceeding in each field and that NEC Fielding has a  strong commitment to promotion of CSR activities. Lastly, I would like to relate my wishes for future  CSR activities. While NEC Fielding is aiming for all- points CSR activities, the basis is discharge of its  responsibilities in society through its regular IT  business. IT systems are now lifelines of the  contemporary age, and resolution of the digital divide  has become an urgent task. Similarly, approaches to  prevention of global warming and other environmental  problems must no longer be deferred. I would like to  see NEC Fielding devise technology for solution of  these problems on various levels as one of the  companies driving the IT industry, whose people are in  possession of IT know-how. The initiatives for  prevention of global warming contained in the 2009  review took a step forward with the development of  EnepalTM PC. By all means please work for the  worldwide spread of this software. I am looking  forward to continued resolute action on behalf of CSR  by NEC Fielding as a leading company. Third Party Review 69 Hiroyuki Yamaguchi Chief Administrator, Waseda University Graduate School of Asia-Pacific Studies Born in Tokyo in 1962, Mr. Yamaguchi graduated from Waseda University with a degree in education. While working as an employee  of the university, Mr. Yamaguchi organized the Japan Volunteers in Parks Association (J-VIPA), which began to send Japanese  volunteers (himself included) to national parks in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia in 1994. Drawing on this  experience, he opened the Hirayama Ikuo Volunteer Center (WAVOC) in 2002 and set about promoting activities of social  contribution in the field of education on the university level. After serving as chief administrator of the School of International  Liberal Studies, he was appointed to his current position in 2008. He is currently engaged in activities for environmental protection  focusing on Mount Rainier National Park in the United States, and Mount Fuji and Mount Hotaka in Japan. He recently also started  a campaign for preservation of the Manzanar War Relocation Center historical site where Japanese-Americans were interned  during the Second World War. Third Party Review I have continued to read the NEC Fieldings CSR report  ever since the first one, and realize that its CSR activities  are steadily evolving by the year. In my comments here,  I will take up new activities over the last year. The feature at the beginning profiling a typical day  on the job for a customer engineer was a good one that  gives the reader a close look at the activities of the  approximately 4,300 such engineers nationwide. It was  interesting to learn how the different work corresponded  to a different type of CSR activity. I would also give  high marks to the addition of the technical center tour  into the stakeholder meetings. This enabled the  participants to see whats behind the companys  reliability with their own eyes. The Report also mentions the preparation of the  Second CSR Medium-term Plan and the change of the  name of the former CSR and Internal Auditing Division  to CSR Management Promotion Division. I imagine  that these developments evidence the solid rooting of  CSR activities throughout the company, which has  matured to the point that CSR is now at the nucleus of  its management. Along with the change of president in  June 2008, the company hammered out the basic policy  of All-points CSR activities. I hope to see it vigorously  practice this policy through a companywide effort. In addition, the Report describes changes including  the establishment of income accounting centers, more  thorough education in sales compliance, the  development of the block system into the unit system,  and changes in the membership of the Crisis  Management Committee. I can feel the companys  determination to make solid arrangements on the fronts  of compliance and governance, which are not very  visible to outside observers but nevertheless form the  backbone of the organization.

It follows last years  division of the whole into five categories, presentation of  TOPICS articles in each category, and description of new  approaches and their results in fiscal 2009. All of the TOPICS  revolved around the theme of support. As a new step, we included a feature article on the typical  day of one of our customer engineers (CEs), who are at the  core of our business operations. Through it, we wanted to  deepen understanding of our business activities and portray  the CSR activities embedded in them. We have adopted the policy of not limiting the target  readership of the report, which is designed to provide  Postscript information to all types of stakeholder. The feature article was  a product of our efforts to find a way to profile NEC Fielding  in terms that would be easy for all to understand. We urge all  stakeholders to give the article a read. We remain committed to preparing reports that convey  the distinctive character of NEC Fielding, and would deeply  appreciate any comments or observations on the report from  its readers.
