Collaboration among stakeholders in the  public and private sectors, across virtually every sector of the value  chain is vitally important. as a business, we remain committed  to actively participating in stakeholder dialogue and supporting  initiatives that are focused on increasing agricultural productivity,  managing and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture,  and improving the economic success of farmers and their families  in all parts of the world.  in 2011, we made great progress to our goals around sustainability,  engaging with many stakeholders and working in partnership with  organizations around the world. im pleased to present you with  Monsantos 2011 Corporate Social responsibility and Sustainability  report which outlines recent work in this area. Weve worked to  summarize both the challenges and progress made in areas critical  to our business and the communities we serve. While im very proud  of all of the projects we highlight in this report, there are two key   initiatives that truly stand out for the impact they have on making  agriculture more sustainable: Field to Market: the Keystone alliance  for Sustainable agriculture and World economic Forums New  Vision for Agriculture. i look forward to your feedback on the part- nerships in which were involved and the progress were making.  you, our external stakeholders, continue to serve as our guide for  continuous improvement in corporate social responsibility and  sustainability. We recognize that this begins in our own operations.  that is why this year we have joined the Global reporting initiative  (Gri), a sustainability reporting framework that helps companies  last year represented a true milestone for raising awareness and  advancing the broader global dialogue about the tremendous challenges  our growing world faces between now and 2050.  Letter from the Chairman measure and report their sustainability performance. this type   of reporting will be a continuous and transparent journey of  improvement for our business. i look forward to updating you   on our progress in future reports. part of our continuous journey is also exemplified through our  commitment to the un Global Compact and the 10 principles relat- ing to the areas of human rights, labor practices, environmental  protection and combating corruption. Since joining the un Global  Compact in 2009, we have provided an annual Communication  on progress and this years report includes our second installment  of our actions supporting the Global Compact. it also includes a  special update on our Human rights activities. our business remains committed to investing in agricultural  systems that can sustainably support the demands of our growing  planet—whether that is on-farm or at home. looking forward,   we are exploring opportunities to support continuous improvement   in crop yields through our efforts in breeding, agronomics and  biotechnology. We are also exploring better health and nutri- tion through our vegetable business. We are well-positioned to  strengthen our partnerships with farmers as a solutions provider  offering more efficient and sustainable farming practices. i am  proud to be a part of the work Monsanto does around the world   to help produce more, conserve more and improve lives.  i encourage you to read this report, and welcome your feedback,  while you learn more about how our business and our employees  throughout the world are working   daily to meet our commitments   to sustainable agriculture.

Addressing shAreowners in 2005, recognizing that many of our shareowners have   views about corporate governance practices they believe   will contribute to our companys success, we implemented   a shareowner outreach program to solicit their views on  governance and tell our governance story. our program has  continued and broadened since that time, as more of our large  institutional shareowners have welcomed, and now even  expect, engagement on governance matters.  We conduct our outreach throughout the year, through a  combination of in-person meetings, telephone conferences   and written correspondence. as appropriate, we include in the  dialogue the companys subject matter experts, along with   its governance professionals. Monsantos board of Directors  not only supports this outreach program, it receives detailed  summaries of each outreach meeting or telephone conference  and copies of shareowner correspondence.  a key aspect of our program is that our shareowners have the  opportunity to set the agenda. this outreach is not just about  Monsanto promoting its governance practices. it is about  learning and understanding our shareowners governance  priorities. our company has implemented a number of changes  in governance practices as a result of shareowner dialogue.  even where a shareowners view may differ from our companys  practice, we believe that both our company and the shareowner  have learned from the exchange of ideas.  We strive in this outreach program to provide shareowners  information about both our governance and insight into the  board and management of the company. our shareowners are  not sitting in our boardroom or in management meetings, so it is  our job to educate them about the character and quality of our  leadership. the shareowners should be readily able to see the  focus of that leadership on Monsantos success and its  willingness to carefully deliberate and address any significant  issues facing Monsanto.  our shareowners are key stakeholders in Monsanto. as owners of our  company they share a common interest in Monsanto, but they may have  different perspectives and priorities.

Stakeholders provided valuable insights about where they feel  Monsanto is achieving success along its sustainability pathway,  as well as where the company may look to make improvements.  Findings of the survey were formally presented in november 2011  to Monsantos senior level executives and to its entire global  leadership team (the MaC, or Management advisory Council),  which consists of more than 115 senior executives who are  responsible for the companys operations in all parts of the world.  in addition to identifying areas where stakeholders believe  Monsanto appears to be achieving success, specific recommenda- tions were made with respect to where the company needs to  make refinements or adjustments in its strategic focus, operations,  efforts to engage with various stakeholder groups, and efforts  toward transparency and disclosure.

Examples include:   Quarterly Pulse Survey Every quarter we sample   25 percent of our regular employees, asking five questions  which comprise an engagement index: 1) Overall Pride in   Monsanto, 2) Overall Job Satisfaction, 3) Willingness to  Recommend Monsanto as a Great Place to Work, 4) Willingness  to Offer Discretionary Effort, 5) Intent to Stay or Leave the  Company. Additional questions help measure employee   attitudes about overall leadership effectiveness, as well as  a range of other topics related to current issues facing the  company. The survey, which is global, is administered in   18 languages. The results are analyzed and presented to the  Executive Team and the Board of Directors every quarter.   Biennial Organization Survey Every two years Monsanto  retains an outside vendor to conduct a census survey of the   organization. The survey contains some 50 questions and is  sent to all regular employees globally. The survey measures  engagement levels and drivers in more depth than the Pulse  Survey. At the end of the survey process, managers across   the company can access a custom report for their team, which  can be used for benchmarking with other internal groups  and outside norms. Managers share the information with  employees and identify ways their teams can improve   the working environment.

GRI LA10 the theme of the three-day conference was Global  Commitment. Local Leadership. the conference celebrated  the progress we have made in sustainable agriculture and  was an opportunity to renew and reenergize our sustainable  agriculture commitments and plan for the future. about 175  Monsanto team members from across our global business,  representing multiple functions, participated. Members of the  companys executive team participated, including Ceo Hugh  Grant. all regional teams presented sustainability plans on the  last day of the conference. the conference proceedings addressed how the company could  strengthen our collaborations with customers, employees,  investors, and society to promote sustainable agriculture. the  company invited representatives from more than 20 other com- panies, farming organizations and nGos to share best practices,  learn about Monsanto and provide the company feedback. Farmer Customers  During the conference, we were joined by farmers from india,  South africa and the united States, who shared their regional  and global perspectives of agriculture. representing both small- holder and large production farms, our farmer guests called for  the need for global approaches to sustainable agriculture that  are also locally adaptable. they supported a systems approach  to agriculture and asked that we continue to be a leader in  providing solutions to farmers and representing their needs. industry leader engagement During a session on employee engagement, we heard from  industry experts from leading food and agricultural companies,  including bunge north america, Campbell Soup Company  and novozymes north america. they discussed the value of  engaging employees with sustainability initiatives and also  underscored the need for innovative solutions and collaborative  partnerships. their feedback for Monsanto was valuable and  provided inspiration as to how all employees can be champions  of sustainable agriculture. nGo Stakeholders in our focus on investors, we were joined by Mark tercek, Ceo  of the nature Conservancy, and a former managing director   at Goldman Sachs. He recognized Monsantos commitment   to sustainable agriculture and encouraged the company to  continue to seek innovative partnerships in multiple sectors. lets put our top people together and your top people together.  lets identify the issues where we think we can create shared  value. lets base it on a kind of grand bargain, a conceptual  grand leap forward. the private sector putting conservation  front and center in its thinking while the environmental organi- zations do the same with productivity and yield, said tercek.

University of Florida to boost world corn production, scientists  with the university of Florida and Monsanto began collaborating in  2011 to develop an improved computer model for predicting corn  growth. Such models are important in understanding the impact  of climate change and decreasing water availability on agricultural  production systems around the world. the new model, expected  to be ready in two to three years, will make projections showing  how interactions between corn varieties, environmental conditions  and management practices influence grain yield. When completed,  the model, which focuses on corn products for food, animal feed  and fuel production, will be placed in the public domain to help  researchers conduct studies and provide information to policy  makers, industry personnel and extension agents who work with  farmers.

He is also a lead author on the ag Sector chapter  and the Sustained assessment chapter. the nCa, conducted  every four years, is an important resource for understanding and  communicating climate change science and impacts in the united  States. it covers already observed changes, the current status of  the climate, and anticipated trends for the future. the nCa report  process integrates scientific information from multiple sources  and sectors. nCa establishes consistent methods for evaluating  climate impacts in the u.S. and provides input for federal science  priorities. nCa findings are used by u.S. citizens, communities and  businesses as they create more sustainable and environmentally  sound plans for the nations future. the nCa is commissioned  by the u.S. Global Change research program (uSGCrp), which  coordinates and integrates federal research on changes in the  global environment and their implications for society. nCa began  as a presidential initiative in 1989 and was mandated by Congress  in the Global Change Research Act of 1990.    the Conservation technology Information Center (CtIC)   a national, public-private partnership, CtiCs mission is to  champion, promote and provide information on technologies and  sustainable agricultural systems that conserve and enhance soil,  throughout our companys long history, Monsanto has always   maintained a close relationship with farmers, initially in the u.S.   and increasingly in all corners of the world..  external organizations & initiatives   BUSInESS PROFIlE  3   StAkEHOLdER ENGAGEmENt  11  TEcHnOlOgy And BUSInESS gOVERnAncE 25  cOmmITmEnT TO SUSTAInABlE AgRIcUlTURE 38   PROdUcIng mORE 40   cOnSERVIng mORE  47   ImPROVIng lIVES 62   gRI IndEx 89  19 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report the Americas Farmers Grow America  program continued its success in 2011. over  520 million people have been reached by the  program through various media. the aware- ness that u.S. farmers are the most productive, environmentally  sustainable producers in the world continues to grow.

Americas Farmers Grow Rural EducationSm  gives farmers the opportunity to nominate a  public school district in their rural community  to compete for a grant of either uS$10,000 or  uS$25,000 to enhance education in the areas of science and/ or math. School districts that apply for a uS$10,000 grant will  compete against other school districts that are located in the  uSDa-designated Crop reporting District (CrD). a school district  that applies for a uS$25,000 grant will compete against schools  that are located in its state or designated region.  177 grants of uS$10,000 and 22 grants   of uS$25,000 were awarded. overall,  the monsanto Fund donated more than uS$2.3 million   to school districts in 39 states through this program in 2011. the Americas Farmers Grow Rural Education Advisory  Council selects the winning grant applications from public  school districts. this advisory Council is made up of 26 farmer  leaders from across the country who are actively engaged in their  local communities through various leadership positions. these  individuals are passionate about both agriculture and education,  which is essential when choosing the best grant application.  the program started with a successful pilot in illinois and Minne- sota, in which farmers were given the opportunity to nominate a  public school district in 165 eligible counties in those two states.  the Monsanto Fund awarded more than uS$266,000 to local  schools in 16 Crop reporting Districts through the pilot. the americas Farmers Grow rural education program is part  of a broad commitment by the Monsanto Fund to highlight the  important contributions farmers make every day to our society  by helping them develop their youth.     americas Farmers mILLION  PEOPlE HAVE BEEn   REAcHEd By THE PROgRAm OvER OvER 520 $2.3 external organizations & initiatives, cont.

Monsantos Gothenburg Water  utilization learning Center in nebraska, our Gothenburg Water utilization learning Center  provides answers and solutions to current questions and issues  raised in production agriculture. With a 324-acre research farm  and more than 80 demonstrations, the center displays how  farmers can use systems-based agriculture to manage drought  and improve yields while using fewer inputs such as water   and fertilizer. one of the most visually impactful demonstrations shows farmers  the preferred ways to prepare for drought conditions from a  genetic, trait and agronomic systems standpoint. in addition to  showcasing our drought-tolerant pipeline technologies derived  through breeding and biotechnology, the center demonstrates a  systems-based approach to help farmers manage dry conditions,  the effects of planting population and row spacing under various  irrigation regimes, and irrigation management options for   limited water.  the center has the ability to reach a diverse group of people to  demonstrate how our technologies can help farmers produce  more while conserving more. in 2011, nearly 4,000 people  visited the center—including farmers, dealers, retailers, crop  consultants, company executives, members of non-governmental  agencies, politicians, university personnel and journalists.  external organizations & initiatives, cont.   14,302 vISItORS HOStEd  in 2011 GRI EC8   BUSInESS PROFIlE  3   StAkEHOLdER ENGAGEmENt  11  TEcHnOlOgy And BUSInESS gOVERnAncE 25  cOmmITmEnT TO SUSTAInABlE AgRIcUlTURE 38   PROdUcIng mORE 40   cOnSERVIng mORE  47   ImPROVIng lIVES 62   gRI IndEx 89  21 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report manage them. During drought, tolerant maize hybrids are  particularly susceptible to pests that are likely to feed on  greener, healthier plants in the fields. in 2011, the executive  advisory board of the WeMa project requested access to insect  protection technology to complement the efforts to develop  drought-tolerant maize hybrids for smallholder farmers in africa. Monsanto agreed to provide the technology royalty-free to the  WeMa project for Sub-Saharan africa, except in the republic   of South africa where smallholder farmers already have access. Maize hybrids developed in the WeMa project will help produce  more reliable harvests and better grain quality. Monsanto esti- mates this effort could result in new white corn hybrids that may  provide 20 to 35 percent more yield during moderate drought— enough to help keep hunger at bay for many in the region. this effort is only part of what is needed to help these farmers  boost their yields and incomes. Farmers also require good soil  health, improved training and information, and access to markets.  WeMa represents a great example of people from different  institutions and backgrounds partnering together to achieve  a common vision.

Water efficient Maize for africa   (WeMa) update WeMa is a public/private partnership, initiated in 2008,   dedicated to improving lives through the development of   products that help smallholder farmers mitigate drought risk   and manage insect pressure.  led by the Kenya-based african agricultural technology   Foundation and funded by the bill and Melinda Gates and  Howard G. buffett foundations, WeMa key partners include the  national agricultural research institutes in Kenya, Mozambique,  South africa, tanzania and uganda, the international Maize   and Wheat improvement Center (CiMMyt) and Monsanto.  Since its inception, the WeMa partnership has successfully  developed a robust pipeline of new drought-tolerant hybrids that  will be available to local seed companies royalty-free over the  next five to six years. in 2011, the african agriculture technology  Foundation entered two conventional maize hybrids into  national performance trials in Kenya. the first WeMa products  are expected to be available to farmers in early 2014. like drought, insects are a major challenge for maize farmers  in africa, who often have little to no resources to effectively  external organizations & initiatives, cont.   mORE yIELd EStImAtEd   AS A RESULt OF tHE wEmA EFFORt IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 20%-35%   BUSInESS PROFIlE  3   StAkEHOLdER ENGAGEmENt  11  TEcHnOlOgy And BUSInESS gOVERnAncE 25  cOmmITmEnT TO SUSTAInABlE AgRIcUlTURE 38   PROdUcIng mORE 40   cOnSERVIng mORE  47   ImPROVIng lIVES 62   gRI IndEx 89  22 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report over the past decade, Monsanto has sharpened its focus on  sustainable agriculture. We recognize the need for compre- hensive stakeholder engagement, including active and ongoing  participation in multiple stakeholder initiatives focused on  increasing agricultural productivity, reducing the environmental  impact of agriculture, and raising the economic success of the  farmer in all parts of the world.  in this section, we highlight four of monsantos stake- holder engagements that are continuing to elevate the  sustainable performance of agriculture in various parts of   the world. Monsanto is committed to these organizations   and others with similar aims around the world, both through  the direct and continuing involvement of our various business  leaders and through ongoing financial support to maintain  these initiatives and advance their work.  Field to Market:   the Keystone alliance for  Sustainable agriculture Monsanto is proud to be a founding member of Field to  Market, an initiative of the Keystone Center that traces   its roots to 2006 and brings together representatives   from all elements of the food chain. Members range from   farm-to-table, with participants collaborating to address   the challenge of producing enough food, fiber, and fuel   for a rapidly-growing global population—projected to reach  nine billion by 2050—while conserving natural resources.  today, Monsanto is actively involved in Field to Market,  participating with nearly 50 companies, universities,   organizations, and industry associations, to develop and  implement methods for gathering information throughout   the food chain, to establish benchmarks and to find ways   to improve productivity and conservation.   the Field to Market environmental resource indicators   report evaluated changes over the past 20 years of   data for land, water, energy use, soil loss and climate   impact for corn, soybean, cotton and wheat production   in the united States.  the work of Field to Market on commodity crops is considered  best in class practice for measuring sustainability at the   farm level. among a variety of applications, the report   findings were used to develop the Fieldprint Calculator,   which helps farmers analyze how their management   practices influence natural resource outcomes on their   farms. this effort defines sustainable agriculture and  provides science-based, technology-neutral ways to   measure performance over time.    Meeting the challenges associated with addressing the  worlds agricultural needs in the approaching decades calls for collaboration  of stakeholders from virtually every sector in the food value chain, including  governments, universities, think tanks, environmentalists, international  economic organizations and numerous other entities in the public, private   and social sectors. key stakeholder engagement profiles GRI EN6, 14, 26 GRI SO1 GRI EC8   BUSInESS PROFIlE  3   StAkEHOLdER ENGAGEmENt  11  TEcHnOlOgy And BUSInESS gOVERnAncE 25  cOmmITmEnT TO SUSTAInABlE AgRIcUlTURE 38   PROdUcIng mORE 40   cOnSERVIng mORE  47   ImPROVIng lIVES 62   gRI IndEx 89  23 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report the Vision they share focuses on three critical goals:  1.  to meet nutritional demands while providing   affordable choices across the food value chain. 2.  to conserve or enhance the quality and quantity of natural  resources and meet the challenges of changing climate. 3.  to drive rural and national economic development   around the globe with well-targeted investments. the initiative established a 20/20/20 framework for achieving  results, which specifies: increasing productivity by 20 percent per  decade, reducing the environmental footprint by 20 percent   per decade and increasing the income of the rural family   by 20 percent per decade. the Visions 2012 report, Putting the New Vision for Agriculture into  Action: A Transformation Is Happening, outlines six elements that are  essential to accomplishing large-scale transformation. these are  leadership and Stakeholder alignment, Clear Strategy and priori- ties, Concrete investment and entrepreneurship pipeline, enabling  Hard and Soft infrastructure policies and investments, Catalytic  Financing and risk Management Solutions, and robust Mecha- nisms and institutions for Delivery, implementation and Durability.  While the new Vision initiative draws upon experiences and  developments occurring in many parts of the world, the report  describes specific country-led initiatives launched by the Vision  team in Vietnam, indonesia, Mexico and tanzania, and creation  of the GroW africa task force to develop similar initiatives for  other interested african countries. the GroW africa partnership,  convened jointly by the african union, the new partnership for  africas Development (nepaD) and the WeF, works to accelerate  sustainable investment in african agriculture to improve the  continents food security. a transformation of the global food system is underway,  representing tremendous potential to improve livelihoods and  ecosystems worldwide. along with the 26 partner companies  contributing leadership and technical expertise, the Vision   initiatives knowledge partners—the Food and agriculture   organization of the united nations (Fao), the Harvard   Kennedy Schools Corporate Social responsibility initiative,   and the international Food policy research institute—are  actively involved in this work. the WeFs Global agenda Council  on Food Security, a high-level multi-stakeholder group, also  provides guidance in an advisory role.  the Sustainability   Consortium established in 2009, the Sustainability Consortium (tSC) was  designed to develop science-based quantitative measurements  for evaluating product sustainability throughout the entire  product lifecycle across all relevant consumer goods sectors.  Monsanto was among the founding members of this global  initiative, playing a critical role in the early stages of the orga- nization and collaborates in the development of a scientific  framework for measuring and reporting on agricultural sustain- ability. tSC is an organization of diverse global participants  working to make the world more sustainable through better  products, services and consumption. the global organization  describes its vision as creating a common language to provide  all decision makers with transparent and accessible information  about the environmental and social impacts of the life cycle of  products, goods and services. tSC delivers results through science-based tools that   improve informed decision making for product sustainability  throughout product life cycles. tSC is developing a standard- ized framework for the communication of sustainability-related  information throughout the product value chain. this frame- work, called the Sustainability Measurement and reporting  System (SMrS), serves as a common global platform for  companies to measure and report on product sustainability.  With SMrS, companies can improve the quality of decision  making about product sustainability, enabling them to design  better products, more effectively manage the sustainability of  upstream supplies and suppliers, and communicate product  sustainability downstream to consumers. World economic Forums (WeF)   new Vision for agriculture  Monsantos executive leadership played an active role in   the inception and development of the WeF new Vision   for agriculture. today, 26 leading partner companies,   representing the full food value chain, are working to build   a framework for advancing global agriculture over the course   of the next several decades.  key stakeholder engagement profiles, cont.

Global Harvest initiative the Global Harvest initiative, a global multi-stakeholder  partner ship, was initiated by Monsanto, John Deere,   aDM and Dupont four years ago. the partnership identified  priority policies and investments to meet our global agricultural  needs. a key achievement was the production of the Global  Agricultural Productivity Indicator (Gap) report. the Gap  report serves as a leading indicator and a call to action for  officials and policy makers to make policy adjustments, focus  investment or commit additional resources. the Gap reporting  methodology involves the use of a well-documented  productivity analysis that reveals the relationship between  inputs and outputs for the agriculture sector. the goal is to  increase the ratio of outputs to inputs per sector.  on a global scale, there is a gap between agricultural  productivity gains in recent years and the projected gains  required over the next several decades. Sustainably doubling  agricultural output by 2050 will require total agricultural  productivity to grow at an annual average rate of at least   1.75 percent from a relatively fixed bundle of agricultural  resources. yet, over the past seven years, that rate   has averaged 1.4 percent (source: uSDa).

Stewardship throughout Monsantos global   regions includes row crops, vegetables and crop   protection products. effective product stewardship by Monsanto protects our  customers, products and the environment. it adds business  value by ensuring growers benefit from technology, and aligns  our activities with industry stewardship standards. Monsanto takes product stewardship very seriously and  considers stewardship to be a fundamental component   of responsible business practices and customer service. product stewardship policies are set at the highest levels   of the company and extend throughout Monsantos culture.   our commitment to careful and responsible product  development, management, use and discontinuation drives   our efforts. employees, acting as owners, embrace the  principles of excellence and continuous improvement.  across the Monsanto organization, programs and processes   are established and implemented to achieve specific business  results. Certain key activities within these current programs   and processes also have an impact on product stewardship.   as technology continues to advance, new stewardship programs  Monsanto Product stewardshiP      product stewardship—which we define as the legal, ethical and  moral obligation to ensure that Monsantos products and technologies are  safe, environmentally responsible and used properly—applies the principles   of the Monsanto pledge to our products, actions and businesses.

Farmers and seed  companies that want to continue to work with the trait will have  to address the regulatory implications of that decision.  Sustainability of biotech trait use   after patent expiry  even after the patents have expired, seeds that contain rr1   will still be highly regulated in many countries to which u.S.  soybeans are exported. industry stewardship guidelines, such as  the excellence through Stewardship program, take the position  that a trait should not be planted in a country unless that trait  has been approved for import into all important export  destinations for that crop.  although Monsanto is discontinuing its use of the rr1 trait and  converting to the new Genuity roundup ready 2 yield  soybean trait, the company announced plans to support key  import approvals for the rr1 trait through year 2021. For seed  companies that want to continue to use the rr1 trait, that  notice provided over ten years (six of them post-patent) to  make arrangements to provide ongoing regulatory support for  the rr1 trait. the six years of support that Monsanto is providing following  patent expiry is considered to be ample time for interested  parties to create an entirely new regulatory data package to  provide ongoing support for the use of the rr1 trait. that may  not be necessary if the industry, working through the biotech- nology industry organization (bio) and the american Seed trade  association (aSta), is successful in establishing a process that  will enable interested companies to strike an alternative arrange- ment. under such an arrangement, Monsanto would either  continue to support rr1 past 2021 or would transfer the existing  rr1 regulatory data package to another entity that would  provide continued support. being a leader in biotech trait development has benefitted  Monsanto, but also means that Monsanto is the first company   to have to wrestle with many difficult issues presented by this  relatively new technology. by providing a long lead time for those  interested in continued use of the rr1 trait, Monsanto hopes  that it provides a valuable model to the rest of the industry for  the sustainable use of traits after patent expiry.  stewardship Matters   Monsanto is working with industry groups, in consultation with seed  companies and farmer organizations, on mechanisms to transition proprietary  biotech traits to so-called generic status to enable access to technology   and farmer choice.

Monsanto maintains  its commitment to making the Global Compact and its  principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day  operations of our company.  through the Global Compact, Monsanto is also committed to  engaging in collaborative projects which advance the broader  development goals of the united nations, particularly the  Millennium Development Goals.  the unGC asks companies to embrace, support and enact,  within their sphere of influence, a set of core values which   relate to the Global Compact principles. these are Monsantos  actions and concomitant results. UN Global CompaCt in 2009, Monsanto Company became a member of the  un Global Compact, the worlds largest sustainability and  corporate citizenship initiative. the Global Compact is  comprised of more than 8,000 participants, including  over 6,000 businesses in 135 countries around the world.  GRI HR1–7   Human rights  UN1: PRINCIPLE 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection   of internationally proclaimed human rights.    Monsanto adopted a human rights policy in april 2006, guided by  the tenets of the universal Declaration of Human rights and the  international labor organizations Declaration of the Fundamental  principles and rights at Work. in 2011, Monsanto continued its  focus on implementing the policy at its sites and with its business  partners. See page 64 for more details.    Monsanto launched its third mandatory computer-based Human  rights policy training module to all employees, which consisted of  fictional scenarios and quizzes, and required a 100 percent score  to pass the course. UN2: PRINCIPLE 2 Businesses should make sure they are not complicit   in human rights abuses.    in 2011, Monsanto included human rights compliance clauses in the  direct contracts it signed with seed production business partners.     because the global risk assessments of the countries in which  Monsanto does business had been conducted three years ago,  Monsanto updated them in 2011. as a result, a number of country  classifications changed, and the companys efforts were prioritized to  focus on high-risk situations to ensure that its policy and practices  are aligned in the protection and advancement of human rights.    Monsanto assesses its business partners for compliance with the  policy on a rotating schedule according to risk level. in 2011, the  company conducted over 37,000 assessments, primarily   in india and africa.

See page 65 for   more details. UN4: PRINCIPLE 4 the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor.    audits of labor and management practices are conducted  routinely at Monsantos facilities and those of its business  partners to ensure compliance with Monsantos policy and  identify situations which require intervention and remediation.  the audits are designed to ensure compliance with our policy  and all local legal requirements.    in the united States, Monsanto continues to operate as the  payroll agent for many of its small farm labor contractors to  ensure that the workers are compensated correctly.    Verification that Monsantos business partners do not engage  in forced or compulsory labor is conducted by independent  third-party auditors in certain world areas. Findings are  reviewed with any grower where questions arise or questionable  conduct is suspected and are acted upon immediately.   See page 65 for more details. UN5: PRINCIPLE 5 the effective abolition of child labor.    based on the standards articulated in the international labor  organization (ilo) Convention, Monsantos human rights policy  prohibits any form of exploitative child labor. in those situations  where minors may legally be employed, Monsanto will act to  assure that such employment does not interfere with the  educational opportunities of the children and will not expose  young workers to situations that are likely to jeopardize their  health or safety.

Monsantos technologies have been demonstrated to be envi- ronmentally superior compared to alternatives. the company  has made them available to growers around the world, always  complying with national laws and regulations applicable to  obtaining approvals and use. according to the international  Service for the acquisition of agri-biotech applications (the  iSaaa), biotech crops are now being used in 29 countries   by approximately 16.7 million farmers. the company has made  its products available to growers in 27 of those countries.    Monsanto has broadly licensed its patented biotech and seed  traits globally to hundreds of companies. this practice has  facilitated diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies   to farmers around the world.   environment UN7: PRINCIPLE 7 Business should support a precautionary approach   to environmental challenges.    Monsanto complies with all applicable laws and regulations in  the testing and evaluation of our products for environmental  impacts. Monsantos safety data packages meet the rigorous  standards of regulatory authorities around the world.     Monsanto has established practices to further the responsible  management of its products and technologies throughout   the product life cycle from product concept to product  discontinuation. Monsanto has established a life Cycle  Stewardship activities Management process (lCStaMp) that  guides and tracks the management of its life cycle stewardship  activities. it verifies consistency and compliance, leverages   best practices, facilitates proactive stewardship planning   and provides for stewardship verification and continuous  improvement. See page 27 for more details.    Monsanto also operates within the excellence through   Stewardship program, an industry-leading product  stewardship program sponsored by the biotech industry  organization. this program includes third party audits of   the companys stewardship programs and quality manage- ment systems. Monsantos u.S. region was certified in   2009, followed by Canada in 2010 and brazil and latin  america South in 2011. information regarding the   excellence through Stewardship program can be found   at excellencethroughstewardship.org or on page 26.    as the leader in the stewardship of roundup agricultural herbi- cides, Monsanto implemented a stewardship program called  the Glyphosate endangered Species initiative. the program  provides growers with a simple web-based tool, pre-Serve, to  identify areas where threatened or endangered plant species  may exist near agriculture. the website prescribes best  management practices that growers must implement with  certain use patterns and application rates in these identified  areas to minimize risks to the protected plant species.

Conserving more Conserving resources by developing seeds and agronomic  practices that use one-third fewer key resources per unit   of output to grow crops while working to lessen habitat loss  and improve water quality. Improving Lives Helping improve the lives of farmers and the people who  depend on them, including an additional five million people   in resource-poor farm families by 2020. these goals are challenging and we realize the solutions   to achieve these outcomes will not come from Monsanto   alone. as a company focused on agricultural innovation   we are pledging to do our part to support farmers as they   strive to meet the needs of a growing planet.

Farmers who are highly productive can earn greater  incomes and support economic growth in rural areas.  Producing More  41 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report PRODUCING MORE unfortunately, farmers abilities to meet this increase in demand  by boosting yields (output per unit of land) is constrained by their  access to innovative management practices and seed technology. Monsanto is tracking progress against this production goal  based on the policy environment established by the major  producing countries of each crop. based on a recent expert  analysis by the Context network, countries can be objectively  classified into three distinct policy groups: leading, transitional  and remaining. the Context network convened an independent  expert panel who analyzed both publicly available data and  proprietary Context data to develop their classification scheme.  each country is classified based on enabling agricultural  productivity through innovation (agronomic practices, plant  breeding, and biotechnology) and investment. based on these classifications, Monsanto will track and publish  progress toward the goal of doubling yields for leading countries.  these countries offer a policy environment that supports innova- tion and investments across all of the three yield growth pillars:  agricultural practices, plant breeding and biotechnology. Farmers  in these countries will have access to new technology and the  opportunity to implement innovations at a relatively faster rate.  through 2010, farmers in leading countries are making progress  toward the goal of doubling yields. Canola and cotton farmers  in these countries are effectively on track with this goal, with  yields that are 33 percent and 30 percent higher than 2000  levels, respectively. leading country corn farmers have  increased yields by 20 percent since 2000. Soybean farmers  in leading countries have increased yields the least among our  focus crops, with an 11 percent gain in yields since 2000. in each crop, however, farmers in leading countries are outper- forming farmers in transitional and remaining countries in absolute  yield enhancement. With a decade of yield monitoring history,   this data strongly supports the main point of this goal and   demonstrates that supportive country-level policies for invest- ment and innovation across the three primary yield growth pillars  are highly correlated with superior results in yield performance  achieved by farmers.   Monsanto established an aggressive target of doubling yields in four   major crops over a 30-year period. this goal is highly relevant as global  forecasted demand of corn, oilseeds and cotton over this same period   will increase significantly.  yIELd INCREASE  SinCe 2000 CANOLA yIELd  +33% COttON yIELd  +30% CORN yIELd  +20% SOyBEAN yIELd  +11% UN8, 9   BUSInESS PROFIlE  3   STAkEHOldER EngAgEmEnT  11  TEcHnOlOgy And BUSInESS gOVERnAncE 25  cOmmITmEnT TO SUSTAInABlE AgRIcUlTURE 38   PROdUCING mORE 40   cOnSERVIng mORE  47   ImPROVIng lIVES 62   gRI IndEx 89  42 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report based on a recent analysis by the Context network, the yield  and productivity growth of corn, soybeans, cotton and canola  crops can be objectively evaluated based on the policy  environment of various countries. the Context network report1 provides expert evaluation of   the policy environment supporting innovation and investment  across the three primary drivers of yield growth: agronomics,  breeding and biotechnology. based on these evaluations,  countries are classified into three distinct policy groups:    Leading countries provide a policy environment that  supports innovation and investment across all three yield  growth drivers.   transitional countries provide a policy environment that is  only partially supportive across the three growth drivers.   Remaining countries do not provide a policy environment   that supports innovation and investment across the yield  growth drivers. When evaluating the productivity levels across these country  classifications, there are remarkable differences. national  average yields and recent yield growth rates are the highest   in countries with leading policy environments, followed by  transitional and remaining policy environments.  With just one-third (55 million hectares) of the global   area under cultivation, corn farmers in the leading countries  produced more than one half of the worlds corn production  (429 million metric tons). Combined, the transitional and  remaining countries occupy nearly two-thirds of the production  area, but produce less than one-half of the worlds corn output. THE EFFECT OF POLICY ON   COrN PrOduCTIvITY raTEs Monsanto strives to increase the yield potential of corn around  the world.

Farmers have  seen yield increases anywhere from two to six tons per hectare  in one growing season. theyve also seen better seeding rates,  meaning more seeds per hectare, which saves on inputs   like fertilizer. the team anticipates expanding the geography covered by  the drill. to encourage farmer interest, the drill is showcased  at many farmer events, including buyer-seller meetings,  demonstration plots, farm shows and government events. project SHare envisages developing farmers as the agents  of sustainable change for farming—to become a lucrative  enterprise for generations to come. this change is already  manifesting itself in farming practices and the lives of farmers.  CASE STUDY: proJECT SHArE like many farmers in his village, lal mixed corn seed with  fertilizer and spread it over his field. He also used a traditional  planting method of a bullock-drawn plough based system.  using this method results in the random spacing of seeds   and direct contact with fertilizer—both factors which   decrease yield.  after seeing farmers experiment with mechanization, lal  decided to join a project that introduced him to a new sowing  and fertilizing drill that would revolutionize his farming practice. the seed and fertilizer drill was developed as part of Project  SHARE (Sustainable Harvest: Agriculture, Resources  and Environment), a partnership between Monsanto india  and the Indian Society of Agribusiness Professionals  (ISAP), to empower cotton and corn small and marginal land  holders across three states and 1,100 villages.  Project SHARE also has a farm advisory and extension service  that works to communicate the importance of modern  cultivation practices to farmers in rajasthans bhilwara and  bundi districts. the projects goal is to enable farmers to  augment yields and thereby incomes.  after one growing season, lal doubled his yield and saved  30 percent on seed costs. He and other indian farmers  enjoyed higher yields because of one change in their farming  techniques: mechanization. Monsanto india and iSap realized improper sowing, which  results in poor plant geometry in the field and affects optimum  plant population, was preventing farmers from receiving the  maximum benefit of Monsantos seed.  to address the issue, Monsanto india, iSap and project SHares  participating farmers contributed to the cost of developing the  seed and fertilizer drill, demonstrating the farmers willingness  to not only learn but also adopt modern practices that they now  believe can help them achieve higher yields. a seed and fertilizer drill is a device that controls seed  and fertilizer quantities to conform to ideal spacing    BUSInESS PROFIlE  3   STAkEHOldER EngAgEmEnT  11  TEcHnOlOgy And BUSInESS gOVERnAncE 25  cOmmITmEnT TO SUSTAInABlE AgRIcUlTURE 38   PROdUCING mORE 40   cOnSERVIng mORE  47   ImPROVIng lIVES 62   gRI IndEx 89 UN8, 9                       indian farmer Jamuna lal doubled yield and saved 30 percent   on seed costs.

Society also benefits. the u.S. government estimates that  about 100 million dry tons of stover can be sustainably  harvested each year. about 10 to 20 percent of this is enough  to provide feed equal to one to two billion bushels of corn for  u.S. beef and dairy herds. this is equivalent to a 10 percent  increase in the u.S. corn supply and could also free up 20  million acres (8 million hectares) of hay ground for other uses. by developing new uses for stover, the environment is  protected, and the strain on each corn harvest is lessened  because the corn that was once destined to be animal feed   can now be used for other purposes.  Corn stover is the stalks, leaves and cobs left after the corn  kernels are harvested in field corn. traditionally, stover has  been left in the field to reduce soil erosion and help increase  soil organic matter. However, higher planting densities and  increased yields have produced stover in amounts that exceed  levels needed to maintain soil health in the most productive  parts of the u.S. Corn belt. Farmers have responded to this  problem by increasing tillage to speed stover decay and reduce  crop residue in their seedbeds.  recently, scientists from Monsanto and archer Daniels Midland  (aDM), worked with the university of nebraska, lincoln (unl)  and iowa State university (iSu), government researchers and  equipment manufacturers to take a new look at stover and  identify how it can play an important new role in animal feeds. using a pre-treatment, a method similar to the one that is used   to make tortillas, enables the sugars in stover to be better  digested by beef cattle and dairy cows. this allows stover   to displace whole corn in livestock feeding programs.    producing two crops on each corn acre.

Monsanto is proud to be a founding member of Field to  Market: the Keystone alliance for Sustainable agriculture.  Field to Market has risen to the challenge of comprehensively  measuring the resource intensity of major row crops in the  united States. Key performance indicators measured by   Field to Market include land use, climate impact, energy use,  irrigated water use and soil loss. employing a three year rolling average of Field to Market  data and analytical methods for 2010, farmers in the u.S. are  tracking ahead of pace to achieve the goal of one-third less key  resources per unit of crop output. u.S. cotton farmers have  reduced average resource intensity by 23 percent. Soybean  and corn farmers are 19 percent and 14 percent more resource  efficient versus the year 2000 baseline observations. Monsanto is supporting efforts to document similar data   and analytical methods in additional countries. over the past  year, multi-stakeholder efforts in Canada and Spain have  issued reports that largely align to the Field to Market effort   in the united States. Moreover, Monsanto is consistently  voicing its support for more robust efforts to collect data   on a global basis that would allow for more consistent  monitoring of resource-use intensity levels in agricultural  production systems.

Monsanto Mississippi river   Watershed project in an effort to address the volume of nutrient and sediment  flowing into the Mississippi river System and the Gulf of Mexico  from adjacent farmlands, Monsanto partnered with the nature  Conservancy, the iowa Soybean association, Delta Wildlife and  national audubon Society in a three-year pilot project.  the project brought new tools and disciplines to help farmers  along the Mississippi river efficiently produce higher-yielding  crops for food, fiber and fuel in ways that further preserve water  quality and support diverse and abundant wildlife populations. the nature Conservancy conducted a conservation project in  four watersheds in the upper Mississippi river basin. Monsanto  worked with local partners—including farmers in those water- sheds—to implement and study conservation techniques that  best lower nutrient and sediment concentrations by reducing  runoff from agricultural landscapes. Meanwhile, the iowa Soybean association researched and   paired micro-watersheds in the boone and raccoon rivers.   the association coordinated conservation outreach in those  watersheds, including monitoring, measurement and evaluation  of on-farm resources and environmental outcomes. Delta Wildlife installed best Management practices (bMps) on  approximately 1,000 sites on working farms in part of the lower  Mississippi Valley, affecting 51,572 acres (20,870 hectares).  Designed to reduce off-site movement of nutrients and sediments,  the bMps stop an estimated 9,203 tons of sediment per year, 10,080  pounds of phosphorus per year, and 20,160 pounds of nitrogen  per year. these practices provide additional environmental benefits,  including improved fish and wildlife habitat and water conservation.  partnering to achieve conservation  and environmental gains    along with Monsantos work to advance the efforts of various  environmental and conservation partners involved in projects related to agriculture,  it has collaborated with willing and enthusiastic partners including growers and  farm families in all parts of the world.

Finding  solutions to this challenge was at the root of a three-year initiative  launched by Monsanto and the nature Conservancy (tnC) in 2009. the initiative brought together agricultural partners to target the  nutrients and sediments that affect water quality in the Mississippi  river and Gulf of Mexico. Four rivers and their watersheds were  chosen to test practices on working farms that keep valuable soil  and nutrients on fields and out of streams.  at Minnesotas root river watershed, short-term results show  reductions can amount to as much as 53,520 pounds of nitrates  entering the watershed each year. in the boone river watershed in  iowa, where the iowa Soybean association is an active partner, we  can approximate nitrate load reduction of 75,915 pounds per year.  but how do results like these help solve the challenge outlined in  my initial question? to feed a growing and more affluent population,  we will have to increase food, fiber and energy production. Simply  clearing more land isnt a sustainable option; already more than   40 percent of the earths land has been cleared for agriculture, and  the majority of the worlds finite amount of fresh water is already  allocated to this purpose as well. So to succeed in meeting global demand for agricultural   commodities—to double our production and feed a population   of nine billion—well have to intensify agriculture on existing lands   in a sustainable manner.  the promising results were seeing from Monsantos investment in  these four watersheds suggest we can meet this challenge, but only  if we see production and conservation as two aspects of one goal.  We are fully capable of designing farming systems that produce  higher yields of agricultural commodities and clean water at the  same time. So in that vein this initiative has not only been about  farming practices in places like iowa and Minnesota; it has the  potential to transform agricultural practices around the world.  We at tnC are proud to be part of such an effort and are grateful   for Monsantos willingness to provide regional and global leader- ship on these issues—to invest in science-based solutions to our  greatest challenges.  the Nature conservancys Great rivers Partnership brings together diverse partners   and builds experience and scientific knowledge through successful conservation projects   along some of the worlds most important rivers. to help farmers meet conservation requirements in two biodiver- sity corridors—one in the atlantic Forest (northeast Corridor)  and the other in Cerrado (Jalapo/Western bahia Corridor)— Monsanto has partnered with Conservation international (Ci).   through this collaboration, we believe we will encourage positive  changes for biodiversity and natural habitats.  Founded in 1987, Ci empowers groups to responsibly and  sustainably care for the environment, our global biodiversity   and the long term well-being of people. Headquartered in the   Washington, DC, area, the organization has 900 employees  working in nearly 30 countries on four continents, plus more  than 1,000 partners around the world. in brazil, the combined efforts of Ci and Monsanto support the  implementation of best practices along Monsantos supply chain.  the work also involves the implementation of concrete conserva- tion actions in the two biodiversity corridors.  Specifically, their objectives are:   1. preventing illegal deforestation 2. preventing the local extinction of species 3.  ensuring compliance with legislation in the agriculture   and livestock supply chain  the initiative focuses on two regions of brazil identified by Ci as  biodiversity hot spots; they are among 34 areas considered the  biologically richest and most threatened in the world, having lost  at least 75 percent of their original vegetation. thus, they are  priority areas for conservation actions. the areas also coincide  with regions where Monsanto operates and where agribusiness  has a significant impact on the environment.  Ci is advising Monsanto on ways it can improve its environmental  practices in relation to protecting the region. in turn, Monsanto  is adopting the conservation of biodiversity in the Cerrado and  the atlantic Forest as one of the key elements of its business  strategies in the region. as part of the partnership, both institu- tions are carrying out activities that will produce concrete and  measurable results to guarantee the conservation of biodiversity  in areas selected as critical by both partners. partnering to achieve conservation   and environmental gains, cont.

Fbrica So jos dos Campos in So jos dos Campos,  Brazil this site is also located in the atlantic Forest   region. employees at the plant work to restore fragments   of the rainforest both on-site and elsewhere in the city of   So Jos dos Campos.   on the site, employees worked with local native plant experts  to recreate an atlantic Forest fragment in an area that was  completely devoid of native vegetation. the reforestation  June each year, employees hand out 150 to 300 seedlings to  community members and participate in a trash clean-up   event along the roads. employees also participate in the  cleaning of the paranaiba river banks and an annual fish  release. in 2011, the total number of fish released into the  paranaiba river was 10,000.   other habitat enhancement projects include a pollinator  garden, where hummingbirds were observed within the first  year. three rock piles and one brush pile were created   in a non-vegetated area to supply cover for reptiles, amphib- ians and small animals. in the future, the wildlife team would  like to add more diversity to the native fish species raised in  the hatchery.   Monsantos effort in improving life of local communities is  evident in the work of the education advisory Committee  (eaC) in Cachoeira Dourada. the eaC works closely with  local schools to enhance the environmental and conservation  knowledge of the students in their community. the Committee  also involves adults in many of the annual clean-up events  to support a healthy environment. For example, in 2009, 52  elementary students from Colgio Srgio de Freitas pacheco  visited the site. they were taught about reforestation, native  species, and wildlife management. about 250 students from  escola Municipal branca de neve elementary School and over  340 students from escola Municipal Higino Guerra planted  20 trees at each of their schools, with help from the eaC and  Monsanto. Students also learned about watering trees, and  choosing the correct location for a seedling. other topics  included general environmental awareness and recycling.

Species  inventories indicate that a variety of native birds and other  wildlife use the restored habitat.    teaching others how to make a difference helps maintain  Monsantos long-term commitment to wildlife management   and habitat preservation. in our efforts to inspire   people and communities through example, Monsanto  employees engage in a wide array of volunteer efforts   within their local communities, and establish strategic   partnerships for wildlife habitat preservation and   restoration. one example includes Monsantos involvement   in work to increase the moose population in the   rocky Mountains. increasing the population   of Moose in the rocky Mountains Wild rose, sandbar willow and red osier dogwood are rich and  nutritious food sources for the Shiras moose, which lives in  the rocky Mountains. every year, Monsanto employees and  family members volunteer their time to re-establish stands  of these trees and shrubs in places where land and snow  slides, flooding, fire or other developments have destroyed  pre-existing stands.  after joining one of these events, Mike Mathews, president  of the north american Moose Foundation, observed that  while moose populations and habitat around the world  have diminished, the rocky Mountain area of Southeastern  idaho has seen its moose population increase each year.  according to Mathews, Monsantos state of the art   practices and world-class reclamation have helped to   make moose conservation and phosphorus production  compatible uses of the land.

Monsantos seed passes  through Hawaii multiple times in its breeding, biotechnology  trait development, trait integration, pre-foundation and   foundation seed production units during development to take  advantage of the favorable climate to grow multiple generations  of corn and soybeans each year.  at all locations, environmental stewardship is a key component  of Monsantos freedom to operate. Water and land are limited  and precious commodities in Hawaii, and the Monsanto Hawaii  team has taken the lead to preserve them. on all islands and in all operations, crops are produced using drip  irrigation. not only does this irrigation method preserve water  by delivering it directly into the plant root zone, it reduces the  amount of fertilizer needed to produce the crop, because fertil- izer is delivered directly to the root zone in small increments, as  opposed to one, larger application made at the beginning of the  growing season. as a result, the nutrients can be utilized more  completely by the crop.  Corn, for example, can be produced  using up to 60% less nitrogen with this method.  the biotechnology trait Conversion Center on Maui utilizes   r1 water from the municipal waste system to produce corn  seed.  r1 water is defined by the County of Maui as tertiary  treated recycled water that can be used without restrictions.   through collaboration with the County of Maui, Monsanto  purchases and uses more than 185,000 gallons of r1 water    according to the united nations, around 700 million people in 43  countries currently suffer from water scarcity. by 2025, 1.8 billion will be  living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds   of the worlds population could be living under water stressed conditions.  Monsanto believes that increasing the amount of bushels produced per gallon   is a crucial role of agricultural innovation.

Monsanto recently purchased a 2,289 acre (926 hectare)  farm on the island of oahu in Kunia. the farm is a multifunc- tional site hosting all aspects of Monsantos pipeline year  round. the farms watershed drains directly into pearl Harbor,  and the erosion of the red volcanic soil present in the area is  a very visible event. therefore, Monsanto devoted three years  to developing and installing a conservation plan that includes  water terraces, catchments and greenways to divert water  and capture sediment before it leaves the farm. What makes  this project unique is that in april 2011, Monsanto Kunia  the Fontanelles aqua View initiative, introduced four years  ago, is a systems approach comprised of water management  tools, quality seed genetics, educational programs and support  services designed to help growers in irrigated areas maximize  the value of their seeds and traits. Fontanelle Hybrids, a  Monsanto regional seed brand, has a large customer base in  nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, oklahoma and texas, where 50  percent of the area already has water pumping restrictions  from local resource districts or limited rainfall. With the instal- lation of moisture probes, growers respond to water needs on  a customized basis and only water when needed, saving costs  associated with unnecessary watering. based on 2010 results  from 475 aqua View system locations, the average Fontanelle  grower saved three rounds of watering per field. extrapolating  those numbers to the 795 aqua View systems in place in 2011,  growers saved 8,419,097,700 gallons of water. Fontanelles aqua View  initiative aqua View was the best piece of equipment on my farm last year... being involved in this  project has opened my eyes so much to water usage in the field and moisture management  in the soil. it is the best return on investment of anything i have used on my farm, said a  grower and aqua View participant from nebraska.  Gallons of water Saved 8,419,097,700 irrigation improvements, cont. received a competitive grant in the amount of uS$84,000  from the oahu resource Conservation and Development  Council. the grant was jointly funded by the u.S. epa and the  Hawaii State Department of Health, and was used to help   fund a small part of the uS$500,0000 cost of the project.   the Kunia farm conservation plan became the centerpiece of  the Honouliuli Watershed restoration project and is a great  recognition of Monsantos dedication to stewardship. Monsanto held a field day during the summer of 2011,   which was open to all growers in oahu. During the day, growers  were able to observe demonstrations in berming, terracing,  catch basin construction, cover cropping and grass waterway  development to further their own stewardship techniques   and knowledge.

When incomes are improved in  farming, rural communities where farming is prominent achieve  higher rates of job creation and economic expansion. Monsanto believes that agriculture can only be sustainable if  the livelihoods of farmers and those who depend on them keep  improving. We seek to aid in the improvement of the lives of all  farmers we are privileged to serve, however, we have set a  specific target of achieving a measurable improvement in at  least five million peoples lives in resource-poor farm families  between 2008–2020. based on global meta-analysis data compiled by iSaaa and pG  economics, 2.1 million resource-poor farmers adopted biotech  crops for the first time in the 2008–2010 period. these farmers  achieved uS$3 billion in additional net income as a result of  this technology adoption. based on farm household population  levels in the locations where these technology adoptions  occurred, six million to 12 million resource-poor farm family  members shared in these benefits. additionally, the communities  where these economic gains were achieved may have realized  three to seven times the level of economic benefits across   rural communities.1  Measuring the total economic impact of technology adoption  for farmers and rural communities is a challenging but  important objective for our assessments in the future.  Monsanto supports and will continue to support efforts to  objectively assess this area of our sustainable agriculture   goals and provide more detailed findings in future reports. improving lives   Many more people are now taking stock of the worlds ability to meet   growing food demand while conserving key resources for future generations.

We operate on a continuous improvement  approach in working with our business partners to address  the challenges posed by performing manual agricultural work,  especially in developing economies.  our priorities are guided by a global risk assessment, which  covers each part of the policy in every country where we   grow seeds and is updated every three years. in 2011, our  scheduled update included adding new countries, reflecting  changes in our business practices since 2008 and recent  country developments. after reviewing on a country-by- country basis the tendency for human rights risks to exist,   we overlaid country-specific operational information to   decide where the greatest risks reside. the result is a list  of high risk countries where we focus and conduct more  detailed assessments of our operations and our supply  chain. When we talk about our supply chain, we often use  the term business partner. Generally speaking, a human  rights business partner is someone who primarily provides  manual labor in the production of seed for Monsanto. the  chart at right shows the breakdown of business partners by  geographic area in 2011. our specific policy commitments and their implementation  merit additional detailed discussion.  india represents the biggest risk area for child labor in our  operations and supply chain.

More information on these programs in india and  their progress can be found on page 67, efforts to eliminate  Child labor in our business partners Fields in india.  Child labor risks also exist in other countries and Monsanto  works to mitigate the risk and remediate occurrences when  discovered. in 2011, our breeding site in San Juan de abajo,  Mexico, received the distinctive honor of being recognized  as an agricultural company free of child workers by the  Secretaria del trabajo y previsin Social (StpS) department  of the Mexican government. this is the first of our 11 sites in  Mexico to receive this distinctive honor and the first company  in nayarit State.  UN4  With regard to forced labor, there are some countries  in africa in which the widely used practice of tenancy  agreements can result in a forced labor situation for   migrant workers. HR7  in those countries, we are working  with our business partner growers to make sure their workers  are free to leave when they wish and will be compensated for  their work in total, regardless of when they elect to return to  their homes. HR5  UN3  For the countries where employees  freedom of association is at risk, we support our employees  independent decisions and included training on the rights  of employees to associate and bargain collectively in our  global training. For example, in 2011 in peru, we successfully  negotiated with the union that was recently formed by our  seasonal workers. We enjoy good labor relations with all   our employee representatives.  HR3  our ability to identify and remediate issues, and to act  in compliance with our policy globally, is dependent upon the  understanding and commitment of every employee to uphold  our values and commitments. to enhance this understanding,  we have provided human rights computer-based employee  training modules at 18 month intervals. these training modules  review sections of the policy in a story format, and conclude  with a quiz. every full-time employee is required to take this  training, and pass the quiz with a score of 100 percent. in 2011,  we launched our third training module since the policy was  adopted, and 98.8 percent of employees completed it. this  represented 9,562 hours of training.

HR4  UN6  employees can voice a concern confidentially or  anonymously with the Monsanto business Conduct office and  can use a variety of methods to do so, including telephonically,  through a toll-free dedicated telephone system, company email,  or the internet. in 2011, two discrimination allegations were  filed with business Conduct. the allegations were investigated  by an independent review team chaired by our business  Conduct office and resolved.  throughout our seed supply chain, we have adopted several  practices designed to help our business partners understand  and act in accordance with our policy. in our direct contracts  with them, we include contract language regarding human  rights. UN2  by signing the contract, they indicate they have  read and understood the policy and agree to act in compli- ance with applicable labor laws. HR1  in 2011, more than  17,800 contracts included this clause or 96 percent of direct  seed grower contracts. (Many of our growers contract with  Seed Coordinators, who then contract directly with us.)   HR2  a second practice we use with our growers is to assess  their compliance via a 22-question screening assessment  which we call our red Flag assessment. We have a rotating  schedule to assess a portion of our business partner growers  in countries according to the risk level identified for the  country. in 2011, we conducted 37,880 assessments, the  majority of which were in india and africa. the company  process requires immediate action to investigate an   affirmative red Flag finding and remediate as necessary.   See business partner graphs on the following page. our work around the world is spearheaded by our Human  rights Champions network. (See sidebar on the following  page for information on the conference we held this year.)  the Champions have the responsibility to heighten awareness  of human rights issues, and work to resolve them in their  geography. they receive special training to enable them  to identify gaps in auditing and compliance with our policy  and risks of non-compliance, and they work within the  organization to remediate issues as expeditiously as possible.  they also serve as contacts in the regions for anyone with   a question or concern about human rights.

Speakers from outside of Monsanto were also invited to  share their perspectives. Faris natour, Director, Human  rights at business for Social responsibility (bSr), discussed  the Guiding principles for business and Human rights  which were endorsed by the un Human rights Council,  and the implications for businesses as a result of this work.  Commenting on his experience at the conference, Faris  said, at the 2011 Human rights Champions conference i  met passionate leaders from around the world who showed  a sense of ownership and great pride in Monsantos  efforts to address human rights challenges in the supply  chain.

We immediately moved to develop an education   and monitoring program for our Seed Coordinators and farmers.  the education process has many facets which have evolved over  the years. the main tool currently in use is our Business Partner  Guidebook, available in five commonly spoken languages of   the farmers in our production areas in india. our contracts   with growers and Seed Coordinators also contain language   reinforcing Monsantos position that child labor is not an   acceptable practice. We continue to monitor our business partners fields in cotton,   an effort overseen by our Child Care program Steering Committee,  which consists of nGo representatives and other interested  parties. the number of business partners in cottonseed production  has grown dramatically over the years, from approximately   1,000 in 2005, to approximately 21,000 in the 2011 season.   12.0% 10.0% 8.0% 6.0% 4.0% 2.0% 0.0% Monsanto internal Monitoring programs Data 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 Percent of Total laborers Found   That Were children 10.0% 4.9% 0.5% 0.2% 0.2% 0.2% 0.3% Monsanto internal Monitoring programs Data 1.0% 0.8% 0.6% 0.4% 0.2% 0.0% 0.8% 09 0.3% 10 0.1% 11 reduction in Child labor in business partner Cottonseed   production Since 2005 reduction in Child labor in business partner Vegetable Seed  production Since 2009 GRI HR4, 6 UN5 continued Progress in Human rigHts   Policy imPlementation, cont.

Monsantos ana Viana led an effort to help Camaaris manufacturing location find a way to help  these impoverished women. in the past year alone, we added 9,000 business partners.  We are pleased that child labor in our fields has been  reduced to well under one-half of one percent of the labor  force. We believe the dramatic increase in the number of  growers is the reason for the small increase we have seen  in child labor percentage in the 2011 season. our vegetable production consists of far fewer growers than  the cotton business. We have about 2,000 growers in vegeta- bles, many of whom have grown seeds for Monsanto for five   years or more. prior to the inception of our formal monitoring  program in 2009, we began our efforts to advise and   educate farmers about our policy and asked them to comply.   our efforts appear to have been quite successful, as when  monitoring began, we found less than 1 percent child labor.  our production and quality teams, who make frequent field visits  and maintain the labor monitoring responsibility themselves,  continue to emphasize the importance of only employing adult  labor and sending children to school. this emphasis, along with  other practices unique to our vegetable seed production model,  have helped eliminate child labor in our business partners vege- table fields. these practices include offering a second crop in a  season to growers who use only adult labor and partnering with  nGos in the vegetable seed production areas to enhance the  school experience for children, in order to increase interest on  the part of both children and their parents in childrens education. Statistics from the brazilian Ministry of Health state that  women over 40 are more likely to develop breast and cervical  cancer, ana Viana, Monsanto brazils Community affairs  analyst, said. the Womens Health projects objective is to  prevent cancer through educational guidance and clinical  diagnosis for low-income women living in Camaari City, which  has an incidence of disease 10 times higher than [brazils]  national average. a group of Monsanto employees in brazil partnered with brazils  Secretary of Health to set up Womens Health. the program  targets women over the age of 40 who havent had preventative  or related examinations for more than a year. the Secretary  of Health helped the team identify communities of women in  need with no access to the public health system. Since the  program began in 2006, it has provided clinical examinations for  4,000 women and provided H1n1 vaccinations to 200 women.  the most difficult aspect of this project was accessing the  places where these women live because no public transporta- tion reaches those areas, Viana said. it was also difficult  gaining their confidence to educate them about prevention.  in the areas the program reaches, many elderly women have  never seen a gynecologist. after diagnosing existing problems,  the women are guided by the Secretary of Health to the appro- priate treatment in public hospitals. its rewarding to know that Monsanto is making a difference  for those women and their families by improving their quality of  life, Viana said. this is an awesome way for Monsanto to give  back to the community. the team hopes to maintain and expand the program in  the future to cover younger women for early detection of  breast, uterine and cervical cancer, and sexually transmitted  diseases. they also hope the results of Womens Health will  encourage brazils Secretary of Health to develop additional  projects to increase disease prevention.

Senior leaders act as liaisons   for each of these groups to provide leadership support   as needed, as well as executive team members who   serve as sponsors.   At our most senior level, we formed our diversity council  in 2007 to advance the Monsanto culture around inclusion  and develop diversity champions at every level of the  organization. this Council has been an effective vehicle to  identify opportunities and areas for improvement throughout  our global business units. the Council is led by our Strategy / operations lead, linking the importance of diversity to driving  innovation and delivering strategic business results.   We must recruit, develop and retain employees to remain  on the cutting edge of agricultural innovation. executive and  management compensation is tied directly to our diversity  efforts, and we are building our succession slates with diverse  internal and external talent pipelines. We continue to learn    at Monsanto, diversity is critical to the success of our global business.   to meet the needs of global farmers, we must have a global point of view.   a farmers needs in South africa, for example, are very different from   a farmers needs in brazil. they face very different agricultural challenges. that is why we have employees around the globe who live and work in or near  the communities where our customers farm. in fact, we have more than 500  global locations for our more than 20,000 employees. our people are the link  between the workplace and the marketplaceand we need a workplace  representative of all cultures to create innovative solutions for our customers.  and make improvements so we can attract and retain the  best talent and provide an inclusive work environment limited  only by our employees aspirations.

ENCOmPASS is a resource group for the companys gay,  lesbian, bisexual and transgendered (Glbt) employees. the  network was begun by ashley alvarado, an administrative  assistant. i started working here about three years ago and  realized that there wasnt [a network of this kind] so i wrote a  proposal, said alvarado. as soon as i stepped forward, all of  the resources were there, said alvarado. its been great.  alvarado sees a specific need for the Glbt network. its a very  competitive market and because we live in Missouri, its not the  most inclusive place for Glbt employees, she said. a lot of  positions that we hire for are very specialized and we have to  make ourselves as desirable as possible, and the networking  groups do that. She also believes the networks are helpful for providing feed- back to policymakers and decision makers.

For romero, one of the most important focus areas in the  Monsanto latin network is recruiting—and not just limited to  Hispanics and latin americans. We focus on seeking the best  talent to bring to Monsanto, she said. in our job searches, we  come across a lot of great talent. our focus is to bring more  Hispanics to the company, but we bring anyone who has the best  talent. in the past four years, weve recruited one Hispanic, one  african-american, one asian and one Caucasian. mONSANtO St. LOUIS wOmENS NEtwORk focuses on  leadership development, mentoring and building relationships  within the organization. For women who dont have leadership   experience, we allow them to take leadership roles within  the network to help build those skills, said Jennifer listello,  president of the Monsanto St. louis Womens network. We hold events to help women with career development and  often have successful women from both within and outside of  the organization come in to talk about their careers. listello  added, the women within the network are truly looking for  good examples of women succeeding to help them navigate  their careers at Monsanto. tHE FAmILy NEtwORk according to Working Mother Magazine,  among employees who are parents, those who are highly  engaged with their families receive stronger performance  reviews than those who always put work first. the Family  network enhances our efforts to create an environment where  contributions at work are balanced with the employees fulfill- ment of personal and family responsibilities, said Steve Mizell,  executive Vice president, Human resources.  vANGUARd (vEtERANS ANd NAtIONAL GUARdSmEN) in order to assist with attracting, developing and retaining  talented employees who may have a military background, the  VanGuarD network was formed.

Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic act specifically  states what is required on food product labels to communicate  ingredients, nutritional content and scientifically documented  health or safety concerns, such as allergens. the FDa has  concluded there is no need to mandate labeling of the  process—such as agricultural biotechnology—by which a food  was developed or produced, because accurate information  regarding the food is already required. Consistent with this  approach, if a production or processing difference results  in a change in the food itself, or alters the food in some way,  then that difference will be reflected on the label. in this  way, a consumer who reads a food label knows it conveys  clear and material information about the food in a consistent  manner. production techniques, such as organic agriculture  and agricultural biotechnology, can be included on the label  if a manufacturer elects to do so, but are not required under  current u.S. law. under these rules, foods containing biotech ingredients are  subject to the same label requirements as other foods and will  contain accurate information about their ingredients, nutritional  content and any required health and safety information such  as allergen content. the safety and benefits of GM products on  the market are well-established. the safety has been confirmed  Food LabeLing: diversity oF thought  Crops produced through the use of biotechnology are considered genetically  modified (GM), and labeling these products has been a subject of debate   for some time. While the u.S.

When you think about  food products purchased by consumers, seed suppliers are  a long way back in the food value chain, and there are many  other views that should be considered. there certainly are  a wide range of views on this topic from a diverse group of  stakeholders. the actual food product being labeled belongs to  someone—they should have a voice. Monsanto does not have  any food products on the shelf. in fact, we dont even grow any  of the crops. Farmers do, and in growing our foods they should  also have a voice. they are consumers and often proudly eat  some of what they grow.  as i absorb and think about all of this, i believe the most  important outcome is that both farmers and consumers  have informed choices, without the effect of unhelpful  fear mongering. the current system of voluntary labeling  accomplishes these objectives, and everyone can find what  they want. the competitive marketplace is alive and well.   if more and more consumers truly want organic and other  non-GM products, we will have more food companies offering  more products to serve those needs. as i walk down my local  grocery store aisle in St. louis, Missouri, i see many of these  offerings, and this information is prominently displayed and  marketed to consumers. as a seed company, we sell or license  many non-GM seeds so farmers have a choice, too. For consumers to whom this label information is not as  important, they benefit from farmers using technology that can  make food more plentiful. in todays approach, both consumers  and farmers get their choices, and neither are scared by  something with no basis in fact. our conclusion is that the  current system of labeling in the u.S. offers the most benefits  to all parties. We proudly take this view along with many farmer  organizations, food companies and nGos. We recognize this is  not an issue everyone will agree upon,  and respect the views of those who  come to a different conclusion. jerry Steiner EVP Sustainability & Corporate Affairs by national food safety agencies in scores of countries, as   well as international public health institutions like the World  Health organization. Hundreds of millions of meals containing  food from GM crops have been consumed over the past 15  years, and there has not been a single substantiated instance  of illness or harm associated with these products. there are, however, preferences consumers may have about  products that are not based on scientifically documented  nutritional differences or health or safety concerns. Food  manufacturers voluntary labeling practices can address  those preferences and provide consumers the opportunity to  make those choices. Food manufacturers who believe their  customers want particular information can label their products  with specific production information as long as it is truthful and  not misleading. Monsantos eVp for Sustainability   and Corporate affairs Weighs in GRI PR3   the subject of labeling brings up many strongly held  views. i have personally received a lot of advice from many  different stakeholders as to what stand Monsanto should take  on requiring labels on foods using GM crops. these are crops  that have been designed to protect themselves from insects or  to tolerate certain herbicides that enable better weed control,  requiring less tillage and thereby saving diesel fuel and topsoil.  in recent years, it also included several different technologies  to improve the healthfulness of oils from soybeans. Some advise that it would help build consumer confidence in  GM crops if we showed confidence and pride in our innovation  and make it visible to the consumer. i believe this has merit, as  we are proud of the contributions our products make. others  have said that it would be impossible for consumers to see a  mandatory label as anything but a warning because they are  conditioned to conclude the reason to require this information  is to inform consumers of a hazard. (even though the safety  record of 15 years is clear evidence there is nothing to warn  them about.) this concern is exacerbated by the relentless  aggressive scare tactics of some of the authors of labeling  initiatives, who want GM labeling to be a warning. this advice   is also compelling.

Food labels  should empower me to make good decisions, not be a source of  confusion while i am shopping. at times, i seek products with special characteristics such as low  in fat or sodium, with added vitamins or a good source of whole  grains. i appreciate it when this information is clearly and promi- nently presented on the label. if i can readily understand what  the claims mean, i will have an opportunity to make an informed  choice based on my preferences and budget. Walking down the grocery aisle, it is easy to see that in addition  to ingredient and nutrition information, many food labels also  include information about production practices (e.g., cage-free  eggs, certified organic lettuce and sustainably raised seafood).   i am also noticing more and more products labeled as natural  or made with all-natural ingredients. Clearly there are many  things consumers may want to know about their food, and food  companies are working hard to determine what product charac- teristics and claims drive consumer demand.  Some foods are labeled as GM-Free. as a scientist and  Monsanto employee, i know that crops produced through  GRI PR3 biotechnology [also called Genetically engineered (Ge) or  Genetically Modified organism (GMo)] are as safe as conven- tionally bred crops and provide benefits to the environment,   but i respect food companies rights to voluntarily label   products as GM-Free and customers rights to buy them. i understand that some countries require food with ingredients  derived through biotechnology to be specially labeled. in the  u.S., such labeling is not required because the FDa has deter- mined that there is no safety or nutritional difference between  biotech and conventional crops, and it is FDa policy to require  labeling based on the characteristics of the food, not how it was  developed and produced. the national organic program, which  regulates food sold as organic in the u.S., does not allow biotech  to be used by producers of organic crops, so consumers wishing  to avoid biotech crops can choose foods that are certified organic. Some groups are seeking to have the FDa and/or individual  states require food companies to specially label foods containing  biotech ingredients. i dont think such labeling should be  required by the government and i worry that, if it is required,   it will mislead consumers regarding the safety of the products.  in my opinion, the governments mandatory label should be  reserved to convey safety and nutritional differences and  responding to other consumer preferences should be left   to voluntary marketing labeling by the food companies. i understand the power of food labels and will continue to seek  out food with clear and accurate labels that help me make good  choices about the quality and nutritional value of the food i feed  my family.

With a grant from the Monsanto Fund in the amount of  uS$48,600, the Kanengo consortium acquired a fire engine  as a first step toward establishing this new fire station. the  new fire engine is now in the hands of the lilongwe City  Council which oversees its day-to-day running, staffing and  maintenance.

MONSANTO FUND HIGHLIGHTS, cont.  professional assistance for  Development action, india With the help of the Monsanto Fund, a five year project is  underway to improve the incomes of 3,000 poor families  in Kalahandi district, through integrated natural resource  Development (inrD), improved farming systems and better  market linkages.  the program, which began in october 2011, identified women  from target families and organized them into Self Help Groups.  these women learn sustainable agriculture practices— maximizing return without depleting resources—through  integrated land and water resource development education,  which propagates the benefits of rainwater harvesting, land  conservation and the judicious use of resources through modern  cropping practices using organic inputs. these demonstrations  helped mobilize support from government bodies, banks and  other financial institutions to sustainably replicate these farming  systems in neighboring villages. it is expected that income from the land under cultivation using  inrD will reduce encroachment on nearby forest land and  encourage the local population to preserve that forest land. Within the first quarter alone, twelve Self Help Groups were  established, and 150 families have been educated on the impor- tance of inrD to increase their incomes and how to fulfill their  economic aspirations through concept seeding sessions. three  irrigation schemes, under an integrated action plan, have been  set up, and flow irrigation schemes have been installed to help  more than 50 families enhance their agricultural productivity as  well as their household food consumption.

Monsanto is one of  only 79 companies so recognized. the Chemical industry Council of Malaysia recognized the pasir  Gudang, Malaysia, manufacturing plant for outstanding perfor- mance with the responsible Care Gold and platinum awards  for employee safety, health and process safety.  Commitment to Safety   of our neighbors in addition to the safety of our employees, families, and con- tractors, we value the safety of our neighbors in the communi- ties where we operate. We recognize the need to have strong  process safety management systems in place and continuously  improve those systems. a process Safety leadership team and a management review  system monitors process safety systems across our chemical  operations. a process Safety technical team made up of key  technical contacts from each of our chemical manufacturing  sites meets regularly to share process safety information and  identify and promote good practices. Monsanto has adopted  the safety metrics recommended by the Center for Chemical  process Safety which track the number and severity of releases  of hazardous chemicals. in addition, we track process safety  metrics for action tracking follow-up, mechanical integrity,  management of change and process safety training. in an effort to better understand and continuously improve  employees and contractors understanding of process  safety, we periodically employ a consulting firm to use a  process safety cultural survey tool across all of our chemical  manufacturing sites. the survey is given to all employees and  contractors in english, Spanish, portuguese, bahasa indone- sian, bahasa Malay, Flemish, and Hindi languages. the survey  enables us to compare ourselves to internal and external  benchmarks. the survey results provide us with an opportunity    BUSInESS PROFIlE  3   STAkEHOldER EngAgEmEnT  11  TEcHnOlOgy And BUSInESS gOVERnAncE 25  cOmmITmEnT TO SUSTAInABlE AgRIcUlTURE 38   PROdUcIng mORE 40   cOnSERVIng mORE  47   ImPROvING LIvES 62   gRI IndEx 89 0.63 internal Monsanto Global incident reporting System Data 1.20 1.00 0.80 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.00 employee total recordable rate  0.80 0.63 0.71 0.66 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 1.05  83 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report to identify areas for improvement in clarity of goals, responsi- bilities, procedures, equipment, process safety reporting, safety  values, worker empowerment and process safety training.   all of the sites participating in the survey have analyzed their  results and put in place action plans for areas of improvement. off the Job Safety Monsanto continues to be a leader with the outreach of   our Global-off-the-Job Safety (otJS) program. Monsanto  employees delivered awareness training and critical   safety supplies related to vehicle safety, emergency   preparedness, first aid and illness/injury prevention,   to name a few. the company collectively touched 350,000 employees,   family members, members of the communities where we live  and work, and customers through the numerous outreach  activities across the world in Fy2011. in recognition of the  Monsanto employees who promote safety in the communities  where we live and work, the actively Caring award (aCa) was  developed to recognize those employees who used life-saving  skills in emergency situations to save others lives. the S.a.F.e. Community award (Safety awareness for excel- lence — Community) was developed to recognize actions our  employees have taken which positively impact their local com- munities and can be validated by a third party (such as a fire  department, hospital, police department or school).  in total, we proudly recognized nine heroes with the aCa life  Saver award and two teams with the S.a.F.e. Community  award in Fy2011.  Global Vehicle Safety Monsanto drivers traveled 170 million miles and achieved   a historic low rate of collisions per million miles (cpmm)   of 3.08 in Fy2011. (See chart at right.) the Monsanto vehicle policy is expanding globally to meet  our diverse business needs. For example, newer and safer  technologies are considered when replacing vehicles in order  to increase the safety of all drivers and passengers while  driving on public roads or farms under varying conditions;  drivers are required to participate in a commentary/peer   reviewed driving process to help them improve their  driving skills under actual driving conditions; seatbelt use is  mandated by all vehicle occupants in company vehicles or  while driving on company business and the use of handheld  devices is prohibited while driving.  Monsanto sites continue to conduct semi-annual unannounced  seat belt checks of employees entering the work site — the  Click Heard around the World campaigns. Globally, 94 percent  of our employees were observed wearing their seat belts and  97 percent of our employees who commute to work using a  motorcycle were observed wearing helmets. in addition, 165  sites were recognized around the world for attaining 100 per- cent compliance in both categories and were presented with  the 100 percent Compliance plaque.

While attention to road safety by most companies stops   where their direct influence ends, Monsanto is among a select  number of enterprises that understand driving is likely an  employees riskiest daily activity. Monsanto views road safety  as an aspect of employee well-being, community outreach and  global sustainability.  Monsantos recognition of road safety as a global imperative  is supported by predictions made by the united nations. From  a worldwide perspective and left unchecked, traffic-related  crashes, injuries and fatalities will result in significant social  and economic costs, especially among low and middle income  countries. annual global traffic-related fatalities are forecast to  grow from 1.3 million in 2008 to almost 2 million by 2020. this  increase will be accompanied by up to 100 million severe injuries  and consume up to 4% of a low income nations Gnp in 2020. Monsanto has put into practice its commitment to road safety  by producing safe driving campaigns for all Monsanto employ- ees, resourcing off-the-job safety, supporting community novice  driver training programs and participating in road safety confer- ences. it also took an important step in 2004 when it became a  member of the board of directors of the network of employers  for traffic Safety (netS). this global nGo is a private-public  partnership, employer-led, and dedicated to road safety.  in its role as a member of netS board of directors, Monsanto  saw the need to provide employers with a platform for discuss- ing road safety issues and sharing best practices. to this end,  in 2007, Monsanto broadened netS capabilities by initiating  and providing start-up funding for an annual, comprehensive  and global fleet safety benchmark program and benchmark  conference. this has proven to be a successful strategic initia- tive. Since 2007, netS benchmark program has more than  doubled in size and in 2011 collected and analyzed data from  almost 500,000 vehicles driving more than ten billion miles   in 128 countries. the benchmark program also yields best   practices, which are shared among netS members.  Monsantos road safety metrics make it a leader among the  benchmarking companies. the 2010 netS member crash rate  average was 8.08 per million miles. Compared to this 2010  benchmark average, Monsantos rate of 3.79 resulted in 725  fewer crashes, thus reducing the risk of injury and death to  Monsantos business drivers and providing cost savings of at  least uS$11 million. through its association with netS and the success enjoyed  by the benchmark program, Monsanto has become involved  in two important road safety projects. Monsanto and other  netS members will work with the u.S. national Highway traffic  Safety administration to develop an employer-led model for  increasing seat belt use in the uSa. in addition, Monsanto will  assist the inter-american Development bank (iDb) in a project  to improve the safety standards of new cars manufactured in  latin america and the Caribbean.  the iDb project results from netS participation in the Decade  of action for road Safety 2011–2020. this global initiative is  under the auspices of the World Health organization and was  formed to slow the growing losses from road crashes, injuries,  and fatalities. netS is a member of the steering committee  leading this global initiative. the Decade of action for road  Safety 2011-2020 provides the framework for Monsanto and  other companies to model corporate road safety and to advo- cate for safer drivers and vehicles, improved roadway infra- structure and capacity, as well as enhanced post-crash care.    monsanto has been a sponsor of the Troy, missouri, FFA. In these videos,  FFA members learn about seatbelt safety, the importance of seatbelts in  rollover accidents, and the dangers of texting and driving.
