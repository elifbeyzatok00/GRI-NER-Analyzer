During the year 2011 the evaluation of work-related stress was included in the Risk Assessment  Document. This control procedure was designed to evaluate the degree of stress related to the  various work tasks for each individual employee. What emerged was a more than satisfactory result.  About the transparency of operational practices,   IME  makes explicit reference to the Quality  Manual and related written procedures, subject to certification of the Quality Management System  according to ISO 9000 since 1997 and their subsequent maintenance and continuous adaptation to  ISO 9000-2008 to testify and provide how  the suppliers are selected according to objective  assurance of their work, ensuring compliance with current regulations on certification of supplies.

Principle 5  Businesses should support the effective abolition of child labour    Commitment  IME operates in full compliance with the regulations and where it use  services performed outside  its plant always places the best care and attention in choosing the suppliers, both italian and foreign,  by evaluating during the screening tests visit every aspect that might also indirectly make it  complicit in violations against minors.    Systems and operations  It categorically excludes all forms of exploitation of child labour at its plants. The average age of  staff at the end of June 2012 is reported to be 47 years. On  130 people reported the same day:3 of  them appear to have an age between 22 and 30.  20 are aged between   31 and 40 years.  56 are aged between 41 and 50 years.  50 are aged between 51 and 60 years.  1 is older.

There are absolutely not  distinctions and discrimination referred to sex or other personal     characteristics "sensitive" such as race or ethnicity, religious affiliation, political orientation, the  individual's health status.

Among the 84 men, 1 was employed from countries outside the European Union and this is the  testimony of the company's elimination of all forms of discrimination and the contribution to  integration.

The company  also uses in appropriate roles and tasks for them absolutely no harmful or dangerous as some  disabled workers (3 men and 1 woman at 30 June 2012) perfectly integrated in the professional  environment.

Environment          Principle 7  Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.    Commitment  The value of the environment understood as everything that surrounds us, not only as a natural  ecosystem over time has become one of the points of attention by the IME. In this context, the  departments responsible for design, production, logistics and quality pay particular attention to  environmental issues, taking care to consider the impacts that any new activities can be undertaken  on the same.     Systems and operations   IME (even before the birth of the National Packaging Consortium named Conai) performed  separate collection of waste typical of its production or product type; was so easy to join later,  regardless of the fact that this is not a legal requirement, in the belief that separate collection and  subsequent recovery and the related controlled through the proper recycling contribute to the  reduction of environmental pollution and waste materials. Accession to the consortium as well as  involve the active participation in a policy of reducing waste also has an economic component  given by the contribution that the company regularly pays the consortium related to the amount and  type of material "packaging" used. The volumes of tons of waste sent to recovery sees a sharp  decline in CD "Mixed waste" in favour of an increase of type "packaging paper and cardboard."  This testifies to the care taken prior to recycling, which allows recovery of waste with cost savings  of differentiation for the entire community. IME, already last year provided for the installation of a  new plant certificate to three passes with condensation. Following this he obtained the certificate for  another energy major portion of its headquarters, bringing its membership class in the scale of  greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere at 11.05 Kg/m3a in a range from 0 at 100, then in the  middle of "green zones". IME two years ago started a renewal and replacement at its production site  in all frames (about 500 MQ) by installing new and modern with a very low transmittance value     (2W/MqK) helping to improve the energy efficiency of buildings , resulting in less emissions into  the air and simultaneously increasing the comfort climate of office space, obtaining at the time, a  result of annual savings of primary energy sources of about 5.5 kWh / MC - 115,000 kWH These  initiatives are also helping to improve the parameters of energy performance certificates for  buildings of the company's production site, thereby demonstrating the commitment of the IME to  stay the course.

This policy gradually reduces the use of traditional tools and media in  favour of the most technologically advanced and very low environmental impact systems. In  purchasing decisions about car fleet IME has always   preferred the better class pollution over  time by buying the most technologically advanced vehicles and adapted to current environmental  regulations. The regular maintenance done directly by the workshops of the manufacturers, ensures  reliability and efficiency in the environment. Over the years IME has continued a careful inventory  of all materials used in the production process with the aim to find, where  required or desired,  components or substances less harmful alternatives. It also dedicated a portion of 1, 5% of its  annual turnover to the replacement / maintenance of production equipment. IME has also  introduced a new document management system that allows all users to consult the relevant  corporate documentation in a fast and safe way and,  most of all without printing on paper.                Fight against corruption            Principle 10  Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms including extortion and bribery    Commitment  IME has been operating for 66 years in full and complete compliance with very strict codes of  ethics and behavior that even if not written in time have become personal property of employees  because  the company believes that no form of corruption, bribery, extortion  should interferes with  or proliferate within the corporate structure.

The commitment to pursue the above mentioned principles is so well attested by the operational  transparency and the wealth of information provided during the preparation of annual accounts and  the half yearly reporting of the Board of Directors. The company activity is subject to regular  meetings where verbalization is properly reported and signed on Company records. Further  evidence of compliance with these principles is the fact that IME was accredited as a provider for  organizations, institutions and companies such as Enel SpA, the State Railways, the Military Italian  Navy. In such contexts, the selection of the supplier and its suitability for a procedure must pass  rigorous scrutiny in terms of anti-mafia legislation and transparency in procurement. IME  has also  obtained certification conferred with the best rating from Dun & Bradstreet in 2011.      Corsico, July 8, 2012      Istrumenti Misure Elettriche S.p.a.
