CSR REPORT 2012  52 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012Responsible Care Activity 53 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012 Governance Economic Activities Responsible Care Activities Social Activities GRI4.11PR1PR3 Acceleration of the Enhancement of Chemicals  Management around the World     In 2002, the World Summit on Sustainable Development  (WSSD) was held in Johannesburg, the Republic of South Afri- ca. At this conference, the so-called 2020 target was proposed  to ensure that chemicals are used and produced in ways that  lead to the minimization of significant adverse effects on hu- man health and the environment.     The International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA)  formulated the Global Product Strategy (GPS) to attain the  2020 target and to enhance product stewardship activity  (initiative to ensure that chemicals available in the market are  safely handled and used throughout their life cycles), which is  a core activity for Responsible Care toward further enhancing  chemicals management.     In Japan, the Japan Chemical Industry Association launched  the Japan Initiative of Product Stewardship (JIPS) to conduct  specific activities to foster the GPS. The Japanese chemical  industry is voluntarily implementing the JIPS based on the as- sessment and management of risks posed by chemicals and  in consideration of the entire supply chain. Sumitomo Chemicals Activities     In response to international trends toward the enhance- ment of chemicals management, Sumitomo Chemical has  promised to conduct appropriate risk assessments for all its  products manufactured or sold in annual amounts of one ton  or more by fiscal 2020 in its Eco-First commitments.     In our risk assessments, we will assess the impact of chemi- cal substances on human health and the environment by con- sidering both the hazard and the exposure (handling amount  and usage of chemicals) together throughout the life cycle of  the substances assessed. The assessment results will be uti- lized for appropriate risk management (risk reduction and risk  measures) in the handling and use stages of the substances  assessed. Moreover, we will document the results in the form  of summaries on the safe handling of chemicals (GPS/JIPS  Safety Summaries) and disclose them widely to the public via  the ICCA website. Effective Use of SuCCESS     In order to collect and manage chemical safety information  to formulate appropriate responses to chemical regulations  that are becoming more strict each year, and ensure chemi- cal safety based on risk assessments amid increased interna- tional awareness of the need for appropriate management of  chemicals, we have developed and are effectively using the  Sumitomo Chemical Comprehensive Environmental, Health &  Safety Management System (SuCCESS). Environmental Health Science Laboratory  Playing a Central Role in Safety Research     The Environmental Health Science Laboratory of Sumitomo  Chemical assesses the impact of the substances handled and  products manufactured by the Company on human health  and the environment. The laboratory makes assessments in  diverse fields ranging from genetics to environmental and  ecological science, using the latest scientific knowledge and  advanced technologies. Careful Consideration for Animal Experiments     In the process of developing useful chemical substances, a  large variety of safety and efficacy assessments are required.  These assessments on human, animals and the environment  cannot be completed without conducting experiments using  laboratory animals. Sumitomo Chemical advocates humane  treatment of laboratory animals and applies the 3Rs of animal  use and animal welfare: replacement, reduction, and refine- ment to conduct animal experiments appropriately with due  consideration for animal welfare.

In the past, the  SDSs*1 for these purchased materials were obtained separately  via the research, business and procurement teams and not all  SDSs managed by the teams were the latest versions. Now,  however, the SDSs can be centrally managed through the use  of SuCCESS, and all departments, including manufacture, sales  and research teams and the administrative departments, have  access to the latest SDSs and product composition information. *1.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) are documents that describe information neces- sary for the safe handling of chemical products (properties, handling methods,  safety measures, etc.) Providing Customers around  the World with SDSs in a Timely Manner Masayuki Fujita Planning & Coordinating Office,  Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector     In exporting our products to countries overseas, we are re- quired to attach SDSs to them and ensure that the sheets are  written in the language of the country to which the products  are exported. In the past, we commissioned necessary transla- tion work to translation companies, but now thanks to the mul- tilingual function provided by SuCCESS, we can create SDSs in  the language of our choice*2 and submit the sheets to custom- ers in a speedy manner. *2 .  We can create SDSs in 32 languages.

Recent research methodologies have made it possible  to obtain data concerning the rate of metabolism and speed of  transport without the need to conduct animal tests. Specifically,  technologies are now being put into practical use to conduct in  vivo metabolic tests on chemical substances using an artificially  synthesized enzyme (cytochrome P450) along with transport pro- teins. The data obtained can be applied to a simulation model that  is able to reproduce the distribution of a substance in the blood  and organs along with metabolism and excretion processes, to- ward the accurate prediction of  in vivo kinetics.     Sumitomo Chemical has been using these technologies for the  precise assessment of chemical safety ahead of other companies  (and received an incentive award from the Pesticide Science Soci- ety of Japan for research into the technologies). We will continue  our research to increase the precision of in vivo kinetic analysis  toward a more accurate assessment of chemical safety.

This is a principle of the Sumitomo familys business philoso- phy, which forms the core of Sumitomo Chemicals corporate  values.     Sumitomo Chemicals history dates back to 1913, when the  House of Sumitomo established a fertilizer manufacturing  plant to solve an environmental problem and help increase  agricultural productivity by producing fertilizers using harm- ful emissions from copper smelting operations. Ever since its  inception, the Company has upheld the conviction that the  essence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is to contribute  to the sustainable development of society through business  activities. Supporting the Recovery of Areas Affected by  the Great East Japan Earthquake     The Great East Japan Earthquake, which occurred on March  11, 2011, caused massive damage to wide areas in northeast- ern Japan, mainly the Pacific coast of the Tohoku and Kanto  regions. The Sumitomo Chemical Group launched its relief ef- forts immediately after the disaster and has since been imple- menting a variety of measures to support the recovery of the  affected areas.     In addition to emergency assistance, such as financial con- tributions and donation of blankets and basic necessities, we  donated our insecticides, SUMITHION and SUMILARV  to  some affected areas suffering from an infestation of flies and  mosquitoes after the disaster. We also sent employee-volun- teers to set up our high-performance insecticidal nets in gar- bage dumps and other places in temporary shelter areas. And  before winter, we distributed thermal underwear made from  our products to the people living in shelters. We also often or- ganize bazaars to sell local specialties from the affected areas,  and our company cafeterias serve special meals and donate to  the affected areas part of the proceeds from the meals.     We are going to continue to do our best to support Japans  recovery from the disaster, in cooperation with government  agencies and NPOs, by capitalizing on our business expertise  and management resources. Responsible Care     A central pillar of Sumitomo Chemicals CSR activities is  Responsible Care (RC), a commitment to ensure safety, pro- tect the environment and human health and maintain high  product quality through the life cycles of our products, from  development to manufacturing, transportation and sale to  use and disposal, and we have been implementing a range of  initiatives for promoting RC. Message from Chairman and President Contributing to Solving Major Problems  Faced by the International Community and  Helping the World Achieve Sustainable Development Hiromasa Yonekura, Chairman Masakazu Tokura, President  3 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012     In the field of chemical safety management, which is one  of the priority issues of RC, we are conducting extensive, ad- vanced chemical safety research, including research on the  genetic, ecological and global environmental levels, making  use of the wealth of our expertise and leading-edge tech- nologies. And to apply the information collected in chemical  safety research to risk analysis and promote risk-based chemi- cal safety management, we are making use of SuCCESS, our  comprehensive chemical management system developed in- house.     In addition, we are tackling environment-, resource- and  energy-related problems by developing innovative Clean  Products and Green Processes that help reduce the impact  on the environment. In particular, we are committed to de- veloping new processes and products intended for energy  saving and CO2 emissions reduction. We are also conducting  research to improve the manufacturing processes of our ma- jor products with the aim of achieving world-class energy ef- ficiency. Contribution to the International Community     This year is the 20th anniversary of the first United Nations  Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Sum- mit), which was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. To cel- ebrate this occasion, the United Nations convened the Confer- ence on Sustainable Development (Rio + 20) in Rio de Janeiro  this June. For this conference, the International Council of  Chemical Associations (ICCA), which comprises major chemi- cal industry associations from countries around the world,  published a report on the chemical industrys efforts to over- come problems hindering global sustainable development,  such as projects for the eradication of poverty and control of  infectious diseases. As a leading Japanese chemical company,  Sumitomo Chemical participated in the initiative, and our  insecticidal mosquito net, Olyset Net, was introduced in the  report. Control of Malaria by the Olyset Net     Malaria, an infectious disease transmitted by Anopheles  mosquitoes, is a major obstacle to Africas fight against pov- erty and the continents progress in economic development.  In the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the United Na- tions defines malaria control as one of the most pressing chal- lenges facing human society. Sumitomo Chemical has been  supplying its Olyset Net—an insecticidal mosquito net that  Sumitomo Chemical developed by using its proprietary tech- nologies—to Africa and many other parts of the world, mak- ing significant contributions to malaria control. In addition, by  manufacturing these nets in Africa, we are creating local jobs  and contributing to the development of the local economy.     Moreover, we have been supporting education in Africa  by donating a portion of the revenues from our Olyset Net  business to help NPOs construct schools and other related  facilities in the region.     The Olyset Net business is an embodiment of our prin- ciple that our business must benefit society, not just our inter- ests, and we are going to continue to support Africa through  this business. Sumitomo Chemicals Forest Project     In Thailand, Sumitomo Chemical is implementing, in coop- eration with an NPO, the Sumitomo Chemicals Forest proj- ect, an initiative to plant mangrove trees with the aim of con- tributing to the conservation of biodiversity and prevention of  global warming. We raise funds for this project by a matching  gift program, in which the Company pledges to provide the  same amount of funds as the donations made by its directors  and employees to the project, and we send to the planting  site in Thailand employee-volunteers, who work with local  residents to plant mangroves. Since the start of this activity in  2008, we have planted a total of approximately 200,000 man- groves in an area extending over 95 hectares. United Nations Global Compact     As economic globalization accelerates, companies in the  private sector are expected to play a greater role in promot- ing the worlds sustainable development. The United Na- tions launched the Global Compact initiative in 2000 to urge  companies to make direct contributions to finding solutions  to global problems. In 2005 Sumitomo Chemical became the  first Japanese chemical company to join Global Compact. We  have also been participating in Global Compact LEAD, the  United Nations new program to put into action the vision  developed in the Global Compact initiative, since its launch in  2011. Contributing to Solving Global Problems and  Promoting Sustainable Development  with the Power of Chemistry     The Sumitomo Chemical Group will continue to conduct  CSR activities globally as a member of the international com- munity in cooperation with a range of stakeholders, including  international organizations, local communities and NPOs. We  will also strive to help solve the pressing problems faced by  the international community, including those related to the  environment, natural resources, energy and food supply, and  contribute to the worlds sustainable development by making  full use of the creative power of chemistry and delivering in- novative technologies and products to market.     We would greatly appreciate your continued support and  cooperation. Hiromasa Yonekura Chairman of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.

Specifically we possess a  Business Philosophy, which outlines the fundamental ethos,  missions, and values of the Company as well as our Corpo- rate Slogan and Statement, which are intended to help instill  pride and commitment among employees. Moreover, we  use the Sumitomo Chemical Charter for Business Conduct as  the basis for the Companys compliance system.      The Sumitomo Spirit is based on the guiding principles set in Monjuin Shiigaki, a document written by Ma- satomo Sumitomo, the founding father of the House of Sumitomo, that urged family members to conduct  business with honesty, prudence and certainty. Sumitomos Business Principles (established in 1891) com- municate the importance of maintaining the trust of business partners and of society, and calls for refraining  from the pursuit of easy gains under the Sumitomo Spirit.     Sumitomo also places importance on harmony between the individual, the nation, and society. Based on  the idea that Sumitomo must seek to benefit not only its own business but also both the nation and society,  Sumitomo Chemical and other Sumitomo Group companies have long been committed to maintaining har- mony between their own interests and those of the public. Sumitomo Chemicals Business Philosophy 1. We commit ourselves to creating new value by building on innovation. 2. We work to contribute to society through our business activities. 3. We develop a vibrant corporate culture and continue to be a company that      society can trust.     The Sumitomo Chemical Group has become diversified in terms of culture and value, as the Group progres- sively globalizes its business. With this diverse profile, it is important for all employees to share the Groups  business philosophy and increase their awareness as members of the Group. To meet this requirement, in  2009, we formulated Sumitomo Chemicals Business Philosophy to outline the Companys fundamental ethos,  missions, and values based on Sumitomos Business Principles. Statement Book To help employees understand the corporate philosophy more easily, we have created and  distributed the copies of the Statement Book. We have also created a DVD version of this book  in Japanese, English, Korean, and simplified and traditional Chinese for use with the Statement  Book. In fiscal 2011, we provided local managers of overseas Group companies with training on  the corporate philosophy using the book and DVD. (See page 73.)  Pledge 1     Sumitomo shall achieve prosperity based on solid foundation by placing prime  importance on integrity and sound management in the conduct of its business. Pledge 2     Sumitomos business interest must always be in harmony with public interest;  Sumitomo shall adapt to good times and bad times but will not pursue immoral  business. Harmony between the individual, the nation, and society Sumitomos Business Principles The Sumitomo Spirit  7 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012 Corporate Slogan Creative Hybrid Chemistry  For a Better Tomorrow     Sumitomo Chemical formulated its Corporate Statement after a project team comprising members from across the company  held lengthy discussions on the important theme of pride and commitment to be constantly shared by employees.

(For com- pliance, see pages 22 and 23.)  Corporate Statement Sumitomo Chemical started business in 1913 as a producer of fertilizers from sulfur dioxide gas emit- ted by copper smelters. This business, which solved the environmental problem of air pollution while  meeting the social demand for more agricultural production, embodied the business philosophy of the  Sumitomo family handed down from the 17th century. Our business must benefit society, not just our interests. Throughout our history of almost a centu- ry, we at Sumitomo Chemical have lived by this credo. We have worked to build better lives by devel- oping various businesses that meet peoples evolving needs. At the same time, we have continuously  delivered technological innovation while paying special attention to product quality, safety, and the  environment. Looking to the future, we will create new value beyond the boundaries of chemistry by combining a  variety of ideas, views, and technologies. We will also continue to take up the challenges facing the  globe, from meeting basic needs, to protecting the environment, to addressing the issues of adequate  supplies of food, energy, and other resources. In this endeavor, each of us at Sumitomo Chemical will work together to enhance our capabilities,  explore new possibilities every day, and overcome the challenges lying ahead with enthusiasm and a  strong sense of mission. Sumitomo Chemical will seek to continue to build trust and bring joy to people across the world  through constant innovation.  8 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012 Toward the Sustainable Development of Society Achievement of Sustainable Chemistry Achieving Sustainable Chemistry  as a Mission Required of a Chemical Company     Sustainable Chemistry represents the concept of continu- ously providing useful products and services in an environ- mentally and socially friendly manner by exploiting the full  potential of chemistry.      The chemical industry has been contributing to creating  fulfillment in peoples lives as well as to industrial and social  development by fostering Sustainable Chemistry through  technological innovation. At present, societies are facing a  range of global issues including energy-, resource-, environ- ment- and food-related problems, which are becoming more  and more serious. The chemical industry is expected to play  an increasingly important role in solving these problems.     Sumitomo Chemical will practice Sustainable Chemistry  built on its CSR-based management to achieve balance  among the three areas of economy, Responsible Care (RC),  and society in all aspects of its business. Society Benefiting users, local  communities, and the world while  abiding by the rules of society Responsible Care (Safety, environment and  product quality) Eliminating accidents and disasters, protecting  the environment by most effectively using  natural resources and energy, producing safe  products, and protecting the health of  customers and employees Economy Maximizing corporate value by  continually providing better  products Products useful  to society Environmentally  friendly and safe  products High-quality  products High-value-added  products Sustainable Chemistry Society  Responsible  Care  Economy CSR Management  9 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012 Enhancement of  base technologies  Creation  of new value Increasing breadth and  depth of core technologies  Integration of  disparate technologies  Fin e  pa rti cle  d is pe rsi on  te ch no lo gie s        Design of  functional organic  chemicals  and polymers High-precision  processing Device design Precise polymerization Analysis of  bio-mechanisms Catalyst design Design of  functional  inorganic  materials Core Technologies and Base Technologies Six Core Technologies Organic synthesis   Inorganic synthesis   Analysis of chemical and physical properties   Toxicological safety assessment     Safety engineering    Material & plant engineering technology     Computer simulation Base Technologies Important  base technologies C h e m i c a l   p r o c e s s   d e s i g n U lt r a m i c r o  a n a l y s i s C on tr ol le d  re le as e                 Omics techniques Toxico-genomics C o nt ro l  of  s u rf a c e  a n d  in te rf a c e      Sumitomo Chemicals Creative Hybrid Chemistry:  Creating New Value through  Integration of Disparate Technologies     In order to practice Sustainable Chemistry, it is necessary  to have scientifically proven technologies, and Sumitomo  Chemical creates such technologies through Creative Hybrid  Chemistry.     Over the course of many years, Sumitomo Chemical has  cultivated a variety of technologies in a diverse range of  fields. Out of this reservoir of expertise and technology, we  have identified the following six areas as our core technolo- gies: catalyst design, high-precision processing, design of  functional organic chemicals and polymers, design of func- tional inorganic materials, device design, and analysis of bio- mechanisms. The Company conducts research and develop- ment based on the Creative Hybrid Chemistry strategy, which  means expanding these six core technologies, enhancing the  base technologies, and integrating disparate technologies  developed inside and outside the Company to create more  value-added products and technologies.     Moreover, with a view to developing innovative tech- nologies and products, we have been fostering industry- government-academia cooperation. Specifically, we are  conducting joint research with public research institutes as  well as with both Japanese and non-Japanese universities,  utilizing the SPring-8 large synchrotron radiation facility, the  Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) and the  Earth Simulator supercomputer system, and participating in  national projects.  Products Developed through Creative Hybrid Chemistry Olyset Net: Insecticidal Mosquito Net That Prevents Malaria Infection     Because the Olyset Net is made from resin-based fibers containing insecticide that is gradu- ally released onto the surface, it retains its insecticidal efficacy for more than five years, even  after repeated washing. Sumitomo Chemical developed this product by integrating resin pro- cessing technology gained through the petrochemical business with insecticide technology  accumulated in the agrochemical business. Creative Hybrid Chemistry  10 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012 GRIEN6EN26 EPL 3 Process for Polarizer    The lamination processes of optical films  used for LCDs, etc. has been dramatically  changed, and compared with the conven- tional method, energy consumption can be  substantially reduced. Moreover the prior  processing is no  longer necessary  for a part of the  film, which leads  to the reduction  of environmental  impact. Hydrochloric Acid Oxidation Process     In this process, hydrochloric acid generat- ed as a byproduct in the manufacture of  chemical products is recycled through con- version to chlorine using a catalyst and oxy- gen. This process uses less energy and is  more environ- ment-friendly  than the con- ventional pro- cess. Caprolactam (Beckmann Rearrangement)  Process     In this process, caprolactam can be manu- factured without producing the byproduct  ammonium sulfate. This process also allows  for a significant reduction in the amount of  raw materials  used as well as a  shortened man- ufacturing pro- cess. Other Green Processes About300,000tons     We need to use energy and resources, which are in limited  supply, to manufacture chemical products. In the production  process, unneeded substances (byproducts) or waste may  also be generated. Sumitomo Chemical has developed Green  Processes to minimize the environmental impact of manu- facturing to the greatest extent possible.      An example of such Green Processes is the new manufac- turing process named the propylene oxide-only process.  Propylene oxide (PO) is mainly used as urethane material,  with approximately 7 million tons or more produced around  the world, and many byproducts are generated during the  conventional manufacturing process. However, with the  new process developed by Sumitomo Chemical, propylene  oxide can be manufactured without byproducts by recycling  cumene. Furthermore, the process boasts an extremely high  product yield due to the use of a catalyst that was indepen- dently developed by the Company. In addition, this process  helps conserve energy and resources by the effective use of  the heat generated by reactions and produces less wastewa- ter. Reduction in CO2 emissions achieved  through the use of the proprietary  propylene oxide-only process  (Relative to the conventional manufacturing process  for the production of 200,000 tons of propylene oxide) Green Processes   Manufacturing processes with lowest possible environmental impact Sumitomo Chemical is implementing measures to reduce the environmental impact  of its products throughout their life cycle, from development through to disposal.

Sumitomo Chemical supplies the materi- als indispensable for the  manufacture of LEDs, in- cluding high purity alu- mina for the sapphire  substrates of LED ele- ments and metalorgan- ics for semiconductor  thin film formation. Agricultural Insecticide Pluto  MC    Pluto MC is an insecticide for use only in the  control of mulberry scale, a serious insect pest,  on tea plants. With only one winter application  to the crop, this product will provide effective  long-term control of mulberry scale. This en- ables tea growers to reduce the frequency of  insecticide spraying. Further- more, this product has little  impact on natural enemies of  this pest, such as parasitic  wasps, making it also suitable  for integrated pest manage- ment (IPM). Other Clean Products Aluminum Titanate DPF    Diesel particulate filters (DPFs) are attached  to diesel engine-powered vehicles to remove  soot. The aluminum titanate DPF developed  by Sumitomo Chemical possesses excellent  features such as  the ability to con- tinuously collect  large volume of  soot.     While reducing the use of resources and energy in the pro- duction processes, we are developing Clean Products that  are safer, more environment-friendly, and of higher quality  with a view to releasing innovative technology-based prod- ucts that contribute to the reduction of environmental im- pact in a range of areas in society.     Polylactic acid-based eco-friendly plastics are an example  of Clean Products. This plastic is a polymer alloy of polypro- pylene and polylactic acid. Because polylactic acid is derived  from plants and is carbon neutral*, total product life cycle  CO2 emissions can be reduced by about 10% compared with  the use of conventional polypropylene.  * Carbon neutral Because plants absorb atmospheric CO2 for photosynthesis, the total life cycle  CO2 emissions from plants are considered to be zero even if CO2 is emitted  when they are disposed of by incineration.

Chemical Group has been supporting the ar- eas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake in a variety of  ways since immediately after the earthquake on March 11, 2011.  One year has already passed since the disaster, and the support  needs of affected areas have been changing along with prog- ress in recovery.     Sumitomo Chemical will continue to support the areas to- ward full recovery by conducting activities in careful consider- ation of their current needs, while implementing anti-disaster  measures to ensure its own business continuity. Support for the Affected Areas Donation of money and relief goods     For the emergency relief of victims and the restoration of af- fected areas, Sumitomo Chemical donated 300 million yen to  the Central Community Chest of Japan. The Company also col- lected donations from executives and employees and donated  them (about nine million yen) to the affected areas (Miyagi,  Iwate, and Fukushima Prefectures) and to employees who had  suffered direct damage due to the earthquake. We also do- nated relief goods such as blankets and daily use goods to the  areas via an NGO (World Vision Japan) and Nippon Keidanren  (Japan Business Federation). Moreover, as the Sumitomo Chem- ical Group, we donated a total of about 500 million yen in cash  and in-kind relief. Serving Tohoku and Kanto support meals in our cafeterias     To support people engaged in agriculture and fisheries in  the Tohoku and Kanto regions who suffered damage from the  earthquake and are still suffering from harmful rumors concern- ing radiation, meals made using ingredients produced in the  Tohoku and Kanto regions are served in our cafeterias. At the  end of March 2012, a portion of sales from these meals, along  with a matched contribution by the Company, was donated to  a scholarship fund established by Iwate Prefecture to support  children who lost their parents due to the tsunami on March 11  until they become full-fledged members of society.     We will continue serving the Tohoku and Kanto support  meals.  Holding fairs to support affected areas     We have also been holding fairs to sell agricultural, marine  and processed food from the Tohoku and Kanto regions. The  Head Office in Tokyo held a total of three such fairs indepen- dently and in cooperation with three neighboring companies  (and with the participation of local residents) in fiscal 2011.  Also, the Head Office in Osaka and Osaka Works held three fairs  independently and in collaboration with Dainippon Sumitomo  Pharma.     We will continue to hold such fairs from fiscal 2012 onwards. Support against insect pests and dispatch of employees as  volunteers     In July 2011, we donated our insecticides (SUMITHION  and  SUMILARV) to areas suffering damage from insect pests such  as from fly infestations, through local governments.     Also, from July to September, we dispatched about 150 em- ployees as volunteers to affected areas, where they equipped  garbage collection points in temporary housing areas with  our highly functional insecticidal nets made using the same  technology and materials as those used in the Olyset Net. To  support recovery of the affected areas, the employees also re- moved debris.     From November to December 2011, we again dispatched  about 90 employees to affected areas, where they distributed  HEATFACT thermal innerwear, which is mainly made from ac- rylonitrile manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical, to temporary  housing residents.   Providing students from affected areas with scholarships     Sumitomo Chemical provides scholarships to students from  affected areas who are slated to enter university in April 2012    to financially support their university endeavors and to prevent  the loss of educational opportunities resulting from the disas- ter. We provided the scholarships through the BEYOND Tomor- row education support project managed by the Global Fund  for Education Assistance. Participating in the Tohoku Cotton Project     Sumitomo Chemical is participating in the Tohoku Cotton  Project as one of the supporting companies. Under this project,  farmers cultivate cotton in paddy fields that were devastated  by the tsunami, and participating companies jointly engage in  spinning, commercializing and marketing the cotton.     The project is designed to support affected areas on a contin- uous basis by facilitating the resumption of agricultural activi- ties and creating local employment through the cultivation of  highly salt-resistant cotton. Participating farmers and spinning/ apparel companies will cooperate together on the cultivation  and harvesting of the cotton through to the marketing of prod- ucts made with the harvested cotton under the Tohoku Cotton  Project brand name.     Sumitomo Chemical will utilize both its products and its long- accumulated chemical industry know-how to make proposals  for the removal of harmful insects and weeds and to obtain  pesticide registration as required for the cultivation of cotton.  In this capacity we will thereby contribute to the project. Measures against Earthquakes and Other Disasters Risk and crisis management     In the event of a large disaster, such as an earthquake, com- panies must ensure the safety of local residents, employees,  Food fair held in the Head Office  in Tokyo in April 2012 to support  disaster-affected areas  Distributing thermal innerwear to  temporary housing residents  Equipping a garbage collection point  with an insecticidal net  15 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012 and other stakeholders. They are also expected to prevent sec- ondary damage and minimize the impact of such disasters on  their business as their corporate responsibilities and also as a  precondition for their survival. Based on this recognition, Sumi- tomo Chemical has set out its basic policies on risk and crisis  management, and has been giving first priority to the safety of  people, the environment, and society. * For the risk management system, see page 21. Confirming the safety of employees and their families     Sumitomo Chemical has long implemented a system to con- firm the safety of employees and their families in the event of a  large-scale disaster. At the time of the Great East Japan Earth- quake, however, it took much time for the Company to identify  the extent of disaster-related damage due to problems with  communication lines and blackouts.     Accordingly, we have decided to employ multiple backup  communication tools, including wire-based, wireless, ground,  and satellite communication methods, to deal with blackouts,  regulated communication, and equipment damage. Enhancement of the disaster management system     In preparation for large earthquakes, we formulated guide- lines for appropriate anti-earthquake measures to be taken at  our sites, and have been making examinations to ensure their  implementation, including those related to the emergency  response system, the system to support information collec- tion and notification, prevention and mitigation of incidents,  rescue and evacuation, and emergency provisions. After the  occurrence of the Great East Japan Earthquake, we revised the  guidelines to more appropriately respond to a wider range of  issues, such as the damage that might be caused by tsunamis,  transportation of relief goods to disaster-affected sites, and im- provement of the system to dispatch employees as relief staff. Business Continuity Plan (BCP)     Sumitomo Chemical has formulated a business continuity  plan (BCP) to ensure the continuance and early recovery of  business in the event of a large-scale disaster. At the same time,  we have diversified materials for procurement to ensure con- tinued production by increasing the number of suppliers to the  Company and adding suitable alternative. We have also secured  alternative transportation routes to customers as a measure to  be implemented to recover from disasters. Anti-seismic measures at the Works and Research Laboratories     At our Works and Research Laboratories that handle hazard- ous substances and high-pressure gas, we are striving to ensure  safe and stable operations and are voluntarily implementing  safety measures that exceed the level required by law.     Specifically, we have made it possible to remotely suspend  operations of our plants in a prompt and safe manner should  an earthquake of a certain size occur, and have implemented  measures to prevent the leakage of harmful substances even in  the event of a large-scale disaster. We are additionally improv- ing the seismic resistance of our tanks and plants in a systemat- ic manner. Moreover, we have established emergency response  rules and manuals as well as fire prevention and extinguishing  equipment, while conducting joint drills with local fire depart- ments and neighboring companies.     Having learned lessons from the Great East Japan Earth- quake, we will enhance our anti-disaster measures by reviewing  risk assumptions, such as those regarding tsunamis, and exam- ine the feasibility of relocation of important emergency power  sources to higher ground, thereby ensuring the safety of our  sites and the stable supply of our products. *For specific measures, see page 50. Economic Activities Building an Aluminum Titanate DPF Plant in Poland     Sumitomo Chemical is building a new plant to produce alu- minum titanate diesel particulate filters (DPFs) within the prem- ises of Sumika Ceramics Poland, which was established in Sep- tember 2011 as one of the Companys subsidiaries. The plant is  scheduled to begin operations in the third quarter of 2013.     Sumitomo Chemicals aluminum titanate DPF outperforms  the current mainstream silicon carbide DPFs in various proper- ties such as soot mass limit*1 and thermal shock resistance*2.  Since the Company successfully developed this proprietary  aluminum titanate DPF in 2009, it has steadily advanced com- mercialization efforts by providing samples to automobile  manufacturers and initiating construction of a mother plant at  the Ehime Works in Japan with an annual production capacity  of 170,000 units. Given that  the Companys DPFs have  already received a high as- sessment in evaluation test- ing by automobile manufac- turers, Sumitomo Chemical  plans to build the new plant  in Poland and embark on full- scale sales in early 2014 in the  European market where de- mand is expected to expand. Enhancing the Polypropylene Compound  Business in China     Sumitomo Chemical newly established its bases for polypro- pylene (PP) compounds in Northern and Northeastern China.     PP compounds are high-performance materials made by  kneading PP with synthetic rubber and inorganic fillers to  improve such parameters as impact resistance and rigidity in  accordance with their use for applications such as automobile  bumpers and interiors. Demand for such materials has been  increasing year after year.

In August 2011, we newly established Jilin Dongcheng  Sumika Polymer Compounds Co., Ltd.  in the suburbs of Chang- chun, Jilin Province and subsequently in September estab- lished Sumika Polymer Compounds Dalian Co., Ltd.  in the city  of Dalian, Liaoning Province. At present, we thus have three PP  compound bases in  China from which we  will further expand  the business across  the country. Starting Construction of Manufacturing Facility for Next-Generation Touchscreen Panels in South Korea     Sumitomo Chemical constructed a new manufacturing facil- ity for next-generation touchscreen panels on the site of Dong- woo Fine-Chem Co., Ltd. the Companys Korean base of opera- tions for electronic materials.     Touchscreen panels constitute a vital component that de- termines display functionality in devices such as smart phones  and tablet computers, which have come into widespread use in  recent years. In addition to existing applications, touchscreens  are expected to find applications in a wide range of devices  such as electronic blackboards, slate devices used in education,  and navigation displays.     The touchscreen panels manufactured by Sumitomo Chemi- cal are next-generation panels used in organic LED (OLED)  display panels, which have won praise for their clarity of image,  convenience in operation and other fine qualities.     Samsung Mobile Display, which will be the major customer  for Sumitomo Chemicals touchscreen panels, is the global  leader in small- and medium-size devices using small-molecule  organic LEDs (SMOLEDs). Working in collaboration with Sam- sung, we aim to establish a high standard of touchscreen panel  manufacturing technologies.     We are also focusing development efforts on polymer organ- ic LED (PLED) materials, which are expected to find applications  in large-screen TVs, and are setting our sights on the future de- velopment of large-screen PLED touchscreen panels as we seek  to expand our business further. Establishing New Equipment for Herbicide  Flumioxazin in the Oita Works     Sumitomo Chemical constructed a new production line at  a facility for its herbicide flumioxazin (branded Sumisoya in  Japan) at its Oita Works to meet the increasing demand for this  product. The expanded production is expected to boost sales  of flumioxazin and derivative products by several tens of bil- lions of yen per year.     Flumioxazin is an herbicide used in the cultivation mainly of  soy beans, cotton, and sugar cane. It demonstrates long-lasting  efficacy in suppressing the growth of weeds after spraying as  well as efficacy in promoting early-stage growth of crops. Flu- mioxazin is also effective against weeds resistant to glyphosate,  an herbicide widely used around the world, and this increases  demand for flumioxazin.     Life sciences is one of Sumitomo Chemicals areas of focus,  and it has worked to enlarge and strengthen its agrochemical  business. The current capacity expansion for flumioxazin is part  of this endeavor. We will continue to contribute to the improve- ment of agricultural crop productivity through our agrochemi- cal business as we continue to expand our business globally. Participating in Light+Building 2012 with  the Worlds First* 60-Color Polymer OLED Lighting     Sumitomo Chemical exhibited its polymer OLED lighting  in Light+Building 2012, one of the worlds largest trade fairs  for lighting and building technology. The exhibition was held  in Frankfurt, Germany in April 2012. We displayed large-scale  lighting panels of about 10 centimeters square each, which  were produced by coating everything except for electrodes  and illuminating in 60 different colors for the first time in the  world.*     We invited the world-renowned Japanese lighting designer  Motoko Ishii as the art director for the polymer OLED lighting,  and the lighting panels were displayed on the theme The Col- ors of Japan—The Colors of Harmony in an innovative attempt  to replicate, by means  of lighting, the elegant  and refined colors of an- cient Japan in a modern  day setting of a Japanese  traditional tearoom by  using the worlds most  advanced polymer OLED  technology. Establishing Sunrise Farm Saijo in Saijo City,  Ehime Prefecture     Sumitomo Chemical established Sunrise Farm Saijo as a joint  venture with Saijo Industry & Information Centre for Support  and JA Saijo, a local agricultural cooperative, in August 2011. In  October of the same year, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and  Panasonic Corp. also made investments in the new company.  This company will play a central role in revitalizing local agri- culture under the agricultural innovation project implemented  in Saijo City. The project is one of 11 Future City Model Projects  implemented across Japan under the leadership of Keidanren.

We will share the expertise and know-how  we have accumulated in the business with people engaged in  agriculture in Saijo, thereby contributing to the development  of local agriculture in the city.     Saijo City, where the project is currently underway, was des- ignated as a special zone for regional revitalization by the Japa- nese government in December 2011. By designating special  zones and providing financial support and preferential taxation  to the zones in a comprehensive manner while lifting related  regulations, the government aims to enhance Japans interna- tional competitiveness and accelerate regional revitalization.  While taking advantage of the special zone scheme, the new  company will conduct demonstrative tests on innovative agri- cultural technologies and make use of the test results to widely  contribute to the recovery  of areas afflicted by the  Great East Japan Earthquake  and to the revitalization of  agriculture both in Japan  and overseas. Responsible Care Activities Making Eco-First Commitments (Updated Version) to the Minister of the Environment      At the follow-up meeting of Eco-First companies held by the  Japanese Ministry of the Environment in March 2012, Sumitomo  Chemical reported on progress in the fulfillment of its Eco-First  Commitments and related achievements to the Minister of the  Environment, and also made its Eco-First Commitments (Up- dated Version) to the Minister (see page 58).     The Eco-First program was launched in April 2008 by the Min- istry of the Environment to urge companies leading industries  in the field of environmental protection to conduct a larger  number of Responsible Care Activities. Under the program,  companies make commitments to the Minister of the Environ- ment for implementing advanced and unique initiatives that  impart excellent ripple effects toward environmental protec- tion.     In November 2008, Sumitomo Chemical became the first  general chemical company to be certified as an Eco-First com- pany, and the aforementioned follow-up meeting was held  as the first of those to be scheduled after the Ministry intro- duced an effective period*1 to the Eco-First Commitments in  September 2010. Sumitomo Chemical makes commitments in  three areas: management of chemical substances, preventing  global warming, and creation of a recycling-based society. In  the Updated Version of the Commitments, we set new numeri- cal targets for the items for which we had attained our initial  targets.     Sumitomo Chemical will continue to lead the worlds chemi- cal industry, conducting Responsible Care activities proactively  and making further contributions to solutions for global envi- ronmental problems. Enhancing Functions and Making More Effective Use of SuCCESS     Sumitomo Chemical developed the Sumitomo Chemical  Comprehensive Environmental, Health & Safety Management  System (SuCCESS) to manage and effectively use chemical  safety information. We are using this system to respond to cus- tomer inquiries concerning substances contained in our prod- ucts, to identify our products that contain regulated substances  promptly and precisely, and prepare GHS*2-compliant SDSs*3.     Information about the compositions of all the products, in- termediates, and materials treated by Sumitomo Chemical, as  well as about the laws and regulations on chemical substances  are stored in the SuCCESS, and in fiscal 2012, we will carry out  examinations for the introduction of the substance volume  tracking (SVT) function to increase the operational efficiency of  the system by automating the manual tabulation work.     In the future, we will proactively foster the use of SuCCESS by  Sumitomo Chemical Group companies to help them manage  chemicals more efficiently, thereby achieving cost reduction  over the entire Group.

As additional support, we also donated 6,000 Olyset Net  insecticidal mosquito nets (see page 30) to the Thai Ministry of  Public Health, in response to  requests from areas facing in- creased risk of infectious diseases  such as mosquitoes that transmit  malaria. This is due to many water  puddles where mosquitoes can  lay more eggs. Proactively Participating in the Projects to  Celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the Normalization  of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China     In 2012, we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the normaliza- tion of Japan-China diplomatic relations. Taking this opportu- nity to further enhance bilateral friendship and relations, Japan,  in a country-wide effort, will hold a range of commemorative  events under the leadership of the Executive Committee for  2012 Friendship Year for Japan-China People-To-People Ex- changes established jointly by the public and private sectors. A  number of exchange projects will be made to celebrate the an- niversary, including student exchanges, grass-roots exchanges,  cultural and sports exchanges, and exchanges through sight- seeing tours.     Sumitomo Chemical is one of the main members of the Ex- ecutive Committee and has established a group to foster these  projects to celebrate the anniversary under its CSR Office.  Participating in the events held in Dalian, China to celebrate  the 40th anniversary     On May 12, 2012 in Dalian, Sumitomo Chemical attended a  Japan-China economic development seminar, an exchange re- ception, and an exhibition featuring photos taken by Japanese  and Chinese photographers.     In the economic development seminar, both Japanese and  Chinese experts made speeches on the prospects of the Japa- nese and Chinese economy and on recycling and environmen- tal businesses, which was followed by exchanges between  Japanese and Chinese participants at an exchange reception.  Also, in the photo exhibition held concurrently with the semi- nar, Chinese representative  displayed photos depicting  the growth history of Japanese  companies operating in Dalian,  while Japanese representative  displayed photos of the Great  East Japan Earthquake. In the  exhibition, photos showing disaster recovery support activities  conducted by Sumitomo Chemical were also introduced. Support to Peking University Law School and Shanghai Jiao  Tong University     Sumitomo Chemical has been providing support to Peking  University Law School, which plays a central role in the revision  and development of Chinas law system, as well as to Shang- hai Jiao Tong University, which is conducting most advanced  research on corporate legal affairs in China, believing that aca- demic development in the legal field will help China achieve  sustainable economic growth.     In fiscal 2011, we made donations to Peking University Law  School and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. To Peking University  Law School, a fund was established to support the faculty to  strengthen currrent teaching system and to Shanghai Jiao Tong  Universty, a donation was made for the publication of a special- ized journal on corporate law. Concluding an internship agreement with Beijing Jiaotong  University and Dalian University of Foreign Languages     Sumitomo Chemical concluded an internship agreement with  Beijing Jiaotong University on April 28, 2012, and with Dalian  University of Foreign Languages on May 11, 2012.     We have been accepting students of leading Chinese univer- sities as interns to provide them with opportunities to deepen  their understanding of Japan and of the activities of Japanese  companies, to broaden their view, and to think about their  future jobs and careers. In fiscal 2011, we accepted a total of 33  students from six Chinese universities as interns, including Pe- king University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Some past  interns later joined our company after knowing more about our  business and operations through the internship program. Receiving a special citation award in recognition  of support of OISCAs planting activities     On October 7, 2011, the Sumitomo Chemical Group, together  with Sumitomo Chemicals Workers Union, received a special  citation award from OISCA at the ceremony celebrating the  50th anniversary of the organizations founding. This was held  in the presence of Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress of  Japan. As one of its activities to conserve biodiversity and pre- vent global warming, Sumitomo Chemical has been supporting  the tree planting activities of OISCA in Thailand and other coun- tries since fiscal 2007 under the Matching Gift program imple- mented jointly by the Company and the Workers Union, and  receiving support from other Group companies (see page 72).  Using part of the collected money, in fiscal 2008, we began the  Sumitomo Chemicals forest activity (mangrove tree plant- ing activity) in Ranong Province located in the southern part of  Thailand, and have been dispatching employees as volunteers  to the planting site.  OISCA granted the  award in recognition  of these efforts.

Moreover, acknowledging the importance of fostering inter- national cooperation to further promote our CSR activities, we  are proactively participating in the UN Global Compact.  20 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012Governance Foundation of CSR-based Management CSR Policy and Promotion System Starting Point of Sumitomo Chemical-CSR     Sumitomo Chemicals business dates back to 1913, when the  Company was founded to manufacture fertilizer using haz- ardous sulfurous acid gas that was generated from smelting  operations at the Besshi Copper Mine in the Shikoku region  of Japan. Sumitomo Chemical thus got its start as a company  committed to overcoming the environmental problems and  contributing to the development of agriculture.      Since then, the Company has been conducting its busi- ness not only to make profits but also to contribute to society  through its business operations. Sumitomo Chemicals Business Philosophy     Sumitomo Chemical established its Basic CSR Policy in No- vember 2004 based on Sumitomos Business Principles and the  Sumitomo Chemical Charter for Business Conduct (see pages 6  and 7). Under this Policy, specific goals are set and CSR activities  are implemented to achieve them. GRI4.8 CSR Promotion System     In January 2010, we established the CSR Department (pres- ent CSR Office) as an organization dedicated to developing  measures to foster CSR activities. Subsequently, in April 2012,  we founded the CSR Promotion Committee to discuss CSR ac- tivities from broad and diverse viewpoints in order to further  foster our CSR activities.     To implement the annual policies decided upon by the CSR  Promotion Committee, the CSR Promotion Meeting, which  comprises members from each business sector, various Works,  and other sites, will be held as needed. All sites set specific  targets based on the annual policies and conduct CSR activi- ties accordingly. The CSR Office serves as the secretariat for the  Committee and the Meeting.     Every year these activities are reported in the CSR Report. Establishment of the CSR Promotion Committee Basic CSR Policy     By continuously creating and providing useful new tech- nologies and products that have never before existed, Sumi- tomo Chemical will build corporate value while contributing  to both the solution of problems facing our environment and  society, and the enrichment of peoples lives.     In order to accomplish this, the Company will work to  achieve a balance of profitable business operations, the  preservation of the environment, safety, health, product qual- ity and social activity. We will also pursue and promote our  CSR activities with consideration for the interests of all our  stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, busi- ness partners, and the local residents of all regions in which  we conduct business. Through our endeavors in these areas,  we hope to play a significant role in building a sustainable  society, while continuing to grow in order to realize our goal  of becoming a truly global chemical company in the 21st cen- tury.      The CSR Promotion Committee is chaired by the executive officer in  charge of CSR and comprises the executive officers in charge of the Com- panys corporate departments and business sectors.     At the CSR Promotion Committee meeting held on April 24, 2012, the  results of activities conducted in fiscal 2011 were reported and the annual  policies for fiscal 2012 were determined. Participants also exchanged opin- ions about CSR activities from various standpoints.     We will continue to foster CSR activities across the company in the rec- ognition of the importance of conducting these activities.

We will con- tinue to implement measures to expedite important decision- making, more clearly define responsibilities in the execution of  our business, enhance and strengthen the compliance system  and internal control, and promote the timely disclosure of infor- mation. Management Structure     Sumitomo Chemical has a board of corporate auditors and  has also introduced an executive officer system to expedite  important decision-making and more clearly define respon- sibilities in the execution of its business. The companys man- agement structure currently consists of nine directors and 32  executive officers (including eight executive officers serving in  a dual capacity as directors) (as of June 22, 2012). The Board of  Directors ensures that important management decisions are ap- propriately made in accordance with laws and regulations, the  Articles of Incorporation, and the regulations concerning the  Board, and also monitors and supervises the performance of  the directors. The executive officers are responsible for ensur- ing that business operations are carried out in accordance with  the Boards strategic management planning. Compensation of  directors is determined according to their respective respon- sibilities in formulating the Companys management policies  and specific measures and in proportion to the business perfor- mance of the Company.     There are five corporate auditors, the majority (three) of  whom are from outside the Company to strengthen the audit- ing function by incorporating outsiders opinions about the  soundness and efficiency of the management of the Company  into its business operations.     Also, to ensure the objectiveness and neutrality of the man- agement system, we have established in-house rules for the  adoption of external experts opinions about specific manage- ment issues, and have founded advisory groups concerning the  nomination and compensation of officers.     In addition, we newly appointed one outside director at the  ordinary shareholders meeting held in June 2012 in order to  strengthen further oversight functions of the Board of Direc- tors and to increase the transparency and objectivity of man- agement. Internal Control     We recognize the continuous development and enhance- ment of our internal control system as a necessary process  in maintaining a sound organization, and believe this system  should be actively utilized for the achievement of business ob- jectives.     Based on the Basic Policy for Enhancement of Internal Control  established by the Board of Directors (revised in March 2012),  we have strengthened the internal control system to conduct  appropriate business operations throughout the Sumitomo  Chemical Group, and have also formed the Internal Control  Committee to inspect and maintain the system in response  to changing circumstances. This committee is organized by  the Internal Control & Audit Department, which proposes and  promotes various measures for improving the internal control  system and monitors their implementation. Internal Auditing     The Internal Control & Audit Department also conducts in- ternal auditing for the followings in the execution of business  duties by executives and employees of the Sumitomo Chemical  Group: (1) effective and efficient operations; (2) reliability of fi- nancial reporting; and (3) design, operation, and effective func- tioning of internal controls concerning compliance with relevant  laws and statutes in all business activities. In addition, the Inter- nal Audit Coordination Board has been established to improve  the effectiveness and efficiency of internal audits throughout  Sumitomo Chemical and all Group companies. Risk Management System     Sumitomo Chemical formulates in-house rules to promptly  detect risks and prevent their materialization, and also to make  appropriate responses in case of risk materialization. The Inter- nal Control Committee decides on the basic policies concerning  the entire Groups risk management for each fiscal year, and the  Risk Crisis Management Committee makes prompt responses in  the event that a significant risk is realized. Information Disclosure System     Sumitomo Chemical is committed to providing its various  stakeholders, including shareholders, business partners, and  local communities, with information in a prompt, accurate, and  fair manner. Our Corporate Communications Office, established  exclusively to engage in investor relations (IR) and public rela- tions (PR) activities, promotes timely and appropriate informa- tion disclosure and dialogue with society.     In addition, we endeavor to build stronger relationships of  trust with society and capital markets by publishing reports  in accordance with the rules stipulated by the securities ex- changes in Japan, including a corporate governance report that  describes the Companys corporate governance philosophy and  system, and a report indicating the status of independent direc- tors/auditors who are unlikely to have conflicts of interest with  general shareholders.     These documents are available on the websites of the Tokyo  Stock Exchange and Osaka Securities Exchange where Sumi- tomo Chemical is listed.

Gaining trust and confidence from society  is essential to achieve sustainable development of business.  With this guiding principle deeply in mind, Sumitomo Chemical  is striving to fulfill its corporate social responsibility by promot- ing a variety of initiatives to secure compliance throughout the  Sumitomo Chemical Group.    For the Sumitomo Chemical Group, compliance means not  simply abiding by the law, but also conforming to social norms  and business ethics. Our business activities continue to expand  and diversify in various geographical regions around the world.  To maintain healthy business conduct in a wide array of coun- tries where laws, social norms and business customs differ, it  is of the utmost importance that each company of the Group,  while sharing common business principles and codes of con- duct, should gain trust from their local communities by con- ducting business so as to meet properly the diverse needs of  society in countries or regions where they operate. Ultimately,  through these concerted endeavors, the Sumitomo Chemical  Group as a whole must win trust from society at large as it con- tinues to expand activities beyond borders.  Think globally, Act locally    From this perspective and based on the notion Think glob- ally, Act locally, Sumitomo Chemical is carrying out compli- ance management which embraces the business conduct of  companies in a consistent manner throughout the Sumitomo  Chemical Group. Constituting the linchpin of such compliance  management is the Compliance Committee of Sumitomo  Chemical, which is composed of members appointed from  among Sumitomo Chemicals executive officers who are not  directly in charge of day-to-day business activities, the purpose  of such Committee structure being to ensure that compliance  management will be promoted from a Group-wide global per- spective and with fair and impartial judgment, not affected by  specific business interests.    The Compliance Committee supervises and provides support  to the Group companies in establishing and operating their  individual compliance systems as well as monitoring the com- pliance status of Sumitomo Chemical and each of the Group  companies.    As far as the Group companies are concerned, each of them  establishes their own compliance system locally with the guid- ance of Sumitomo Chemicals Compliance Committee but at  their own responsibility. Once the compliance system is estab- lished, each company sustains the self-governed operation of  their system. In this connection, the Compliance Committee  has established the Sumitomo Chemical Group Compliance  Standard that is a basic standard aiming to ensure unified  compliance management across the Group, and each Group  company must follow it in establishing and operating their  respective compliance system. Each company carries out their  compliance management in accordance with this Standard  while adapting appropriately to local laws and regulations as  well as accommodating prevalent social demands for corpo- rate activities in countries where they do business. Accordingly,  each company works with in-house or external lawyers or oth- er experts retained locally in preparing a written Code of Con- duct that its employees must abide by (which Code is generally  called Compliance Manual by Sumitomo Chemical and the  Group companies in Japan and Code of Ethics by the Group  companies abroad). Further, each company usually works out  an arrangement with such experts under which the company  can seek professional advice on compliance matters from them  whenever necessary.    On the part of Sumitomo Chemical, the Compliance Commit- tee is working, among other things, to build a global network  with lawyers or others whereby it can effectively harness the  benefits of each Group companys such working relationships  with their lawyers and other experts. The global network will  be capable of keeping the Compliance Committee updated, for  instance, on the newest major legal developments on compli- ance in each country, which will enable Sumitomo Chemical to  extend whatever support desired to the Group companies in a  proper and timely manner.

Chairman  (Executive Vice President) Vice Chairman Members  23 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012 Governance Economic Activities Responsible Care Activities Social Activities Compliance Management Promoted by Employees  Themselves    To promote compliance management effectively, the efforts  of the Compliance Committee alone are not enough. Employ- ees in every workplace must take part in concrete activities to  prevent misconduct or detect any suspected misconduct as  early as possible. To help achieve this end, Sumitomo Chemical  has the Speak-up System in place, separately from an ordinary  business reporting line to his or her superior, which allows an  employee to directly report any incident or suspected incident  of compliance violation to a designated contact. Further, if an  employee prefers not to report to an internal contact for some  reason, he or she may report to an external contact, outside  lawyers designated by the Company. Group Companies both in  Japan and abroad are requested to adopt the Speak-up System  of the same nature, in principle. At Sumitomo Chemical, the  Compliance Committee has taken every opportunity to thor- oughly familiarize employees with the use and significance of  the Speak-up System, as part of the Compliance Seminars that  the Compliance Committee holds periodically for education of  all employees.    Thanks to constant and concerted efforts, such as these  educational activities, both at Sumitomo Chemical and Group  companies, the Speak-up System has been functioning effec- tively since its introduction, with 20 to 30 reports received every  year containing queries, questions, etc. relating to suspected  conduct. The Compliance Committee always responds to such  reports swiftly and prudently.  In fiscal 2011, there were reported  no major incidents of compliance violation, including any failure  to comply with laws, regulations or other rules. Concrete Activities for Effective Compliance Management    The daily activities of the Compliance Committee are carried  out by the Compliance Committee Secretariat consisting of  members representing several departments in the Company  that are not directly involved in specific business activities of  Sumitomo Chemical. The Secretariat works to grasp the status  quo of compliance in Sumitomo Chemical as well as Group  companies in Japan and the rest of the world, identify impor- tant issues to address, and undertake educational activities  periodically as well as forming and proposing plans for various  initiatives that will help strengthen our global compliance man- agement in the future.    For example, the Secretariat receives written reports every  year from each of the Group companies around the world,  which state, for example, whether a company had any incident  of compliance violation during the past year, how a company  handled reports received regarding suspected compliance vio- lation, and whether a company had any difficulty or problem  in operating its compliance system during the year. Then, the  Secretariat looks into a specific compliance situation of each  company as outlined in the reports, and renders support, if  so desired, including exchanging views face-to-face with the  companys compliance officer, to improve and strengthen the  compliance management of the company in question.    Going forward, the Compliance Committee, while providing  continued support to individual Group companies, will study  whether a more effective mode of Group-wide compliance  management could be pursued by shedding light on possible  commonality of specific geographical regions, such as any ele- ments commonly perceived among or applicable to the Group  companies in China where our business operations are ever ex- panding. In fiscal 2011, we conducted a compliance awareness  survey directed to employees of Sumitomo Chemical and 10 se- lected Group companies in Japan, totaling approximately 4,400  respondents. The survey was intended to assess compliance-re- lated risks that might be existent in the operation and business  conduct of each Group company as well as Sumitomo Chemi- cal, thereby working further to enhance activities for effective  compliance management. Based on the result of the survey, we  will work out specific measures for improvement as part of the  Compliance Committees action plans for the next fiscal year. Ensuring Fair Competition in Business Activities    Sumitomo Chemical currently places particular emphasis on  its efforts of preventing bribery in business conduct. As is evi- dent from such international initiatives as the United Nations  Convention against Corruption and the OECD (Organization  for Economic Co-operation and Development) Convention on  Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International  Business Transactions, there is a surging momentum globally  calling for achieving fair competition in the marketplace by  eradicating corrupt practices, such as bribery. For the Sumitomo  Chemical Group that is developing business globally at an ac- celerating rate, it is growingly important that each and every  company of the Group makes unwavering efforts to eliminate  bribery and any other corrupt practices, as well as abiding by  competition laws of each relevant country, to ensure conduct- ing business in a fair and equitable manner.    From this standpoint, Sumitomo Chemical has recently  strengthened its internal initiatives toward fair market competi- tion by re-organizing the former Competition Law Compliance  Committee to set up the Competition Law Compliance and Brib- ery Prevention Committee. As part of such initiatives, the Com- mittee has newly prepared, for the benefit of Sumitomo Chemi- cal employees, the Compliance Manual for Bribery Prevention,  in addition to the existing Competition Law Compliance Manual  earlier provided, to define more clearly and specifically the basic  rules that all employees are required to abide by. Seminars and  other educational programs are being provided company-wide  to all employees. We intend to extend these initiatives actively  to our Group Companies by providing them with both the  Manuals as guidelines and asking all Group companies to adopt  manuals of the same sort as modified to suit each companys  specific business operations as well as consistent with laws and  regulations of a country in which they operate.    Sumitomo Chemical will continue to work toward enhancing  compliance management for itself and its Group companies  alike, based on the key notion Think globally, Act locally so  that we will be able to gain greater trust and confidence from all  of our stakeholders and society at large.  24 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012Governance Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

Human Rights Labour Standards Environment Anti-Corruption The Global Compacts Ten Principles UN Global Compact GRI4.94.114.124.13SO5 Participation in the UN Global Compact    Sumitomo Chemical is committed to contributing to the  sustainable development of society as the core of its CSR and  believes it crucial to comply with international norms and  cooperate with international organizations, NGOs, and other  companies in meeting the challenges faced by society, such  as problems related to climate change and poverty. The UN  Global Compact* (GC) initiative is fully consistent with the  conceptions, and in January 2005, Sumitomo Chemical be- came the first Japanese chemical company to participate in  the initiative.    In compliance with the 10 principles of the Global Compact,  we are conducting more activities by networking with the UN  and other organizations. Participation in the Working Group on the 10th  Principle (Anti-Corruption)    In December 2008, Sumitomo Chemical became the first  Japanese company to participate in the Global Compact  Working Group on the 10th Principle (Anti-Corruption). This  working group, which comprises companies, NGOs, and oth- ers with divergent interests, discusses development of sys- tems and measures to combat corruption.    As a member of the sub-working group on supply chains,  whose duty was to prepare a Guide for Customers and Suppli- ers, Sumitomo Chemical prepared parts of the draft.     We attended the ninth meeting of the Working Group on  Anti-Corruption held in Morocco in October 2011 and ex- changed opinions with other participants on the challenges  to be met in fostering anti-corruption measures among com- panies. UN Global Compact LEAD    In January 2011, under the leadership of the UN Secre- tary General Ban Ki-moon, the Global Compact LEAD was  launched as a new framework to proactively tackle various  problems faced by humankind. The Global Compact LEAD  was launched with participation from 54 companies (including  three Japanese companies) that had made great contributions  to the Global Compact, which is comprised of about 10,000  companies and other organizations. Sumitomo Chemical has  been a member of the LEAD since its launch.    Sumitomo Chemical reports on the progress of measures  to comply with the GC principles in the annual CSR report. In  fiscal 2011, we worked to obtain a common understanding of  the 10 GC principles among all related departments, surveyed  the present situation to improve our corporate transparency  and information disclosure as a company participating in  LEAD, and incorporated the survey results in creating this CSR  Report 2012.    As a member of Global Compact Network Japan, we partici- pated in its CSR report study group and created a manual to  help improve CSR reports with other member companies.    As a member of the international community, Sumitomo  Chemical will continue to make efforts to resolve global prob- lems in cooperation with the UN, and other organizations and  companies. *UN Global Compact: The UN Global Compact is a United Nations initiative  in which businesses demonstrate responsible and creative leadership and  voluntarily participate in efforts to establish a worldwide framework that en- ables them to act as good corporate citizens and achieve sustainable growth.  25 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012 Economic Activities Three-Year Corporate Business Plan Overview of  Fiscal 2011 Business Performance Relations with Stakeholders Contribution through the Olyset Net Business 26 27 29 30 CONTENTS Sumitomo Chemical will continue to supply useful, innovative  and groundbreaking products worldwide, thereby contributing  to the development of society and industries.

Under these circumstances, we made a concerted effort to  improve our business performance by modifying sales prices,  expanding sales quantities, and cost savings through drastic  rationalization. As a result, in fiscal 2011, net sales decreased  to 1,947.9 billion yen, down 34.6 billion yen from the previous  fiscal year, and operating income, ordinary income, and net  income stood at 60.7 billion yen, 50.7 billion yen, and 5.6 bil- lion yen, respectively.  60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Net Sales Operating Income Ordinary Income Number of Employees Net Income Overseas Sales Ratios 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0 100 50 0 -50 120 90 60 30 0 80 60 40 20 0 -20 -40 -60 30,000 25,000 20,000 0 '07  '08  '09  '10  '11  '07  '08  '09  '10  '11  '07  '08  '09  '10  '11  '07  '08  '09  '10  '11 '07  '08  '09  '10  '11  '07  '08  '09  '10  '11 1,896.5 92.8 25,588 102.4 63.1 41.6 1,788.2 32.6 26,902 2.1 59.2 41.9 1,620.9 35.0 27,828 51.5 14.7 45.0 1,982.4 84.1 29,382 88.0 24.4 53.3 1,947.9 50.7 29,839 60.7 5.6 51.8 Overview of Fiscal 2011 Business Performance  (Billions of yen)  (Billions of yen)  (Billions of yen)  (Billions of yen)  (FY)  (FY)  (FY)  (FY)  (FY)  (FY)  (%)  (Persons)  28 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012Economic Activities Overview of Fiscal 2011 Business Performance   Basic Chemicals Sector     Although the market situation improved for methyl meth- acrylate (MMA) and synthetic fiber materials, shipments of  these materials decreased due to the Great East Japan Earth- quake as well as diminishing demand. Shipments of chemical  products also remained at a low level, resulting in a decline  in sales. As a result, net sales amounted to 284.3 billion yen,  down 17.9 billion yen from the previous fiscal year, and oper- ating income decreased by 11.3 billion yen year on year to 9.3  billion yen.   Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector     Shipments of synthetic resin and petrochemical products  decreased due to the Earthquake and diminishing demand  as well as the large amount of repair work performed at our  manufacturing facilities both in Japan and overseas. Nonethe- less, sales increased thanks to the improvement of the over- seas market situation following a rise in the price of materials  such as naphtha and to the revision of sales prices in Japan. As  a result, net sales increased by 22.5 billion yen year on year to  672.4 billion yen, while operating income came to 6.2 billion  yen, down 5 billion yen from the previous fiscal year.  IT-related Chemicals Sector     Shipments of polarizing films, a key material used in LCDs,  rose due to increased demand for use in smartphones and  tablet PCs, and enhancement of our film production capac- ity in Taiwan; however, shipments of color filters decreased.  Sales prices for both polarizing films and color filers dropped,  and the strong yen yielded an adverse impact to the yen- denominated business results of Sumitomo Chemical Group  companies outside Japan. As a result, net sales decreased by  29.2 billion yen year on year to 293.1 billion yen, and operat- ing income came to 11 billion yen, down 15.2 billion yen from  the previous fiscal year.   Health & Crop Sciences Sector     Sales of methionine (feed additive) expanded favorably, and  in the crop protection business, shipments of herbicides con- tinued to show steady growth. Despite the influence of the  strong yen on the yen-denominated business results of Group  companies outside Japan, net sales increased by 13.3 billion  yen year on year to 264.1 billion yen, while operating income  increased to 26.5 billion yen, up 3.2 billion from the previous  fiscal year.   Pharmaceuticals Sector     Sales of the atypical antipsychotic LATUDA started in the  US in February 2011, while sales of AVAPRO (agent for the  treatment of hypertension), LONASEN (agent for the treat- ment of schizophrenia), TRERIEF(new agent for the treat- ment of Parkinsons disease) and METGLUCO (biguanide oral  hypoglycemic drug) continued to expand. However, sales of  AMLODIN (therapeutic agent for hypertension and angina  pectoris) decreased due to generic drug competition along  with the impact of the strong yen to yen-denominated busi- ness results of overseas Group companies. As a result, sales  came to 380. 5 billion yen, down 30.1 billion yen from the pre- vious fiscal year, during which we received a lump-sum pay- ment due to the conclusion of a partnership agreement on  product development and marketing, and operating income  decreased by 7.7 billion yen year on year to 20.9 billion yen.   Others In addition to operating business in the aforementioned five  sectors, the Sumitomo Chemical Group is also engaged in  supplying electrical power and steam, the design of chemical  industrial equipment and in the supervision of its installation,  as well as in transport and warehousing, and physical proper- ty/environmental analysis. Sales from these operations came  to 53.4 billion yen, up 6.8 billion yen year on year, and operat- ing income also increased by 3.6 billion yen to 7.7 billion yen.

The Company will continue to make efforts to maximize its  corporate value, taking the optimal approach with each of its  major stakeholders. Distribution of Economic Value to Stakeholders      In fiscal 2011, the Company distributed the following added  value to its major stakeholders, which we have estimated by  classifying the profits and costs posted in the financial state- ments by stakeholder, with reference to the GRI guidelines  and other materials. Donations      Sumitomo Chemical regards it as one of its important social  responsibilities to make donations, and has been making spe- cific donations by comprehensively examining factors such as  social importance, need of continuity, and urgency.     In areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake, we  donated relief goods and a part of sales from meals served at  cafeterias. (For details of our support to afflicted areas, see page 14.)  We have also continued to donate Olyset Nets as an effective  means to control malaria and to provide support for educa- tion in Africa. Moreover, in fiscal 2011, we extended support to  victims of the flooding that occurred in Thailand in October.     In fiscal 2011, we made a total of 449 donations, which  amounted to 513.08 million yen. *For the distribution of value to society and employees, the amounts are shown on  an unconsolidated basis.  Assured by an independent assurance provider Relations with Stakeholders Approach to be taken by Sumitomo Chemical In order to meet the expectations of shareholders and investors  and maximize corporate value, Sumitomo Chemical will make use  of its strengths, including its excellent technological development  ability, high cost competitiveness, and global business operations,  toward sustainable growth, while appropriately returning profits  and disclosing information to its stakeholders in a fair manner. Sumitomo Chemical is working to create a workplace environment  in which individual employees can make the most of their abili- ties, giving due consideration to compliance and diversity among  employees.

People living in Africa account for 90% of these deaths, and  most of the victims are children under the age of five living in  the Sub-Saharan region. Infectious diseases, such as malaria,  prevent people from working or attending school and also in- cur high costs for medical treatment, often forcing them into a  vicious circle of poverty from which it is difficult to escape.     Malaria is an infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes,  and protecting people from mosquitoes represents the most  effective method of preventing contraction of the disease.  Sumitomo Chemical developed the Olyset Net, which is a  highly durable net made from polyethylene resin-based fibers  containing insecticide, using expertise gained through the de- velopment and production of resin and active ingredients for  insecticides. The Company developed this product through  Creative Hybrid Chemistry by combining its proprietary tech- nologies from different fields. (For details see page 9.)     The Olyset Net symbolizes the CSR initiative of Sumitomo  Chemical, which is committed to business activities that con- tribute to the creation of a prosperous society. Expanding Production Capacity in Line with WHO Policy     In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the  use of the Olyset Net as a long-lasting insecticidal net. The  Olyset Net has been contributing to malaria control in Africa  and across the world. Results from a regional trial indicated  that the use of the net contributed to a large decline in the  local rate of malarial infection. In 2008, the WHO, promoting  the policy of universal coverage, enlarged its pool of candi- dates for malaria control, which had previously been limited  to pregnant women and infants. Under this policy, the orga- nization aimed to distribute one long-lasting insecticidal net  per two people in malaria-prone areas. It was estimated that  fulfilling this aim would require 350 million nets. To meet the  demand, Sumitomo Chemical increased the total Olyset Net  production capacity of its production bases in three countries  (Tanzania, Vietnam, and China) to 60 million nets per year.     In 2003, Sumitomo Chemical provided its Olyset Net  manufacturing technology free of licensing fees to A to Z  Textile Mills Limited, a Tanzanian mosquito net manufacturer.  Subsequently in 2007, the Company established Vector Health  International Limited, a joint venture with A to Z Textile Mills  and opened a new factory. The Olyset Net  business has pro- vided many people with jobs in Tanzania, thereby contribut- ing to local employment and economic development. In 2011,  Harvard Medical School introduced the case of A to Z Textile  Mills as a successful example of local production in the global  health field.     Sales from the Olyset Net business account for 4% of sales  from the Health & Crop Sciences Sector (see page 27).   Releasing Olyset CLASSIC to General Consumers     In Kenya in October 2011, Sumitomo Chemical released the  Olyset CLASSIC, which provides the same functions as the  Olyset  Net, to general consumers.     Olyset Nets have been purchased primarily by the WHO,  UNICEF, and other international organizations and donated  mainly to those suffering high mortality rates from malaria  infection such as children and pregnant women in more than  80 countries. The Company decided to sell Olyset CLASSIC  insecticidal mosquito nets through general distribution chan- nels in order to provide the product to all those in need. The  nets will be sold initially at major supermarkets in Kenya and  then marketed across the country.      The Olyset CLASSIC will be sold in a range of sizes to en- sure suitability for beds of almost all sizes and are expected to  be used not only in households but in hospitals, schools and  other public facilities.     Through this business, Sumitomo Chemical will continue  to make contribution toward the sustainable development of  society.

In this plan, we have also set  targets for RC audits and logistics. We are striving to steadily  conduct RC activities based on this plan and in consideration of  our long-term targets.     In addition, we have formulated the Sumitomo Chemical  Groups medium-term plan for Responsible Care activities.  Based on this plan, each Group company sets their own specific  medium-term and annual RC activity plans in light of their cur- rent situation and implements the plans through a PDCA cycle  to further improve their activity level. Applying the Sumitomo Chemical Group Responsible  Care Activity Standards     As part of measures to enhance internal control and foster  efficiency in Group management, Sumitomo Chemical formu- lated the Sumitomo Chemical Group Responsible Care Activity  Standards in April 2010. Since then, the Company has been  applying the standards, which set forth the Groups policies,  measures, procedures, and other basic requirements for each  RC activity area, to its consolidated subsidiaries both within  and outside Japan (excluding equity-method affiliates). The  basic standards have provided Group companies with a solid  activity foundation that can be shared among them regardless  of the details of each business and have enabled the Group to  conduct RC activities in a more unified manner. We will work to  implement the standards, which have already been applied for  more than two years, more efficiently and effectively. Information Exchange between Group Companies    In April 2012, we held the sixth RC Global Meeting at the Sumi- tomo Chemical Environmental Health Science Laboratory (Osa- ka), inviting about 30 members from 19 overseas Group compa- nies. In this annual meeting held since 2007 targeting overseas  Group companies, participants introduced the initiatives they  were taking in compliance with local laws and regulations and  proactively discussed and exchanged their opinions concerning  common problems.    In May 2012, we also held a meeting at the Head Office in  Osaka for domestic Group companies to exchange informa- tion on Responsible Care. This meeting has been held for more  than 20 years, usually with the participation of more than 100  people. At the meeting, both Sumitomo Chemical and its Group  companies reported their RC-related challenges and topics, and  participants proactively exchanged opinions with each other.

Sumitomo Chemicals Works and Research Laboratories are  subject to the following two types of RC audits: (1) Specialized  audits, in which a checklist is created and specialists then con- duct audits on RC systems and their operation; and (2) Manage- ment audits involving Responsible Care Committee members  led by the executive officer in charge of Responsible Care.    Specialized audits are also conducted for each of Sumitomo  Chemicals business sectors as well as Group companies in Ja- pan and overseas. Fiscal 2011 Responsible Care Audit    Responsible Care specialized audits and management audits  were conducted at the Ehime, Chiba, Osaka, Oita, Misawa, and  Ohe Works. In addition, a total of 41 audits were conducted on  our business sectors and domestic and overseas Group com- panies (see DATA BOOK p. 13). The results turned up no major  issues of noncompliance with laws and regulations that led to  issuance of recommendations or a penalty charge by the gov- ernment.

In fiscal 2011, we held the meeting in November with the  participation of 18 domestic Group companies and participants  conducted open discussions on the following three themes: (1)  application of the Group Responsible Care Activity Standards;  (2) measures to be taken against the problems pointed out in RC  audits and those that arise in times of disaster; and (3) provision  of static electricity-related safety information.     Regarding the meeting, participants made comments such as  I was able to share detailed information, I am not very experi- enced in the field and it was useful to know about the measures  taken by other companies, and It was very meaningful for me  to listen to experts opinions, though time was limited. We will  continue to hold the meeting once a year.

Taoka Chemical has overseas bases in China and India. We are  conducting activities for environmental protection, safety, and  health at these bases in line with our Corporate Policy for Qual- ity, Safety, and Environment, which states, To undertake envi- ronmental protection, human safety and health in the overseas  operations.    Taoka (Tianjin) Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. produces additives for  rubber chemicals, intermediates for photographic chemicals,  and chemicals for electronic materials. We have conducted a  number of activities for this company including holding HAZOP  meetings, conducting onsite safety audits, and sharing safety- related information, while proactively carrying out quality  audits and supporting quality management. Thanks to efforts  by local employees and support from the head office, the Chi- nese subsidiary obtained ISO 9001 certification in 2011 and also  received the highest level of commendation from the authority  of the Economic Development Area in which it is located.    Taoka Chemical India Pvt. Ltd. manufactures instant adhe- sives. We are providing instructions to this subsidiary regarding  the operation and management of newly established waste in- cineration equipment and carrying out safety audits to ensure  the steady operation of the system. We also annually conduct  onsite quality audits. In fiscal 2012, we will support the com- pany toward its acquisition of ISO 9001 certification. Conducting RC Activities  Steadily, with Continuous  Improvement  Sumipex Techsheet Co., Ltd. (Taiwan)    Sumipex Techsheet (STS) started operations in January 2009.  We manufacture and sell acrylic boards used in signboards,  lighting covers and other items. We also began manufactur- ing products for Japanese customers last year and have been  improving product quality to meet detailed product require- ments.    STS has the following five Responsible Care targets:     (1) Increase the safety awareness of employees     (2) Manage risks and prevent accidents     (3) Conserve energy and resources     (4) Prevent environmental pollution and make continuous          improvements in this area     (5) Comply with safety- and environment-related laws           and regulations    Last year, as an activity for (1), we began to convene young  deputy managers from relevant departments to our monthly  safety meeting, in which we identify safety risks and discuss  the reasons they are considered as such. Based on these discus- sions, we are making improvements, targeting the workplaces,  machines, and work methods that pose safety risks.    For (5), we are implementing measures in response to recent  revisions of the local environmental laws and regulations con- cerning exhaust gas in Taiwan, applying foresight to assist in  this regard. With our current exhaust gas treatment system,  gas with traces of mist containing methyl methacrylate mono- mer, which is used as the main material for acrylic boards, is  expelled as exhaust, and if our acrylic board production capac- ity is expanded in the future as planned, the amount of dis- charged mist (MMA-m) might exceed the regulated standard.  To prevent this from occurring, we designed a basic process to  recover MMA-m for recycling prior to exhaust gas treatment,  receiving support from the design department of Sumika  Technology Co., Ltd., located in Tainan, from last year. We need  to remodel the exhaust gas treatment system step by step  in order to complete the process. In fiscal 2012, we will foster  environmental protection, resource saving, and recycling by  remodeling the system while also improving our organization  and operational methods to boost our Responsible Care activi- ties to a higher level.

Sumika Electronic Materials (Wuxi) Co., Ltd. (SEMW) since its  establishment in 2004, and while mainly engaged in its key  businesses including the production of Polarizing films, Light  diffuser plates, Light guide plates, Separators for LIB, LCP Com- pounds and so on, has been committed to the cause of CSR,  especially in the field of energy-saving. SEMWs efforts and con- tributions have won common approval from local government  and other communities. In 2011, SEMW won the Award named  the Best Project for Reducing En- ergy Consumption and a 30,000  RMB cash award from Wuxi New  District Administrative Commit- tee as a result of our outstanding  achievement.  We will persist in our improvement forever!    Confucius, who has been famous since Ancient Chinese  times, always conducted a self-examination three times per  day. Such is the method of company operations as well. Since  SEMWs establishment in 2004, company leaders and all staff  have been making comprehensive self-examinations, includ- ing on not only operating principles and major policies, but  also processes, equipment and devices. As a result of making  improvements based on self-examination, we were able to  achieve great success in the field of energy-saving. Here for  your reference, a few cases follow:     Moreover, based on the policy of energy saving and eco- friendly growing, all our departments have been proactively  making investments in energy saving. As a result, we achieved  both sustainable operation and substantial cost reduction  (equivalent to 2 million RMB).     We will continue to implement energy saving measures in  line with the policies set by the Chinese government. In the  next few years, we plan to introduce new systems such as new  efficient LED lighting and power EP (Environment Protect)  systems, in order to reduce energy cost, improve competitive- ness, and maintain eco-friendly growth. At the same time, we  are making all out efforts to reduce energy consumption and  maintain the Earths global environment. Developing Environment-Friendly  Products Sumika Agrotech Co., Ltd.    Sumika Agrotech aims to contribute to the development  of agriculture and society by developing technologies and  products that are related to basic agricultural materials such  as water, soil, fertilizers, and seeds.    In conducting our business, we place importance not only  on contributing to agricultural production but also on reduc- ing the impact caused by agriculture to the environment. For  example, we developed a one shot fertilizer, paying atten- tion to the nutrient absorption pattern of crop plants. One  shot fertilizer is attracting attention as an environment-friend- ly fertilizer because the nutrients are efficiently absorbed by  plants while the outflow of fertilizer ingredients into the soil is  minimized.    Our irrigation materials, which are used to water plants, are  made from plastics with low environmental impact. Also, we  Irrigation tube One shot fertilizer Irrigation tube Seed coating Program Lighting  control  project Solar street  lighting  project Project for  the  reasonable  use of air  conditioners Plant water  project  Theme Improve the  method of  lighting control Reasonable  layout of solar  street lamps Operate air  conditioners in  an efficient  manner Reduce the use  of electricity Before improvement Lights were manually  controlled by a switch,  with some constantly  switched on Solar street lamps  were used outside  the suspended plant Air conditioners  were constantly  used Water supply by  pumping       After improvement Control by infrared  rays  These redundant solar  street lamps were  moved to the plant that  was operating Some of the air conditioners  are shut down according to the  number of onsite workers. (As a result of repeated tests,  the following fact was  revealed: when the  temperature reaches 22  degrees Celsius +/- 2 degrees,  and a relative humidity of  55% +/- 5%, there is no  impact on the production  process, even if one-third of  the air conditioners are  switched off.)

In  developing any product, we are committed to reducing the  environmental impact of the product throughout its total life  cycle, from the procurement of materials through to the end- of-life of the product and its disposal.      We will further enhance our environmental impact reduc- tion measures to make more contributions to society. Embedding RC Activities and its  continuous improvement Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore (Private) Limited (PCS)    PCS was conferred the Excellence Award in all Responsible  Care Codes of Management Practice at the Singapore Chemi- cal Industry Councils (SCIC) Responsible Care Awards 2011.  SCIC is the official body representing the chemical industry in  Singapore. Its membership comprises key multi-national cor- porations, small-to-medium enterprises, service providers and  traders. SCIC is affiliated with the ASEAN Chemical Industries  Council and also plays an instrumental role in the adoption  of GHS in Singapore. PCS was conferred the highest award in  all RC categories by SCIC in recognition of the initiatives the  company had taken to continually improve the health, safety  and environment (HSE) of employees and the community.      I will introduce some of the initiatives taken by PCS as fol- lows. Community awareness and emergency response     Some of the key initiatives and strategies include proce- dures for notification to appropriate parties within a compre- hensive communication network. Pollution prevention     Among the key strategies are reducing known pollutants  generated in the workplace to the practicable minimum and  programs to increase employees awareness and gain support  to minimize pollutants. Process safety     Consistent effort has been put in to ensure capability to  identify failures, gaps or unsafe conditions. Comprehensive  training schemes equip employees with the knowledge to  strive for continual improvement. Product stewardship     One of the key considerations is communication with cus- tomers, distributors and workforce on safe use, transportation  and disposal of products, and recommendations for risk re- duction.     Participation in the SCIC Awards has spurred PCS to contin- ue to scale greater heights in search of excellence and build- ing trust with stakeholders. SCIC Responsible Care Awards 2011 granting ceremony Personnel Exchanges in the  Responsible Care Field  between Group Companies Seung Ju Song Responsible Care Office (Environment & Safety) Energy & Climate Change Office Head Office in Tokyo     Sumitomo Chemical is accelerating globalization in a range  of business and operational fields. Also in the field of Re- sponsible Care (RC), the Company is fostering global human  resource development as well as personnel exchanges and  bidirectional communications between employees in charge  of RC, both within and outside Japan.     As part of such measures, I was transferred from Dongwoo  Fine-Chem, a group company based in South Korea that  manufacturers and sells IT-related materials, to the RC Office  (and the Energy & Climate Change Office) on a temporary  basis (for two years). In the RC Office, I am mainly engaged in  the standardization and systematization of energy- and envi- ronmental protection-related operations.      I am struggling hard to perform the tasks given to me,  which provide me with precious opportunities to learn about  Sumitomo Chemicals advanced RC measures and deepen  my knowledge and understanding about Japanese laws/reg- ulations and related movements. I would like to contribute  to higher operational efficiency and the visualization of busi- ness operations for the entire Sumitomo Chemical Group. To  this end, I am trying hard to achieve results during my stay in  Japan, which will be over in about six months.

These include activities to promote  anti-climate change measures and energy-environment strat- egies; share energy/environmental protection management  targets throughout the Group; foster the standardization and  systematization of environmental management operations;  enhance risk management based on environmental risk as- sessment; and examine the practical use of environmental ef- ficiency indicators and environmental accounting methods. Promotion of Anti-Climate Change Measures and Energy-Environment Strategies     Global society is now required to thoroughly review the use  of energy to tackle the climate change problem. Believing it  to be important to meet this requirement, Sumitomo Chemi- cal formulated specific energy-environment strategies from a  long-term perspective and has been implementing measures  accordingly. We will respond to the climate change problem,  regarding it not only as a risk but also as a business (growth)  opportunity that will help us further enhance the foundation  of our production activities.

Specifically, we set the target environmental concentra- tions*1 (in the air and water) for all substances as our voluntary  management criteria. We evaluate hazard levels by compar- ing the targets with data obtained through monitoring and  simulation, formulate reduction plans based on the evalua- tion results, and implement the plans to reduce the amounts  of substances released. Examining the Practical Use of Environmental  Efficiency Indicators and Environmental  Accounting Methods Assessing the environmental impact of each Group company  using JEPIX *2     In fiscal 2011, as in the previous fiscal year, we undertook  environmental impact assessments using JEPIX, in order to  evaluate the effectiveness of this index as a strategic manage- ment indicator, and continued with relevant analyses. Assessing environmental impact of each product by LIME     For more practical use of LCA*3 data both internally and ex- ternally, we use LCA software (MiLCA) from the Japan Environ- mental Management Association for Industry to undertake  environmental impact assessments of our major products us- ing the LIME method.

Implementation  of the reduction  measures Conforming  44 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012Responsible Care Activity Energy Saving and Activities for Avoided  CO2 Emissions      Sumitomo Chemical is proactively implementing measures  for the achievement of a recycling-based, low-carbon society,  including measures to save more energy and further reduce  CO2 emissions. Outline     Sumitomo Chemical regards and pursues the following as  its core implementation targets: to achieve the worlds high- est level of energy efficiency in the manufacturing process  of its major products (remarkable improvement of energy ef- ficiency); and to review energy sources and develop processes  and products that contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions  (further expansion of the low-carbon business).     To remarkably improve energy efficiency, we are imple- menting multifaceted energy saving measures that will  achieve tangible results, including improving the operation  methods and efficiency of our equipment, recovering waste  heat, and rationalizing and fundamentally improving pro- duction processes through the use of our unique catalyst  technology. We are also implementing low-carbon measures  in a planned manner, including using low-carbon fuels for in- house power/steam generation, expanding our contributions  to reducing CO2 emissions business, and making use of the  BioCarbon Fund.  Trends and Topics of Performance Items Targets and actual results     We are striving to achieve predefined numerical targets,  while precisely estimating our CO2 emissions by energy source  to clarify points to be improved and to elevate the entire man- agement process to a higher level.

(Note) Data for fiscal 2010 was changed to increase accuracy. Calculating Energy Consumption and Greenhouse  Gas Emissions Based on the Act on the Rational Use of  Energy and the Act on Promotion of Global Warming  Countermeasures     By law, all 35 sites of Sumitomo Chemical (of which 10 sites  are designated as energy management factories) are required  to report their energy consumption and greenhouse gas emis- sions to governmental authorities. In fiscal 2011, total energy  use by the sites came to 1,191 thousands kiloliters in crude oil  equivalent, a reduction of 9.8% from the previous fiscal year,  and their CO2 emissions from the use of energy totaled 3,024  thousands tons, a reduction of 11.4% year on year.

(1) Reducing steam loss (and CO2 emissions) by enhancing  steam trap management (Ehime Works)     Since fiscal 2010, the Ehime Works has employed IT to  implement measures for reducing steam loss by enhancing  steam trap inspection and management. In the past, various  information on steam traps was collected and compiled using  paper media such as ledgers, but because a range of employ- ees were engaged in  steam trap inspection,  the documents became  dispersed and the col- lected data was not ap- propriately maintained  or updated. To solve  this problem, the Works  fostered digitization of  the documents using IT  tools and appointed an  employee exclusively  for steam trap inspections, thereby reinforcing and ensuring  the central management of steam trap-related information.     As a result, the Works can now carry out stream trap inspec- tions more efficiently. In addition, the Works began holding  technical support seminars to teach employees other than the  aforementioned inspector how to perform inspections on a  regular basis, thereby increasing energy saving awareness and  improving and disseminating inspection technologies and  skills among employees. By implementing these measures  across the board, the Works was able to substantially reduce  steam loss in fiscal 2011. (2) Introducing LED lights to the product warehouse        (Misawa Works)     The Misawa Works adopted the use of LEDs for its ceiling  lights during construction of a new GMP-compliant ware- house (GMP: a quality management criteria for products such  as pharmaceuticals set by the Japanese government based on  the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act). As a result, energy consump- tion was reduced by about 40% compared with the use of  conventional mercury  lamps. LED lights pro- vide a range of benefits  other than energy  saving, including de- creased necessity to re- place them in elevated  areas due to longer life.  Also, LED lights do not  attract insects because  they do not emit strong  ultraviolet rays, and can be lit up instantly, leading to higher  work efficiency in the warehouse. (3) Reducing power loss by introducing inverter-type blowers       (Okayama Plant, Osaka Works)     The Okayama Plant is operating an active sludge treatment  system for wastewater, for which air generated by a blower is  used. Because it is a batch plant, production items frequently  change, and the amount of wastewater also fluctuates accord- ingly. In response to these changes, the plant must vary the  amount of air supplied to the treatment system. In the past,  the plant used a large 110 kW air blower to provide enough  air to treat the large amount of wastewater present. However,  based on the actual amount of wastewater treated over one  day, the amount supplied to the treatment system was ad- justed by releasing excess air generated by the blower to the  atmosphere.      In fiscal 2011, the plant introduced two small 55 kW blowers  to generate only the air required resulting in conservation of  energy. This is expected to help the plant reduce its power  use by 25% from conventional levels (equivalent to a 33 tons  reduction in CO2 emissions per year). Preparing the guidelines for the  estimation of avoided CO2 emissions and  a carbon footprint (CFP) calculation manual     It has been said that the chemical industry consumes much  energy, but in fact the industry provides the global society with  a range of products that contribute significantly to reducing  greenhouse gas emissions in the use stage of their life cycle.     Sumitomo Chemical believes that it is urgent to develop  next-generation processes and products that help reduce CO2  emissions, and is accelerating measures to achieve this out- come through the concerted efforts of all its departments. In  order to make all employees aware of this need even as early  as in the R&D stage and incorporate it into product design,  we independently created the guidelines for the estimation  of avoided CO2  emissions as well as a carbon footprint (CFP)  manual. At present, we are promoting the use of these materi- als within the Company while also quantifying (visualizing) the  contributions made by our core products towards emissions  reduction. CFP study meeting  held at the Head Office  in Tokyo Energy & Climate Change Office, Head Office in Tokyo  46 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012Responsible Care Activity Optimum Mix of Appropriate Legal Compliance  Measures and Voluntary Activities     Sumitomo Chemical is combining legal compliance mea- sures and voluntary activities in an optimal manner to reduce  its environmental impacts such as exhaust gases, wastewater,  and solid waste. Outline     For pollutants released into the environment, we are ac- tively promoting multifaceted measures and strengthening  management by widely adopting the concept of risk man- agement, in addition to complying with legal standards and  meeting the criteria agreed with local governments. We are  also continually deepening mutual communications with peo- ple living in the neighborhoods around our facilities by proac- tively listening to their opinions. Through these measures we  aim to further improve our environmental performance based  on even better relations of trust with local communities. Trends and Topics of Major Environmental  Performance Items     We have set medium-term targets for each performance  item and are endeavoring to faithfully attain them. In line with  these goals, each of our sites has set their own priority targets  in consideration of the specific characteristics of their respec- tive businesses, thereby enhancing their risk management. Prevention of air and water pollution     We are endeavoring to reduce emissions of SOx, NOx, and  soot and dust into the air, and of COD, nitrogen, and phos- phorous into water bodies. Moreover, we are fostering the ef- fective use of water (to improve unit water use). (For details, see  page 6 of the DATA BOOK.) GRI3.94.11EN14EN20EN22EN26 Substances Subject to the PRTR Act and VOCs PRTR: We aim to achieve the target of reducing total emis- sions of air and water pollutants by 60% relative to fiscal 2008,  by fiscal 2015, through drastic risk management that is based  on our risk assessment results. (For details, see pages 8 to 10 of the  DATA BOOK.) VOCs:  We will manage the related risks in line with PRTR mea- sures while continuing to achieve the target of reducing VOC  emissions by 30% relative to fiscal 2000.  (For details, see page 10  of the DATA BOOK.) Waste Landfill disposal: We aim to achieve the target of reducing  the landfill disposal amount by 80% relative to fiscal 2000, by  fiscal 2015, by curbing waste generation and fostering waste  reuse and recycling. In particular, to fulfill our responsibility as  a manufacturer of inorganic and organic chemicals based on  the Act on the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources  (revised recycling law), we are proactively reducing the gen- eration of sludge and also promoting its use as a resource. (For  details, see page 11 of the DATA BOOK.) Standardizing group-wide efforts of checking on commis- sioned waste disposal companies: Due to revision of the Waste  Management and Public Cleansing Act of Japan, companies  commissioning waste disposal to outside entities are now  required to make efforts to check on how said commissioned  companies treat and dispose of the waste. In response, Sumi- tomo Chemical has conducted examinations to set its own  standards for onsite checking (rules to be checked regard- ing the waste disposal companies, frequency of performing  checks, recording format, etc.), and has applied them across  the company and shared the results of the checks (through  central management and visualization of the information col- lected from each site), thereby increasing effectiveness and  efficiency of related operations. PCB waste: We are continually commissioning the treatment  of waste containing high concentrations of PCBs to JESCO* in  a planned manner, and with the exception of some factories  in the Kanto region, we aim to complete waste treatment at  all our facilities by March 2014, which is earlier than the legal  deadline. Also, regarding waste containing PCBs at lower  concentrations, we have continued to engage in surveys and  studies on early treatment. In April 2012, the Ehime Works be- gan treatment ahead of other sites.

We will con- tinue to observe international rules and standards, strengthen  and expand our efforts to conserve biodiversity and promote  sustainable use of biological resources, and contribute to  sustainable development of the global community with the  power of chemistry. Soil and groundwater contamination     We have continued surveys and evaluations of soil contamina- tion as well as remediation work on our land. We have also mon- itored groundwater close to our boundaries on a regular basis  to confirm that levels of hazardous materials, including toxic  oils, are below those stipulated by environmental standards. Specified CFCs     We are continuing the replacement of refrigerators using  specified CFCs, including CFC-12, as coolants with those using  alternative coolants, aiming to complete the replacement by  2025. (For details, see page 10 of the DATA BOOK.) Specific activities     Each of our sites executes a PDCA cycle to achieve specific re- sults and contribute to the attainment of the Companys targets. (1) Reducing the concentration of nitrogen in wastewater (Ehime Works)     In expanding the plant facilities, from which wastewater  containing high concentrations of nitrogen is discharged, the  Works has installed a system to recover ammonia from waste- water using a new method, thereby reducing the concentra- tion of nitrogen in the water by 40%. The equipment separates  ammonia from the nitrogen-containing process liquid using  only one-fourth or less of the energy required by the conven- tional recovery method (equivalent to about a 75,000 tons  reduction in CO2 emissions). In recognition of this achievement,  the Works received an award at the sixth Responsible Care  Award held by the Japan Chemical Industry Association. (2) Reducing the emissions of vinyl chloride monomer (Chiba Works)     The Works had previously been recovering and treating  exhaust gas containing vinyl chloride monomer with a tem- perature swing adsorption system using activated carbon. This  massive piece of equipment, which was installed to treat a vast  amount of dilute exhaust gas, requires a large amount of steam  to remove the vinyl chloride monomer, and corrosion of the  equipment caused by the chloride was a concern. In 2011, to  solve these problems, the Works introduced a pressure swing  adsorption system using hydrophobic silica gel as an adsorbent.  As a result, atmospheric emissions of vinyl chloride monomer  were reduced by 90% or more and steam use was also reduced  by 4,000 tons. (3) Making effective use of byproduct oil as a combustion im- prover for the submerged combustion furnace (Oita Works)     The Works had previously been using purchased heavy oil C as  a combustion improver for the submerged combustion furnace  used to incinerate primary waste liquids, but altered the furnace  to use oil waste from the plant (byproduct oil) as a substitute  for the heavy oil. Initially there was concern that nitrogen oxides  (NOx) emitted into the air might increase due to incineration  of the byproduct oil. However, thanks to the application of the  denitrification technology (returning NOx in exhaust gas to ni- trogen), NOx emissions have remained at the standard level or  below even after replacement of heavy oil with byproduct oil,  and yearly CO2 emissions have been reduced by 6,000 tons. (4) Initiating treatment of electric appliances containing PCBs  at low concentrations (Ehime Works)     In addition to treating transformers and other devices contain- ing PCBs at high concentrations, the Ehime Works began treating  electric appliances containing PCBs at low concentrations in fiscal  2011. Specifically, the Works will remove insulation oil from the ap- pliances and commission the incineration of the oil and applianc- es separately to treatment facilities certified by the government.  The Works will continue these treatments in a planned manner. Sumitomo Chemicals Commitment to the Conservation of Biodiversity 1. We position the conservation of biodiversity as one of our most impor- tant management issues and strive to help protect the global environment. 2. We work to continuously reduce environmental impact in our produc- tion operations and our development and supply of products and services  and in cooperation with third parties in the supply chain and thereby con- tribute to the conservation of biodiversity. 3. By regularly implementing education programs, we ensure that employ- ees fully recognize and understand the importance of biodiversity and  promote our commitment to its conservation. 4. We continuously engage in corporate social responsibility activities that  contribute to environmental protection and lead to greater trust and confi- dence from society. 5. We disclose the results of these efforts and maintain effective communi- cation with the general public. Recovering and Recycling Bobbins     The department is fostering the recovery and recycling of  bobbins. Bobbins are used as cores around which heat-resistant  separators manufactured by the company are coiled. The product  weighs about 1.8 kg, including the weight of the resin bobbin,  which is about 0.4 kg. The department began recovering and re- cycling bobbins in May 2011, before which recovery and recycling  had been commissioned to an outside entity.     The skills of operators have improved year by year, and pres- ently as many as 99% or more of bobbins are recycled. In 2012, the  production of heat-resistant separators is expected to increase,  and accordingly, the number of bobbins to be treated will double  from the present level of 6,000 pieces per month. The department  will continue to maintain  this high recycling rate  to protect the environ- ment, while also ratio- nalizing its operations.

Safety Performances in Fiscal 2011     In Japan in fiscal 2011, Sumitomo Chemical achieved a total  of zero lost-workday injuries, while its contractors had a total  of four lost-workday injuries (frequency rate of lost-workday  injuries: 0. 36). The annual average for the frequency of lost- workday injuries of Sumitomo Chemical during the 10 years  from fiscal 2002 to 2011 was 2.5.     Sumitomo Chemical has been aggressive in pursuing occu- pational safety and health activities to prevent labor accidents  under the fundamental principle of Making Safety the First  Priority. To this end we are repeating the PDCA cycle to iden- tify all conspicuous and potential risks and hazards in each  workplace and implementing a series of measures, including  making improvements based on the results of risk assess- ments.     In fiscal 2010, we began enhancing a culture of safety  throughout the company for all employees to truly under- stand and practice our principle of Making Safety the First  Priority, and achieved a total of zero labor accidents in the  second year since the start of the initiative. We will keep im- plementing measures to continue achieving our zero-accident  target.   Measures Implemented in Fiscal 2011 to Enhance  a Culture of Safety     Sumitomo Chemical has been nurturing a culture of safety  and mutual respect based on the principle of Making Safety  the First Priority and encourages all its organizations (work- places) and individuals (employees) to understand the impor- tance of safety and voluntarily undertake necessary actions.     In fiscal 2011, we implemented the following two measures  to further enhance our safety culture. Designation of a safety day for the entire company     In fiscal 2011, based on our policy of Making Safety the First  Priority, we designated the first Monday of every month as a  safety day for the entire company, on which employees are  encouraged to think about safety.     On each safety day, all employees at all sites prioritize safe- ty-related activities and events, and in principle, no corporate  meetings requiring business trips for site/line managers are  planned. Instead, each site on safety day is encouraged to  hold onsite meetings for occupational safety and health to  the extent possible. Also, safety messages are dispatched by  Occupational Safety and Health/Industrial Safety and  Disaster Prevention 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 '75 '80 '85 '90 '95 1.61 (Note) 0.72 (Note) 0.38 0 '00 '05 '11 (FY) Japan-All industries (Frequency Rate of Lost-Workday Injuries) Japan-Chemical industry Members of the Japan Chemical  Industry Association Sumitomo Chemical Frequency Rate of Lost-Workday Injuries  (Note) Results in fiscal 2010 are shown because the relevant data for fiscal 2011 was not  available from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare at the time of creation of this  report.     In 2012, when I first heard the slogan, Enhance a culture of  safety to achieve not only zero labor ac- cidents but also zero risks, I hit upon the  idea of comparing the culture of safety  to a plant, which we would water every  day to help it grow and come into bloom,  to achieve both zero labor accidents and  zero risks. Based on this idea, I created  this poster, on which a large sunflower is  depicted as the plant which we nurture to  make it bloom, to achieve this significant  target of zero risks.     Many of our workplaces have achieved a zero labor accident  record, with members having attained high safety awareness as  a result of permeation of the culture of safety. I believe, however,  that we must not be satisfied with the status quo and instead  must detect any potential risks and prevent their materialization  so that we can continue with our perfect record of zero labor ac- cidents. Based on this belief, I have created the following slogan.

Evaluation of the safety culture level      To further enhance the culture of safety, we evaluated the  current safety culture level of Sumitomo Chemical to assess  the effects of our safety measures.     The evaluation targeted all employees as well as the em- ployees of some contractors, and consisted of a questionnaire  comprising about 130 questions that covered the following  three items: safety awareness and activities in an individual  sense; safety management at the workplace; and  organiza- tional climate at the workplace. We also surveyed differences  in safety awareness and ideas between managers (sectional  managers and those in higher positions) and general em- ployees, as well as how Sumitomo Chemical was viewed by  employees of contractors and their awareness of Sumitomo  Chemicals safety principles, policies, programs, and activities.      The results of these surveys revealed that the safety culture  level of Sumitomo Chemical is roughly average for the chemi- cal industry. There were, however, differences in the level of  safety culture between workplaces, and we therefore need  to encourage workplaces displaying a low safety culture level  to think about the reasons for their unfavorable results and  to take actions to improve. Regarding differences in safety  awareness and ideas between managers and general em- ployees, no significant gaps were discovered. However, some  similar gaps were observed across the company and we need  to make efforts to narrow them. For example, many managers  answered yes to the question, Are activities to ensure com- pliance with the safety rules and procedures highly appreci- ated at your workplace?; however, general employees did not  show this same tendency.     Additionally, each site held a meeting to report the survey  results and to deepen understanding of the safety culture  level, with the results to be incorporated into measures to be  implemented to enhance safety culture in fiscal 2012. 4R-KYT* Competition Held  at the Ehime Works for the Achievement of  Zero Labor Accidents     On April 1, 2011, the Ehime Works was registered as a site  with zero labor accident activities under the Zero-Accident  Campaign Registration System by the Japan Industrial Safety  & Health Association, thereby renewing its determination to  prevent all people working within its premises from becoming  injured.     As part of the activities, the Works held the second prelimi- nary 4R-KYT competition toward achieving zero labor acci- dents following the first such competition held last year, and a  total of eight teams participated, representing the Works and  related research laboratories.     The activities will be further expanded to practical KY. 4R-KYT competition held at the Works All the Works Ehime Works Ohe Works Chiba Works Osaka Works Oita Works Misawa Works  Evaluation of the Safety Culture Level  No substantial differences  observed for any of the items.

Safety and Disaster Prevention Management for  Preventing Accidents at Plants and Assuring Safety     The foremost mission of industrial safety and disaster preven- tion management is to prevent unforeseen plant accidents by  ensuring process safety and plant integrity. Plants must also be  protected against natural disasters and terrorist attacks in or- der to secure safety for workers at the sites as well as residents  living in the surrounding areas. Stringent risk assessments are  therefore conducted, in addition to continuous safety improve- ment and comprehensive voluntary safety management.     In fiscal 2011, Sumitomo Chemical achieved that fiscal years  target of no severe industrial accidents*. (The Company had  one severe industrial accident in fiscal 2010.) However, there  were five minor industrial accidents (compared to two in fiscal  2010). We have fully analyzed the causes of these accidents  and are enhancing safety management across the company  to prevent serious industrial accidents from occurring. Process Safety Management from Research and  Development to Plant Operation and Dismantling     In an effort to reduce environmental impact and achieve ze- ro-accident and zero-disaster operations, Sumitomo Chemical  performs safety assessments at each stage from new chemical  process R&D to plant design, construction, operation, mainte- nance, and dismantling. (1) Examination of Process Safety     The Process Safety Review Committee convenes at every  step, from R&D through to industrial scale production pro- cesses, to oversee a system in which the safety of each stage  is thoroughly verified before moving on to the next stage. The  system is in use at Sumitomo Chemical, and all Group compa- nies are being instructed to adopt it. (2) R&D Safety Confirmation     Materials safety data and other related data on the chemi- cals to be handled are examined and assessed in detail. This  data is then used to select the safest chemicals and to assess  the required amounts in order to ensure that R&D will utilize  only fundamentally safe chemical processes.      The construction materials for each plant are also examined  and evaluated to select the optimum materials with lower life- cycle costs. (3) Plant Safety Confirmation at Design and Construction  Stages     While plants are designed based on legal technical stan- GRI4.11LA7 dards, processes are additionally subjected to hazard assess- ments in order to highlight potential dangers and incorporate,  from the standpoint of self-administered management, more  stringent safety precautions into the design and construction  processes.     In addition, operational manuals are created and training is  provided for operators. The Company also regularly conducts  process hazard evaluations attended by relevant persons after  the start of plant operations and when operating parameters  or facilities are modified. Advanced Self-Administered Safety Management     Aiming to achieve advanced self-administered manage- ment, Sumitomo Chemicals Process & Production Technology  Center works to improve and effectively utilize the support  system and tools obtained from various sources. Its mission  is to support process safety and disaster prevention manage- ment, prepare various safety and disaster prevention guide- lines, and compile a database of safety information (technical  information and accident reports) and risks related to the mix- ing of, or contact with substances.     In Japan, Sumitomo Chemical formulated guidelines on  safety measures based on the voluntary safety measures  implemented by the Company and distributed copies to  domestic Group companies to help them reduce risks associ- ated with large earthquakes and leakage of toxic substances.  We also held briefing sessions on these measures. Moreover,  regarding safety measures for static electricity, the Process &  Production Technology Centers safety engineering research  team has been giving onsite guidance to Group companies.     For Group companies outside Japan, in fiscal 2011, Sumi- tomo Chemical created English versions of the Safety Man- agement Guidelines as well as of guidelines on static elec- tricity safety measures and chemical process safety among  guidelines on industrial safety and disaster prevention. These  guidelines were distributed to the companies to promote in- dustrial safety and disaster prevention management. * Severe industrial accidents refers to workplace incidents that cause injuries to local  residents requiring outpatient/hospital treatment, lost-workday injuries to workers on  the site, or incidents involving more severe results.

Moreover, in consideration of the damage caused by the  unprecedented scale of the earthquake and tsunami, we are  reviewing our anti-seismic measures to prepare against earth- quakes that are larger than the conventionally foreseen ones.  The following details the relevant measures taken by our sites. Connecting the J-Alert system to the in-house broadcasting system (Ehime Works)     In Japan, operation of the J-Alert nationwide early warning  system has begun. This satellite-based system allows gov- ernmental organizations to provide emergency information,  such as earthquake early warnings, to municipalities that then  dispatch the information to citizens via their wireless disaster  prevention systems.     In January 2012, the Ehime Works connected the J-Alert sys- tem to its in-house automatic broadcasting system in order to  receive relevant information from the local government (Nii- hama City). The Works intends to minimize damage caused  by disasters by promptly and safely suspending operations  based on information received through the system. Changing the place at which emergency food and goods are stored (Okayama Plant)     As a rule, the Okayama Plant evacuates employees to a hill  20 m in height on its premises in the event of large earth- quakes and tsunamis. Moreover, after the Great East Japan  Earthquake, the plant increased stored emergency foods  (dried bread and biscuits) and drinks as meal substitutes to a  level sufficient to feed all employees twice over, and changed  their storage location from the security room (at the main  gate) to the building on the hill, at which employees would be  evacuated in an actual emergency. Conducting an anti-tsunami drill (Oita Works)     In October 2011, the Oita Works conducted an evacua- tion drill for a large simulated tsunami based on the lessons  learned from the March 11, 2011 tsunami. In the drill, a tsunami  warning was given through emergency broadcasting and via  the wireless disaster prevention system, and almost all em- ployees and visitors completed evacuation within 30 minutes  as planned. The Works will carefully conduct more drills based  on the problems identified in the first trial, including training  for urgent suspension of plant operations. Also, the Works  will prepare more signs and indicators to facilitate emergency  evacuations. Increasing the height of the dike in the seawater intake pump area (Chiba Works)     On March 11, 2011, the tsunami reached the coast where  the Chiba Works is situated, but fortunately the Works was  not flooded. It was however revealed in the post-tsunami re- investigation that the height of the dike was lower in the An- egasaki seawater pump intake area than in other areas, which  translated to a higher flooding  risk. In response, while conducting  periodic maintenance activities in  autumn 2011, the Works increased  the height of the dike to reduce the  flooding risk not only against tsu- namis but also against tidal waves  and typhoons. Distributing copies of a card showing emergency action guidelines (Health & Crop Sciences Research Laboratory)    The research laboratory believes it to be very important to  confirm the safety of its members in the event of a large-scale  disaster. In such a case, however, it may be difficult for mem- bers to communicate and act appropriately due to anxiety  and/or restricted communications. In August 2011, the labo- ratory therefore created a card showing emergency action  guidelines and distributed copies to all members, who now  always carry the card with them so that they can act calmly,  even in emergencies. Preventing books from falling  (Advanced Materials Research Laboratory)    The research laboratory experienced a seismic intensity  scale of six lower (People are difficult to keep standing) dur- ing the Great East Japan Earthquake. Minimal damage was  sustained to the building; however, in the library, several  thousand books (about half of all the books stored) fell from  the bookshelves, although the shelves themselves did not col- lapse. Based on this experience, the laboratory placed safety  sheets under the books and also  introduced safety bar equipment  (book keeper) that works through  automatic operation to prevent  books from falling.

At this conference, the so-called 2020 target was proposed  to ensure that chemicals are used and produced in ways that  lead to the minimization of significant adverse effects on hu- man health and the environment.     The International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA)  formulated the Global Product Strategy (GPS) to attain the  2020 target and to enhance product stewardship activity  (initiative to ensure that chemicals available in the market are  safely handled and used throughout their life cycles), which is  a core activity for Responsible Care toward further enhancing  chemicals management.     In Japan, the Japan Chemical Industry Association launched  the Japan Initiative of Product Stewardship (JIPS) to conduct  specific activities to foster the GPS. The Japanese chemical  industry is voluntarily implementing the JIPS based on the as- sessment and management of risks posed by chemicals and  in consideration of the entire supply chain. Sumitomo Chemicals Activities     In response to international trends toward the enhance- ment of chemicals management, Sumitomo Chemical has  promised to conduct appropriate risk assessments for all its  products manufactured or sold in annual amounts of one ton  or more by fiscal 2020 in its Eco-First commitments.     In our risk assessments, we will assess the impact of chemi- cal substances on human health and the environment by con- sidering both the hazard and the exposure (handling amount  and usage of chemicals) together throughout the life cycle of  the substances assessed. The assessment results will be uti- lized for appropriate risk management (risk reduction and risk  measures) in the handling and use stages of the substances  assessed. Moreover, we will document the results in the form  of summaries on the safe handling of chemicals (GPS/JIPS  Safety Summaries) and disclose them widely to the public via  the ICCA website. Effective Use of SuCCESS     In order to collect and manage chemical safety information  to formulate appropriate responses to chemical regulations  that are becoming more strict each year, and ensure chemi- cal safety based on risk assessments amid increased interna- tional awareness of the need for appropriate management of  chemicals, we have developed and are effectively using the  Sumitomo Chemical Comprehensive Environmental, Health &  Safety Management System (SuCCESS).

In the past, the  SDSs*1 for these purchased materials were obtained separately  via the research, business and procurement teams and not all  SDSs managed by the teams were the latest versions. Now,  however, the SDSs can be centrally managed through the use  of SuCCESS, and all departments, including manufacture, sales  and research teams and the administrative departments, have  access to the latest SDSs and product composition information. *1.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) are documents that describe information neces- sary for the safe handling of chemical products (properties, handling methods,  safety measures, etc.)  53 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012 Governance Economic Activities Responsible Care Activities Social Activities Environmental Health Science Laboratory  Playing a Central Role in Safety Research     The Environmental Health Science Laboratory of Sumitomo  Chemical assesses the impact of the substances handled and  products manufactured by the Company on human health  and the environment. The laboratory makes assessments in  diverse fields ranging from genetics to environmental and  ecological science, using the latest scientific knowledge and  advanced technologies. Careful Consideration for Animal Experiments     In the process of developing useful chemical substances, a  large variety of safety and efficacy assessments are required.  These assessments on human, animals and the environment  cannot be completed without conducting experiments using  laboratory animals. Sumitomo Chemical advocates humane  treatment of laboratory animals and applies the 3Rs of animal  use and animal welfare: replacement, reduction, and refine- ment to conduct animal experiments appropriately with due  consideration for animal welfare. Providing Customers around  the World with SDSs in a Timely Manner Masayuki Fujita Planning & Coordinating Office,  Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector     In exporting our products to countries overseas, we are re- quired to attach SDSs to them and ensure that the sheets are  written in the language of the country to which the products  are exported. In the past, we commissioned necessary transla- tion work to translation companies, but now thanks to the mul- tilingual function provided by SuCCESS, we can create SDSs in  the language of our choice*2 and submit the sheets to custom- ers in a speedy manner. *2 .  We can create SDSs in 32 languages.

Recent research methodologies have made it possible  to obtain data concerning the rate of metabolism and speed of  transport without the need to conduct animal tests. Specifically,  technologies are now being put into practical use to conduct in  vitro metabolic tests on chemical substances using an artificially  synthesized enzyme (cytochrome P450) along with transport pro- teins. The data obtained can be applied to a simulation model that  is able to reproduce the distribution of a substance in the blood  and organs along with metabolism and excretion processes, to- ward the accurate prediction of  in vivo kinetics.     Sumitomo Chemical has been using these technologies for the  precise assessment of chemical safety ahead of other companies  (and received an incentive award from the Pesticide Science Soci- ety of Japan for research into the technologies). We will continue  our research to increase the precision of in vivo kinetic analysis  toward a more accurate assessment of chemical safety.

In 1992, we set  specific safety measures to be implemented within the Com- pany to ensure the safety of our products throughout their  life cycle, from development, manufacture, distribution, and  use through to disposal. In 2009, we also substantially revised  the method of assessing the risks posed by our products,  after making minor revisions. As shown in the figure below,  this new assessment method was created referring to the GPS  measures taken by the International Council of Chemical As- sociations (ICCA) (see page 52) and is based on GHS*1-compliant  hazard and exposure/impact levels.     In assessing the exposure/impact levels of our products, we  consider not only the use of the products by our customers,  but also the use and disposal of the products through supply  chain, to the extent possible.     To perform such risk assessments, it is necessary to know  how our customers are using our products, and we therefore  foster cooperation with them. Based on our previous risk as- sessment results, we have in fact asked some of our customers  to take special safety measures.     Because the risk assessment method has substantially  changed, we are providing employees with necessary edu- cation and are reassessing the risks of our products that are  released in the market, which we plan to complete by 2020.     In fiscal 2011, we performed about 50 risk assessments in  total. We will continue to collect data related to hazard and  exposure/impact levels to make assessments using this new  method, while also encouraging Group companies to carry  out similar assessments. Communication with Customers     Sumitomo Chemical conducts safety tests of its products  and surveys related safety data present in the public domain  to help its customers with the safe handling of the Companys  product. The results are supplies as Safety Data Sheets (SDSs)  to its customers. SDSs include information on the safe handling  of chemical products (proper- ties, handling methods, safety  measures, etc.) and should be  created in compliance with the  Japanese Industrial Standards  (JIS)*2 and the standards set  by the International Organiza- tion for Standardization (ISO)*3.  For products that need to be  handled with special care, we  create Yellow Cards (simplified  SDSs) and distribute copies to  distributors of the products  to prepare them for possible  emergencies that they may face  during transport.     In Japan, the JIS provisions  on SDSs were revised in 2005 in line with the GHS. Sumitomo  Chemical participated in the revision work, while also revising  its own SDSs. We have already completed the revision work  for the products for which such revisions are required by law.  We always pay attention to new safety information. In fiscal  2011, we revised and created a total of about 100 new SDSs.     A recent trend has emerged in which some of our customers  wish to receive detailed information on substances that are  contained in our products in trace amounts in addition to the  information shown in the SDSs. Amid this trend, Sumitomo  Chemical became a member of the Joint Article Management  Promotion-consortium (JAMP)*4 in order to build up a system  to communicate information about specific substances con- tained in its products. As a JAMP member, we are providing  customers with rational information that they require, by us- ing the JAMP mechanism (MSDSplus*5 and AIS*6). In fiscal 2011,  we participated in a project to examine the information com- munication methods utilized for the management of chemical  risks that was jointly launched by JAMP and the Japan Chemi- cal Industry Association*7.

In 1998, all our manufacturing sites, excluding the Gifu Plant,  obtained ISO 9001 certification, the international standards  on quality management systems issued by the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO). Moreover, the Gifu  Plant, Okayama Plant, and Oita Works are managing manufac- turing processes and quality based on pharmaceutical GMP  standards, while in 2010, the Ehime Works obtained certifica- tion for European Feed Additives and PreMixtures Quality Sys- tem (FAMI-QS) for methionine, an essential amino acid used  in feed additives. We will continue to build up optimal quality  assurance systems across the company.    For the fail-safe operation of these quality assurance sys- tems, employees must be aware of their importance and  implement them. To this end, Sumitomo Chemical provides  employees with consistent education across the company,  and each site also provides their members with education  that is pertinent to the products treated therein.    In fiscal 2011, major quality problems existed; one each for  the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector and the IT-related Chemi- cals Sector. The problem in the Petrochemicals & Plastics  Sector was caused by a material supplier. Nonetheless, we are  taking drastic measures to prevent the reoccurrence of similar  problems while clarifying the cause in detail.    Sumitomo Chemical has also been encouraging Group com- panies to enhance their quality assurance systems. In fiscal  2010, we set the Group quality assurance and PL standards  and fostered the establishment of relevant systems and rules  at about 60 Group companies. In fiscal 2011, three Group com- panies newly acquired ISO 9001 certification.

Sumitomo Chemical America is supporting the corporate ac- tivities of Sumitomo Chemical in the Americas while marketing  and selling the Companys products, including basic chemicals,  petrochemical & plastic products, and health and crop science- related products such as insecticides for household use and  feed additives.     As a corporate member of the American Chemistry Council  (ACC), we formulated the policies, established rules, educated  employees, and carried out internal audits for the introduction  of a Responsible Care management system that meets ACCs  criteria, and acquired third-party certification for the system at  the end of 2010. Based on this system, we are conducting prod- uct management according to their risk classifications, in order  to ensure product safety throughout the supply chain. For the  ESPOLEX series (material for automobile airbag covers), we have  obtained ISO/TS 16949/2009 and ISO 9001/2008 certification as  well.     Sumitomo Chemical America will continue to ensure product  safety across the supply chain and encourage employees to  conduct Responsible Care activities to meet the needs of cus- tomers.

A total of 117 logistics  companies belong to this council, which mutually fosters ac- tivities to ensure occupational safety and health, environmen- tal protection, and logistics quality. Member companies that  have had no incidents and set a good example for logistics  quality improvement activities are commended at the coun- cils annual general meeting. Also, we hold a nationwide com- petition for tank truck drivers to encourage them to self-train  on basic unloading procedures and on measures to be taken  when faced with various problem scenarios. Participation in hands-on training provided to ensure safety against fires and explosions     Employees of Sumitomo Chemicals partner logistics com- panies also participated in hands-on training provided at the  Companys manufac- turing facilities in prep- aration for emergen- cies such as ignitions  and explosions caused  by static electricity. Use of a tool to evaluate corporate safety culture     The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and  Tourism has created a tool to evaluate corporate safety culture  as a means to manage transportation safety. This tool can be  used by transportation companies to manage transportation  safety in an organized manner. Sumitomo Chemicals partner  logistics companies used this tool in fiscal 2011 and conduct- ed safety awareness surveys with their employees. Incidents Involving Employees of Partner Logistics Companies     In fiscal 2011, we were not able to achieve zero incidents:  there were two lost-workday injuries involving employees of  our partner logistics companies. (1) An employee working in a warehouse became injured after  being struck by the rear wheel of a forklift. (The forklift was  being driven in reverse, with the driver unaware that the em- ployee was standing in harms way.) (2) A tank truck driver became injured by slipping and falling  when getting into a truck through the door of the drivers seat  in preparation for the next days departure. Occurrence of Major Logistics Quality-Related  Incidents     Against the target of keeping the number of major incidents  to below six, we faced one incident (liquid leakage at the  delivery destination*: Rank C incident) in fiscal 2011 and thus  achieved the target.  * Deficiencies in initial response to the leakage and in relevant communications made  to those concerned  Initiatives for Ensuring Quality, Safety, and Environmental  Protection in Logistics Operations Commendation at the general meeting of the Sumitomo Chemical Logistics  Partnership Council held on May 26, 2011 Second competition for tank truck drivers held on October 6, 2011 Hands-on training held on January 25, 2012 Occurrence of Major Logistics Quality-Related Incidents  during the Past 10 Years Rank B Rank C '01    '02     '03     '04     '05     '06      '07   '08     '09     '10     '11 (FY) (Note) Sumitomo Chemical classifies major incidents into Rank A, B, C in descending  order of severity from the worst to least.

In fiscal 2011, we implemented a modal shift from  truck to rail transportation of our products from the Ehime  Works to the Kanto area. Specifically, under the Japanese  Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industrys fiscal 2011 program  to help companies make rational use of energy, we newly pre- pared a tank container to transport liquid products requiring  strict temperature control by rail, and began using this con- tainer in the same fiscal year. Reduction of Environmental Impact in Logistics  Operations  (Actual Results for Fiscal 2006 to 2011)     In our logistics operations in Japan in fiscal 2011, unit energy  consumption decreased by 5% year on year thanks to a num- ber of factors, including the modal shift from tank truck to rail  for long-distance transportation, an increase in the amount  transported at one time, and efforts made to shorten the  transportation distance. Measures to Ensure Logistics Quality     We have proactively introduced measures across the com- pany to prevent errors related to shipping, delivery, and prod- uct inputting by the use of information technologies. In fiscal  2011, we developed a system to prevent inputting errors for  resin products at the Chiba Works. Specifically, the checking  method was changed from human visual examination to the  use of barcodes, thereby preventing inappropriate input due  to human error. (Note) Regarding the fuel consumption per ton-kilometer used in the calculation, we  had until last fiscal year, adopted the coefficient used in cases in which the loading rate  was unknown; however, from fiscal 2011, we began using the loading rate-based coeffi- cient in order to increase data precision in consideration of the actual transportation sit- uation.

We are also committed to conducting social contribution activi- ties that are unique to Sumitomo Chemical through our business  activities with a focus on covering three different areas: coexis- tence with local communities, continued support for sustainable  society and responsible business as a global company. Moreover, we are working toward increased information disclo- sure and the promotion of dialogue with multi-stakeholders. Hand in Hand with Customers Hand in Hand with Business Partners Hand in Hand with Local Communities and Society Hand in Hand with Employees 60 61 62 68 CONTENTS  60 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012Social Activities For Higher Customer Satisfaction     The Sumitomo Chemical Group is committed to supplying  high-quality products and services that satisfy customers  needs and ensure safety in their use. At Sumitomo Chemical,  the departments in charge of sales and quality assurance work  together to extend necessary support for increased customer  satisfaction.      Sumitomo Chemical operates a product quality information  management system to incorporate the complaints and re- quests made by customers into its quality assurance activities.  Each business sector of the Company analyses the informa- tion registered with the system and implements measures to  prevent the occurrence of similar problems. Also, the Works,  Research Laboratories, and sales personnel share information  regarding customers complaints and improvement requests  about product quality as important data, based on which the  entire organization should make responses to customers.  Measures Taken by the Plastics Technical Center     The Plastics Technical Center (in Chiba) conducts research  for the application and processing of petrochemical products  in response to market needs. The center supports corporate  customers in developing resin products from various aspects.     For example, in the field of automotive parts, the center  considers and proposes new resin processing technologies to  manufacture lighter, stronger, and multifunctional resin prod- ucts, and provides information about materials and process- ing technologies for practical processing evaluation. More- over, by making a processability assessment through flow  analysis and designing products through impact analysis us- ing the next-generation plastics computer aided engineering  (CAE) technologies, the center supports corporate customers  in commercializing resin products. Also, in recent years, the  center has been fostering molecular-level CAE analysis to help  improve the design of polymer materials, while bringing new  value to the market by making proposals for high-perfor- mance resin processed products with new functions and for  technologies to commercialize such products.      The environment surrounding the petrochemical indus- try is undergoing great changes, and customers needs are  also substantially and rapidly changing. In response to these  changes, the Plastics Technical Center will continue to develop  highly value-added new processing technologies, materials,  and products in a speedy manner and propose them to cus- tomers. GRI4.154.16PR5 Consultation Service Provided by the Product  Promotion Department of the Crop Protection Division     The Product Promotion Department of the Crop Protection  Division provides customers with consultation services about  Sumitomo Chemicals crop protection chemicals within Japan,  committed to responding to customers from a customers  viewpoint in line with the Companys compliance policy. Cus- tomers ask the service staff questions about various issues,  such as the appropriate usage of crop protection chemicals and  food safety, and the members endeavor to obtain the latest  information, including information on the registration of crop  protection chemicals, thus providing inquirers with precise  information in an easy-to-understand manner in compliance  with related laws, including the Agricultural Chemicals Control  Act of Japan. The department has also introduced a new sys- tem to even more precisely and quickly respond to inquiries.  The questions regarding the products of other compnies and  general crop protection chemicals are also handled with close  consultation with internal and external business partners.     Through the consultation service, the department actively  communicates with customers, and improves and develops  products giving due consideration to their requests. When  receiving complaints about the Companys products, the  department cooperates with other departments to make  prompt responses. Moreover, the department is promoting  information sharing within the Company; for example, sum- marizing the inquiries made by customers in a brochure and  creating a Q&A document based on inquiries made in the  same period of the previous year, for use by salespeople.     Also, to help customer service members improve their skills,  the department holds study meetings on frequently asked  questions (FAQs) and encourages the members to attend  external seminars to learn how competitors and companies  in other industries deal with customers. Moreover, customer  service members hold information exchange/study meetings  with their counterparts working at other Sumitomo Group  companies engaged in agriculture-related business for mu- tual improvement. Through these activities, the department is  working to increase the credibility of the Sumitomo Chemical  Agro Group.

In addition to ensur- ing fairness, equitability, and transparency in our transactions  with business partners, we are also encouraging them to  promote their CSR activities through our responsible procure- ment activities. Clarifying regulations within the Company     Sumitomo Chemical clearly states the following basic prin- ciple of responsible procurement in its Basic Procurement  Policies (shown below):     4. In its procurement, the Procurement Section shall give  preference to those suppliers that are active in CSR initiatives,  with the aim of fulfilling its corporate social responsibilities  and building sound relationships with suppliers.     In addition, we clearly state our basic responsible procure- ment policy in the Group Business Standards of Procurement,  which apply to Group companies both in Japan and overseas. Means to foster Responsible Procurement (1) Using the Sumitomo Chemical Supply-Chain CSR Deployment  Guidebook and Check Sheets     Sumitomo Chemical has created the Sumitomo Chemical  Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook, which explains  CSR items (legal compliance and ethics; human rights and  labor; disaster prevention and occupational health and safety;  environmental protection; and quality and product safety) to  be focused on by suppliers. Sumitomo Chemical aims to help  its suppliers address their issues by monitoring and provid- ing feedback on the results of their self-evaluation using the  Sumitomo Chemical Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Check  Sheets and helping them promote CSR activities by repeating  the PDCA cycle. (2) Web Page on Procurement Information     Sumitomo Chemical has a CSR Procurement section in its  Procurement Information website linked from the Company  homepage in order to broadly inform its stakeholders about  its CSR procurement initiatives.

They made food repli- cas, including bean-starch vermicelli, from waste PET bottles  through the use of chemicals and spent time contemplating  environmental problems. Not all applicants were able to join  the event due to limited seating. To enable more people at- tend the next lesson, we  are planning to hold it as  a two-day event. We will  continue conducting  similar activities to stim- ulate childrens interest  in chemistry.  64 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012Social Activities GRIEC8 International Contribution     The Sumitomo Chemical Group is conducting localized so- cial contribution activities around the world. Supporting Hospice Activities (Poland)    Since 2010, Sumika Electronic Materi- als Poland (SEMP) has been supporting  the Hope Hospice for children in Toru  by providing financial support and pro- viding Christmas presents to the hos- pice. Additionally, every summer, SEMP  organizes a family picnic for employees and their families with  the participation of more than 500 people, and during the  event, a special charity lottery is held to raise funds through  donations to the Hope Hospice. We are thus making social  contributions in a manner that is enjoyable for employees.    Hope Hospice provides 24 hour care for children with life- threatening and terminal illnesses. Toru has areas of great  poverty, and there are many parents who are unable to care  for children with serious long-term illnesses and disabilities  and are forced to abandon them in local hospices and state  childrens homes. Unfortunately, state funding does not en- sure comprehensive care and medical attention for these chil- dren. Without the support of friends and people of goodwill  who understand the situation, it would be impossible for the  hospice to continue its work. As SEMP, we are pleased that we  can support these activities even in a small way. Donating Recycled Wheelchairs (Thailand)     Bara Chemical, Sumipex  (Thailand) and Sumika Poly- mer Compounds (Thailand)  are jointly supporting the  Wheelchairs of Hope activ- ity conducted by a Japanese  NPO to recover and recycle  waste wheelchairs in Japan  and deliver them directly to people in need in Asian countries.  Believing it to be important to take the first step, each of the  three companies collected and recycled one to three wheel- chairs, providing them directly to neighbors of companies in  need of wheelchairs.     Recognizing the importance of continuing social contribu- tion activities, the companies will continuously support the  Wheelchairs of Hope activity while investigating the local  need for wheelchairs.

In 2011, the companies launched a matching gift program  (in which the companies donate an amount of money that is  equal to that donated by employees), collecting many dona- tions from both executives and general employees that were  used to construct a new basketball court, and to install sports  equipment and 20 desk and chair sets at the school.    On September 23, 2011, representatives of the companies  and labor unions visited the school for a donation ceremony,  where they met cheerful children and confirmed the results  of the three-year support activity, which had substantially im- proved the schools environment.    The companies will continue helping improve the environ- ment for children through diversified activities, including the  matching gift program, based on Sumitomo Chemicals CSR  principles. Youth Environmental Education Activities (United States)    Valent BioSciences Corpo- ration (VBC) celebrated its  annual Bring-Your-Kids-to- Learn-Day on August 11, 2011.  VBC uses this annual pro- gram as another opportunity  to give back to the local communities and society through  youth environmental education. The themes for the annual  event focus on education on biodiversity and on environ- mental harmony through presentations, hands-on activities,  nature walks and open discussions.    We selected this years event to take place at the nearby Volo  Bog, a state natural area, which has the only open-water bog  in Illinois and is a National Natural Landmark. The children  examined soil samples from three types of communities and  identified the different animal species that lived in the soil  and calculated a diversity index. They learned that the more  diversity that is found in the soil, the healthier it is. Along the  trail, our guide encouraged the children to interact with and  preserve the wonders of the bog.    VBC provided the children with guide books for identify- ing trees and birds. Now that they have been introduced to  the natural wonders of the bog, they can share their learning  experiences with their friends and family and act as nature  guides themselves.

(For details see  page 30.)   Toward the Achievement of the Millennium  Development Goals (MDGs)     In Africa, in particular, in the Sub-Saharan region, people are  facing a range of problems, including poverty, infectious dis- eases, and high death rates for pregnant women and infants.  In response, the United Nations has set the Millennium Devel- opment Goals* as immediate measures to solve the problems.     Sumitomo Chemical has been lending its support to Africa  by providing its insecticidal mosquito net, Olyset Net for the  prevention of malaria, thereby directly making contributions  to the achievement of one of the MDGs (Combat HIV/AIDS,  malaria and other diseases) while also indirectly contributing  to the attainment of the following Goals: Reduce child mor- tality, Improve maternal health, Eradicate poverty, and  Achieve universal primary education. Malaria Control Initiatives     Sumitomo Chemicals Olyset Net is highly evaluated and  recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a  critical means of controlling malaria, and the nets have been  distributed supplied to areas across the globe, mainly to Af- rica. Additionally, the nets have been donated through NGOs  and international organizations, and it has been reported that  the number of people infected with malaria parasites or actu- ally suffering from the disease have been decreasing in areas  where the nets are used. Creating Employment through Local Production     Sumitomo Chemical provided its Olyset Net manufactur- ing technology free of licensing fees to a local company in  Tanzania and established a joint venture with the company  to create more jobs for local people and to contribute to the  development of the local economy. Promoting Malaria awarenss programs     In fiscal 2011, Sumitomo Chemical conducted the following  activities to promote malaria prevention awareness programs.  Me and My Net competition     Sumitomo Chemical held the Me and My Net competition  jointly with the UK-based international educational support  organization, Royal Commonwealth Society, as a campaign to  help children understand the importance of malaria preven- tion. In this competition, school children wrote essays, painted  pictures and took photos on the theme of preventing malaria  through the use of the mosquito nets. Over 2,100 entries were  received from 167 schools  and 25 countries including  India, Pakistan and Malaysia  as well as African nations and  after review by a judging  panel, an Indian student was  awarded as the top prize. Providing financial support to a malaria prevention project     In October 2011, Sumitomo Chemical donated 22,000 dol- lars to the malaria prevention project spearheaded by the  Hollywood actor David Arquette through the US based NPO  known as Malaria No More. To support the NPOs malaria  prevention initiatives, Mr. Arquette had been engaged in vari- ous endeavors to collect 40,000 dollars by his 40th birthday (on  September 8). As a donation, Sumitomo Chemical matched  the amount of money collected by the actor, resulting in a to- tal of 44,000 dollars for the NPO. Educational Support for the Leaders of Tomorrow     Sumitomo Chemical has been supporting education in Af- rica by using a portion of sales from the Olyset Net business.  In cooperation with the NGOs World Vision Japan and Plan  Japan, we have supported 12 projects to construct primary  and secondary school buildings, as well as dormitories for  teachers and school lunch facilities in eight African countries.  At present we are supporting another two projects in Congo  and Mozambique. Once the construction is completed, we  will continue to provide support for school fees and supplies,  thereby helping the next generation of leaders get the educa- tion they need. (See pages 14 to 19 of CSR Highlights.)       As a member of the international community, Sumitomo  Chemical will continue its proactive support of Africa toward  the achievement of the MDGs.

Each company site  formulates annual activity plans and conducts specific activi- ties based on Company-wide policies. Engaging in a Variety of Dialogues     Each Works engages in a variety of risk communication and  dialogue activities for various purposes. These include risk  communication model projects carried out jointly with local  governments, environment and safety support projects for  domestic and overseas governments and businesses, regular  meetings with local residents, and dialogues with the com- munity based on cooperation with the chemical industry.     Moreover, the head offices (in Tokyo and Osaka) participate  in a range of committee activities conducted by the national  government and industrial associations as well as in industry- government-academia seminars and lectures to disseminate  relevant information and exchange opinions in a timely man- ner. The overall aim is to help people deepen their understand- ing of Sumitomo Chemical and win more trust from the public. Localized Information Disclosure by Worksites     Each worksite of the Company publishes its own environ- mental and safety report every year to report on its local ac- tivities in detail. The reports of the worksites complement the  Companys own CSR Report.     In addition, the Ehime, Osaka, and Oita Works publish local  newsletters for the proactive distribution of area-specific in- formation, often delivered to citizens as newspaper inserts. Local newsletters published by the Ehime, Osaka and Oita Works  (delivered to households biannually inserted in newspaper) Company-wide policies Target Specific initiatives - Achieve safe operations and ensure regional safety - Promote communication with society Visualize Responsible Care activities conducted  at the sites and widely disclose related information - Enhance information disclosure   Create site reports on the environment and safety,  local newsletters and the Sumitomo Chemical CSR  Report - Foster interactive dialogues   Promote a range of risk communications     In February 2012, a Responsible Care dialogue meeting was suc- cessfully held in Oita; the eighth one held in the area. A total of 165  people attended the meeting, including 87 citizens living in the  neighborhood of the participating companies along with those  from related industry organizations, governmental agencies, and  schools.     The regional dialogue meeting is held every two years and led by  local companies belonging to the Japan Chemical Industry Associa- tions Responsible Care Committee. The February 2012 meeting was  held through cooperation of the bases of a total of 11 companies.  These bases included not only Sumitomo Chemicals Oita Works  and sites of other member companies of the committee but also  sites of companies that were non-members who thought it mean- ingful to participate nonetheless. The sites selected earthquakes  and tsunamis as the main theme of the meeting, believing that lo- cal inhabitants, who had witnessed the unprecedented damage of  the Great East Japan Earthquake, would be very much interested in  the proceedings. In the meeting, Oita Prefecture and Oita City gave  keynote lectures, participating companies including Sumitomo  Chemical made presentations on specific countermeasures to be  implemented, and opinions were proactively exchanged between  participants. Participating  citizens raised various ques- tions and made a range of  comments regarding mea- sures to be taken by compa- nies in the event of chemical  substance leakage from  factory damage sustained  by an earthquake, including  how the companies would  promptly inform the local  inhabitants of the facts. In response to such questions, companies  provided clear and easy-to-understand answers.    Keeping in mind the fact that we tend to get into a rut when con- ducting activities at these local dialogue meetings, we would like  to further develop such meetings as a forum for opinion exchanges  and discussions between local inhabitants and companies through  careful selection of the theme for each meeting and by fostering  frank opinion exchanges between related parties, including group  leaders of the local inhabitants. Panel displayed by Sumitomo Chemical Organization of a Responsible Care Dialogue Meeting in Oita  68 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012Social Activities GRILA11 HR System That Inspires Greater Motivation     Sumitomo Chemical has introduced a personnel system that  allows highly motivated and capable employees to engage in  a range of challenging jobs, and that rewards those who have  made significant efforts and contributions to the Company  regardless of age, nationality, or gender.     This job (role)-based human resources (HR) system is man- aged and operated targeting both managerial and non- managerial employees. Evaluation System     Both managerial and non-managerial employees are evalu- ated not only for performance but also for competencies,  behavioral processes, and attitude. The aim of this system is  not merely the pursuit of short-term achievements, but rather  employee development and medium- to long-term corporate  development.     In the evaluation system, managers talk with their subor- dinates on a regular basis to help employees increase their  motivation and abilities by giving feedback not only on their  performance but also on the good points and points to be im- proved regarding their actions. Managers also talk with their  staff about workplace policies, what is expected of individual  members, and career plans, in order to help staff increase  their abilities and motivation. Compliance and CSR Evaluations     Compliance and CSR are included in the items evaluated for  non-managerial employees with a view to raising their com- pliance and CSR awareness. CSR evaluations focus on Respon- sible Care (safety, environment, and product quality). Revision of the HR System (1) Abolishing the area-limited employment arrangement     In April 2012, Sumitomo Chemical abolished the area-limit- ed employment arrangement.     Accordingly, those wanting to join the Company will be  required to sit in for either the Grade I employment examina- tion or Grade II employment examination, and an identical  HR system will be applied to all those who have joined the  Company. This will allow the new employees to display their  abilities without any limitation stemming from job type and  encourage them to work hard to assume higher positions and  more important roles.     The HR system was revised through the five meetings of  the HR system examination team and three rounds of labor- management negotiations. The HR system was introduced  to ensure that employees with high motivation and abilities  could engage in a range of challenging jobs, and that those  who had made efforts and contributions to the Company  would be appropriately treated. The revisions were made to  further enhance this system.     To ensure that all employees are aware of the purpose of  the revision, all managerial employees at all sites were briefed  on the matter, and they in turn explained relevant points to  non-managerial employees. (2) Revising the roles and grades of those in supervisory        positions     In addition to abolishing the area-limited employment ar- rangement, we also revised the roles and grades of those in  supervisory positions.     Supervisors are now required to play even more important  roles, including in safety management, and we have revised  their roles and grades accordingly in a manner that provides  them with higher motivation to fulfill their roles. Managerial  employees Grade IV Grade III Grade II Grade I Hand in Hand with Employees - Only for those working at     mfg. facilities, and - Managerial candidates - Playing higher-grade roles,  and - Evaluation of potential/    general abilities Grade II (or higher)  employment  examination Grade I employment  examination Roles and Grades Assigned under the HR System Promotion exam Promotion exam Employment exam Grade I  employment  exam. Grade II (or higher)  employment  exam. Description Those playing Grade I  roles as new employees  will be selected. Those playing Grade II or  higher roles as new  employees will be  selected. Period for the grade One year  (However, the  period may be  shortened depend- ing upon the past  experience of each  new employee.) Outline of the employment examinations  69 SUMITOMO CHEMICAL  CSR REPORT 2012 Governance Economic Activities Responsible Care Activities Social Activities GRILA8HR3HR4HR11 Managing the Physical and Mental Health of Employees and Giving Support to Their Social  Contribution Activities     Sumitomo Chemical is implementing a range of measures  to help employees maintain and promote their physical and  mental health with the assistance of the chief occupational  health physician of the Company. We are also improving the  working environment to support employees social contribu- tion activities in a more proactive manner. Mental Health     Employees are able to use the counseling services provided  by the in-house mental health facilities and also by external  specialist institutions.      In fiscal 2011, seminars on caring for mental health were  held for new employees and newly promoted employees, and  stratified training seminars were also organized for sectional  managers and team leaders.     In addition, in order to help employees who have been  absent from work for extended periods due to mental health  problems return to work, we introduced a rehabilitation work  system in April 2009. Under this system, an onsite occupation- al health physician, an HR staff member, and the employees  manager cooperate in helping the employee start working  again by determining the working days, hours, and other de- tails for the employee. Physical Health     Since April 2008, the health insurance associations of com- panies have been required by law to have all employees and  their dependents aged 40 or older undergo health checkups  and receive guidance for lifestyle-related disease. Sumitomo  Chemical works with its health insurance association to ensure  that all employees and their dependents undergo the health  checkups, regardless of age, and employees and their depen- dents aged 35 or older receive guidance for lifestyle-related  disease, thereby helping employees with early diagnosis and  the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases.     In fiscal 2011, the Company dispatched its chief occupational  health physician to provide medical counseling and evaluate  the medical service environment to Saudi Arabia twice and to  China, Singapore, India, the United States, and Europe once  each to provide support for employees working overseas and  their families. Participating in the TABLE FOR TWO Program      Sumitomo Chemical has been participating in the TABLE  FOR TWO program since May 2008 to promote employees  health and contribute to society. The Company serves healthy  menu options at the cafeterias at its sites according to the  criteria set down by the TABLE FOR TWO (TFT) organization.  When employees choose to eat any of the healthy meals, 20  yen per meal is donated to the TFT secretariat and the money  is used to pay for a school lunch for one child in an African  country. In this way the Company is helping to alleviate hun- ger in Africa while also helping employees avoid obesity and  lifestyle-related diseases at the same time.     Furthermore, as a Matching Gift, the Company makes a do- nation to the TFT secretariat matching employees donations,  and donations to this organization totaled 11,673,600 yen as  of the end of March 2012. Volunteer Leave System     To provide support to employees social contribution activi- ties, we have instituted a volunteer leave system that enables  employees to take paid volunteer leave up to two consecutive  working days per year. Since launching this system in April  2008, 44 employees have made use of it (for a total of 103  days) as of the end of March 2012. Protection of Human Rights     To educate employees on human rights issues and respon- sible behavior, Sumitomo Chemical holds a commitee on hu- man rights every year, formulates annual policies on human  rights, and implements measures to protect human rights.    Moreover, based on the concept of providing employees  with workplaces where they can display their abilities with  ease of mind, we are addressing the issues of sexual harass- ment and power abuse, in addition to discrimination, mainly  by holding enlightenment seminars. In fiscal 2011, we held a  total of 171 seminars, lectures, and film shows as a part of the  in-house training curriculum, in which a total of 3,360 employ- ees participated.    In addition, to ensure employee awareness of the importance  of respecting human rights, this subject was included in the  compliance manual (see page 22), which was distributed to all em- ployees.    In fiscal 2011 as in previous fiscal years, no reports of discrimina- tion were received within the company.

To this  end we are implementing measures focusing on providing  female employees with more opportunities to display their  abilities.     To promote diversity, it is essential to provide all employees  with comfortable workplaces where they can make the most  of their skills and abilities in a variety of situations. To meet  this requirement, Sumitomo Chemical is also implementing  work-life balance-related measures to help employees make  their private and business lives compatible and lead sound  and fulfilling lives. Establishing the Diversity Promotion Office and the Labor- Management Committee for Diversity and Work-Life Balance     In order to work on diversity issues on a full scale, we estab- lished the Diversity Promotion Office in April 2010 within the  company. Additionally, believing that measures for diversity  and work-life balance need to be fostered based on the un- derstanding of employees of all ranks, since November 2010  we have been holding meetings of the Labor-Management  Committee for Diversity and Work-Life Balance, which is com- posed of representatives of the labor union and the Company  and several female employees. The committee holds discus- sions on a range of themes, including how to help female  employees display more of their abilities and how to improve  work-life balance, and examines specific measures to be im- plemented to this effect.     As a result of these activities, Sumitomo Chemical was  ranked No. 40 among 465 companies in Nikkei Inc.s list of  companies that provide a comfortable workplace. Initiatives in Fiscal 2011 (1) Helping employees continue working     In order to help employees who are facing great changes  in their lives, including those requiring childcare and nursing  care, we substantially revised our relevant support systems  in April 2011. Specifically, we enacted the following initiatives:  extended the childcare leave period and partially introduced  paid holidays to the system, newly established a leave system  to support male employees participating in childcare, relaxed  limits on the frequency of applications for childcare/nursing  care leave, and also relaxed application criteria for the mater- nity leave system. We have thus been improving the working  environment to help employees continue working even during  pregnancy, childbirth, and while taking care of their children or  other family members.     Moreover, in April 2012, we published a work-life-balance  guidebook with easy-to-understand explanations about the  Companys support systems in place for pregnancy, childbirth,  childcare and nursing care, and the procedures to be taken to  utilize these systems so that employees can use them more ef- fectively. (2) Measures to improve work-life-balance     Sumitomo Chemical is conducting activities to help employ- ees work with high efficiency while also ensuring that they  enjoy their private lives. Specifically, we are allocating paid holi- days to employees in a systematic manner and ensuring that  each of our sites and workplaces designate a work-life balance  days (also named refreshment day) at least once a week, on  which no overtime is required of employees.     Also to increase the effectiveness of work-life balance pro- motion measures, we have designated May and November as  work-life balance promotion months. During these months,  we post awareness-raising posters at each workplace. And on  the work-life balance days in the months we conduct patrols  of the workplaces, we urge employees to not work overtime.     Further, to check the work-life balance awareness level of  employees and increase the effectiveness of related measures  to enforce them, we collect data on work-life balance indicators  from each workplace every six months, including total over- time work hours, number of employees who worked longer  hours, and the percentage of employees taking paid holidays. GRI3.94.15 Systems and Measures for Better Work-Life Balance  Available until the end of the first April following the childs third birthday (without limits on the frequency of use).

In addition to the facilities established since  fiscal 2008 in Ehime, Osaka, and Chiba, we opened the fourth  one, named Sumika Kids Tokyo, at the head office in Tokyo  in August 2010. We will also open another within the research  laboratory in Takarazuka in April 2013.     At all our in-house childcare facilities, pre-school aged chil- dren, including infants in their first year (of mothers who have  returned to work) are taken care of until 8:00 p.m. or even  only for several hours in response to the needs of their par- ents. Some facilities also accept children of local residents to  contribute to resolving the serious social problem concerning  the long waiting lists for nursery schools. As of April 1, 2012, a  total of 112 children are taken care of at the in-house childcare  facilities. GRILA11LA13 Diversified Employment      Sumitomo Chemical looks for and recruits talented people,  regardless of age, gender, or nationality in a wide range of  areas, and a diverse spectrum of people are working in the  Company. In fiscal 2011, the Company recruited 28 foreign  nationals and 76 women. We are also committed to providing  employees with a workplace in which they feel comfortable  working, regardless of nationality or gender, and an increas- ing number of people feel able to exercise their talents at the  Company. Employment of People with Disabilities      In fiscal 2011, the employment rate of people with disabili- ties at Sumitomo Chemical totaled 1.87%. In view that the  Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfares Labour Policy Council  approved raising the statutory employment rate of people  with disabilities from the current 1.80% to 2.0% by April 2013  for companies in the private sector, we are continuing to  foster the employment of people with disabilities. When we  accept them, we assign them to suitable work, and modify the  workplace where necessary so that they can make the most of  their abilities. Reemployment System      Since fiscal 2006, Sumitomo Chemical has been implement- ing a system to reemploy retirees to provide them with op- portunities to demonstrate the skills and expertise they have  gained through working for the Company. In fiscal 2011, 93  (66.9%) of 139 retirees (of Sumitomo Chemical) were reem- ployed by the Company or its Group companies.     Moreover, to help employees make plans for their post- retirement lives, we provide all employees reaching the age of  50 with a seminar on life design. In addition, employees talk  with their managers on their post-retirement lives on three  occasions—when they reach the age of 55, 57, and 59.     I returned to the workplace after taking maternity and child- care leave. During the leave period, I was able to spend much  time with my child, observing development day by day. It was a  precious experience for me. At present, I am working under the  reduced working hour system. I am devising measures to work  more efficiently, while trying to share information with those  around me. At home, I use a cleaning robot and prepare frozen  food wisely in order to have more time to spend with my child.

Labor-Management Initiatives     At Sumitomo Chemical, central labor-management meet- ings and regional labor-management meetings are held semi- annually for the parties to exchange opinions. The Company  and its labor union also hold meetings to discuss and formu- late various programs for non-managerial employees to en- able them to increase their morale and motivation at work.     Through the Labor-Management Committee for Diversity  and Work-Life Balance established in fiscal 2010, we have been  promoting labor management discussions on relevant issues,  including future challenges and measures.     Moreover, the Company and its labor union are cooperating  in supporting the anti-global warming measures and social  contribution activities initiated by employees. Social Contribution Activities Promoted through Labor-Management Cooperation (1) Promoting CO2 emissions reduction in the household     As one of the activities conducted based on labor-manage- ment cooperation, since fiscal 2008, Sumitomo Chemical has  been implementing a campaign to encourage employees to  reduce CO2 emissions at home to prevent global warming,  along with distributing its own Environmental Accounting  Book to employees. In February 2012, we completely rede- signed the accounting book so that employees could start  using it more easily and whenever they wished. Among em- ployees who use the book to reduce their CO2 emissions at  home, those who achieve outstanding results are commend- ed by the Company. In recognition of this effort, in fiscal 2011  the Company received its third consecutive prize for energy  conservation activities for consumer products from the Japan  Chemical Industry Association. (2) Matching Gift program      In fiscal 2007, Sumitomo Chemical started its Matching Gift  program jointly with its labor union. In this program, dona- tions are made by employees and executives of Sumitomo  Chemical Group companies, and Sumitomo Chemical matches  the amount collected. The total is then donated to the organi- zations selected as recipients.     In fiscal 2011, we donated to ASHINAGA*1, a NPO, as part  of our support for childcare and education. We also made  a donation to the Organization for Industrial, Spiritual and  Cultural Advancement-International (OISCA)*2 to support its  tree-planting activities as part of our support for global envi- ronmental protection and the prevention of global warming.  Specifically, employees and executives donated 6,636,816 yen  and 7,164,924 yen to ASHINAGA and OISCA, respectively and  the Company also donated the matched amount to the orga- nizations. (3) Mangrove planting project in Thailand       (Sumitomo Chemicals Forest)     Sumitomo Chemical and its Group companies have been  conducting a mangrove planting project in cooperation with  OISCA in Ranong Province, Thailand, using part of the money  donated to the NGO through the Matching Gift program,  starting in fiscal 2008. At the activity site, called Sumitomo  Chemicals Forest, local people play a central role, planting  trees and managing related activities. Since fiscal 2008, Sumi- tomo Chemical has been dispatching employee volunteers to  the site. In February 2012, 12 employees made exchanges with  the local inhabitants and together planted 10,000 mangrove  trees. At present, Sumitomo Chemicals Forest extends over  95 hectares and contains about 200,000 mangrove trees. In  March 2012, the Executive Vice President of the Company and  the president of the Workers Union visited the site in Thailand  to see the progress of the project.     In 2011, the Sumitomo Chemical Group and the Workers  Union received a special commendation from OISCA in recog- nition of this support activity. We will continue to support tree  planting activities as a means to conserve biodiversity and  prevent global warming. GRI4.44.16 Environmental  Accounting Book *1. ASHINAGA is a NPO established to provide physical and mental support for children  who have lost their parents because of illness, accidents, or for other reasons. The money  donated to this organization is used to provide a scholarship fund for these orphans. *2. OISCA is a global NGO engaged in rural development and environmental protection  mainly in the Asia-Pacific region. The money donated by Sumitomo Chemical to this orga- nization is used for its Childrens Forest Program and to plant mangrove trees in Ranong,  Thailand.     In February 2012, I participated in planting activities in Thailand  as a member of the labor unions secretariat. In planting trees  together with the local inhabitants and children, visiting local  schools and staying at the house of one of the locals, I felt strong- ly that Sumitomo Chemicals Forest provided us with an opportu- nity to make face-to-face communications with the local people  and foster mutual development.  The activity also provides partici- pating employees with an oppor- tunity to deepen their emotional  ties with each other. I believe it is  an activity that is worth continu- ing through labor-management  cooperation.

Of the Groups consolidated  sales, overseas sales accounted for 51.8% in fiscal 2011, and  this share will continue to increase in the future. The share  of overseas production is also expected to increase from the  present level of 40%.       Under these circumstances, Sumitomo Chemical attributes  importance to securing, managing, and developing human  resources that can support and foster the globalization of  its business. The Company aims to achieve right-person-in- the-right place employment across the globe, regardless of  age, gender, or nationality, and to attain this final goal, we are  implementing a range of measures.  Number of Global Position Holders (GPHs)      As the first step in fostering global personnel measures, we  have begun to enhance the development of managers who  can support the global business operations of the Company.  For the sustainable global development of the Company, it is  indeed essential to secure human resources that possess the  abilities to lead management of its overseas subsidiaries.     Based on this idea, Sumitomo Chemical began identifying  global key positions within the Group in 2005. Since then, we  have been developing human resources with sufficient ability  to take on positions as global position holders by organiz- ing international conferences, standardizing the performance  evaluation system, and fostering the sharing of our corporate  visions and values. The number of global position holders,  initially at 40, increased to 81 in January 2012, of which about  60% are non-Japanese. Standardizing Grading Globally     Sumitomo Chemical is also focusing on identifying and  developing employees who can be next-generation leaders,  in addition to enhancing the development of managers at its  overseas Group companies.      As a first step, the Company is utilizing information on em- ployees of overseas Sumitomo Chemical Group companies,  including their positions and other personnel data. These  data are centrally managed in a global database created to  manage the performance of the managers of the Group com- panies based on the same management indicators as those  used inside the Company. Based on the obtained information,  human resources with high potential will be identified and  transferred across the Group beyond departmental and na- tional boundaries and given a range of training and education  to acquire the abilities necessary to become global position  holders. We believe that repeating the cycle of performance  evaluation, identification of excellent human resources, and  education and development of such resources will lead to  business operations that are more sustainable and global in  nature. Development of Global Talent  (1) Training seminar on global business communication skills     In fiscal 2011, a total of 110 young Japanese employees who  were expected to become global leaders attended a training  seminar to develop and improve their business communica- tion skills in English, including those who received the training  for the first time.  (2) Training of local managers of overseas Group companies     As a means to identify and develop global human resources  in a systematic manner, we have been providing local manag- ers of overseas Sumitomo Chemical Group companies with  training since fiscal 2010, aiming to help them understand the  Groups management philosophy and values and to become  more aware of their roles as members of the Group.     As of the end of fiscal 2011, this training was provided a total  of 15 times in four regions (Singapore, North America, Europe  and China) under the leadership of the corporate branches es- tablished within each respective region, and with the partici- pation of 270 managers in total. We will continue to provide  this training in fiscal 2012 and onwards. (3) Establishment of a training center in Singapore     In order to foster the development of next-generation  global leaders, we established a training center in Singapore,  which is the location of one of our corporate branches, in  January 2012. At the center, we plan to provide training to our  overseas local managers, hold Sumitomo Chemical training  seminars, and organize corporate branch seminars in consid- eration of the needs of Group companies in Southeast Asia.

We also proactively accept internship  students from overseas universities and continue to imple- ment a range of global employment measures.     Since April 2, 2012, following the abolishment of the area- limited employment arrangement (see page 68), we have  been selecting new employees in line with the grade system  that would be applied to them after joining the Company.      The entrance ceremony and training of new employees,  which had previously been held both at the Head Office in  Tokyo and other sites based on the area-limited employment  arrangement, were decided  in principle to be held only  at the Head Office in Tokyo  in and after April 2012. Human Resources Development Program     Sumitomo Chemical has been implementing a range of pro- grams and measures to help talented human resources fully  exhibit their abilities. In fiscal 2011, the Company provided  employees of different job grades with necessary training and  implemented measures according to their positions, to meet  the following important targets: (1) Planned development of global leaders who will play a  central management role (2) Smooth inter-generational transfer of technologies and  skills that support its business (3) Support in strengthening workplace management (4) Support for employees in acquiring and developing the  knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary for their job  grades CDS (Training Rotation System)      Sumitomo Chemical has been carrying out systematic train- ing rotations of all non-managerial employees and some man- agers to ensure that individuals are placed in the positions for  which they are most suited. Under this system, we are using  GRILA11 the preferences submitted by employees and the develop- ment plans made by their managers to help employees plan  and develop their ideal careers.     Training rotation plans were made and implemented for  880 employees and for 582 employees in fiscal 2010 and fiscal  2011, respectively.      In addition we provided employees to whom the training  rotation system was applied with career development train- ing to give them opportunities to look back on their past jobs  and get some tips for future career development.     Moreover, in August 2010, Sumitomo Chemical created  training guidelines for employees, to which they can refer in  considering what abilities they should develop in the field for  which they are most suited or in which they desire to work in  the future.     The guidelines, which clearly show the knowledge, skills,  reference materials, and training necessary for each job type,  are available to all employees. Mentor and Trainer Systems      Sumitomo Chemical introduced a Trainer System in Janu- ary 2008, under which highly skilled employees who have an  aptitude for teaching are certified as trainers. These trainers  provide instructions and advice to younger employees to fa- cilitate their development and ensure the succession of skills  from generation to generation.     In April 2010, we also introduced a Mentor System to give  supervisors and potential supervisors on-the-job training. We  are using this system to enhance the development of core tal- ent for manufacturing departments.     As of April 2012, a total of 80 employees and six employees  have been certified as trainers and mentors, respectively,  throughout the Company.     I was certified as a mentor in April 2011 and have since been giv- ing instructions to supervisors of the manufacturing facilities to  help them improve their abilities. In the face of changes with the  times, I am serving as a mentor with high motivation, encouraged  by an increase in the number of supervisors who understand the  important points of my instructions. I will continue to provide in- structions to develop supervi- sors who can take appropriate  responses toward the future,  which will certainly be fraught  with more difficulties.

Addition- ally, Sumitomo Chemical has updated its Eco First  commitment to the Ministry of the Environment, en- hanced the functions of the comprehensive chemi- cal management systems (SuCCESS), and began sell- ing a product providing functionality similar to the  Olyset Net for general consumers in Kenya in order  to help control malaria as well as contribute to local  economic development and employment creation.  The Company is thus fostering CSR activities through  its core business activities.      In this CSR report, the Company has disclosed in- formation in a more substantive manner, particularly  concerning human rights, society and product re- sponsibility in reference to the issues we pointed out  last year, and based on the GRI guidelines. Regard- ing local contribution activities, the Company has  begun to disclose more information on the activities  of both domestic and overseas Group companies in  addition to information on its own activities. This is  proof of the Companys commitment to disclosing  more useful information to the Groups stakeholders  around the world and is indeed significant.      Regarding the scope of information disclosed on  each indicator, most of the information disclosed  concerning social performance indicators comes  from Sumitomo Chemical. Information on environ- mental performance indicators includes that from  domestic Group companies but excludes that from  overseas Group companies. It is desirable that the  scope of information disclosure will further be  broadened for all indicators so that the entire Sumi- tomo Chemical Groups situation, including that of domestic and overseas Group companies, will be communicated to the  public in an easy-to-understand manner through its CSR report.      During our assurance procedures, it was revealed that not all tabulation rules were followed on environmental performance  and environmental accounting indicators and that tabulation results needed to be modified for some sites and subsidiaries of  the Company due to constraints caused by limited allocation of human resources to the tabulation work. These errors were  corrected during the assurance service period; however, it is indeed necessary that the Company improve its tabulation manu- al, make all those concerned well aware of the details, and digitize the tabulation work to ensure correct tabulation despite the  constraints of limited human resources.      For the Sumitomo Chemical Group, the share of overseas sales has now exceeded 50%. In its Three-Year Corporate Business  Plan, the Company upholds the slogan, Achieve sustainable strong growth as a stronger, more innovative global company as  its corporate vision. It is expected that the Company will further globalize its information disclosure activities and will continue  and expand its CSR initiatives to support its management foundation.
