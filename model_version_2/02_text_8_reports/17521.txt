ceos message Dear Stakeholders,  As the new Chief Executive Officer of Noble Group, I am pleased to confirm Nobles continued support of the  UN Global Compact and its ten principles in respect to human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.  Over the past two years these principles have started to become part of Nobles way of conducting business. As examples  of this commitment an increasing number of Noble businesses have undertaken initiatives to support local communities  in a range of ways, with special emphasis on education. An increasing number of our supply chains have developed  customized products that are certified carbon neutral. These actions demonstrate that the principles that form the  basis of the UN Global Compact are not simply mission statements but are put into action by Noble. I feel it is important to stress that as a participant in the markets for numerous natural resources, we are conscious of the need to carefully  develop and maintain sustainable supply chains. Many of the industries we are involved in require care and attention to ensure they will be  productive for Noble, our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate in the long run. At a time of heightened social and economic instability, environmental challenges and climate change all companies must endeavor to do  their best to try and create a business environment that is sustainable to all stakeholders. This is in many respects what we believe the  UN Global Compact aims to encourage and at Noble we are fully committed to this goal.     Yusuf Alireza Chief Executive Officer 2 Who we are and what we do Noble Group manages a global supply chain of agricultural, energy, metals and mineral  resources. Noble operates from over 140 locations, employing more than 70 nationalities.  Noble manages a diversified portfolio of essential raw materials, integrating the sourcing,  marketing, processing, financing and transportation of these products. The Group also  owns and manages a number of strategic assets which assist in sourcing resources from  low cost producers, such as Brazil, Argentina, Australia and Indonesia. These are supplied  to high demand and growth markets, including China, India and the Middle East.   Today, Noble has interests in grain crushing facilities, coal and iron ore mines, fuel  terminals and storage facilities, sugar and ethanol plants, ports, vessels and other key  infrastructure, ensuring that high quality products are delivered to our customers in  the most efficient and timely manner. Implementation of the 10 principles into company life This issue of Communication on Progress (COP) marks the second year of Noble Groups  commitment to the UN Global Compact. In the past 12 months, we have continued  implementing the 10 universal principles of the UN Global Compact into our commodity  supply chain business. We have engaged and invested in various community projects and  initiatives to foster our relationship in the locations from which we operate. We have aligned  the eligibility criteria for our Noble Groups Charity Foundation at the Group level and  many of our local operations have continued to establish initiatives to support those in need.   Noble advocates policies and actions to advance broader UN goals and issues both  internally and externally. In January, Mr. Richard Elman, Executive Chairman, took  part in a discussion panel on sustainable growth at the annual Asian Financial Forum.  The discussion shed light on the challenges associated with anticipated growth in  demand for energy and raw materials, and the opportunities to adopt eco-friendly  technologies and solutions early in development. Our actions and approach towards  sustainability are reflected in the following passage from the introductory speech  delivered by Mr. Elman: Prevention is easier than a cure. It will be far more expensive  to try and adapt to serious climate change than to reduce our impact in the first place.  We cant control nature, but we can control our impact on it. At a regional level, our engagement with the Global Compact Local Network  aspires to make progress in addressing critical issues within the region. Noble Groups Global Strategy Meeting in 2011 continued to stimulate strategic  discussion among Nobles senior management of ways in which to further  promote the UN Global Compacts principles.  Our commitment to the UN Global Compact Principles assists us in bringing  focus to crucial CSR standards and provide a guideline for their integration into  Nobles business operations. This Communication on Progress (COP) describes  the progress we have made implementing these 10 principles in the areas of  human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. The document also  provides an overview of our commitment to the UN Global Compact and the  relevance of the specific principles for Noble. This is accompanied by a brief  description of our policies and systems, as well as our activities and their outcome  and impact on our day-to-day business. introduction  4 Our Commitment Noble is committed to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our Code of Conduct – and other Group Policies - demand that all Noble  employees comply with the law in every jurisdiction in which we operate and  apply to all employees of the Group and each of its subsidiaries directors,  officers and employees. The Code and other Policies set out principles to guide  employees in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. These principles  require the highest standards of personal and corporate integrity when   dealing on behalf of the Group with its customers, suppliers, competitors   and the community. Human rights are high on our agenda; we uphold them always and often go  beyond the legislative requirements. We invest in real actions to address issues such  as education, health and safety, water and sanitation in communities in need. We do  not tolerate human rights abuses within the scope of our business operations. Supporting Human Rights in Nobles policies and actions At Noble, every new employee attends an induction workshop to learn about  our company culture, rules and regulations, as well as our company principles.  Hence, all employees are informed about their rights as reflected under existing  policies, which are updated on a regular basis. In our offices, education on  business ethics and conduct are regularly held in order to affirm the procedures   for reporting any such violations in the workplace. At the Group level, we have a dedicated team conducting systematic internal  audits across all our operations and assets. In addition to ensuring compliance  with national requirements, the team also makes certain that all locations are  adhering to the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact. Any risks identified are  included in a review report and presented to the Operations Head for further action. When we acquire a new asset, any past, current or potential future liabilities and  breaches of human rights are investigated as part of the legal due diligence we conduct. human rights Businesses should support and respect the protection  of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 1 make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Principle 2  6 We address basic needs such as health and education, while always  encouraging our local employees to engage and contribute. This non-profit organization based in Jakarta,  Indonesia focuses in youth development by  supporting access to education and economic  assistance.  The HOpE program provides micro loans  to female micro entrepreneurs on the condition that  they put their children in school. The project aims  to create a stable income to the families of these  students so they can focus on their studies. Noble has  committed to supporting the micro loan program for  three years. YCAB Foundation – Hands-on Operation for  Entrepreneurship (HOpE) Safety is our top priority. Noble Group focuses on  creating a work environment with zero accidents.  By coaching and improving employee engagement,  Noble has transformed the view of workplace safety  from being simply a compliance regulation to safety  being an integral part of the company culture.  In Nobles Chinese processing plants in Qinzhou and  Longkou, we have recently reached a milestone in safety:  operating for more than one million safe working hours.  Furthermore, Nobles other plants in China are not far behind.  One million is the interim target and sustained effort is put into  safeguarding the health and wellbeing of our workforce. Occupational safety at Nobles Chinese  soybean processing plants When we expand our supply chains into new territories, valuable investments  are also made in infrastructure improvements which often bring economic and social  wellbeing in impoverished regions within countries such as in Argentina,  Brazil, China, India and Indonesia. Furthermore, across all locations Noble  remunerates employees at least at the level of the minimum wage.  We are fully aware that we operate in some regions that have a history of difficult  relations between resource extraction, farming industries and indigenous peoples.   However we endeavor to address these issues and concerns by building relationships  with local communities. We are pleased to report that in 2011/2012 we received no formal  complaints of any violations of the rights of indigenous peoples. Furthermore, with many of our community investment projects, which are  often  initiated by our local operations, we address basic needs such as health and education,  while always encouraging our local employees to engage and contribute. An example  of a community project to empower women is illustrated below. Building on Nobles Group-wide health and safety assessment conducted in 2011,   we maintain our ongoing commitment to control risks and improve safety performance  in all of our assets and operations. One of our largest assets, the oilseed processing  facility and port terminal in Timbes, Argentina, was recently certified for compliance  with OHSAS 18000 Standard, a management system that ensures high levels   of occupational health and safety. Globally, we have a good safety record and in  most locations we have had no reported injuries or workplace illnesses. An example  of our safety achievements is illustrated below.  8 labour Our Commitment  Nobles Code of Conduct sets forth the requirements for compliance as well as the  guidelines on the key labour issues, which are an integral part of the principles  advocated in the UN Global Compact.  We support the freedom of association and collective bargaining for our  employees in the countries we operate in and diligently comply with local labour  laws and regulations.  At Noble, any kind of forced or compulsory labour is not tolerated and we do not  exploit child labour in any of our global operations. We value diversity at every level of our organization and respect the rights  of our 14,000 employees of more than 70 nationalities in almost 40 countries  around the world. Our Equal Opportunities Policy applies to every employee in  the Group and commits Noble to eliminating discrimination, harassment and  victimization at the workplace.  Implementation of Labour Standards in Nobles policies and actions We have clear policies and training practices to combat discrimination. In our  offices, education on business ethics and conduct is undertaken. Our employees  receive mandatory training on workplace conduct on a regular basis. No forms of  discrimination are tolerated and we encourage and promote procedures for reporting  any unwelcome attitudes in the workplace. In 2011/2012 we received no credible  complaints of discrimination in any of our locations. The Group is committed to a high standard of ethical conduct and our  managers are responsible for ensuring that the Equal Opportunities Policy  and other labour principles are adhered to in their departments. Noble has  adopted and implemented a whistle-blowing policy where employees may,  in confidence, raise concerns on possible corporate improprieties in matters  of unlawful activity, policy or practices, suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest  practices or other similar matters. There are also arrangements in place   for an independent investigation of such issues and for appropriate follow   up action where necessary. Moreover, appraisal procedures are in place   that focus on employees development and succession planning and ensure  management engagement. Many Noble employees, especially in countries such as Brazil, Argentina and China  where key installations are located, are represented by trade unions. Our employees  are represented by a number of different trade unions or similar bodies, and we respect  and cooperate with these bodies.  Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the  effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 3 the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 5 the elimination of all forms of forced and   compulsory labour; Principle 4 the elimination of discrimination in respect of  employment and occupation. Principle 6  10 In some countries in which we operate, we are under collective agreements  with unions, which stipulate labour conditions and eliminate any kind of forced  or compulsory labour. 63% of our employees are covered by such collective  bargaining agreements.  When we undertake investments in new assets, labour-related risks and compliance  with local labour laws and regulations form part of our due diligence and risk analysis.  At Noble, we recognize the strong correlation between poverty and child labour.  Limited access to quality education for minors jeopardizes the childrens future and  hence Noble invests and supports initiatives in regions at risk. In line with our business growth, we have continued to expand our trainee  programmes, building on the structured apprenticeship approach in three areas:  product trainees, corporate and industrial trainees. Through last years office-wide  initiative, working with managers to identify high potential individuals in their teams,  more than 120 employees worldwide were identified as having high potential, leading  to more than 30 job promotions and additional training and coaching. We also  increased the hours of training for Nobles employees in our sugar mills in Brazil.  286,822 hours of technical, safety, and leadership training were provided to employees  in the first half of 2012 alone. Noble Cocoa believes that integrating sustainability  into business practices is essential to secure the long  term supply of cocoa and to maintain a profitable  cocoa business. Helping farmers to improve their  livelihoods through increased revenue from better crop  yields and quality will ensure that cocoa is grown in  sustainable ways that safeguard the environment and  build long term value throughout the supply chain. Our Code for Responsible Sourcing aims to achieve  the highest possible social and environmental  standards in all our operations and also our suppliers  business operations. This guarantees compliance with  international labour regulations and addresses key  issues facing cocoa farming communities. To date, we have empowered over 2500 farmers  in Cte dIvoire,  training them in good agricultural  practices and the UTZ CERTIFIED Code of Conduct –  the leading certification programme for sustainable  cocoa production – to improve the overall productivity  and quality of their cocoa, enabling them to increase  their incomes and improve their standard of living.  Responsible Cocoa Sourcing 286,822 hours of technical, safety,  and leadership training were  provided to employees in the first  half of 2012 alone. Initiated by the President of Brazil in 2008, the National  Commitment to Labour Conditions in the sugarcane  industry seeks to guarantee new rights and better quality  of life for its workers.  The Commitment serves as the basis for initiating  public and private actions to improve working  conditions. It includes public programmes and policies  to protect workers; models of good business practice  in sugar and ethanol production units, as well as an  emphasis on workers remuneration, health and safety  and union activities.  Nobles commitment to offer competitive products  while ensuring workers rights has earned its four  sugar mills – Meridiano, Catanduva, Potirendaba and  Sebastianopolis – certifications for recognizing the  National Commitment. We seek to play a positive role in this region and  support local community projects. Last year Noble  Bioenergia partnered with the Votuporanga municipality  to upgrade a health clinic in Vila Amrica, and  constructed two new health clinics in the Cana and  Cecap II neighbourhoods. Every year, Noble offers  horticulture lessons and literacy classes for rural workers  and through various partnership programs, we provide  financial support to help children to meet their nutritional  needs and develop knowledge and skills. Nobles sugar mills awarded for Labour Conditions  12 12 environment supports a precautionary approach to the environmental challenge posed by climate  change. Furthermore, Noble Group supports the development and diffusion of  environmentally friendly technologies in various areas of its business. Implementing measures to protect the environment  All Noble employees are encouraged to reduce the environmental footprint of the  company by controlling their resource usage, including energy, water and paper.  In addition, environmental performance data with regards to CO2 emissions in  our offices are collected and assessed for our Group-wide carbon neutral project.  These results are certified independently. At the asset level, environmental impact assessments are conducted according to legal  regulations and principles before we purchase new installations. Various environmental  policies exist onsite at our assets. For example, our Australian coal mines, Timbes oilseed  processing complex and our Chinese crushing mills operate based on the principles of the  environmental management system ISO14001; monitoring systems are in place for water,  air quality, biodiversity, soil, and noise management.         At various assets, Noble has invested in climate-friendly renewable energy technology.  A key investment realized this year was a bio-diesel plant Noble procured for one of  its crushing plants in Argentina. Soybean oil produced onsite will provide the  Our Commitment As our business relies on the availability of natural resources, Noble promotes  environmental responsibility. We are committed to protecting sensitive and  important areas of the worlds ecosystems, despite our business being confronted  by an array of environmental challenges, including water and air pollution,  biodiversity and resource depletion amongst others. In particular, the company  Businesses should support a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges; Principle 7 encourage the development and diffusion of  environmentally friendly technologies. Principle 9 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental  responsibility; and Principle 8  14 energy feedstock for the plant. Several investments kick-started last year for  example, biomass-fired cogeneration units in Argentina, Brazil and the Ukraine  have been continued.  In expanding its owned fleet of ships to meet the growing demands of its  integrated supply chain strategy, Noble is acquiring and building ships that  are more energy efficient. Noble has also adopted a Vessel/Barge Chartering  and Vetting Policy, the purpose of which is to ensure that all vessels chartered  for the transportation of petroleum, petroleum products, chemicals and LPG  meet certain specified criteria and undergo screening by external vetting  experts. Noble has also adopted an Emergency Oil Spill Response Plan to  ensure that, in the unfortunate event of an oil spill involving one of its  vessels or terminals, it is able to respond in an immediate, effective and  responsible manner. Our state-of-the-art liquid bulk storage terminal at Botlek Tank Terminal  in the Netherlands operates virtually emission free - vapours from loading are  recovered to protect both product value and environmental impact. Since the inception of Noble Groups Carbon Neutral Project, more than  735,000 tonnes of CO2 have been offset with carbon credits generated  from renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. chain from Cte dIvoire last year to create a new product: Carbon Neutral Cocoa from  Cte dIvoire. Since the inception of Noble Groups Carbon Neutral Project, more than  735,000 tonnes of CO2 have been offset with carbon credits generated from renewable  energy and energy efficiency projects in India, China and America.  Furthermore, for its first response to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2011,  Noble achieved the second highest score for carbon emissions disclosure in Asia   (ex-Japan). In our submission, we reported on the Noble Groups greenhouse gas  emissions and all risks and opportunities related to climate change. The total Scope  1 and 2 emissions combined amounted to 2,765,523 metric tonnes CO2e, an increase  of 9.5% compared to the base year. The overall increase in absolute emissions for  scope 1 and scope 2 reflects the growth of the company and its expansion in asset  investments. It is worthy to note that our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions figures were  verified to confirm their completeness and accuracy. Nobles signing and participation   in the CDP has brought a fresh focus to managing the risks and opportunities presented  by climate change to our operations, leading to the incorporation of new initiatives to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions into our overall business strategy.  El Carmen, a private trans-boundary nature reserve  along the border between Mexico and the United States,  is considered one of the five great wilderness  ecosystems of the world. It is home to more than  500 species of plants, over 200 species of birds,  80 species of mammals, and 65 species of  reptiles and amphibians.  In an effort to protect  this ecosystem and restore natural habitats,  Noble Group entered an agreement in February  2012 with Cemex, a building materials company,  to collaborate in biodiversity and conservation  efforts at El Carmen Mountains. El Carmen - Transboundary Biodiversity  Conservation Initiative In addition, Noble Groups Clean Fuels Division is dedicated to provide solutions  to alternative fuel sources while reducing environmental impacts. Noble is active in  distributing bio-fuels and diversifying our energy assets in the clean fuels sector.  Nobles integrated supply chain strategy capitalizes on the rising regional demand and  shifts in consumption patterns to clean fuels. Noble also partners with NGOs, for example, Civic Exchange in Hong Kong, to  draw in scientific expertise in researching risks and potential adaptation measures to  environmental issues. Since 2007 Noble Group has supported the efforts of the World  Wildlife Fund (WWF). WWF Hong Kong engages in the preservation of nature  reserves in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta regions. We have also expanded our activities in the area of climate change mitigation.  Nobles Carbon Neutral project was initiated in 2007 with the aim of driving the  company step-by-step towards carbon neutrality. In 2011, Nobles beneficiary ships,  all Noble offices worldwide, Nobles publications and top management events again  achieved carbon neutrality. After carrying out a similar exercise for our coffee supply  chain in Brazil, we calculated the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of our cocoa supply   16 16 anti-corruption Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms,  including extortion and bribery. Principle 10 Our Commitment Noble is against any form of corruption. It is our policy not to engage in any   form of corruption, bribery or anti-trust behavior, nor to violate fair competition.   We acknowledge our actions are constantly under scrutiny. Our core values of  being accountable and responsible extend to our shared commitment to prevent  fraud and corruption.    Precautionary measures to prevent corruption Noble has an experienced Compliance Team which is dedicated to ensuring that Nobles  business is undertaken in conformity with applicable laws and regulations.

Our Group-wide policies with respect to anti-corruption, anti-trust, anti-money  laundering, combating financial crime, terrorist financing, sanctions and fraud are  outlined in detail in Nobles Code of Conduct. Specific rules on security trading when  in possession of internal, confidential information are circulated among our employees  regularly and set out in a separate policy.  All Noble employees worldwide are given explicit guidance on ethical business  practices, such as conflicts of interest, entertainment and gifts. Their  acknowledgment is part of the induction process mandatory for every new employee  joining the company. As part of our global compliance training to enforce  ethical behavior, in 2012 Noble is organizing seminars  on commodity market abuse compliance across  our main trading centres.  The training was/is held  by our compliance officers for traders and managers  exposed to such risks - already more than 800  employees have attended the course. The trainings  refresh legal guidance in both the EU and the US,  including an introduction to specific EU Gas & Power  sector requirements and regulatory obligations when  engaging in futures commodity trading in the US.   Global Training on commodity market  abuse compliance  Nobles Code of Conduct contains a procedure for the good faith reporting of any  violation of the Code or other Noble Policies. Additionally, Noble has appropriate systems and controls in place, such as regular  check procedures conducted by our internal audit team, to ensure compliance with respect   to anti-bribery and anti-corruption measures. Nobles Compliance Team conducts regular training for staff on a wide variety of  issues, including anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, competition, sanctions and  environmental compliance.  18 outlook Noble emphasizes its strong support for policies and actions to continue to implement  the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact.
