In the course of their  economic activities, central enterprises voluntarily implement their social responsibilities, which not only necessary for sustainable  development, but also a duty of companies as citizens in society. Over the years, as one of the key state-owned enterprises directly   managed by the central government, China Huaneng Group has consciously integrated social responsibility into its enterprise  development strategy, business management and the entire process of building its corporate culture. Adhering to the Three-color  corporate mission, we are committed to promoting the sustainable development of power and energy in China. Also persisting in the  road of safe development, optimal development, green development, healthy development, international development and harmonious  development, we have made efforts to give back to society with the fruits of development. We have built a vast stage for staff  development, created development opportunities for partners, and provided sincere help to the public. Whats more, we have realized  with balanced speed, scale, quality and efficiency, achieved coordination between development levels and the resource environment,  and made positive contributions to the comprehensive and rapid development of the economy and society. In 2011, facing unprecedented difficulties and a complex and  difficult business situation, we have earnestly implemented  the Scientific Outlook on Development. Adhering to the  working ideas of transforming development modes, adjusting  structurally, intensifying management, raising efficiency,  controlling risks, improving quality and pioneering as a first- class enterprise, we have conquered difficult problems, made  exciting achievements and laid a good foundation for building  a world-class enterprise with international competitiveness. By  the end of 2011, our domestic and foreign installed electricity  generation capacity had reached 125.38 GW, ranking first in Asia  and second in the world. We achieved an annual generating  capacity of 604.6 billion KWh, coal production of 64.06 million  tons, and consolidated operating income of 270.3 billion Yuan.  Our production and operation targets are among the best in  the industry. We have improved the companys overall strength,  competitiveness, and sustainable development capabilities;  achieved A-level performance as evaluated by the State-owned  Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC); and   ranked 276th globally among Fortune 500 companies. In 2012, we will take building a world-class enterprise with  international competitiveness as the driving force, take  improving the quality and efficiency as the center, and take  speeding up transformation and upgrading as the focus. We  will focus on changing our development modes, advancing  the ideas of getting stronger and better, as well as give priority  to further strengthening safety management and promoting  the development of a safe production management system.  While making great efforts to strengthen business management  to increase efficiency, we will improve development quality  to realize effective, moderate and orderly development. We  will also strengthen capital operations and the work of going  global to promote the readjustment of capital, improve our  technological innovation systems and mechanisms, intensify  energy conservation and push ahead with the construction  of an excellent and environmentally-friendly enterprise.  Furthermore, we will advance reform and innovation to improve  the management level of the enterprise, strengthen Party  construction and strive to enhance the scientific level of Party  construction work. In todays world, social, environmental and resource problems  have become the focus of global concern and a bottleneck of  economic and social development, and are major issues facing  the development and progress of human society generally.  As an energy group with electricity as our core business, we  have always been highly concerned about national energy  security and the impact of fossil energy development on the  environment. We continue on the road of green, low-carbon  and circular economic development, and strive to realize cleaner  development. Furthermore, we consciously abide by the basic  principles in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC); comply  with the relevant laws and regulations of the state, international  conventions and international practices; and manage  credit according to the law. We also continue to deepen our  management and operations to tap our potential and increase  efficiency, ensuring the maintenance and appreciation of state- owned assets, and attaching importance to the interests of  stakeholders to achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcomes. Responsibility carries force and wins the future. We will always  keep in mind the economic, political and social responsibilities  of the enterprise, and enhance its sustainable development  capabilities with high standards and high quality, so as to take  important strides on the road to build a world-class enterprise.

This creates the conditions for coal-fired power plants of the  Company to reduce losses or turn losses into profits.  Major Risks   Changes in the Economic Situation The world economic situation will remain very severe and complicated with increasing instability and economic recovery uncertain. The Chinese economy is confronted  with significantly unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable contradictions and problems, the coexistence of downward pressures from economic growth and from  the rise of prices, and complicated economic and financial trends, which bring risks to the Companys management and development.   Changes in the Electric Power Market Affected by factors such as the slowdown of economic growth, adjustment of the industrial structure, and more efforts in energy conservation and emissions reduction,  the acceleration rate of electric power consumption growth may slow across society. In recent years, influenced by factors such as having less newly installed capacity,  coal supply issues, and less inflow, the company has not been able to put all of its power generation capacity into effective use, directly bringing challenges to the Com- pany in production and marketing.   Changes in the Coal Market Constrained by rail capacity, port transit capacity and the striking structural contradiction between the supply and demand of coal, the coal supply will remain tight in  some areas for some time, and its price will remain high. Internationally affected by depreciation of the US dollar, the global excess of financial liquidity, and other factors,  the coal price will still fluctuate greatly, bringing pressure to the Company in ensuring fuel supplies and reducing fuel costs.     Changes in Capital Markets As bank deposit reserve ratios and loan interest rates remain high, has resulted in tight supply, high costs and strict supervision in capital markets, with great uncertainty  in monetary policy trends and fund supplies, which means setting new requirements for the Company for fund guarantees and cost controls.   Corresponding Measures   Further Strengthening Safety Management With implementing safety responsibility as the mainline and strengthening the  control of safety production process as the focus, we deeply pushed ahead with  the construction of a supervision system and guarantee system for safe produc- tion, solidly carried out the task of meeting safety production standards, and  deepened staff training on safety education. We also strengthened the safety  management of coal mines and conducted special programs on disaster preven- tion, while improving the emergency system to achieve systematic safety.   Further Intensifying Operations and Management We have paid close attention to changes in the markets for electricity, coal and  capital, strengthened our analysis and assessments of the situations, and devel- oped effective measures to cope with the complicated circumstances in produc- tion and operations. We have also fully implemented EVA management and cost  control measures and solved business problems while making efforts to increase  income and decrease expenditures, and turning losses into profits so that we can  complete our business tasks.    Further Improving Development Quality In accordance with the requirements for building a world-class enterprise, we  have incorporated the improvement of development quality and efficiency into  the whole development process of the company, advancing the implementation  of strategies, accelerating the readjustment of the power structure, industrial  structure and regional distribution, thus enhancing the synergistic capabilities of  the industry, and achieving effective, moderate and orderly development.    Further Strengthening Capital Operations and the Work of  going global Adhering to the principles of advancing in some areas while retracting in oth- ers and doing what is appropriate and discarding what is inappropriate, we  intensified our efforts around equity financing, revitalized our stock assets, and  optimized our capital layout. In the meantime, we have actively implemented  the strategy of go global, deepened international exchange and cooperation,  and improved and internationalized our operations and management.   Further Promoting Scientific and Technological Innovation We have deeply carried out the strategy of scientific and technological innova- tion, and strengthened the building of a scientific research team and research  platform.

Further Strengthening Energy Conservation and Emissions  Reductions We are working to conscientiously carry out the requirements for energy con- servation and emissions reduction during the period of the 12th Five-Year Plan,  and have actively participated in the thousands of companies saving energy  and reducing carbon emissions activity. We have also been deeply tapping the  energy-saving potential of generating units, promoting the desulfurization and  denitration transformation of active generating units in an orderly manner, while  striving to build an excellent and environmentally-friendly enterprise.   Further Pressing Ahead with Reform and Innovation We continue to work on our overall goal in building a world-class enterprise, earnestly  pushing forward the construction of an international benchmarking system, constantly  improving the three-level management system, sorting out professional management  systems in relevant fields, strengthening performance evaluations and comprehensive  risk management, and continuously improving corporate management.  Further Strengthening Party Building We have continued to further explore and grasp the working principle of Party build- ing, earnestly pushing forward all the work of Party building. This includes deeply car- rying out the anti-corruption work and striving to enhance the scientific level of Party  building work. We also have continued to strengthen the building of our cadre team  and staff team as well as the development of corporate culture, fully implementing  corporate social responsibility, and establishing a good corporate image.   Broad Consensus on Changing Development Mode  Through thorough study and practice of the Scientific Outlook on Development,  the staff of the company deeply understands that changing the companys  development mode is both a responsibility of the company and an inherent  requirement for sustainable development. This laid a solid ideological foundation  for the company to speed up transformation and upgrading, and get stronger  and better.   Better Capability in Tackling Hard Issues and Overcoming Dif- ficulties Huaneng has thoroughly carried out the Striving for excellence Campaign in a  systematic way. Relentlessly and tenaciously, all of the cadres and employees  have withstood various tests, and accumulated valuable experience, significantly  improved the ability and quality of the cadre team.

We set up Production Safety Committees in all  enterprises. Leaders of each enterprise were  responsible for general safety and  for organizing and ensuring a safe work environment. In 2011, the Company compiled Regulations against Code Violations,  Regulations on Inspection and Treatment of Hidden Dangers, and  Accountability and Punishment Measures for Accidents, amended Regulations  on Investigation of Power Production Accidents and other rules and regulations.  The Company developed documentation work in each of the grassroots  companies to further promote the institutionalization and standardization of  safe production management. In 2011, the Company cooperated actively with the State Electricity Regulatory  Commission to carry out standardization of safe production in the power  industry, and conducted standard tests and evaluations in the Dalat, Dezhou and  Haikou power plants, respectively.   Implementing Responsibility We implemented the nations policies, laws, and regulations on production  safety through our Safety Production Responsibility System, which used a  closed-loop management system that ensured decomposition, implementation  and performance assessment of responsibility. All companies have signed a  Production Safety Responsibility Agreement to guarantee the implementation  of the safe production responsibility system. In this way, responsibilities for  safety are designated level by level to each subsidiary, grassroots company,  department, team and post. We further improved our Detailed Rules for Implementation of Safety  Performance Assessments and other systems, quantified our safety indicators,  and divided them into four major indicators covering production safety,  operational safety, political safety, and image safety for measurement and  assessment. These indicators became the basis for assessing performance  and determining responsibility. In addition, we have strictly implemented  Accountability and Punishment Measures for Accidents to strengthen  investigations into whoever responsible for accidents. Annually, we assessed  each companys safety performance targets and issued warnings and  corresponding penalties to those that fall short of their targets.  On January 4 th On February7 th On June 3 rd On June 15 th On September 15 th the Company held the years first enlarged meeting of the Production Safety Committee to sum up  production safety work in 2010 and make deployments for 2011. the Company deployed three special actions on complete coal mining licensing, improved system  development, and the construction of the Six Systems . the Company carried out Safe Production Month activities with the theme of Safety responsibility relies  on implementation. Huaneng held a video conference to arrange for each Huaneng subsidiary company spare no efforts to  meet peak demand and prevent summer floods.   the Company held a video conference on special actions against breaches of regulations in power  generation companies and made relevant deployments. To avoid serious accidents related to equipment, fire, or traffic; To avoid all other incidents that may impact the image of our company. Events Putting People First  and Safe Development Safe development is the precondition for sustainable development. In order to  achieve safe development, we stick to the scientific concept of putting people  first. We regard safety as part of benefits, reputation and competitiveness,  and fully implement our Safe Production Responsibility System. We have also  improved safety management regulations, strengthened our emergency response  mechanisms, and continuously make improvements to our Safety Management  System so as to raise safety levels and strive to be the safest company possible.` 20 Putting People First and  Safe Development Sustainability Report 2011    Accident Management  The Company further strengthened accident management, carried out a 100-Day Special Action against Breach of Regulations and made detailed reviews of vari- ous accidents by means of video conferences, accident reports and others, so as to help all companies draw lessons and prevent similar accidents. In 2011, we held the  Power Enterprise Safety Production Supervision and Management Workshop, through which we made in-depth analysis of personal injury accidents from 2005 to 2010,  summed up experience of safe production, and developed improvement measures.   Team Building We treated team building as an essential aspect of safety management. Stressing  the concept of ensuring zero death with zero breach of regulations, and ensur- ing zero accident with zero defect, we continued to carry out the activities of  being an excellent group and excellent employees. We encourage each group  to innovate around safety management, and have comprehensively advanced  group safety standardization, increased safety education and training. We have  continuously consolidated the foundations of the enterprises safe production. In  2011, ten power plant teams of the company including the number two team of  the power operations department of the Yuhuan Power Plant were awarded the  title of Worker Pioneers by All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU).  Management on Safety of Infrastructure Construction  We have adopted responsible procurement, strictly implemented access systems for outsourcing construction companies, and blacklisted companies if they experi- enced production and infrastructure construction accidents by barring them from future tendering. We also carried out pre-job safety training and education for person- nel, ensured they were familiar with the code of safe construction, and enhanced their safety awareness. Furthermore, we strengthened our supervision over construc- tion companies, and organized special activities on prevention and remediation of safety accidents in construction, so as to prevent safety incidents during infrastructure  construction projects. Through focused basic management on safety, clear job safety respon- sibilities, closed-loop management, standard operational procedures,  prominent evaluations on quality, intensified safety training and study,  and safety group building, the main unit maintenance team of the  Haibowan Power Plant achieved excellent results and successively won  awards like Youth Civilization Sample, Central Enterprise Red Flag  Group, and others. The Chaohu Power Plant adopted integrated management in production and infrastructure construction, eliminating minor personal injuries and serious  equipment damage accidents, and achieving a smooth transition from infrastructure construction to power generation. Consequently, the Power Plant has suc- cessively received awards like the Electric Power Industrys Quality Engineering Award and the Electric Power Construction Associations Annual Quality Engineer- ing Award.   Emergency Management The Company has improved the emergency management system, compiled preventive  action plans, carried out emergency drills, and formed an emergency response team. We  believe that preventive measures should be implemented effectively and that emergen- cies need to be managed dynamically to ensure proper controls. We have enhanced  worker safety awareness and developed their abilities to handle emergencies. In 2011,  we further improved various special emergency programs, and successfully held drills for  preventing flooding at the Lancang River and a fire emergency drill in the Lingdong Coal  Mine. Additionally, the Company paid great attention to handling responses to sudden natural  disasters, focused on strengthening our ability to handle abnormal climate, geological  disasters, and other issues. We implemented full emergency management measures  covering plans, materials, exercises, observation and the like. In 2011, the power plants in  Weihai, Yuhuan, Fuzhou, Haikou, Taipingyi and others activated their emergency plans,  successfully defended themselves against Typhoon Muifa, Typhoon Naza and other  geological disasters, and ensured safety production.

We also stressed maintenance  quality,  and organized technical innovation projects. In accordance  with new requirements on energy conservation and emissions  reductions, we modified our equipment and strictly implemented  rules on protective equipment and explosion prevention measures.  Additionally, we actively promoted technical supervision and  management, earnestly made summaries and analysis of technical  supervision, strengthened training for technical supervisors, and  continued to improve equipment safety levels. In 2011, we kept the  leading position in the industry for both equipment utilization rate  and unplanned outage rate. In particular, 31 power plants realized  no unplanned outages throughout 2011, including key plants like  Yuhuan, Baosan, Jinghong, Manwan and others.   Prevention and Control of Safety Risks   Safety Evaluations We deeply developed safety evaluations, and issued Standards and Evidence on Safety Evaluations to establish a scientific evaluation system and working  mechanisms while increasing self-discipline in safe production and continuous improvement. In 2011, all of the grassroots enterprises carried out their  own investigations, among which some were assessed by experts in secondary units. Additionally, the group company conducted reexaminations and  evaluations in Power Plants of Chaohu, Rizhao, Linyi, Yangluo, Baoyi, Wulashan, Yimin and Hailar, which effectively increased the safety of their production  and management, along with equipment safety levels.  Coal Safety Management The Company continued to strengthen coal mine safety production technology and on-site  management, improved emergency management and long-term mechanisms to prevent major  disasters and inspect serious hidden dangers, and actively promoted the development of safety quality  standards, so as to further reinforce the foundations of coal mine safety management. In 2011, the Company promoted three special actions on complete coal mining licensing, improved  system construction and the development of the Six Systems, extensively carried out general  inspections of coal mine production safety, carried out a special program against breach of regulations,  and conducted inspections and coal mine safety evaluations, which continue to enhance coal mine  safety levels. Eleven coal mines passed the Safety Supervision Bureaus criteria and achieved national  standards. We shifted the focus of safety work to the production line, strengthened supervision at the workplace, deepened the inspection and elimination of hidden dangers to  its equipment and the overall working environment. Additionally, we developed comprehensive safety inspections, and organized supervision teams to supervise eight  grassroots companies, so that we realized closed-loop management of safety production in an all-round way. In 2011, subsidiary power generation enterprises inspected  28,830 hidden dangers, achieving rectification and reform with funds of 97.89 million Yuan, rectifying 25,659 hidden dangers (89%), and also inspecting 25 major hidden  dangers, rectifying 13 (52%).

It also indicated that there still exists a certain gap between overall safe production and management and the objectives of  building a world-class enterprise. Safety responsibility is very important. We shall remain constantly on guard, firmly putting people first and ensuring safe development, and develop a profound  understanding that safe production is the top responsibility, top priority, and most important for efficiency for our enterprise. We shall earnestly draw lessons  from accidents, find out and reflect on the defects, and take accident prevention as the main direction, and standardized production as an important guarantee  while promoting safe production. We shall also strictly implement safety responsibility; give priority to five special aspects covering special action against  breach of regulations, inspection and treatment of hidden dangers, safety evaluations, safety training and education, and safety management of outsourcing  engineering. Furthermore, we shall strengthen the safety management of coal enterprises, and fully develop safe production and management systems, and  standards in power plants, so as to reinforce safety assurance, and ensure intrinsic safety.  Employee Training on Safety We continuously improved our staff safety education and training system, de- veloped a safety training plan based on practical needs, and carried out safety  trainings in a planned, targeted and differentiated way by means of teaching  classes, safety warnings, etc. to raise awareness of production safety among our  employees and enhance their ability in handling accidents. In 2011, Huaneng  organized 20 training sessions for leaders, professionals and technical supervi- sors with more than 1,205 participants. Furthermore, 30 people passed national  CSE qualification examinations successfully. The number of CSE has come to  542  persons. We have continued to improve safety training modes to enhance their quality  and effect. In 2011, Huaneng organized and developed a Multimedia Training  The power plants in Shantou, Huaiyin and Dalat innovated training  forms, developed Safety Training and Education Platforms, used mul- timedia tools for teaching, presented the content in three-dimensional  ways with pictures, texts, sounds and videos, and noticeably improved  the effects of training.   Safety Culture Activities We attach great importance to the development of safety culture, constantly innovating the means and methods of cultivating safety culture, created a strong atmos- phere for safe production, and cultivated good safe operations habits. In 2011, Huaneng initiated Safe Production Month, with the theme of Safety responsibility lays  stress on implementation, organized its subsidiary companies to participate in online knowledge competitions, essay competition on safe production, and other activi- ties like the Safe Production Youth Demonstration Post. Through various publicity and educational activities like a signature campaign, contest on safety knowledge,  and safety speech contests, we raised safety awareness among our employees. System for Safe Production, which made use of video, cartoons and other ways  to fully demonstrate more than 240 typical cases, and effectively improved the  immediacy and interest of safety training. No serious equipment accidents, no serious fire accidents, no major traffic acci- dents, or large-scale pollution accidents occurred in 2011. In 2011, one serious production-related accident leading to death occurred in a  power enterprise, the same number as in the previous year. Six common equipment accidents in power generation occurred in 2011, up by  six over the previous year. 62 Class 1 equipment failures occurred in 2011, an increase of 8 compared with  2010. the ratio of unplanned outages was 0.12%, 0.04% higher than 2010.

Its power output is directly transmitted to the Beijing-Tianjin- Tangshan power grid through two 500 KV transmission lines. Presently, its total  installed capacity is 3720MW, accounting for 6.5% in Northern Chinas power grid. Since its establishment, the Shangdu Power Plant has persisted in paying equal at- tention to power generation and infrastructure construction. In combination with  its actual needs, the Power Plant improved the safety management system for the  whole process of infrastructure construction. The Power Plant strictly controlled four  aspects covering the inspection of construction unit licenses, preparatory work before  construction, on-site supervision and management, and the evaluation of construc- tion units. Furthermore, it paid close attention to the safety training for construction  personnel, management against breach of regulations, and other issues, so as to  ensure the safe construction of infrastructure projects. Improving the safety management system. Shangdu Power Plant developed a  suite of regulations and systems for the whole process of infrastructure construction,  which covers management around the objectives of safe infrastructure construction,  examination and approval of safety technical measures, supervision and inspection  of safety quality, investment in safety protection, and accountability of safety infra- structure development, and urged the supervision and construction unit to prepare  an implementation plan on safety management. The power plant also established a  safety assurance system headed by its Party-secretary, and a safety supervision sys- tem led by its general manager, defining the working process of safety management  on infrastructure construction and staff responsibilities, and forming a complete  safety management network system. Focus on inspecting the qualification certificates of construction units. In  the stage of bidding, all construction units had to accept the inspection of safety  qualification by the Shangdu Power Plant, which inspects 19 items covering the  qualification certificates corresponding to construction projects, safety organiza- tional structure, safety performance, construction safety records over the most recent  three years, and other items. In particular, the power plant examines construction  personnel medical records, labor contracts, and insurance for work-related injury or  accidents. The power plant also signed responsibility contracts on safety objectives,  and safety agreements with all construction units, so as to define the safety respon- sibilities of both parties, and disaggregate and quantify the general objectives and  requirements of safety management. Furthermore, the power plant retains 2.5% of  the total amount of the project as funds for safety, quality and progress assessment,  so as to induce construction units to pay more attention to safety construction man- agement. Paying great attention to preliminary work. The Shangdu Power Plant discretely  and selectively organized different construction units to take level-3 safety educa- tion and training  to eliminate the phenomenon of giving workers an examination  instead of training. All construction personnel have to accept safety training and pass  the examination before working. The power plant also carried out appropriate activi- ties like speeches on safety, a safety knowledge contest, safety month and so forth,  and conducted emergency drills so that the safety concept would be rooted in the  minds of the construction workers. Additionally, the power plant strictly examined  the three measures and one plan prepared by construction units, strengthening  the inspection of scaffolds, tools and equipment before construction so as to ensure  operational safety for personnel using techniques, tools, and equipment in different  working environments and worked to achieve earlier warnings in safety manage- ment. Strengthening on-site supervision and management. Adhering to the principle  of zero tolerance and paying close attention to the three violations, the Shangdu  Power Plant set up a board to expose the violations of regulations, issued a Manage- ment Manual on Fighting Violations of Regulations in Infrastructure Projects and  Standard Atlas of Safety Facilities, set up safety signs and slogans, requested supervi- sion and construction units to keep record of violations, and publicized the safety  concept of zero violations and injuries. Additionally, the Power Plant persisted in  conducting daily checks and weekly joint check of safety and civilization, actively  carried out special action against breach of regulations, and special inspections for  protective equipment, hot work on site, temporary power supplies, scaffolds, use of  safety tools and equipment, implementation of a two-ticket system (operation tickets  and work tickets), increased focus on higher-risk construction, improved supervision  over major projects, and strictly investigated unqualified items and urged rectifica- tion. Strengthening the evaluation of construction units.  The Shangdu Power Plant  regularly made statistic reports of violations of regulations in each construction unit,  along with their safety management performance, evaluated their on-site safe and  civilized construction efforts, criticized backward construction units, and praised and  rewarded advanced ones. Through this the power plant promoted all construction  units to standardize their internal management and strengthen self-restraint, so that  the plant could effectively control on-site violations of regulations and ensure the  safety of infrastructure projects under a controllable and controlled situation. Through the complete and detailed process control, closed-loop scientific safety su- pervision and management, and active and effective incentives, the Shangdu Power  Plant put six generating units into operation from April 2003 to December 2011,  with no serious casualty-causing accidents, equipment accidents, or fire accidents,  and achieved the expected safety objectives in infrastructure construction. Shangdu  Power Plant was given the Ankang Cup Winning Enterprise award, the National  Labor Merit Certificate, and the National Civilization Unit award, along with others.

Energy Conservation, Emission Reduction and Green Development 38 Sustainability Report 2011    Strengthening Supervision and Management We regard our work in energy conservation and environmental protection as  an important part of the performance of evaluation and management, and  have worked to link this to compensation through an evaluation system. We  have implemented a one-vote veto system for major energy conservation and  environmental protection objectives that disqualify enterprises from applying  for the Four Excellent Teams if they have failed to achieve annual objectives and  meet requirements. This helps form an incentive and constraint mechanism with  clear awards and punishments.   Steadily Promoting Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction   Strengthening Detailed Management Starting with basic management, the company strengthened energy conservation treatment in newly-operating units as well as units with excessive energy consump- tion, along with key-type generating units. We also selected technicians with rich experience in energy conservation and formed them into a cross-regional and interdis- ciplinary working group to carry out special work on energy conservation and emission reduction. In 2011, we made a special diagnosis of energy conservation in 33 key generating units, and carried out special energy-saving rectification actions in 27 key power plants.  Through focusing on small indicators, benchmarking for single consumption of auxiliaries, and paired treatment, we achieved remarkable results, decreasing the coal  consumption rate of 52 units by over 5 g/kWh and dropping station service power consumption rates in 77 units by 0.2% over the previous year. In 2011, we formulated the documents, including Planning for a Energy-saving and Environment-friendly Enterprise (2011-2015); Standards on Excellent  Environmentally-friendly Coal-fired Power Plants; Guidance on the Design, Maintenance and Operation of Desulphurization Systems. We made clear our  objectives, tasks, measures and timetables of energy conservation and emission reduction during the period of the 12th Five-Year Plan, and assigned  responsibilities to each regional company and grassroots enterprise to ensure the performance of responsibilities level by level with clear objectives and  thorough implementation. In 2011, we improved the systems for statistics, supervision, analysis and  assessment of environment protection performance, and established a system  for online supervision and comprehensive analysis of energy conservation  indicators. We regularly issued a grassroots enterprises index that evaluated  energy conservation and environmental protection, steadily carried out  benchmarking analysis, and took special and effective action to rectify problems,  so as to form a dynamic closed-loop supervision mechanism. Huaneng Jinling Power Plant   Implementing Energy-saving Modifications We implemented Guidelines on Huaneng Thermal Power Generating Unit Energy  Conservation, and Guidelines on Huaneng Thermal Power Generating Unit Power  Conservation. Relying on technical progress, we extensively tapped the energy conser- vation potential of active power generating units, carried out flow path retrofitting of  turbines and opening cylinders to increase efficiency, and reduced the steam consump- tion of turbines. We also optimized cold-end systems, drainage systems, coal pulverizing  systems, wind and smoke systems, and adjusted and tested the performance of auxiliary  systems. We actively adopted motor frequency conversion technology, boiler plasma  ignition, and other technology to reduce the power and oil consumption of generating  units, to utilize all remaining energy, improve heat recovery, and improve the operational  efficiency of the units.   Creating an Excellent Energy-saving and                 Environmentally-friendly Enterprise We earnestly implemented Planning on Creating an Excellent and Environmentally- friendly Enterprise during the 12th Five-Year Plan and further improved evaluation  standards. We also standardized and perfected our preparation and planning on energy  conservation and emission reduction, training on energy conservation management,  analysis and statistics of energy conservation indicators, fuel charging management,  and energy conservation supervision and management. Relying on the Xian Thermal  Power Research Institute, we tackled some key technical problems like optimizing  governing valves of large capacity generating units, experimenting with blending and  burning techniques, optimizing the powdering system, and reducing power plant elec- tricity consumption rates in key generating units.

In 2011, the Company achieved water con- sumption rate for power generation of 1.28 kg/kWh, down by 0.02 kg/ kWh over the previous year. The Company advocated the concept of green office, actively promoted the construction of official document platform, and kept modern paperless office to  minimize paper waste. The Company also strengthened operation and management of air-conditioning and heating system, requiring the temperature of air- conditioner not less than 26 in summer and not higher than 20 in winter, to achieve great effect in electricity conservation.   Reducing Emissions of Greenhouse Gases We actively developed the key technology of carbon capture and demonstrated operation, and formed our own CO2 capturing technology with independent intellectu- al property right, capturing CO2 from combustion flue gas. In 2011, capture devices (120,000 ton/year) in Shidongkou Power Plant II and another device (3,000 ton/year)  in Beijing Cogeneration Power Plant were in stale operation. As the main initiator, Huaneng actively promote the establishment of the National Alliances of CO2 Capture,  Utilization and Storage (CCUS) . CO2 capture devices in the Shidongkou Power Plant II Diagnosing energy conservation    We retrofitted generating units in an orderly way to increase the capacity and  efficiency of desulphurization systems and equipped them with denitrification  devices. In 2011, we increased capacity and efficiency of 3,070 MW desulphuri- zation systems; 1,660 MW units were equipped with denitrification devices. We  continued to reduce the total amount of SO2 emissions, effectively controlled the  total amount of NOX emissions, and pushed forward mercury emissions monitor- ing in three pilot power plants in Fuzhou, Yushe, and Beijing respectively.

It has an installed capacity of 1,768 MW, provides heat for an area of 63  million square meters, and ensures about 10% of the power supply and 1/3 of the  heat supply for Beijing. It plays an important supporting role in the energy supply  system of Beijing. The Beijing Cogeneration Power Plant carries out the capitals strategy of developing  safe, clean, high-efficiency and low-carbon energy, taking the creation of a resource- saving and environmentally-friendly power plant as its objective and integrates the  concept of green development into production, operations and the entire process  of development, actively exploring new ideas of energy conservation, innovating  new methods of environmental protection, and striving to build a world-class green  power plant. Improving energy efficiency. The Beijing Cogeneration Power Plant made positive  use of advanced technology, and represents an increase in investment in equipment  upgrading. It uses advanced co-generation of power and heat technology in  domestic companies, with average thermal efficiency over 60% for the whole year,  which is about 20% higher than that of conventional condensed steam power plants.  This technology could save 400,000 tons of standard coal per year, and has saved a  total of more than four million tons of standard coal since it was put into operation.  In 2008, the company took the lead to adopt the technology of poly-generation of  power, cool and heat, installed two sets of 1.25 million calorie LiBr refrigeration units  with hot water sources to provide cool sources for production and living buildings  equivalent to 22,000 square meters, which may reduce power plant electricity  consumption by 1.7 million kWh. It also invested over 50 million Yuan to build the  first secondary sewage recycling system, which may save 12 million cubic meters of  fresh water per year, greatly relieving Beijings water shortages. The Huaneng Beijing  Cogeneration Power Plant was the first power plant that adopted the technology  of chimney and cooling tower integration, which increases the utilization rate of  chimney energy and decreases the temperature of circulating water, in so doing  improving the heating efficiency of the power plant. Reducing emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. The Beijing  Cogeneration Power Plant has unceasingly explored environmental protection  work, brought forth new ideas, and strengthened the control of waste emissions  to effectively control and reduce emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.

International development must be based on a global perspective, implement an  internationalized business strategy, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the field  of offshore energy resources, and gradually expand international market share. We must  strengthen offshore asset management, effectively control risks; scientifically allocate  global capital, talent and market resources, and improve our international operations  management skills. To ensure the safety of offshore asset management; To improve the profitability of offshore asset and achieve reasonable investment returns; To make good use of two types of markets and two types of resources so as to develop  the cause of Huaneng. 56 Global Perspective and  International Development Sustainability Report 2011  In March 2008, Huaneng Power International successfully acquired a 100% stake of the Singapore Tuas Power Ltd. with S$4.235 billion from Singapore Temasek  Shareholding Company through international public bidding. This is Huanengs first wholly-funded power plant abroad. Tuas Power Ltd. has a total installed capacity of 2,670 MW. Since the acquisition, Huaneng has taken serving the local power market as its highest purpose, and  pursuing long-term win-win development as its objective. Therefore, Huaneng made great progress in the development and construction of new projects,  successively launching the Tembusu project and CCP5, which has helped Huaneng achieve greater market share and build up its strengths. Developing and Constructing the Shweli River Hydropower Station Stage I in Myanmar with a BOT model in 2006 Acquiring a 50% stake of InterGen in 2010 At the end of November 2010, Huaneng, in association with the Guangdong Yudean  Group, acquired a 50% stake of InterGen held by India GMR Group with USD $1.232  billion, and the deal was completed on April 11th 2011. InterGen has 12 power plants, among which there are 9 gas-fired power plants,  3 coal-fired power plants, and 1 pressure station and pipeline work in Mexico.  These 12 power plants are distributed in 5 countries including the Netherlands,  the United Kingdom, Mexico, Australia and the Philippines, with total installed  capacity of 8,146 MW and equity capacity of 6,312 MW.  In December 2006, relying on regional advantages of adjacent to the Lancang River and the Mekong River and its technological, operational and management advantages in  hydropower stations, the Huaneng Lancang River Hydropower Company initiated and established the Yunnan Joint Power Development Co., Ltd., which signed the Agreement  on a Joint Venture to Develop a Hydropower Project on the Shweli River for Stage I with DHPI of the First Power Department of Myanmar to build and operate the Shweli  River Hydropower Station Stage I with a BOT model. This project is the first foreign hydropower project with a BOT model in China. As the power station adopted the special power  supply model of one power station for two power grids, it opened the way to transmit power output generated abroad back to China, along with creating a new international  cooperation model. The Shweli River Hydropower Station Stage I has total investments of USD $  475 million, with installed capacity of 6100 MW. From damming the river to  connecting to the power grid, Huaneng completed the project in just 28 months,  which has fostered a good company image in Myanmar. By the end of 2011, the Shweli River Hydropower Station Stage I had generated  9.726 billion kWh, of which 5.287 billion kWh was transmitted back to China, and  4.359 billion kWh to Myanmar. This project has strongly supported the economy  both in China and in Myanmar, and made positive contributions to cooperation  in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.  Acquiring a 100% stake of the Singapore Tuas Power Company in 2008 Shweli River Hydropower Station Stage I Mexico Chihuahua Power Plant   Strengthening Internationalized Operations and Management   Developing Effective Operational Measures The Company formulated Interim Regulations on Management of Overseas Property Rights, Interim Measures on Management of Shareholding Enterprises of  China Huaneng Hong Kong Company, and other rules and regulations, so as to implement absolute control in the major decision-making of overseas subsidiary  companies. Huaneng Power International has specifically set up a Tuas management office, reorganized Tuas board of directors and enjoys veto rights. Through setting  up an Australia Representative Office, sending general technical managers accredited to the Australian Power Company, and other ways, Huaneng has gradually formed  its own supervision method combining equity management with operational management. Huaneng selected and sent Huanengs directors or members to InterGens  Regulatory Commissions and other professional committees, so as to regularly submit information on production and operations, and strengthen daily supervision.   Improving Risk Control The Company formulated and improved Regulations on Comprehensive  Management of Risks, and developed methods on risk evaluation of overseas  investment and operations. We collected, mastered, and analyzed the industrial  policies, laws and regulations, and market information in each country where  we have operations, made more analysis and research of risks, and developed  emergency plans to prevent the occurrence of various risks. Since going abroad  from the first time in 2003, we have made our foreign business operations  stronger and have obtained good investment returns.    Promoting International Exchange and Cooperation The Company have continued to attach importance to bringing our own  advantages into play, thus actively strengthening exchanges and cooperation  with companies in the United States, Europe, Australia and other places, and  promoted the mutual research and development of projects, talent training and  exchanges on management so as to improve the Companys internationalization  level. In January 2011, we signed a technological cooperation agreement  with the American Electric Power Company on reducing CO2 emissions and  improving the efficiency of coal-fired power plants. Both parties will adopt our  self-developed CO2 capturing technology, cooperate on research about CO2  emissions reductions in coal-fired power plants, and promote the construction  of demonstration projects in due time.

The power plant is one of the three major power plants in Singapore and  plays an important role in ensuring the power supply in Singapore. Successfully acquiring a stake. As early as in 2004, Huaneng made a detailed  investigation on the production and management of the Tuas Power Company.  In early 2008, Temasek officially started the program to sell Tuas Power Ltd.,  and Huaneng actively participated in the bid. In order to win trust and support  from the management, labors and the trade union of Tuas Power Ltd., Huaneng  communicated meticulously with them. Huaneng promised to retain the  original management and staff, and keep its existing development direction  after acquisition. On the basis of long-term understanding and thorough  communication, Huaneng acquired a 100% stake of Tuas Power Ltd. with  S$4.235 billion in March 2008. Promoting integrated management. After acquiring its stake, Huaneng  determined  the management direction of Tuas Power Ltd.Taking into  consideration its expertise in the management of overseas assets, in combination  with the social, economic and legal environment in Singapore, and the actual  situation of Tuas Power Ltd., Huaneng took account of risks, increases of  efficiency, and promotion of development as its mission . Huaneng  oriented the  management of Tuas Power Ltd. as part of strategic operational management,  laid emphasis on the structure of corporate governance, strengthened  management in budget incentives and major decisions, and actively promoted  integrated management. On the basis of its original management system,  Huaneng reorganized the Board of Directors and added the directors of  Huaneng, and set up a Risk Management Committee to strengthen risk  management. Huaneng also established mechanisms to regularly report and  communicate information about operations and management, improved  internal control systems in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and  introduced internal controls and external audit mechanisms; we actively  publicized and implemented Huanengs three color concept to strengthen the  development of corporate culture and promote cultural cohesion. Huaneng  gave strong support in the production and management of the power plant,  management of project construction, bank loans and financing, and other  aspects, based on which Tuas Power Ltd. focused on marketing and production,  increased income and reduced expenditures, and constantly improved its  development quality and efficiency. Extending the development field. While keeping safety and production  orderly, keeping management controllable and highly-efficient, and keeping  performance levels increasing steadily, and based on the energy development  strategy in Singapore, Tuas Power Ltd. has successively launched projects of  Tembusu and CCP5. In November 2009, infrastructure construction of the  Tembusu large-scale integrated hydropower and steam project of Tuas Power  Ltd. was started in the Tembusu Industrial Park of Jurong Island. It creatively  introduced mixing fuel of clean coal + biomass into power generation, which  not only meets strict environmental requirements, but also provides relatively  low-cost hydropower products, promoting local economic development.  Presently, phase I of the Tembusu project and its A project in phase II are under  construction according to plan, both of which will be put into operation in early  2013 and 2014 respectively. In 2010, seizing the opportunity, and complying with  the energy strategic plan of the government, Tuas Power Ltd. developed a plan  for retrofitting generating units to use natural gas instead of oil, that is, building  CCP5 (400MW) generators in place of two oil-fired generating units. The project  was started in early 2011, and is expected to be put into operation in the fourth  quarter of 2013. With the start of both projects, Tuas Power Ltd. has successfully  transformed its development mode from single power generation to providing  power supply and utility services, thus further enhancing its competitiveness. Since the acquisition, Tuas Power Ltd. had, by the end of 2011, achieved power  output of 40.7 billion kWh. In comparison with the number of labors before  the acquisition, there was an increase of 95 persons in the company, therefore,  Huaneng honored its commitment of no downsizing and provided more  jobs for local people. The successful acquisition and excellent operations of  Tuas Power Ltd. has not only fostered a good image of Chinese enterprises in  Singapore, but also accumulated experience for Huaneng in operating in the  competitive power market of a developed economy, as well as becoming a  successful model in Huanengs internationalization strategy.

Now on the both sides of Lancang River, running water is  flowing into thousands of households, which means that twisting the tap brings  clean water in the house and smiles on the faces of the villagers. The Lancang River Company persisted in poverty alleviation by culture, science  and technology, so it accelerated the construction of public cultural facilities like  cultural stations and cultural recreation rooms in the towns, carried out labor  transfer education training, and strived to develop a new type of farmer with  culture, technology and business minds. In the meantime, it guided the masses  to shift the focus of development to the strong industries that accord with the  actual local situation, so as to help farmers increase their income. In addition, the company also improved the rural health service system, building  rural clinics, supporting rural doctors in training, and subsidizing farmers to enjoy  state-funded new-type rural cooperative medical care, so as to improve the rural  health service. Since carrying out the 100-1000-10000 project, the Lancang River Company has  invested a total of more than 70 million Yuan, building 60 Hope Primary Schools,  37 clinics, 30 cultural rooms, and 16 reading rooms, financing 118 villages to  improve their appearances, supporting 1,410 rural teachers to participate  in professional training, and helping 1,150 junior and senior middle school  students to go to vocational technology schools, pairing with over 2,500 needy  students to help them complete their education, conducting 9,515 trainings  for transferring the rural labor force, and subsidizing 170,022 farmers to enjoy  state-funded new-type rural cooperative medical care. All of these effectively  improved local economic and social development, and built the bank of the  Lancang River into a harmonious social and economic development belt.

Terminology  Ultra Supercritical Power Genera- tion Technology Ultra supercritical power generation technology improves thermal efficiency in a  boiler and reduces electricity and coal costs by increasing boiler steam pressure  (25-31 MPa) and temperature (580-610). Currently, this is the world's most  advanced environmentally-friendly technology for power generation.  High Temperature Gas-cooled     Reactor (HTGR) The High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor is a kind of nuclear reactor that takes  helium gas as a cooling agent, with a high exit temperature. The high tempera- ture gas-cooled reactor uses coated particle fuel and graphite as a moderator.  The exit temperature of the reactor center is from 850C to 1,000C, and even  higher. The fuel is usually highly-concentrated uranium dioxide, and sometimes  is low-concentration uranium dioxide. The high temperature gas-cooled reactor  has such advantages as high thermal efficiency (40-41%), high burn-up fraction  (up to 20 MW day/ton uranium, and high conversion ratio (0.7-0.8).  GreenGen GreenGen refers to the research, development, demonstration and promotion  of a coal-based energy system that focuses on hydrogen production through  gasification, combined cycle power generation with hydrogen turbines, and fuel  cell-based power generation, while capturing and storing CO2 , so as to raise the  efficiency of coal-fried power generation and achieve near-zero emissions of pol- lutants and CO2 .  The Clean Development Mechanism  (CDM) The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is one of the three flexible mecha- nisms under the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. It allows developed countries  to cooperate with developing countries in projects that reduce emissions and  generate Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), by providing financial and techni- cal support to help developed countries fulfill their greenhouse gas emission  commitments.  Economic Value Added (EVA) Economic Value Added is a comprehensive tool or index used to measure if an  enterprise creates value or if the enterprise realizes real profit of production and  management. It is based on retained profits after tax by deducting the opportu- nity cost of equity and debt capital from its operating profit.  Carbon Capture, Utilization and  Storage (CCUS) CCUS technology is a new development trend of carbon capture and storage  (CCS) technology, which purifies carbon dioxide emitted in the production proc- ess, and puts it into new production processes. Thus, CO2 can be recycled in pro- duction rather than simply being stored. Compared with CCS technology, CCUS  technology may use CO2 as a resource to produce economic benefits, so it is a  more realistic operational technology.  Safety Evaluation It refers to a method to comprehensively apply safety system engineering, in  which we measure and predict the safety of the system, identify the dangers and  insecure elements, and make qualitative and quantitative analysis of them so as  to confirm the possible causes of danger and their severity, make correct evalu- ations about the safety of the system, and correspondingly provide concrete  countermeasures to eliminate unsafe elements and dangers. Through imple- menting these countermeasures in a comprehensive, systematic, purposeful and  planned way, we may standardize and normalize safety management, improve  the standards of safe production, and prevent the occurrence of accidents in ad- vance.  Three Synchronizations in Environ- mental Protection Article 26 of the Environmental Protection Law in China stipulates that installa- tions for the prevention and control of pollution at a construction project must  be designed, built and commissioned together with the principal part of the  project. No permission shall be given for a construction project to be commis- sioned or used until its installation for the prevention and control of pollution are  examined and considered to be up to the standard by the competent depart- ment of environmental protection administration that examined and approved  the environment impact statement. This stipulation is known as the Three Syn- chronizations system in the Environmental Protection Law in China.   100-1000-10000 Campaign The 100-1,000-10,000 Campaign refers to the project to construct 100 schools,  build 100 rural clinics, renovate 100 natural villages, and establish 100 rural cul- ture rooms; to train 1,000 rural teachers, provide financial aid for 1,000 junior and  senior high school graduates to enter vocational technical schools, and 1,000  poverty-stricken students in middle schools and primary schools to complete  their education; to resolve the problem of drinking water of 10,000 people, to  train 10,000 rural workers for employment transfer and support 100,000 people  to participate in the national new rural cooperative medical service.
