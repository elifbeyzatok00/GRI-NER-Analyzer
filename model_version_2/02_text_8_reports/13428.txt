Contact Index  Sustainability Report 2010 9  I am very pleased to present the Fourth Sustainability Report for COPEINCA.  This document represents our  commitment to the Millennium Goals and the Global Compact which we have been subscribed to since 2007. In the first place I would like to comment on the successful placement of COPEINCA bonds on the international  market, for 175 million dollars at the beginning of February. The operation exceeded all our expectations. This bond,  which impacted positively on our countrys image permitted us to carry out the short term investments needed  to improve our operational efficiency and comply with the highest environmental standards. In this way we can  position ourselves as the most efficient and profitable company in the sector. We are currently the second fishing  company in the country and, notwithstanding the moderate appearances of the Nio and Nia phenomenas, we  have demonstrated the strength of our operations and have continued with our investment projects.    We ended 2010 with more than 75% of our fleet equipped with a modern refrigeration system and 80% of our  plants prepared to produce 100% of our fish meal by indirect drying and very high quality. We perform our  work always with the objective of minimizing accidents both in the fleet and in the plants. In this regard during  2010 we have managed to considerably reduce the number of these accidents and the working days lost as a  consequence of these accidents.  We know that our employees have played a fundamental role in the excellent  business we have experimented in 2010. As a result, we have initiated the Ability Development Program for  all our organizations leaders, with which we reinforce teamwork, quality and compliance with results and above  all, leadership.  At the same time we have launched the Quality of Life Program, oriented towards balancing  the labor commitments and the family life of our employees. In social aspects we created COPEINCAs Volunteer Program in order to generate an interaction space between  our employees and the community and within which we began, in the month of April, the Eco-business School  Program. I am certain that all this will increase the number of volunteers next year and everyone will be infected  with the energy and enthusiasm of the students with whom they have shared their achievements. Finally, I would like to share with you COPEINCAs commitment to the Global Compact.  We were able to  participate for the first time in the United Nations Yearbook, which assembles the worlds best sustainability  practices that are promoted by means of the Compact.  In June the Global Compact Leaders Summit was  celebrated, organized by the United Nations and we were able to promote the principles of the Global Compact  and the Millennium Goals in the different meetings and dialogue tables in which we participated. This serves  to ratify our commitment with the initiatives we have adopted and consolidates Social Responsibility as a  transversal part of our organization. We invite you to revise the goals and objectives we have set for the future.  Our  conduct does nothing more than confirm the commitment of the company towards a profitable business,  that, in the medium term guarantees us environmentally friendly technological investments in order to counteract  the impact of our operations. We will continue to be committed and on route to achieving the sustainability of  the resources and of the business.  I would like to thank each of our employees who make it possible for us to be a sustainable company in time  with the vision and the energy to become better every day. Cordial greetings Samuel B. Dyer Coriat 1.Letter  from the CEO  Sustainability Report 2010 11  In COPEINCA we take responsibility  for our acts and always consider the  triple result, economic, social and  environmental.

Mission To produce and sell  fishmeal and fish oil with efficiency, quality  and responsibility. Vision To be the world leader in  the production of fish meal  and fish oil. Values 2.Mission,  vision and  values  Sustainability Report 2010 13  3.About COPEINCA a.  2010  Management  COPEINCA is concentrated in the production of fishmeal and fish oil covering completely  the value chain, from the capture of the fish to the final distribution. The company  operates anchovy vessels that fish off the coast of Peru and process the raw material in six  processing plants situated along the coast. The anchovy (Engraulis ringens) captured, in  addition to that purchased from third parties, is processed under the highest standards  of quality, ensuring a superior level of fishmeal.  With the release of this Fourth Sustainability Report 2010, COPEINCA reaffirms its  commitment to report the business economic management, integrated with the social  and environmental results recorded during 2010. From now on, management information  and the results obtained will be presented annually. Based on the Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI), the Global Compact principles and the Millennium Goals, this document  contains information on the plants of Bayovar, Chicama, Chancay, Ilo, Chimbote and  Huarmey, in addition to the administrative office in Lima. COPEINCA is a public limited company, established in accordance with Norwegian  legislation. As a company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE), we are subject to the  demands of corporate government established in that country and must therefore publish  an annual statement of our performance throughout the year on this subject, according  to the Norwegian Code of Corporate Government Practices.  For more information please  obtain the document through the following link:  http://www.copeinca.com.pe/website/content/pagina1.php?pID=544.  b.  Corporate  Government  Practices With the release of this Fourth Sustainability Report  2010, COPEINCA reaffirms its commitment to report  the business economic management, integrated with the  social and environmental results recorded during 2010  Sustainability Report 2010 15  Brief summary The maximum administrative authority in  our organization is the Board of Directors,  whose mission is to look out for the  interests of the shareholders, and ensure  enforcement of the company strategies in  order to achieve established objectives.  This Board is conformed by 4 Shareholder  Directors and 4 Independent Directors  including the Chairman of the Board who  does not occupy an executive position  within the organization. The independent members were invited  to form part of the Board after examining  their professional careers and personal  contributions in activities related to the  industry, both nationally and internationally. The current Board has been maintained  since 2009 and comprises the following  members: Kristjan Davidsson, Chairman Samuel Dyer Ampudia, Vice Chairman Mimi Berdal, Director Luis Dyer Ampudia, Director Piero Dyer Coriat, Director Sheyla Dyer Coriat, Director Marianne Elisabeth Johnsen, Director Ivn Orlic Ticern, Director The main committees held by the company  are:  Audit, Control and Risks.   Human Management, Ethics, Corporate  Government and Social Responsibility.  Strategies, Acquisitions and Finance.  Each year the Board evaluates its own  performance related to the previous period  by means of the publication of the annual  report, the financial statements and the  sustainability  report.  This  evaluation  includes  de  performance  of  each  committee, as well as that of each of the  directors.  c. Risk  Management  COPEINCA has implemented an integrated system of risk management in order to  preserve the integrity of its resources, increase its competitive advantage and guarantee  the continuity of the business in light of the different internal and external risks to which  the company is exposed. Risk management is a process that is carried out by the Board,  by management and by all employees in general in accordance with the company Risk  Administration Manual and based on the COSO ERM methodology. COPEINCA holds the conviction that, in order to consolidate and develop as a leading  company, it must observe enterprise objectives and ethical principles that must be  applied in its relationship with clients, suppliers, shareholders, employees and with  society in general. Ethics and integrity ensure the credibility of all the stakeholders  and the company expects all its employees to maintain the highest standards in these  principles.   Honesty, dignity, respect, loyalty, integrity, efficiency, transparency and awareness of  ethical principles are the greatest values that direct COPEINCAs relationship with its  public. In 2010, the company performed two biannual processes to identify and evaluate strategic  risks in which it did not identify corruption as a critical risk due to the low level of impact  and the probability of occurrence; consequently there has been no general training on the  subject.  Notwithstanding this, all company personnel receive the Code of Conduct and  the Internal Working Rules (RIT) manuals where the ethical behavior that is demanded  by our employees is specified. Additionally the company has an Anonymous Communication Line located on its web  site (www.copeinca.com.pe), which allows any employee, supplier or client to denounce  acts contrary to this Code and the Internal Working Rules, or any unethical behavior in  general that could involve company employees. COPEINCA holds the conviction that, in order to  consolidate and develop as a leading company, it must  observe enterprise objectives and ethical principles that  must be applied in its relationship with clients, suppliers,  shareholders, employees and with society in general.  Sustainability Report 2010 17  Risk Management System As part of the Boards commitment to corporate government practices, COPEINCA  has implemented a Risk Management System under the COSO ERM methodology that  positions us as one of the leading companies in Peru in implementing this tool. COSO ERM is a risk management model, accepted around the world that assists  companies to achieve their strategic objectives, efficiency and efficacy in their operations,  confidence in their financial reports and compliance with local and foreign laws and  regulations.    MEYCOR COSO Software for internal control and risks  In the second half of 2010, COPEINCA implemented this software for internal control  and risks (MEYCOR COSO) that permits the decentralization of its administration in the  areas of the company, identifying the threats that could affect our meeting the strategic  objectives of the projects and processes to be carried out.  COSO ERM is a risk management model, accepted around  the world that assists companies to achieve their strategic  objectives, efficiency and efficacy in their operations,  confidence in their financial reports and compliance with local  and foreign laws and regulations.  With this tool the various areas can better identify the actual controls that mitigate risks;  self evaluate them and propose improvement plans, as well as obtain indicators of our  risk management effectiveness in each company process. The MEYER COSO software will allow us to decentralize the administration of risks  and controls MEYCOR COSO as well as obtain indicators of the effectiveness of the  companys risk management.

Consequently, COPEINCA acts in accordance  with the challenges that establish social responsibility policies, the Millennium Goals  and the principles of the Global Compact of which it has been a member since 2007. This brings the company to contemplate in all its decisions the three grand axes of  economic growth, social development and environmental conservation, striving to  communicate and put into practice the principles and values of social responsibility in  all its processes, operations and areas of the company transversally.  The identification of the main risks and opportunities of the business is vitally important  for company development.

The company considers it fundamental to relay on the support and evaluation of each  Stakeholder with which it relates. Consequently, in 2004, an initial identification of all  stakeholders was carried out by all managers to determine the influence and impact  of each of them, this exercise was complemented by an specific image evaluation of  COPEINCA carried out by Conecta	Asociados to identify the main companies, institutions  and communities that are impacted by or impact on COPEINCA. Since then, all activities  considered some stakeholders described on the next page, however other stakeholders  identify are expected to be included in 2013 as a working policy for them is not implemented.

Various programs have been implemented  in order to comply with the objectives of the Social Responsibility policy. Programs are  carried out with the support of partners or strategic allies, coordinating directly with  COPEINCA activities for the well- being of the different Stakeholders.  Commitment to external initiatives The Global Compact COPEINCA was the first Peruvian fishing company to present a Sustainability Report.  This report was audited in 2005, and subsequently the company has presented reports  for the periods corresponding to 2006 – 2007 and 2008 – 2009, as can be seen on the  companys web site. These reports reflect the main indicators that show COPEINCAs  environmental and social performance, as well as the programs and activities carried out  within the framework of Social Responsibility.   The document is prepared on the basis of international indicators such as those of the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Millennium Goals and the principles of the Global Compact.  As a result, and thanks to the efforts of all our employees, from the first of COPEINCAs  Communications on Progress, the United Nations classified the Sustainability Report  presented as notable, which has been a great encouragement for the company and motivation  to continue with the firm challenge of constantly improving to satisfy the needs of our  Stakeholders.  To access this information please enter into the following link:  http://www.unglobalcompact.org/COP/analyzing_progress/notable_cops.html.  This years COPEINCA has actively participated in the Global Compact. Since 2010 the  companys best practices related to the 10 principles are published in the United Nations  International Yearbook. In June 2010, COPEINCA participated in the World Leaders Summit  held in New York in which we learned and exchanged relevant information with regard to the  strategy of the multinational companies.    a.

Sustainability Report 2010 29  RS TODOS During 2010, the second stage of the project took place. Formally, a public event was  organized in order to communicate in more detail the conclusions and recommendations  reached during the preparatory working stage which took place during 2009. We hope  that, in this way, we can achieve a more extensive communication of this responsibility  activity and perform the necessary follow up to the recommendations produced during  the two previous stages of preparation and communication.  Throughout this period the printing of the materials will be ensured to communicate them  and a mechanism will be established to follow up the recommendations that appeared in  the previous stages. The mechanism will be a proposal agreed by promoters and partners  of the project. Following the 2009 and 2010 commitments, the project continued its development in  Cajamarca, Piura, La Libertad and Arequipa, receiving support from four large sources:  civil society, (NGOs, unions, etc.), educational entities, private companies and the State.  The more representative common agreements were:  Strengthen the Regional Promotional Nucleus.  Define and establish specific social responsibility (SR) objectives and activities in each region.  Develop the communication actions and the company positioning.  Create a platform that permits group reflection, the sharing of interregional information  and the exchange of strategies.  Establish a SR week or month for a national campaign.  Recognize and incorporate other initiatives in the ESR process.  Raise regional information in order to know the situation, detecting resistances that  serve as sensitivity indicators generated by the ESR process. Eco- Business School Program This initiative began in 2010 with the Sustainable Development Promotion Institute (IPES)  which designed the enterpriser program of environmental education addressed to young  students during their last cycle of secondary school. Academically supported by the  Ministries of Education and Environment, the objective is to strengthen young peoples  capacities to identify reality, understand the functioning of the market and understand  the procedures and challenges that imply building, managing and administering an  economic business undertaking an environmentally friendly manner and developing  leadership and managerial skills to this end. The efforts of this initiative led the company to promote COPEINCA Volunteer Program to  motivate the participation of employees. To do this, groups of 4 or 5 persons were formed  to support each school in the development of their business plan, and make their Project  a profitable alternative in time. This was a virtual consultancy by means of the web page  designed especially for this initiative. Additionally, periodical visits were carried out to  strengthen the close communication between both parties. These are some of the programs achievements:   33 educational institutions trained.   2,598 hours of training given.   10 educational institutions benefited directly.   210 students benefited directly and 7000 indirectly.   More than 3000 families benefited.   105 hours of volunteer work.   5,727 dollars invested. APROs Management One of the strategic allies in sustainable development in each port where COPEINCA  operates is the Association of Producers of Fishmeal and Fish Oil (commonly called  APROs). With the APROs the objective is to strengthen the social responsibility and  environmental care activities that the company carries out.  Through the Image, Communications and Social Responsibility Committee of the National  Fishing Society (SNP), a Strategic Planning Manual was prepared to serve as a guide to  establish a diagnosis, define an social responsibility policy with guidelines, sustainable  schemes and common values, as well as other management and differentiation elements.  Throughout the year several meetings were held to approve the communication and  implementation of the guide in all the APROs so that they can constitute themselves as  corporate entities.  With the support and coordination of the National Fishing Society a management model  was produced for the APROs, defining guidelines to establish these associations as  corporate bodies.  Unanimously each APRO has a presidency led by a fishing company in  the zone. In the case of COPEINCA we assumed the presidency of APROSECHURA and  APROCHIMBOTE, as well as participating actively in APROCHICAMA, APROCHANCAY  and APROSUR. Generation of value – Direct and Indirect Economies The indirect economic impact constitutes an important part of the economic influence  that COPEINCA exerts in the context of sustainable development. While the direct  economic impacts and the market influence tend to center in immediate consequences  of the monetary flows towards stakeholders, the indirect impacts include the additional  effects generated by the money circulation in the economy. COPEINCA therefore is a  participant and socioeconomic change agent within the radius of influence where its  operations are carried out, proven by the creation of new business in the different zones.  During 2010 a total of 10 new enterprises have been recorded close to the company plants,  especially:   Restaurants   Stores   Lodgings In addition to generating indirect economic value, COPEINCA has a direct influence on  the economy through infrastructure investments, with an impact that goes beyond the  scope of the direct business operations. In this aspect we include social assistance and  equipment, activities that in 2010 added up to 26,477 dollars.  Sustainability Report 2010 31  As an objective in the Strategic Plan, during 2010 COPEINCA worked intensely at the  implementation of the Security and Occupational Health Management System based on  the international norm OHSAS 18001, first in all the fishing processing plants of Ilo and  Chicama but with the aim that by 2012 all plants would be certified. The operational controls are realized every day by the safety area, relying on the support  of the different headquarters of the plant and always led by the superintendent. Moreover,  these security requirements are also demanded for contractors as they receive inductions,  deliver their IPER table to prevent risks of accidents and occupational diseases in their  own employees as part of their Security and Occupational Health Management System. Jaime Pinedo, Corporate Chief of Industrial Security  The volunteer program in COPEINCA started in 2010 science the Eco-business School  program was launched. With this first initiative, employees were aware of the need  in different cities in Peru and wanted to share a special moment with children of lower  income neighborhoods. So, the Amor	a	Manos	Limpias activity was programmed and co- organized with the Nordic-Peruvian Chamber of Commerce and other affiliated companies. I was glad to participate in this activity; the idea was to share a special morning full of  teaching spaces and recreational moments with more than 350 children. The best part is  that as it was a Christmas time, all children were especially happy as all years studying  sacrifice was rewarded with this sharing activity. All volunteers spend a great morning  and we had the opportunity to make 350 kids happy Annia Vargas, Environmental System and Industrial Security Coordinator. Taking part in the volunteer program for Eco-Business was an amazing and enriching  experience for my group and me.  I know that many volunteers singed up thinking that it was a way of helping the boys and  girls from different lower income neighborhoods but we never imagine all the lessons  and experiences they gave us.  My group worked really hard with the girls who decided to recycle all plastic materials  (PET) into Echo bags. Seeing the illusion in these girls, dreaming, creating and finding  solutions to everydays difficulties involved us as volunteers reminding us that as human  beings we can always reach our goals especially when it comes to giving or sharing.  I strongly believe that it is possible to achieve much more with little time and commitment  that simply donating material goods. I feel happy to have known these girls, leaders of our community and role model.

In this way the purchasing processes, the stores, accounts and treasury are integrated in  the following activities:   Supplier registry (implemented).   Price contest (under trial).   Quotes.   Comparative charts.   Requests for purchase.   Confirmation of receipt of merchandise, registry and visualization of invoice status.   Programming and confirmation of payment.   Printing of tax retention certificates. With which the following benefits are obtained:   Reduction in supply costs.   Reduction in the purchasing cycle.   Less use of paper.   Reduction in manual charge for invoices.   Reduction in the emission process for retention certificates.   Reduction in telephone calls and e-mails to consult suppliers.   Increase in the level of service to our internal clients.   Improvement in commercial relationship with suppliers. We are currently developing the technical coordination so that the logistics operator  JOVIZA can register the suppliers dispatch note and its visualization in the SAP module. b. Suppliers Purchase of Materials The buying process is established with different national and international suppliers.  This year there has been an increase in international purchases related to the equipment  implementation in all COPEINCA fishing plants, due to the operational efficiency  processes carried out in 2010.

There was also a reduction in the fishing quota from 3.5 million tons to 2.5 million  tons for the second 2010 period, between April and May of 2010. With this reduction the  demand increased and transactions were agreed at levels of around US$ 1,900 per ton.  Even though the prices did not drop to the levels that were operative 2 years ago (US$ 800  and 900 per ton) they did fall and stayed between US$ 1,600 and 1,700 per ton. Around April, there was another occurrence that took the prices down and this was the  news of the delay in the aquaculture season in China, the principle consumer of fishmeal  in the world and the main buyer from Peru. In September and October 2010, when normally  50% of the new seasons fishmeal has been sold, the producers had not managed to sell  the production, due mainly to the delays in China. The European markets also began to  replace fishmeal in their formulas and therefore require less volume of the product than  previously. Finally the pre-sales for 2010-II began almost with the November production, before being  informed that La Nia phenomena would affect fishing. Later it was confirmed that the  season would be suspended temporarily and that the quota would only be around 38%  of the usual figure. With this suspension of the 2010-II season, Peru experienced another  price peak reaching US$2,000 per ton, dragging in its elevation the prices of the fishmeal  that was already in China. In spite of these occurrences, Peru did not reach these prices. Main Products Fishmeal  Fishmeal is protein concentrate based on fish (anchovy) presented in a powder form and  used for animal feed. There are two types of fishmeal depending on the drying process:  Steam Dried Fishmeal (SD): this is dried by transmission of heat without the flame  contacting the product.  Flame Dried Fishmeal (FD): this is dried by direct fire with the calorific action of the  flame in contact with the product.  Commercially speaking the life time of fishmeal is one year; however fishmeal with longer  periods must include an antioxidant in a dose of between 500 to 600 ppm. The production  date is printed on the bag and the brand is also included at the time of production.  There are markets (like China) that demand, in addition to the pre-printed brand, special  indications on the bag including product quality specifications (protein, TVBN, histamine,  salt and sand) as well as the plant registration number.  In Europe there must be a warning that the product is not apt for human consumption  and does not contain remains of mammal bones. For all shipments, especially bulk  shipments, where bags are not used and therefore no production date indicated, this  must appear on the Pre-shipment Surveyors Report, which is a certificate issued by a  specialized company. Fish Oil Is the fat content of the raw material (anchovy), extracted during the fishmeal production  process by the presses, it is centrifuged to separate water from the oil before polishing  the product in order to extract solids (lipoproteins) and water. This product is known as  crude fish oil and has a high content of essential fatty acids (Omega 3).  Fish oil does not have a specific expiry date that accompanies the product nor does it  contain additional substances such as the antioxidant of the fishmeal. Its quality depends,  among other things, on the use it is given and will also depend on the product parameters  at the time of shipment, such as acidity, anisidine and peroxides among others. The lower  the percentage of these parameters, the slower the solidification and therefore a better  quality of oil is obtained. The production date appears on the export documents.   Certified Operation All the COPEINCA plants are approved for operation by the Peruvian Fishing Technology  Institute (ITP) in accordance with the requirements and conditions established in the  Sanitary Standard for fishing and aquaculture activities. Additionally, all plants hold  certifications for BASC, GMPB2 and the IFFO Standard and for 2012 the certification with  ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 will be completed; currently only the plants of Chicama and  Ilo are certified with this norm. Finally, and depending on the destination, an additional  license or registry of the company and the plant is requested to allow entry into a specific  territory, as is the case of China, Taiwan and Russia among others.  Approximately 90% of the raw material caught by the company is refrigerated immediately  after capture and during the voyage to the processing plant by means of the RSW system  (Refrigerated Sea Water) with which the vessels are equipped. In this way the highest  standards of raw material freshness are guaranteed which means top quality fishmeal  with high protein and low levels of TVBN and histamine. As explained above, in order to export the fishmeal and fish oil, there must be certain  export documents that accredits the specifications of the same and the methods used  to obtain the results, ensuring therefore the quality not only on behalf of the company  but also by an independent third party. The documents that indicate origin and detail the  quantity shipped, the packing and the containers used must also be included.  c. Commercial  Management All the COPEINCA plants are approved for operation by the  Peruvian Fishing Technology Institute (ITP) in accordance  with the requirements and conditions established in the  Sanitary Standard for fishing and aquaculture activities.

Although China continues to be the main buyer of  fishmeal in 2010 its international share fell as a result of increases in other markets, such  as Vietnam and Japan and the delay in the aquaculture industry experienced by China  itself.  The main fish oil market during 2010 was the local one with a 37.96% share, followed by  Denmark with 25.42% (one of the main ports of entry to Europe). Chile and Belgium also  stand out with respective shares of 16.42% and 13.22%. It is important to note the growth  in Chile after the 2010 earthquake and its reduction in fishing quotas, it is hoped the  increase will be maintained during 2011.

In the case of fish oil, the refineries  maintained their share at 4% compared to 5% in the year before. It should be mentioned that  many of the local sales of fish oil go to refineries that export it to different markets. This is  the case of two local buyers who appear in the list of principle Peruvian exporters but buy  locally. With regard to distribution channels, during 2010 sales were channeled directly, increasing  from 48% to 59% with respect to 2009. The sales through representatives and brokers  were 28% and 13% respectively maintaining a similar share as that of the year before.  These results are based on a strategy of establishing long term relationships focused on  product quality and the security of a constant offer. Client Satisfaction Surveys For the second consecutive year a client satisfaction survey was carried out through on- line interviews. Ipsos Apoyo, consultancy company selected for this survey, guarantees  total confidence to the clients with their responses. Requests were sent to 74 clients around  the world and 56 replied (76%). The sample included final clients, traders and importers  of fishmeal and fish oil as clients whose main intermediaries are representatives and  brokers. The survey evaluated 7 attributes: re-purchase recommendation, quality of the  relationship, client attention, service, product quality, execution of dispatch and quality  of service in delivery of documents and product. In comparison to the year before, the  survey showed an improvement of +8 points in the general perception of the company. At  the same time COPEINCA is perceived as Top 3 by 66% of the clients evaluated (+4 points  compared to the year before).  The survey also permitted the identification of opportunities for corporate improvement.  As a result, for 2011 it is planned to continue with the evaluation so that the information  obtained can be of greater value for the company and can produce bigger and better  results for our clients. In comparison to the year before, the survey showed an  improvement of +8 points in the general perception of the  company.

In February, COPEINCA issued bonds for US$ 175 million in  a successful operation where the demand superseded all expectations on being over- subscribed five times with an equivalent of US$ 700 million. This was the first Peruvian  corporate bond issued in 4 years since a Peruvian company performed an operation of this  type, achieving a positive impact on the countrys image in the international marketplace.  The issue is going to allow COPEINCA to carry out in the short term, the necessary  investments to improve operational efficiency and continue to comply with environmental  standards and the new quota regulations. Consequently it will become the most efficient  and profitable company in the sector, progressing with this towards the vision of  consolidating itself as a world leader. At the same time, with the issue of this bonus the company could orient its financial  obligations to more competitive terms and conditions, as well as achieving positioning in  the group of companies with the highest standards of quality in the world.  The issue is going to allow COPEINCA to carry out in  the short term, the necessary investments to improve  operational efficiency and continue to comply with  environmental standards and the new quota regulations.

Environmental Management During 2010, COPEINCA managed to consolidate itself as the second Peruvian fishing  company with a total production of more than 106,000 tons of Fishmeal and 26,000 tons of  fish oil. Despite the fact that it was a difficult year, due to La Nia and El Nio phenomena  that brought about a reduction in production almost 50% lower than a normal year, the  company has confirmed the soundness of its operations, has obtained a positive cash  flow and has continued with its investment plan that will convert it into the most profitable  company in the sector.  To achieve this objective, the company has initiated the building of 3 vessels that signify  a landmark in the national fishing industry. The differentiation is due to the form and  fishing possibilities that the refrigeration system installed provides, from the catch to  the processing plant. These vessels as well as the plant and fleet investment plan are  going to permit us to become more efficient and to raise our standards of environment  protection. The installations will be friendly and will comply with the most demanding  certifications in environmental care (ISO 14001), as has occurred in the Chicama and Ilo  plants where we have implemented ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. Additionally, all the  companys plants currently have IFFO responsible supply certification and GMP + B2 for  nutritional safety.  For 2011, COPEINCA, due to its investments and the efficiencies achieved expects to  substantially improve the quality of its products and, as a consequence, the profitability  of its business, as well to contribute to the care of the environment and the preservation  of the anchovy biomass.  COPEINCA has acquired the Diamante fishmeal processing plant located in Chancay, the  equipment and machinery will permit an increase in the processing capacity. Something  similar took place in Chicama where part of the facilities was sold permitting COPEINCA  to stay with a processing capacity of 60 ton/hour that was transferred to another plant.  During 2010, COPEINCA managed to consolidate itself  as the second Peruvian fishing company with a total  production of more than 106,000 tons of Fishmeal and  26,000 tons of fish oil.  Sustainability Report 2010 47  More than US$30 million were invested in technological projects; US$17 million has  been directed invested in environmental improvements. This innovation process and  technological change will permit COPEINCA to become a point of reference for the sector  from the middle of 2011. The materials detailed in the following chart form part of the products used, in addition to  the anchovy, which is the main raw material: As can be seen in the chart Production Data below, during 2010 COPEINCA  felt the  presence of the El Nio and La Nia phenomena along the Peruvian Coast producing  a significant reduction in the anchovy catch, that at the same time was reflected in the  consumption of materials used within the productive process.  In 2009 there was a significant drop in the use of antioxidant (AO) in the productive  process: the reduction was from 0.92kg AO/ton of fishmeal to 0.62kg AO/ton of fishmeal  which implies a better use of our resources. This year the same effect is registered due  mainly to the climatic conditions and the quality of the fish that reduces the re-processing  and therefore the consumption of this material. With regard to second use bags that were  mainly discarded after bulk shipments, are now recycled and re-used which meant that  in 2010 45.6% of them were sold. More than US$30 million were invested in technological  projects; US$17 million has been directed invested in  environmental improvements. This innovation process and  technological change will permit COPEINCA to become a  point of reference for the sector from the middle of 2011. a. Principle  environmental  investments b.

Diesel 2 is also used by all the fishing fleet.  The indirect energy (non renewable) consumed comes mainly from the public network of  Hidrandina, EDELNOR and Electro Sur. As can be seen in the Energy Generation Chart, consumption has fallen in relation to 2009  due to a reduction in the national catch during the last months of 2010. The emissions of  greenhouse gases are also directly related to these low energy consumptions recording a  total of 87,781 tCO2e in 2010 which, compared to the 135,379 tCO2e in 2009, is a significant  reduction. In parts of the production process, such as dryers, coolers, and the stick water plant,  other gaseous emissions have been monitored since 2009.

In the summary chart below the activities and progress made are shown.  Sustainability Report 2010 51  As part of its environmental commitment, COPEINCA has implemented a series of  initiatives in all its plants in order to reduce the use of energy and positively contribute to  the environment:  In Bayovar, campaigns were carried out to encourage electrical energy savings during  the close seasons, at weekends or periods when there is no fish, reducing also electrical  consumption during the day. Among our employees we introduced a campaign for the  responsible use of computers, switching them off when not used for periods in excess  of 30 minutes and replacing the classical screens with more efficient energy use LCDs.  The air conditioning equipment has been replaced by modern equipment with less  consumption.  In Chicama, there is continuous maintenance of lighting and fluorescent energy savers.  The analogical screens have also been changed to digital obtaining a considerable  saving in electrical energy in addition to performing programmed maintenance on the  equipment and the air conditioning so that they are in perfect working order.  En Huarmey, there have also been sensitization campaigns among employees and the  efficient handling of lights operated during night by the security service guards.  In Chancay, with the new plant extension project being executed, the reactive energy  was reduced by means of the installation of a battery of condensers that permitted  a substantial saving for the company. At this site there was a migration of monitors  towards more efficient digital systems.  In Chimbote, the illumination installations are efficient and they are being extended to  all areas of the plant. The air conditioning is installed at 60% which produced savings  in electrical energy. All the old monitors have been changed for flat screens and all  employees have been asked to use electrical and electronic devices responsibly.  In Ilo, we are working with all personnel to make them aware of the need to save energy  and the security service guards perform controls to ensure that all electronic devices  does not remain switched on. 30 screens were changes for slim screens with less  electrical consumption  In Lima, computer equipment has been changed for new modern and slimmer  technology, recording consumption reductions from 70 W to 20 W, a saving of more  than 50%.  All our printers have also been changed for lower consumption models and  in terms of lighting we continue to use fluorescent lighting and saver bulbs. The main sources of water that supply the plants come from the public network, from  large tanks and our own wells. However, since 2009 we are also using river water, mainly  in the Chimbote plant, which has increased in 2010 as can be seen in the following chart.  As part of its environmental commitment, COPEINCA  has implemented a series of initiatives in all its  plants in order to reduce the use of energy and  positively contribute to the environment. c. Water  Consumption  Sustainability Report 2010 53  No source of water has been affected significantly by its extraction. Moreover, and thanks  to the improvements implemented in 2010, water consumption was recorded at 207,492  m3, 19% less than that recorded in 2009. A large percentage of the water that goes into the  productive process is re-used in the boilers (clean condensate) while dirty concentrate is  used to clean equipment, obtaining in 2010 a total of 19.2% of recycled water. At the end  of 2010, 853,696 m was poured back into the ocean, 57% less than in 2009. The industrial effluents consist of water for unloading raw material which is used as a  means of transporting the fish from the dock to the plant.  Before, the blood water –  from the storage of raw material in the wells-, formed part of these effluents. However at  present, this is reintroduced into the productive process as it contains high protein values  and does not contaminate the ocean when discharged. Plant Bayovar Chicama Chimbote Huarmey Chancay Ilo Average Fat and Oil BOD5 Total Suspended  Solids (TSS) 2009 3,061 3,719 4,593 2,099 3,440 5,144 2009 28,597 28,805 38,109 22,792 20,483 14,170 2009 13,717 14,253 15,642 10,345 7,016 7,325 2010 2,995 1,323 2,040 1,932 1,633 943 2010 28,698 13,136 21,573 16,264 8,475 3,950 2010 14,983 6,930 10,569 14,457 7,148 2,597 Units: mg/lt.  As it can be seen, the improvements and efficiencies implemented since 2009 are  reflected in the significant reduction in concentrations of oils, fats, suspended solids and  BOD5 that are monitored regularly by an accredited external laboratory.  The use of pumping water begins with the ecologic TRANSVAC bomb, where the relation  of water/raw material is maximum 1:1, resulting in a lower volume of water to be treated  than with traditional pumps.  The recovery of solids follows larger than 0.5 o 1mm  depending on the plants, the Trommels or the rotary drums. These solids are stored and  subsequently returned to the process together with the raw material. The recovery of fat is performed in flotation cells where micro bubbles carry the fat to the  surface. The resulting effluent from this process still has fats and solids, which is why it  is taken to a foam collection tank. This foam is heated so that it can then pass on to a  separation of solids process and a fat separation process by a centrifuge operation. The  solids recovered are added to the fishmeal manufacturing process and the oil recovered  is stored. The final effluent is sent to the ocean by means of an underwater piping system.  The main concentrations are shown in the following chart:  A large percentage of the water that goes into the  productive process is re-used in the boilers  (clean condensate) while dirty concentrate is used to  clean equipment, obtaining in 2010 a total of 19.2% of  recycled water. 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Well Water Consumption Tank Water Consumption Pub.

The useable dangerous residues, such as batteries and oil, are recycled by a  Solid Waste Commercialization Company (EPS-RC) giving value by means of specialized  treatment.  In the case of non dangerous solid waste, if they are handled by the Municipality they are  managed through the corresponding institution and if they are industrial and re-useable  they can be subjected to different types of treatment:  Internal recovery: metal cylinders, bags of salt, rubber tires, and discarded plastic  sheets, pieces of wood.  Sale to third parties; scrap, PVC  buoys, pieces of netting, fishmeal bags, wooden  residue, fish oil  residues, organic process residues.  Internal or external donation: cardboard and paper remains, glass residue air filters. As an efficient company COPEINCA seeks to obtain a maximum reduction in volumes of  solid residue generated and at the end, that these residues receive treatment, as occurs  in 75% of the cases at present:  The management of solid waste begins with segregation in different devices distributed  at various points in the plant. After segregation, if the residue is dangerous, it is taken to a  temporary store for dangerous residues that has all safety measures installed demanded  by national legislation.  Subsequently solid waste that cannot be used are disposed through the Solid Waste  Service Company (EPS-RS) which is authorized by the Municipality and registered in the  General Direction of Environmental Health (DIGESA). The residues are taken from the  In order to manage the dangerous and non dangerous solid residues there is a Corporate  Solid Waste Procedure that governs the management of the residues generated in all  plants. In the graph below, the total waste generated by the company can be seen. An  increase in non dangerous solid waste was registered in 2010 as well as in dangerous  solid waste due principally to the waste generated by the implementation of different  projects at all the sites. d.

Human  Management The challenge for 2010 was to align all the employees to work practices that would  lead COPEINCA to becoming a world leader in the production of fishmeal and fish oil.  Consequently the general management decided to begin a Leadership Skills Development  Program, better known as DHL. The program was selected as a special need to orient the  company leaders toward one single and unique style of managing people, identifying four  key leadership competences that will have to be developed together with the employees  under their charge:   Transformer leadership   Development of teams   Continuous improvement   Orientation towards results These four competencies are worked through a series of workshops, individual and group  coaching sessions implemented by the human management together with the support of  JML Consultants. In the first stage, 360 surveys were carried out with the employees so  that the performance of the leader participating in the program could be evaluated. Later,  with the official opening of the program the first workshop of transformer leadership  took place with the team of managers. In the second stage the workshops and coaching  sessions were covered more deeply and finally, in the third stage, surveys were carried  out with all the employees in order obtain the programs results and their impact on day  to day work. Quality of Life Program  COPEINCA began the Quality of Life Program in September 2010. The main objective is  to provide an working environment and companionship for all the companys employees.  The human management, through the social management area, focuses on the needs of  employees in terms of physical, emotional and affective health (family integration). The quality of life at work covers all the efforts we can make in order to improve all  employees motivation. This idea seeks to implement personalized transcendental  motivation programs with the objective of generating physical, social and emotional  welfare for all employees and their families. Consequently, in order for the program to be  successful, it is fundamental to be able to rely on the best attitude of each employee in  order that, as is occurring, the best results are obtained. The challenge for 2010 was to align all the employees to  work practices that would lead COPEINCA to becoming a  world leader in the production of fishmeal and fish oil. a.  Main human  management  programs   Sustainability Report 2010 59  Occupational Health One of the first programs implemented during 2010 was occupational health in which a  series of measures and actions aimed at maintaining, improving and repairing the health  of people in their working, social and personal lives were implemented. The program  includes planning, organizing executing and evaluating activities related to safety and  hygiene and preventive medicine, with the objective of creating a healthier and safer  working environment for all employees. At the end of the program an area designated for the filing of our employees clinical  histories will be implemented. This is an essential tool needed to finalize the ISO and  OHSAS certifications. Additionally the company will subscribe agreements with  specialized centers for the benefit of personnel:  like gyms, educational and recreational  facilities for the family, centers to relax, optical services among others. The medical evaluations of the employees were taken by Millenium Service Company, a  specialized supplier contracted by means of a public bid, coordinated with the logistics  area, following a timetable established for each plant. Leaders of Communication and Change In 2009 the COPEINCA Network of Communication and Change Leaders was created. In  this network, a group of employees performed the work of informing and communicating  information to all the company areas and levels, through the receipt of concerns,  promoting good relations and transmitting interesting news. The network helped in the  improvement of the working environment, the welfare of the employees and to catalyze  and resolve obstacles or internal communication difficulties by means of a satisfactory  handling of the companys official information.  The network is supported directly by the human management area and supports the  general management in divulging aspects that are related to the welfare and development  of COPEINCAs employees. In 2010 The First Meeting of Leaders of Communication and  Change was held and managed by Eco Consultants. The main objective was to strengthen  interpersonal relations as well as the communication abilities of each leader, through 12  hour immersion training courses. By the end of 2010, the program is working with 139  leaders in the whole organization. COPEINCA promotes a safe and healthy working environment in such a way that not  only are the rights of personnel not affected but also, promoted and developed among  all employees. Consequently we work with a management policy that indicates that  all members of the company should develop on the principle of equal conditions and  opportunities and, as a result, have access to the same benefits and remunerations  according to their position within the companys hierarchy. During 2010 no specific  training in Human Rights was carried out and yet we have not identified discriminatory  practices or actions within the organization.   With regard to child labor, COPEINCA has specific conditions detailed in the Internal  Working Rules RIT) in which it is specified that in order to work in the company all  employees must meet a series of conditions, one of which is that of being at least 18  years old. This is why no processing plant or office was identify as a potential risk for  child labor.  COPEINCA promotes a safe and healthy working  environment in such a way that not only are the rights  of personnel not affected but also, promoted and  developed among all employees.  b.  Human Rights,  diversity and  equal  opportunities  This code has been applicable since 2009 and is the document that indicates the  guidelines or principles that the organization expects of its employees. The Code serves  as a reference for the acts and behavior of all COPEINCA members. Its objective is to  guarantee the companys good reputation and promote among all the employees a  commitment to integrity and excellence.   An anonymous channel of communication has been implemented by which all employees  can inform and record any incompliance or fault to the Code of Conduct.  At the end of 2010 the company had a total of 1,620 employees, significantly less than  2009 due to reductions of workers in the fleet area that represent a high percentage of the  total number of company employees.  In general terms, the entry of personnel corresponds to a selection process to cover  vacant positions. The turnover of crew is due to the fact that many vessels were discarded  in order to have a lower number of more efficient units. 2010 CATEGORY Managers Superintendents/ Heads  Office Staff Plant Staff Crew Practicing Students Total ENTRIES 1 2 48 91 4 15 161 LOSSES 1 0 62 46 494 22 625 The employees recruitment process depends on the RIT requirements. On recruiting,  the most important element is to find an ideal collaborator for the position to be filled.  This person may or may not come from the zone where the work will take place, however  COPEINCA recognizes the importance of the person being near to his/hers family and  this criteria is considered at the time of recruitment. The search process is performed in  the work zone and nearby, in case no qualified person is found the search is extended to  zones further away and could even be performed outside Peru.  In the Chancay, Chimbote and Huarmey plants, COPEINCA has labor unions that in 2010  represented a total of 8.95% of the companys labor force. These unions are plant unions  and do not belong to external labor organizations.  COPEINCAs policy of labor benefits is directed at all employees and particular efforts are  made in the company leaders occupying management, superintendent or chief positions.  The benefits are revised periodically to ensure they are up-to-date, remain competitive  and effectively respond to new situations and challenges that the company faces. Among the main benefits we have:   Food   Fishing Incentive   EPS Health Insurance   Life Insurance    Personal transport vehicle   Fuel, maintenance, general insurance and 3rd party insurance.   Loans    Stock options   Schooling   Transport of personnel to the plant   Complementary all risk insurance and pension   Lap top The remunerations offered by COPEINCA are considerable higher than the minimum  wage in Peru which in 2010 were held at S/. 550.00. The companys employees record a  minimum wage that is 62% higher than the legal minimum.

After  completing the format to raise training needs for each area, priorities are determined  for each formation in order to place priorities on the more relevant and which fit into the  operational plan of the corresponding area, as well as the budget assigned for training.  All areas of the company have a special budget for this, although some areas have  more than others in response to the companys strategic plan. The areas of production  and quality and research receive more training hours, as well as more specialization in  technical matters, as a result they are assigned a larger percentage of the budget. As for  the production areas, each plant has its own budget, which is administered directly by the  Superintendent and reported to the of human management area.   During 2010 a total of S/. 235,000 have been invested, representing 29,672 hours of training.  As part of the Leadership Skills Development Program (DHL), in 2010 COPEINCA focused  on performance evaluations directed especially to managers, superintendents, section  heads and supervisors of all the units that have personnel under their responsibility. By the  end of 2010, a total of 122 employees have been evaluated. For the year 2011 the development of the evaluation program will continue as well as the  monitoring of progress programmed for each leader. In special cases referring to the  incorporation of personnel, during the program development, only leaving reports will be  applied. The BASC certification promotes the implementation of a self-management program  based on the principal of better practices and continuous improvement that guarantee the  security of international commerce. In order to verify the conformity of the Management  System for Secure Commerce – BASC, a systematic process of evaluations is established,  through audits that lead later to the certification which lasts one year. A work plan and a  specific timetable are currently being developed to carry out BASC evaluations at all the  sites including Lima. f.   Skills  development  g. Performance  Evaluations h.

For 2011 the  plants of Ilo, Chicama, Bayovar and Chimbote are expected to hold these international  certifications. Additionally a special budget has been assigned for the improvement of the  security structure at all sites.  In accordance with Supreme Decree N 009 – 2005 – TR, COPEINCA has a committee  for health and safety at work comprising company management representatives and  representatives of the workers, with an equal participation percentage. The worker  representatives are elected by means of a vote among employees from the plants and the  fleet.   Finally, in coordination with human management, annual safety training programs have  been established and are communicated by the mural newspapers, Incasite and El	Anzuelo  magazine. In the following chart the results of the main indexes of accidents are presented. Accidents in Plant Accidents de Fleet Days Lost in Plant Days Lost in Fleet 2007 15 25 353 916 2009 11 126 466 13,130 2008 39 134 719 3,736 2010 24 76 390 2,155 As can be seen in the table, during 2010, accidents in the plants have increased by 118%  with regard to 2009. This is mainly due to the fact that throughout this year a greater  number of investment projects have been carried out in the plants, leading to a greater  number of accidents. Despite this however, the days lost in the plants are significantly  lower than in previous years meaning that accidents were less serious. These campaigns are fundamental in COPEINCAs labor management due to the influence  they have on the employees and their physical, mental and social well-being and the fact  that they lead to the full development of the individual.  The programs are grouped in three types:    Preventive: in order to avoid risks and the development of diseases.   Promotional: to improve living conditions, productivity and work.   Occupational: to detect, control, monitor and prevent future diseases. The main problems in which intervention is necessary to prevent, control and monitor  are the work accidents and the occupational and regular diseases of the employees. The  high index of medical days off produces important losses for the company and, in the  long term, affects the employee. In 2010 strategies have been developed to reduce work  accidents, in coordination with the insurance companies who have the responsibility of  carrying the companys human risk, by the end of 2010 92% of employees have been  evaluated in occupational health. i.

La Victoria  Lima  From our consideration:  This letter aims to perform the Third Party Checked to confirm compliance with the Level B of the 2010  Sustainability Report of Corporacion Pesquera Inca SA, according to the requirements of the Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI).  Our external verification was based on a detailed review of the report according to the outlines of the "Guide for the  Development of Sustainability Reporting" from the GRI G3. The conclusions of this analysis will be developed in this  letter, included the following points:    The overview of the alignment with the principles of GRI for the development of sustainability reports.   The confirmation of the grade B, according to the fulfillment of the reported performance indicators  necessary to achieve that level.    Recommendations for improving future reports.    In the following lines we develop our conclusions:  1. Alignment with the principles of the GRI  The 2010 Sustainability Report complies with the principle of Materiality for several reasons. In addition to  providing relevant information on its overall performance, the report clearly explains the key impacts, risks and  opportunities of the company from the standpoint of sustainability. It also notes that suggestions have been  compiled in order to report relevant information for a particular stakeholder.   On the other hand, the report offers a wealth of information on environmental performance; we nevertheless  consider that the contents of management with communities need more precision about the scope, description of  interventions and the results obtained.  As for the management of the value chain, we believe it is necessary to know whether the practices  of sustainability and human rights that the company describes are being extended to their suppliers or not. In the  Peruvian fishing industry, a responsible management of suppliers should not be limited to the management of  purchasing indicators.  The 2010 Sustainability Report complies with the principle of Stakeholder Inclusiveness as it lists all of them and  notes that the organization regularly conducts studies to identify and to determine their impacts and understand  their perceptions and attitudes. It also lists the issues that have been incorporated into the report, after having collected  the information expectations of the stakeholders consulted through a survey.  The report is also aligned with the principle of Sustainability Context because it explains the outlook and approach of  the company in relation to the integral action. As well, it addresses the relationship established between the challenges  of sustainability of the company, its stakeholders, activities and goals.  On the principle of Completeness, it would be important for future opportunities to point out the magnitude of the  companys performance, including key indicators of the behavior of third parties or suppliers.

Compliance with the necessary indicators to confirm the application level B  The 2010 Sustainability Report of Corporacion Pesquera Inca SA develops all the profile  information and management approach of the organization as well as 63 performance indicators, 40 of which are  core and 23 are additional.  According to the GRI guidelines, to meet the application level B the organization must report a minimum of 20 core  performance indicators and at least one from each dimension (economic, environmental, human rights, labor  practices, society and product responsibility). Therefore, the analysis allows us to confirm that the 2010 Sustainability  Report meets the level B.  3. Opportunities for improving future reports  Due to the importance of certain aspects of the industry which Copeinca belongs to, and the relevance of certain  stakeholders, we believe there are some key aspects to consider when developing this publication.   We think it is imperative to report the management of the value chain more fully due to the high impact it has in  the activity, as the fleet of third parties does. While the management of social responsibility starts with  the internal standards, sometimes the wider impact of the exercise is produced through these actors.   It is necessary to know the company's position on relevant issues for the industry and the sustainability of the  fishing resources, such as the quota law. This content is clearly related to the sustainability issues described in the  report.   The topics related to social management must also be addressed more fully, specifying impact, scope and  scale. Also, the section on APRO can pick up these issues with greater emphasis, if the management  of community relations of the company is being channeled through them.   We recommend the organization to gather up and highlight more case studies with concrete stories that  illustrate how social responsibility has been introduced and managed by the organization.  Responde is a consulting firm specialized in the promotion of social responsibility and reputation management, and  was not involved in drafting this sustainability report. After the arguments presented, we can confirm that the  2010 Sustainability Report of Corporacion Pesquera Inca SA qualifies to meet the application level:              B: Third Party Checked  Sincerely yours,   Jorge Melo Vega Castro     General Manager   Sustainability Report 2010 73  3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 4.10 4.11 4.12 4.13 4.14 4.15 4.16 4.17 EC0 EC1 EC2 EC3 EC4 EC5 EC6 EC7 EC8 EC9 EN0 6 - - - 6 28 47 - 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 6 6 7 16 12 13 13 13 11,13 26 26 26 40 - 40 19 39 18 18 28 - - - - - - - - From 1 to 10 From 1 to 10 From 1 to 10 From 1 to 10 From 1 to 10 From 1 to 10 From 1 to 10 From 1 to 10 From 1 to 10 From 1 to 10 7 From 1 to 10 From 1 to 10 - - - - 1,4,6,7 - 7 - - 1 - 6 - - 7,8,9 - There are no limitations   We have no subsidiaries We report on the basis of GRI protocols a. 2010 Management Environmental Management - This years report was verified  by Responde (see letter). b.
