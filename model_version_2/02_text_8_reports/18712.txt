THE ROAD TO SUSTAINABILITY 2012 SUSTAINABILITY REpORT THE ROAD TO SUSTAINABILITY HYUNDAI MOTOR cOMpANY      2012 SUSTAINAbIlITY RepORT  REpORTINg gUIDELINES  HMcs 2012 Sustainability Report has been produced in line with the G3 Global Report- ing Initiative guidelines which were set out in October 2006. The table on pages 90 and  91 of the Report shows where to find the information that corresponds with each of  the GRI Indicators. pERfORmANcE DATA cOLLEcTION pROcESS  Data regarding business performance, environmental management and social contribution  is displayed in tables and graphs which are managed by HMC staff from the relevant  departments. At the beginning of each calendar year, the Environmental Strategy  team collects the data via the company intranet which is then reviewed and analyzed.  the process by which environmental performance data is collected and managed is  reviewed annually by outside experts during the ISO 14001 certification procedures. Key  environmental performance data on greenhouse gas emissions, water use and waste  are collected from both domestic sites and overseas. However, some environmental  performance data and most of the social contribution activities data are collected only  from domestic operation sites. Work is under progress to improve the data collection  system to include a greater proportion of overseas operation sites. REpORTINg pERIOD AND ScOpE  this report covers quantitative results from the 2011 calendar year and qualitative  results from January 2011 to March 2012. the report includes sustainability activities at  HMC headquarters, domestic sales offices, service centers, distribution centers, training  centers, manufacturing plants and r&D centers, as well as overseas manufacturing plants,  sales offices, regional headquarters, overseas offices, overseas r&D centers and other  related companies (import companies, auto financing firms and advertising firms). ASSURANcE  Between 2003 and 2006, HMC hired third-party assurance experts to review the  contents of our Sustainability report. Beginning in 2006, we organized an external  review committee made up of sustainability experts to enable  more detailed review and  feedback. In 2008, we held a series of meetings with key representatives from various  stakeholder groups including investors, government, NGOs, sustainability experts and  suppliers, and endeavored to take into consideration their opinions when the report  was being produced. In 2009 and 2010, we organized the Sustainability report review  Committee to assess how well we responded to stakeholder demands in the report. In  2011 and 2012, we commissioned third-party auditors to verify the data in the report.  Data collection, report drafting and internal reviews were carried out in collaboration with  the Environmental strategy team, who were in charge of the reports publication, and  relevant HMC teams responsible for the content of different parts of the report. Since 2003, the Hyundai Motor company (HMc) has been publishing a corporate  Sustainability Report entitled The Road to Sustainability. Through the publication  of this Report, HMc reaffirms its commitment to sustainable business management,  sharing our achievements with our stakeholders and promoting an enhanced under- standing of HMcs sustainability management.

Cultivating a new automobile culture based on mutual benefits, and taking responsibility for future  generations are the core objectives of HMCs sustainable management. This year marks the tenth  anniversary of the publication of our first Sustainability Report back in 2003.

HMCs corporate philosophy and activities are deeply rooted in sustainability and all HMC members including myself are  dedicated to promoting sustainability.  Humanity is facing a number of serious challenges including energy shortage, climate change, depletion of natural resourc- es and an ever increasing polarization of society. These challenges have significant impacts on businesses at many different  levels. However, although the challenges pose threats they also present new opportunities. In this light, sustainable business  management can serve as an engine for future growth by encouraging and stimulating us to tackle these challenges in a  proactive and innovative manner. We need to invest in the protection of our ecosystem and to tackle other environmental problems which left alone could  have a significant negative impact on our livelihoods. This is especially true for the automobile industry considering the large  amount of resources that are used and the emissions associated with the manufacture and use of automobiles. Automobile  manufacturers therefore, are striving to achieve sustainable mobility, both as a moral obligation and as something which  is imperative to our business. In addition, we will continue to make improvements in vehicle performance, safety and afford- ability. HMC has set the realization of sustainable mobility as its ultimate goal and created a growth strategy for achieving  this goal. We have been making significant investments in the development and commercialization of green vehicles. In 2011, we re- leased the Sonata Hybrid in both the North American and Korean markets. Additionally, we successfully conducted demon- stration programs for Hydrogen fuel Cell electric vehicles and electric vehicle. HMC will continue investing in green vehicle  development and we aim to produce a much larger number of them in the very near future. In 2011, our annual global sales hit the four million mark as our investment in green vehicle technology increased. HMC has  a long way to go but I firmly believe that these record high sales figures are proof that we are getting closer to achieving our  vision to ultimately become a truly beloved car company. The healthy growth of a corporation can only be achieved through organic collaboration with stakeholders, based on mutual  trust. Therefore, HMC manages its business focusing on the mutual benefits of key stakeholders including customers, inves- tors, employees, suppliers and local communities. In fact, we have placed responsible business management as the core of  our sustainable growth strategy.  We would never have come this far without your continued support. I would like to ask for your feedback and continued sup- port in the future. Thank you.

The management philosophy of a company is the basis of its business management and provides its  reason for existence. Using HMCs traditional values and spirit as a basis, the essence of our man- agement philosophy is summarized in three key ideas: unlimited sense of responsibility, realization  of possibilities and respect for mankind. These three key ideas were used as the basis for our new  management philosophy, Realizing mankinds dream by creating a new future through ingenious  ideas and continuously challenging new frontiers. The sense of unlimited responsibility signifies the pursuit of sustainable growth through a deep  sense of responsibility towards our stakeholders. The realization of possibilities signifies our pio- neering spirit that has driven HMC to new business frontiers. The love for humanity represents our  will to contribute to the improvement of living conditions for all humanity. Using this new manage- ment philosophy as our guide, the Hyundai Motor Company will continue its growth as a respected  company making a positive contribution to humanity. VISION  Lifetime partner in automobiles and beyond To become a trusted lifetime partner for our customers, we will bring a new perspec- tive to automobiles through innovative mobility solutions based on human-centric, eco- friendly technologies and services. The new Vision 2020 presents clear sustainable growth goals for all members of the Hyundai   Motor Group, as well as setting out what we must strive to achieve. Automobiles are no longer just a  means of transportation that connect people but another space for living. Vision 2020 is designed to  embrace the changing values and philosophy of what automobiles mean to society. By pursuing this  vision, HMC has set out to become not just a car maker but a company that creates new values, a  company beloved by customers, and ultimately, a lifetime partner to our customers. fIVE cORE VALUES  We have selected five core values customer, challenge, collaboration, people and globality to help  us implement our new management philosophy and realize the vision of 2020. The five core values  were created using the following process. First, we identified the unique characteristics embedded in  HMCs employees that have contributed to our success so far. Then we mixed in sustainable values,  creating something useful for guiding our actions. The core values will serve as a guide not only for  HMCs business management activities but also to strengthen its community of members and to  provide a basis for sustainable growth and development. cORpORATe  pHIlOSOpHY The Hyundai motor companys power to create a sustainable future lies in its  willingness to tackle challenges and in its respect for creativity. In 2011, Hmcs  corporate philosophy was revised to set firm guidelines for overcoming all challenges  in our path towards accelerated growth and to making a greater contribution  towards achieving sustainability for humanity. 1 2 3 cORE cONcEpTS  EmBEDDED IN  mANAgEmENT  pHILOSOpHY  Pursue sustainable growth in order to provide for not only HMCs employees and their families but  also those of our suppliers Pursue the best quality in products to ensure safety and satisfaction of customers that lasts a Iifetime Foster DNA that strives for never-ending growth and advancement  Nurture an entrepreneurial spirit which enables us to break out of our comfort zone and to take risks      in light of greater success Create authentic values by turning small possibilities into real achievements  Contribute to improving general living conditions by providing products and services of the highest  quality for the greatest number of people Proactively tackle environmental issues and make contributions to local communities worldwide Unlimited sense of  responsibility Realization of  possibilities Respect for mankind lIfeTIMe  pARTNeR We will provide brands, products and  services that are tailored to the needs  of customers from youth to post- retirement.

The creation and fair sharing of multiple value streams with  stakeholders is a necessary part of realizing sustainable development for the  future. Using our long-term CSR strategy as its guide, the Hyundai Motor Group  will strive to share the sustainable values that are created through partnership  with our key stakeholders. Stakeholders The Hyundai Motor Group has achieved significant business growth through  close collaboration with stakeholders and is fast becoming a global leader in  the automotive industry. In sustainability management, all stakeholders are  important partners who create and share future values. The Hyundai Motor  Group will strive to identify key social issues through close interaction with its  key stakeholders including local communities, customers and employees and  will incorporate measures for tackling these issues into our CSR Strategy.

The CSR Committee is responsible for activities in three core areas including  environmental management, trust-based management and social contribution. With guidance from  the CSR Committee, HMC joined the UN Global Compact and declared its commitment to fulfill its  social responsibilities throughout its business practices. The UN Global Compact is a voluntary initia- tive launched by the UN that seeks to align business operations and strategies globally using ten uni- versally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption.  We renewed our CSR Charter shortly after joining the UN Global Compact in April 2009 and estab- lished a CSR taskforce with responsibility for establishing our long-term CSR strategy up to 2020 and  for setting the foundations for its implementation.  Our long term CSR goal is To become a sustainable value provider. We have selected seven core  project areas: growth with partners, provision of pleasant mobility, to be a responsible business  partner, promotion of transparent business management, to be a company that people can trust,  to be a great company to work for and to lead on climate change response. We have selected  stakeholders who are most suitable for each project area and are focusing on the creation of a sus- tainable future based on our partnerships with stakeholders. ENVIRONmENTAL mANAgEmENT  In 2003, HMC announced its new environmental management philosophy and policies, and since  then has been pursuing green growth whilst striking a healthy balance between business growth and  environmental protection. Rather than just focusing on regulation compliance, we are focusing our  efforts more proactively on environmental management such as creating new market opportunities  by improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. With this goal in mind, we are also striving to re- duce the negative environmental impact associated with the lifecycle of our products. HMC is focus- ing on implementing Blue Drive, a strategy that currently focuses on improving the fuel efficiency of  vehicles powered by internal combustion engines and seeks to supply zero emission vehicles in the  future.  Aiming to strengthen its capacity to respond to global environmental issues and regulations, HMC  identified climate change, recycling, air quality and hazardous materials as the core issues and es- tablished an environmental management structure accordingly. Climate change has been identified  as the top priority, at present. Therefore, we are concentrating our effort on reducing CO2 emissions  of both our automobiles and our operation sites. SUSTAINAbIlITY  MANAGeMeNT  pROMOTION  STRUcTURe As a responsible corporate citizen, Hmc strives to achieve mutual growth with its  stakeholders, by considering business efficiency, environmental impact and our  social responsibility, when making business decisions. 1 2 12 Stakeholders  enviRonmenT SocieTy appendix economy SUSTAINABILITY mANAgEmENT HMC 2012  SuStAINABIlIty  rEPOrt 14 14 15 HMCs ethical management policies were designed to foster a corporate culture based on fairness.  In 2001, HMC established the HMC Ethics Charter, the Employee Code of Conduct, and the Guide- lines for Ethical Business Conduct to set clear guidelines for all its employees. In 2008, we joined the  UN Global Compact which provides principles for all employees to help them comply with all relevant  laws, regulations and also to respect accepted social norms. HMC has also been conducting training  on fair trade and anti-corruption to foster a corporate culture where employees can make ethically  correct decisions when faced with difficult situations that may involve ethical dilemmas.  In order to improve transparency in the management decision making process, HMC also estab- lished an ethics committee in 2007, which is composed of external directors. In 2011, we adopted  the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in order to increase the transparency of our  accounting practices. HMCs Ethical Management practice has evolved considerably in order to further promote trans- parency and fairness. In 2002, we adopted a voluntary Fair Trade Compliance Program in order to  ensure fair trade with our suppliers. HMC signed its third fair trade agreement with a record number  of suppliers in 2011. HMCs ethical management policies are making a considerable contribution  towards strengthening HMCs competitiveness and creating new economic values by eliminating the  source of a number of management inefficiencies. REgULATION cOmpLIANcE Complying with all laws and regulations, as well as respecting internationally accepted norms of  business conduct in all its business practices is a key business principle within HMC. With that prin- ciple as a basis, HMC also strives to promote the voluntary compliance with all regulations, and has  created a Fair Trade Compliance Program to prevent any unfair business conduct. fair trade agreement with suppliers Since we signed our first fair trade agreement with our supplies in September 2008, we have contin- ued to uphold it, resigning the fourth fair trade agreement in 2012. In 2009, the Fair Trade Commission awarded HMC the AA rating for our thorough implementation of  the fair trade promotion activities including improvement of payment conditions and the creation of  a number of supplier support funds.  More recently, HMC created new supplier support schemes including the Share Growth Fund, R&D  Support Corps and sector-specific supplier training after signing its third fair trade agreement with  202 suppliers.   eTHIcAl  MANAGeMeNT  AND cORpORATe  GOveRNANce Transparency and high ethical standards are required for all businesses. Hmc has  earned the trust of our stakeholders through our transparent and ethical business  conduct. We will continue to foster a sound corporate culture by encouraging all  of our employees to understand the merits of ethical management and strictly  enforcing a high ethical standard. 1 3 4 TRUST-BASED mANAgEmENT Companies can only grow with the support of their stakeholders. HMC has been pursuing a strategy  of shared growth by establishing trust-based relationships with our stakeholders including custom- ers, employees, investors, suppliers and local communities. Mutual respects as well as transparent  and ethical business operations are the key principles in earning the trust of our stakeholders. HMC  is persistently communicating the value of trust-based management to stakeholders while making a  continuous effort to further improve transparency and ethical standards in our business. SOcIAL cONTRIBUTION AcTIVITIES As a responsible corporate citizen, HMC has been devoting significant resources to creating a better  society for all members of the global community as part of the work that comes under our CSR motto  Moving the World Together. Moving the World Together social contribution projects are our flagship social welfare programs tai- lored for people in need. We also conduct various other CSR activities that fall into categories such  as Easy Move, Safe Move, Green Move and Happy Move depending on the nature of the project. We also conduct CSR activities in areas including social welfare, education, art and culture and also  sport. In 2003, we established a long term CSR management roadmap to ensure that our activities  are carried out in an efficient manner, leading to tangible changes. Our sustained efforts in CSR  haves led to the establishment of a global CSR promotion structure with effective programs and a  large number of volunteers. We will continue to improve our implementation structure to fulfill our  rightful role as a respected corporate citizen of the global community.  enviRonmenT SocieTy appendix economy SUSTAINABILITY mANAgEmENT HMC 2012  SuStAINABIlIty  rEPOrt The new agreement contains three new supplier relations guidelines on supplier contract signing,  new supplier registrationmanagement and management of the internal audit committee on subcon- tracting.

Comprised of four executive direc- tors and five external directors who are leading experts in various areas relevant to the automotive  industry, the BOD acts to promote transparent and sound business management. Important business management decisions are discussed and approved by the BOD and by share- holders when necessary at the general shareholders meeting. Corporate accounting and business  management practices are also subjected to an audit by third-party professionals. The Board of Di- rectors makes decisions on matters defined by law or our articles of incorporation, issues delegated  by the general shareholders meeting, and key matters relating to the basic guidelines for company  operations. The BOD retains the authority to supervise the duties of directors and management.  The BOD has three subcommittees including the Audit Committee, the External Director Candidate  Nomination Committee and the Ethics Committee to ensure that the BOD can operate effectively. At the 2011 Shareholders Meeting, a compensation ceiling of 15 billion KRW for directors was ap- proved. Total compensation paid to executives and external directors was 8.82 billion KRW from  January 1st to December 31st, 2011.

This was a remarkable  achievement made possible through HMCs steady efforts in quality management  and customer-first management. These two management principles were designed  to improve the quality of life for all of our customers. The strong sales achieved  recently with the new high fuel efficiency models is what led to these record-high  sales. The year 2012 is expected to be another challenging year for the automotive  market with the looming global economic depression. HMC will continue to  strengthen its quality management and customer-first management initiatives and  to increase its investment in the development of green vehicle technologies in order  to grow and continue delivering great customer value.

In addition, HMC also established  R&D centers and sales subsidiaries in key markets, in order to develop and produce innovative  vehicles that better meet the needs of our consumers in each market. In 2010 for the first time, overseas production accounted for more than 50% of total production for  the first time and this increased to 54% in 2011 with the launch of a new manufacturing plant in  Russia and increased production from the Czech plant. With the forthcoming launch of third plant in  China and a new plant in Brazil, the proportion of overseas production will continue to increase for  next few years. As of mid-2012, we have a domestic manufacturing capacity of 1.82 million vehicles and our  domestic plants successfully achieved their 2011 production goals, producing slightly more vehicles  than planned. The six overseas plants also delivered their production goals, producing 3% more  vehicles than set out in the 2011 plan. Overall, HMC exceeded its production goal by 2%, producing  over 4 million vehicles for the first time in its history in 2011.

Fortunately,  automotive sales in the U.S. and Russia have increased thanks to rise in consumer confidence,  leading to continued increase in global sales, reaching over 70 million units. Sales of domestically produced HMC vehicles have increased by 8.9% to 1,885,975 units in 2011  compared to the previous year. Sales in the Korean market were 683,570, up by 3.6% and 1,202,405  units were exported, which was a 12.1% increase from a year ago. Similar to 2010, the increase  in overseas sales of domestically produced vehicles largely came from advanced countries, in the  Middle East, as well as Central and South American markets. In 2011 sales of HMC vehicles in  Korea slightly increased, with market share increasing by 1.4% to 46.4% thanks to the popularity of  the new Avante (Elantra), which was our top-selling vehicle and to the third highest-selling Grandeur  (Azera). Sales of vehicles produced in overseas plants increased to 2,174,803 units, a 15.6% increase from  the previous year. The proportion of vehicles produced overseas was 53.6%. Total HMC vehicle sales  were 4,060,778 units which was a 4% over achievement compared to the 2011 business plan,  making 2011 the first year in which annual sales surpassed the 4 million marks. Sales in China and  India increased slightly while HMCs market share in the U.S. market surpassed the 5% mark thanks  to the popularity of the Elantra and Sonata for the first time in 26 years since HMC entered the  market. HMC achieved the highest market share of 2.9% in the European market despite a 1.5% decrease  in overall automotive sales. Sales of HMC vehicles in the European market are expected to increase  in 2012 with the establishment of the new sales offices in Germany and France. HMC is expecting  more geographically diversified sales portfolio by region this year, which will help with establishment  of a stronger business structure and in turn creating a sustainable growth. Global automotive sales began to slow down significantly during the second half of 2011 and the  trend is likely to continue, with lasting instability in the financial markets due to the Euro zone crisis  causing a decrease in vehicle sales in both advanced and emerging economies. Despite challenging  market conditions, HMC set an annual sales target of 4.29 million units for 2012, an increase of 5.7%  from the 2011 sales. We are confident that our high quality vehicles produced using our customer- first management system and incorporating our strong brand image will allow us to achieve this  target despite the global economic challenges.

In fact, creating a greener  automobile is one of our highest priorities as we are faced with multiple environmental challenges  including climate change and depletion of natural resources. Recognizing the seriousness of the  issues we are facing, HMC is investing in the development of green vehicles, green production  technologies and other environmental technologies that not only meet regulation standards but fulfill  our responsibility for our children and future generations. 32 Climate Change    46 recycling   49 Hazardous materials 52 air Quality environment  Decrease by The 2011 average cO2  emissiOns Of hmc  new passenger   vehicles sOlD in The eU A growing number of countries are introducing ever tighter standards on  greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent a global crisis caused by climate  change. For example, the European Union introduced a strict CO2 emission  standard on new passenger vehicles in 2012. HMC has been making significant  efforts to reduce CO2 in all stages of the vehicle life cycle including production,  operation and recycling. As a result, HMC succeeded to reduce the average CO2  emissions of new passenger vehicles registered in the European Union region in  2011 to 132g/km, a 28.6% reduction against the 1995 average CO2 emissions  of 185g/km, thanks to improvements made in fuel efficiency. 28.6% 132g/km 185g/km 28.6% Reduction 2011 1995 environment  30 31 HmC 2012  sustainability  report 30 31 The role of automobiles in the protection of the environment  and global ecosystem Simply put, to date improving human convenience has been the key focus of technology development. As a result, the  advancement of science and technology has led to the development of a lifestyle with a level of convenience never before  thought possible. However, more than two centuries of industrialization has also had a significantly negative impact on the  environment. For example, the increased mining of natural resources has led to the depletion of energy resources which  has become a serious issue for the future. Moreover, greenhouse gases from the operation of power plants, the use of  automobiles, deforestation and other human activities has accelerated potentially dangerous climate changes according to  the consensus of the international scientific community. As such, industrialization which helped many nations to obtain economic wealth, has brought with it some serious negative  consequences. Among the consequences, climate change is the most serious threat. However, the release of other pollutants  into the air, water and soil are also leading to serious problems. These environmental problems are becoming so serious that  they are undermining our very survival. The development of alternative green technologies, not just the improvement of existing technologies, is required to effectively  tackle the global environmental problems of climate change. Since most of the greenhouse gases which are emitted and  cause climate change are manmade, the keys to tackling the climate change crisis lie in the development of alternative green  energy technologies to fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. The development of alternative energy is important because their  supply is in decline and also because the extraction and use of fossil fuels is causing serious problems in many parts of the  world including the polarization of economic wealth and even in some places military conflicts. The development of alternative  energy sources and technologies powered by them is key to the restoration of our ecosystem, the long-term survival of  humanity and even world peace. Understanding the situation at hand, HMC is seeking to create a new paradigm in automotive technology development that  will lead to the production of much greener vehicles and production technologies beyond regulation standards. The announcement of HMCs environmental management philosophy and policies was designed to strike a balance between  Humanity, the Environment and Society. It was intended as the first step in the transition from a passive response to  regulation compliance to proactive environmental management. In addition, HMC began investigating what role automobiles  can play in mitigating the relationship between mankind and nature.  The ultimate goal of this investigation is to find a new role for automobiles as a green medium that can restore the relationship  between human and nature, rather than the current situation where the automobile has a detrimental impact on the  environment while only serving human needs. Although it may be an impossible goal, HMC is committed to sustaining  investment in the development of green energy and technologies to lead to a new era of clean alternative energy in the near  future. Our research areas include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants associated with the lifecycle of  automobiles, the advancement of Hybrid electric powertrain and the development of commercially viable Electric vehicles and  Fuel Cell Electric vehicles, which will bring us closer to maintaining harmony between nature, humans and machines. HMC  believes in the potential of automobiles to become a mediator that reinstates balance between nature and mankind. climate change  human nature machine Air pollution Hazardous  Materials Recycling Te ch no lo gy                                                                                                                                                                                                                   En er gy    existence / value  / expansion of  function balance and  harmony with  mankind HmC 2012  sustainability  report Harmony mediation  The automobile can be the means by which we reconcile     the relationship between nature and humanity En vir on me nt all y- fr ie nd ly the automobile can be the  means by which we reconcile  the relationship between  nature and humanity  32 33 envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report 33 efficiency Technology  our primary focus is improving the efficiency  of our vehicles. we are dedicated to making  immediate improvements in environmental  performance, particularly reducing Co2  emissions by improving the fuel efficiency of  our conventionally powered gasoline and diesel  vehicles.  hybrid system our second strategic focus is on the development  of intermediate technology, which can contribute  to the development of an electric powertrain. the  two technologies which we are concentrating on  are the hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid systems,  both of which employ a combination of an internal  combustion engine and electric powertrain  system, providing significant improvements in fuel  efficiency. clean mobility our third strategic focus is on the development  of green technology which can be a long-term  solution, through sustained r&d efforts. battery  electric vehicle (ev) and hydrogen fuel Cell  electric vehicle (fCev) technologies are currently  regarded as potential long-term solutions. we  have made excellent achievements with our  r&d of both ev and fCev. HmC has established  targets for the commercialization of both the ev  and fCev and is currently exploring opportunities  to form partnerships with relevant industries in  order to effectively cope with the uncertainty  associated with the commercialization of the evs  and fCevs. HmC believes that the successful  commercialization of the ev or fCev will open the  door to a new era of Clean mobility.

The all new Azera released in 2011 had a rated fuel efficiency of  12.8km/L which was a 13.3% improvement on the previous generation. The rated fuel efficiency of  the veloster and i40 are 16.6km/L and 23.3km/L respectively which are the highest in their classes  in domestic market. Thanks to these new vehicles with such low CO2 emissions, the average CO2  emissions of HMC vehicles registered in the European Union members states has decreased by  28.6% compared to 1995, to 132g/km in 2011. In the U.S., HMC recorded 36.3mpg in corporate average fuel economy of all 2010 model year   passenger cars sold by the company, which was 32% above the regulation standard of 27.5mpg.  HMC was selected as the automobile company with the lowest fleet average CO2 emission of 329g/mile  and with an average fuel efficiency of 27.0mpg, by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for  2010 model year. Releasing high fuel efficiency models in different markets Achieving maximum fuel efficiency with new technologies including ISG system and DCT pack HMC offered the option to fit the advanced Idle Stop & Go (ISG) on the Blue Saver version of the  Accent and Avante (Elantra). As the name suggests, the ISG system stops the engine when the  vehicle is not moving and restarts the engine automatically to cut down on unnecessary engine  running. Unlike the standard version which only activated when the gear shift was in neutral, the  advanced ISG system is fully operational regardless of gear position. Thanks to the advanced ISG  system, the Blue Saver version of the Accent and Avante (Elantra) have outstanding fuel efficiency  ratings of 17.7km and 17.5km respectively. The Dual Clutch Transmission which operates like an automatic transmission but with the efficiency  of a manual transmission contributed to the outstanding fuel efficiency improvements. For example,  a DCT-equipped Veloster has a fuel efficiency of 16.6km/L while offering a wonderful sporty  performance. HMC has released high fuel efficiency models in a variety of markets with different regulations. For  example, HMC has released four models including the Accent, Elantra, veloster and Sonata Hybrid,  with highway fuel efficiency over 40mpg in the U.S. In Europe, HMC has released the i20, i30 and  i40 with clean diesel engines with incredibly low CO2 emissions. biofuels and other alternative fuels Alternative fuel vehicles that meet local demands HMC is currently developing engines that can run on alternative fuels other than gasoline or diesel  fuels. For example, HMC has already developed models capable of running on ethanol. We are  especially focusing on Flexible Fuel vehicles (FFV) capable of running on E85 (85% ethanol + 15%  gasoline), as a response to increasing use of ethanol in North America and Brazil. In 2011, we  launched the Tucson FFV in Brazil.  36 37 envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report blueon displayed at the 2011 geneva motor show envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report The European market requires a different response because of the high  number of diesel vehicles, as well as vehicles that run on bio diesel, which  is made from rapeseed, palm or soybean and are much more commonly  used in the region. We are working toward the standardization of BD5 fuel  (95% diesel + 5% bio diesel) and the production of diesel vehicles capable  of running on BD5 fuel. All HMCs diesel vehicles released since 2010 are  capable of running on BD5 as well as bio fuel with up to 20% to 30% bio  diesel content.  Vehicles running on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) are classified as  green vehicles because they emit 20% to 30% less CO2 emissions  compared to gasoline models. HMCs first CNG vehicles were 11.5  ton waste transport trucks and buses launched in 2000. In 2010, we  developed a CNG Hybrid Electric Bus Blue City to further reduce CO2  emissions. We have released a natural gas version of our popular Santro  in India where CNG is more widely used. We also released the i10 Bi-fuel  model at the end of 2011, which runs on both LpG and gasoline. hybrid electric vehicle Development of Propriety LPi hybrid system and gasoline hybrid  systems The Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), which has gained significant popularity  as a greener alternative to conventional vehicles, is powered by both an  internal combustion engine and an electric motor, a combination which  leads to a reduction in fuel consumption and improved performance when  compared to conventional vehicles. HMC has developed several HEvs  starting with its first HEV concept car, the FGV-1 Hybrid in 1995. In 2004,  we developed the Click Hybrid and in 2005 produced the verna Hybrid. In 2009, HMC mass produced the worlds first LPi HEV, the Avante (Elantra)  Lpi Hybrid, for sale in the Korean market. In May 2011, we released the  Sonata Hybrid which has outstanding fuel efficiency and performance  characteristics in Korea and the U.S. and plan to expand our hybrid line-up  with midsize cars and SUvs in the future. Sonata Hybrid Hard-type direct drive hybrid system       The Sonata Hybrid is the first mass-produced gasoline  hybrid model by HMC, based on the highly acclaimed Sonata. It is also HMCs first hybrid model  developed for the overseas market. Equipped with a customized engine and six-speed transmission  optimized for a hybrid system, it is the greenest midsize sedan in HMCs line-up for the mass market.  HMC developed a custom hard-type hybrid system, called the Direct Drive Hybrid (DDH) system,  which is a propriety parallel hybrid drive system different from the power split system employed in our  competitors hybrid models. By employing the DDH system that employs smaller electric motors and  is simpler in structure than competitors system, the Sonata Hybrid boasts excellent fuel efficiency  while keeping price comparatively low. The DDH system also has more dynamic performance because the engine transmits power directly  to the wheels. Thanks to its unique configuration, the Sonata Hybrid has an excellent highway fuel  efficiency rating of 40mpg, giving it a competitive edge in the U.S. market. It also has an excellent  city fuel efficiency rating of 35mpg which is on a par with or higher than most competitor models in  its class. The Sonata Hybrid is also the worlds first hard-type HEV equipped with lithium-ion polymer (Li-ion)  batteries with four layers of safety features to ensure fail-proof operation. Plug-in Hybrid Preparing for the launch of the Plug-in Hybrid Car in 2015       HMC is aiming to release a mid-size  plug-in Hybrid car in 2015. plug-in Hybrids are HEvs with larger batteries which can be charged using  an external power source, which allows them to be driven as an electric vehicle using the electricity  stored in the battery. Once the battery is drained, it can be driven as an HEv using both the internal  combustion engine and the electric motor system. electric vehicle 2011 BlueOn EV demonstration program, Aiming to launch a compact car EV by 2015 Electric vehicles (EVs) have come under the spotlight as a key sustainable mobility option with  the need to reduce CO2 emissions and the inevitable depletion of oil supplies. In addition to  Ev development, we are also strengthening partnership with relevant stakeholders to enable  the commercialization of Evs. For instance, we signed an MOU with the Korean Electric power  Corporation (KEPCO) to collaborate on the development and standardization of EV chargers. BlueOn EV HMC has a released a number of EVs including the Sonata EV in 1991 and the BlueOn in 2010.  The BlueOn EV is equipped with a lithium-ion polymer battery and a range of new electric drive  components to provide top class performance. It has an incredible range of 140km on a single  charge. The top speed of the BlueOn is 130km/h and it can accelerate from zero to 100km/h in  15.7 seconds. All high voltage components were designed with comprehensive safety features and  have undergone extensive testing to ensure they are reliable and safe. Many of the components  were developed domestically, strengthening the foundation for continued improvements in Ev  technologies in Korea.   38 envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report please can you tell us about  hmcs blue Drive strategy. The Blue Drive strategy focuses in the short  term on improving the performance and fuel  efficiency of conventional vehicles and in the  long term on achieving  sustainable mobility  through the development of alternative  powertrain vehicles. More specifically, we  are focusing our efforts on the development  of Hybrids, Electric vehicles and hydrogen  Fuel Cell Electric vehicles. We released  the Sonata Hybrid first in North America  and then into the Korean market in 2011.  Equipped with precision clutch control and  a number of exciting new technologies, the  Sonata Hybrid can smoothly shift between Ev  operating mode and the HEv mode. It also  has excellent fuel efficiency and world class  performance characteristics. We have also  developed our first EV in 2010 which can be  driven on highway called BlueOn, and which  is currently being tested in a demonstration  program in Korea. The Tucson ix FCEv, a  third generation FCEv with improved fuel  efficiency and driving range was also recently  completed and supplied for demonstration  programs in Korea and Europe.  faced with peak oil and  climate change, key  stakeholders including  governments and consumers  are now demanding green  vehicles more than ever.  what is your prediction on  how the green vehicle market  will develop? The Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) market is  the fastest growing among green vehicles  because it doesnt require investment in  the alternative fuel infrastructure. Japanese  carmakers currently dominate the market,  but American and European carmakers  have now entered the race. Currently, the  HEv market is dominated by mid-sized  and smaller vehicles. However, I expect  competition in larger HEvs including SUv  models to intensify in the future. The market  for EVs and Plug-in HEVs (PHEVs) is also  growing considerably because of government  incentives for the development and  purchasing of vehicles powered using electric  powertrain and therefore low emissions  that satisfy strengthened emissions  standards. The pHEv comes equipped with  larger battery than HEvs, enabling Ev-like  operation for a short distance. Unlike Evs,  pHEvs can run on gasoline using the internal  combustion engine, and therefore do not  require rapid-charging station for operation.  However, a slow charging infrastructure is  still needed for overnight chagrining of the  batteries. Electric vehicles still have a long  way to go largely because of the limited  capacity of batteries and the high costs.  For instance, an Ev made using currently  available technology costs two to three times  more than comparable conventional vehicles,  and has a driving range per charge of only  200km or less. The lengthy charging time is  another obstacle to the commercialization  of EVs. Nevertheless the age of the EV may  come sooner than expected as there is  strong support from governments and an  increasing number of car manufactures are  moving  into Ev development. I predict that  a small yet significant niche market will be  developed with related businesses such  as rapid charging stations and car-sharing  being established. The high production  costs of fuel cell stacks which generate  electricity by facilitating a reaction between  hydrogen and oxygen is a key obstacle in the  commercialization of FCEvs. Establishment  of hydrogen charging stations is another  significant obstacle. Even though the  commercialization of FCEvs will take longer  than other green vehicles many automakers  including HMC, Toyota and Honda are  investing in its development because  FCEv has the potential to be the ultimate  alternative to conventional vehicles and  internal combustion engines. Ev and FCEvs  are expected to be the dominant green cars  of the future. I expect Evs to become the  leading mode of transport for urban and  short-distance travel, if battery performance  and cost can be improved and charging  stations installed. The FCEvs are expected  to be used by those who need transport over  longer distances. please tell us more about  hmcs plans to develop green  cars. The global automotive industry is striving to  lower the cost of green vehicles as well as  trying to overcome technological barriers.  Carmakers are focusing on: simplifying  systems (integration and downsizing parts),  employing new technologies to transfer  power and heat, developing next-generation  batteries, developing a permanent magnet  that requires less use of rare minerals and  developing computer chips made from  Silicon Carbide for automotive use. I am  certain that progress in these R&D areas will  drive down the price of the next-generation  of green vehicles and in the near future  improve their performance beyond even that  of conventional vehicles. HMC is well placed  to lead in the green vehicle market, with  the internal capacity to develop core green  vehicle components. We plan to further  strengthen our R&D of advanced green  vehicle technologies to be a leader in green  vehicle technology.  tucson ix fCev at the  2012 beijing motor show fCev northern europe  demonstration program  inTerview WoonG-cHul YAnG  VicE chAirmAn, EnVironmEnTAl TEchnology cEnTEr 39 HMC has supplied 30 BlueOn EVs to government agencies and regional  government bodies as part of a demonstration program. 256 additional  BlueOn EVs were supplied for this program between January and  December 2011. Participation in national research project on compact EV development HMC is participating in the Green Transportation System based on Next- generation Electric vehicles commissioned by the Korean government,  as one of 45 partners including large corporations, SMEs, universities  and research institutes. The participants plan to invest a total of 126.7  billion KRW: between May 2011 and April 2014, 67.2 billion KRW from  government and 59.5 billion KRW from the private sector. Developing an  affordable electric powertrain for a compact car is the ultimate goal of the  project. The team is striving to achieve a driving range per single charge of  over 200km, 0 to 100km/h acceleration time of 11.5 seconds, charging  time of five hours for slow charging and 23 minutes for rapid charging. fuel cell electric vehicle (fcev) HMC to participate in the 2011 FCEV demonstration project in Europe Hydrogen is regarded as a compelling alternative to fossil fuels. FCEvs  are operated as an Ev using the electricity generated from the fuel  cell where oxygen and hydrogen reacts. As a result, an FCEv has zero  direct emissions just like an Ev yet with higher energy efficiency and  performance compared to an Ev. In general, a FCEv is also at least twice  more energy efficient compared to a conventional vehicle, making the  FCEV the most energy efficient vehicle technology available today. HMCs most recently developed Fuel Cell Electric SUv is up to 3.75 times  more energy efficient than comparable gasoline-powered SUvs. Since  1998, HMC has invested significant resources in fuel cell development  in order to achieve the twin goals of better performance and lower cost.  Recently, we successfully developed a metallic separator (bipolar plates)  technology which led to a reduction in the fuel cell stack price to one sixth  of its original price, dramatically improving mass production potential. FCEV demonstration program HMC has been operating an FCEv demonstration program in collaboration  with the Korean government since 2006. HMC also participated in the  North America FCEV demonstration program led by the U.S. Department of  Energy between 2004 and 2009. FCEv demonstration program in Korea  in the cities of Seoul and Ulsan with 48 Tucson ix FCEv was launched in  2009 and was successfully completed in 2011.  The third-generation Tucson ix FCEv has a fuel efficiency equivalent to  30.2km/L (UDDS), a driving range of 635km (UDDS) and a top speed of  160km/h. It has also improved low temperature start-up ability and can  be started at minus 25C (-13F). Thanks to the modularization of core  FCEv components including the fuel cell stack, drive train components  and inverter, the size of the FCEv system was reduced by 20% and  significant weight reduction was achieved.  Participating in FCEV demonstration program in Europe HMC has succeeded to make significant achievements in the FCEv  program conducted in Europe. For example, HMC signed MOUs with four  Northern European countries on FCEV demonstration projects in January  2011, an MOU on participation in Clean Energy partnerships with the  German government in February 2011 and an MOU with Copenhagen city  office for the supply of FCEVs in May 2011. In October 2011, the European parliament selected HMC as the sole  implementer of the FCEv demonstration program. The EU Fuel Cells  and Hydrogen Joint Project also picked the HMC ix35 (Tucson) as the  demo FCEV for a demonstration program in Denmark and Norway. HMC  has also supplied third generation ix35s to the Danish government.  HMCs participation in the demonstration programs in Europe will lay the  foundation for HMCs leadership in the alternative fuel vehicle market.  HMC will further strengthen its capacity in FCEv technologies through  these experiences.  40 41 envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report reDUcing ghg emissiOns aT planTs Balancing economic prosperity and environmental protection is central to HMCs goal to be a top  global company. We are constantly working to reduce GHG emissions not just at our production  plants but at all operating sites including sales offices, service centers and research centers. On April 14th 2010, the Korean government passed a new law the Basic Law on Low Carbon Green  Growth. The government also set a national target for reducing GHG emissions, by 30% by 2020  and introduced GHG-Energy Target Management Scheme (TMS) to control GHG emissions from  large emitters. The TMS is a top-down emissions reduction system which forces GHG reductions to  achieve the 2020 target. HMC agreed its first target for reduction of GHG emissions and energy use with the Korean  government in 2011 and successfully delivered the agreed reduction despite a challenging business  environment, abnormal weather conditions and oil price fluctuations. 2 2011 ghg emissions 2011–Participation in GHG-Energy Target Management Scheme HMC has been managing its GHG emissions and associated processes using the operation  principles from the GHG-Energy Target Management Scheme as a guide. According to the GHG  data, calculated using governmental guidelines and verified by Lloyd Register Quality Assurance Ltd.,  the total GHG emissions from HMCs domestic operation sites was 1,541,927 tons in 2010 and  1,562,658 tons in 2011. The number of vehicles produced in 2011 increased by 8.5% to 1,892,254  units from 1,743,378 in 2010. Therefore, GHG emissions per vehicle produced decreased by 6.6%  from 0.884 ton in 2010 to 0.826 ton in 2011. The GHG emissions from three production plants, Ulsan, Asan and Jeonju, accounted for 85.9% of  the total emissions. The remaining 14.1% of the GHG emissions were from energy use at buildings  including R&D facilities, service centers, headquarters and sales offices. In 2011, the proportion of  direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions was 35.8% and 64.2% respectively. This is  due to a heavy reliance on electricity supplied from the national grid in the manufacturing process of  automobiles. According to our assessment, total GHG emissions from overseas production plants located in the  U.S., China, India, Turkey, the Czech Republic and Russia increased 2.5 times from 285,000 tons- CO2 in 2007 to 721,132 tons-CO2 in 2011. This is due to increased production volumes at our  overseas plants and to the addition of new production plants.

The current target is a 5% reduction by 2015 compared to the 2005 levels. We  plan to achieve a 10% reduction by 2020. The five year reduction plan is designed as a rolling plan  intended to achieve the annual reduction goals set internally each year. The scope was be revised in  2011 to cover all facilities managed by HMC, including R&D facilities, service centers, headquarters  and sales offices. We have also identified three key emissions reduction strategies which are energy  efficiency improvements, introduction of advanced CO2 emissions processing (capture and storage,  absorption) and the increased use of renewable energy. We invested more than 8.4 billion KRW to install heat pumps which enable us to collect and reuse  waste heat from our painting shops in 2008 and 2009. We also introduced high-efficiency inverters  and a number of facilities to improve energy efficiency. The new energy efficient facilities have  successfully offset our increase in energy use due to the expansion of the plant. An investment of 2.7 billion KRW was made to install a high efficiency lighting system which led to an  annual CO2 emissions reduction of 6,805 tons. Utilizing the steam generated using waste heat from  the incinerator located in the Hyundai Heavy Industry has also contributed to the immense reduction  in CO2 emissions of 11,046 tons per year since 2010. Replacement of old energy supply utilization- related facilities led to a reduction of 10,465 tons of CO2 emissions in 2011. We plan to invest 6.9  billion KRW to achieve a reduction of 18,103 tons-CO2 per year in 2012. Introduction of advanced management system for GHG reduction The Ulsan plant became the first plant in Korea to receive ISO 50001 energy management system  certification on December 28th 2011. The ISO 50001 certification standard was announced in June  2011 and the Korean Energy Management Corporation, a government affiliated energy efficiency  improvement promotion agency, had been encouraging Korean companies to adopt the standard.  The implementation of the advanced energy management system at the Ulsan plant reinforced top  managements dedicated to energy efficiency improvement and its four step process: plan, do, check  and action. The 2011 production volume at our Asan plant was the highest ever at 302,650 units, up by 5.1%  from 2010. As a result, the total GHG emissions increased from 2010, yet GHG emissions per vehicle  produced decreased by 3.1% due to the implementation of various efficiency improving measures. Replacement of the steam supply system in the paint shop, which previously consisted of an external  gas boiler generating steam and then transferring by pipe, was one of the most effective energy  efficiency improvements made. The new steam generator uses natural gas and has a much higher  thermal efficiency leading to a significant reduction in GHG emissions. Further improvements will be  implemented in the future, including installation of high efficiency LED lamps and improvements to  the manufacturing process, in order to achieve further reduction in GHG emisstons and energy use. In 2011, annual GHG emissions at our Jeonju plant decreased by 1% to 139,111 tons-CO2 from  141,315 tons-CO2 in 2010, while production volume increased by 5.3% to 64,235 buses and  trucks. Reducing the defect rate at our part manufacturing plant and integrating the heat treatment  operations helped reduce our energy use and in turn lower CO2 emissions by 2,200 tons-CO2. Over  2,600 metallic lights (430 watt per bulb) in the truck assembly lines and materials processing plants  were replaced with high efficiency fluorescent lights (162 watt per bulb) and induction lights (150  watt per bulb), leading to a reduction of 1,115 tons-CO2. Other energy efficiency improvement measures were implemented including the installation of a  centralized control system to operate a direct-fired heater to reduce unnecessary use during off  hours and break periods and the installation of auto traps which prevent the loss of pressurized air  by removing moisture in high pressure air pipelines. Reducing overseas GHG emissions At HMCs Czech plant the focus was on achieving an immediate reduction as local regulation  requiring this recently came into effect. Meanwhile at all other HMC plants overseas we are  voluntarily working to reduce emissions due to growing concern about climate change and rising  energy prices. According to our calculations total GHG emissions at six HMC plants located in the U.S.,  China, India, Turkey, Czech Republic and Russia have increased by 10.1% from 654,889 tons-CO2  in 2010 to 721,132 tons-CO2 in 2011. This is due to an increase in the overall production volume  including operations at a new production plant in Russia. Czech Plant (HMMC) l The Czech plant will be subject to the European Union Emission Trading  Scheme with emission allowances and a reduction target, starting in 2013. In 2009, we established  a GHG emissions inventory and have been achieving significant reductions in GHG emissions  through measures such as improving energy efficiency of paint shop ovens and the optimization of  T/Up booth operation.  In 2011, 600 metallic lights in our transmission manufacturing plant were replaced with more energy  efficient compact fluorescent lights with a Digital Addressable Lighting Interface, leading to energy  savings of 800MW. In addition, an advanced lighting system will be installed at the new transmission  plant, which will be operational from 2012 and will result in savings of 490MW of electricity. U.S. Plant (HMMA) l The U.S. EpA introduced a Mandatory Reporting Rule in 2011. Accordingly,  the HMMA made its first GHG emissions report to the EPA on September 2011. Most of the direct  GHG emissions from HMMA are associated with natural gas use at the paint shop and therefore  efforts to reduce emissions have concentrated on measures such as optimizing oven operation,  lower operating temperatures and reduced RTO initiation time from 7.5 hours to 5.5 hours. Further  reductions in natural gas use and GHG emissions are expected with the installation of the waste  heat reuse system in the near future.  44 45 envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report 44 45 led street lamps installed at  namyang r&d Center namyang r&d Center solar electric system < n a m y a n g  r & D  c e n t e r > <headquarters and other facilities> China Plant (BHMC) l HMC built its first and second plants in China in 2002 and 2007 respectively,  with a combined annual production capacity of 600,000 units. A new plant with a production  capacity of 400,000 units will be completed in 2012, expanding the total capacity to one million  units per year. Faced with a significant increase in energy use, we are focusing on the following  three activities to reduce energy use. First, we are improving energy management by eliminating  unnecessary lighting and heating. We are improving our electricity system and optimizing the  assembly robot operations to reduce electricity use during the manufacturing process. Lastly, we are  replacing outdated equipment such as old heaters in the engine assembly lines with more efficient  equipment. India Plant (HMI) l Although per-capita GHG emissions in India are some of the lowest in the world,  India is still the third largest GHG emitter, after China and the U.S. We have two plants, the first built  in 1998 and the second in 2007, with an annual production capacity of 650,000. HMC is striving to  improve the energy efficiency of the two plants in order to contribute to the mitigation of emerging  energy shortages in India. First, we identified sources of unnecessary energy use such as air conditioning and lighting in  unoccupied areas and installed advanced control devices such as sensor-controlled lights. We also  implemented energy patrol schemes to ensure the elimination of unnecessary energy use during off  hours and break times. Inverters were installed to improve the efficiency of energy intensive devices  such as fans and pumps. External lighting fixtures are gradually being replaced with high efficiency  LED lamps and solar electricity-powered street lights were installed at the plant gates, reducing  energy use whilst generating some positive publicity. Russia Plant (HMMR) l High energy efficiency was a high priority objective during the construction  of the Russian plant, which became operational in 2011. For example, high efficiency condensing  boilers and direct heat ovens were fitted. We also installed inverter type motors in order to minimize  electricity use. Our indoor temperature control system adjusts the amount of fuel burned for heating  by monitoring changes in indoor temperature, while maintaining the temperature within two degrees  of the target temperature and minimizing fuel use. Turkey Plant (HAOS) l HMCs Turkey plant is subject to a government regulation on energy use and  resource efficiency improvement (Acceptance date: October 25th 2008) which was created as part  of the Energy Efficiency Act (Law No: 5627, Acceptance date: April 18th 2007). As a result, we have  been receiving annual energy management training in addition to submitting annual energy reports  the Energy and Resource ministry. We have implemented a long list of energy saving measures which includes; the introduction of a real- time energy use monitoring and control system, the incorporation of a waste heat recycling system  using the paint shop steam, the optimization of the paint shop oven flame intensity, reduced oven  preheating time (by 30 minutes), shortened air-heating unit operation time (by 1 hour), automated  building temperature and light control system, optimization air pressure (7 bar  6.5 bar), the  employment of high efficiency pumps and motors, the introduction of high efficiency lights and much  more. Further efforts will continue to be made to further reduce energy use in the future. reducing ghg emissions from buildings GHG emissions from buildings including R&D facilities, service centers and headquarters account  for 14.1% of total emissions from HMCs domestic operation sites. HMCs efforts to reduce CO2  emission associated with its buildings began in 2008. We have included these buildings in the scope  for corporate GHG emissions reduction since 2010. Significant achievements were made in 2011 thanks to the introduction of energy efficiency  improvement equipment and renewable energy. For example, building and street lights were replaced  with high efficiency LED lights, which consume 80% less electricity than incandescent lights and do  not release mercury and harmful gases. In December 2011, 168 LED lamps (60 watt per bulb) were  installed in our offices and in November 2011, 40 LED lamps (165 watt per bulb) were installed on  streets. In July 2010, we installed a 50kW solar electricity system on the roof of the recently completed R&D  Museum. In addition, a 10kW system was installed at our Quality Assurance Center building. The  electricity generated from these systems is used to power the lighting and climate control systems  of the respective buildings, reducing annual CO2 emissions by 41.6 tons. The R&D GHG emissions  reduction task force, created in February 2010, has come up with 23 ideas to reduce emissions,  including the recovery of unspent fuel in test vehicles, optimizing the coolant amount in test  equipment, energy efficiency improvement of personal computers and enabling power-saving mode  in heaters and air conditioners. The task force spent 1.2 billion KRW on reduction activities and  achieved a reduction of 3,338 tons-CO2. Adjusting the operating mode of water coolers and the air-fuel ratio of boilers installed at the HMC  headquarters resulted in significant energy savings and a cost saving of 53 million KRW. Installation  of the heat to electricity conversion device at the glass elevator contributed to a saving of 1.1 million  KRW in electricity. Motion detection sensors were installed for lights in emergency staircases and  restrooms at the Rolling Hills Hotel to save electricity. Lights in guest rooms were also replaced with  energy efficient LED lamps.  46 47 Recycling  1 2011 586,750 2010 535,779 2009 490,630  TOTal amOUnT Of wasTe generaTeD (global, unit: tons) 2011 567,908 2010 517,714 2009 375,834  TOTal amOUnT Of recycleD maTerials (global, unit: tons) 2011 20,390 2010 19,662 2009 16,987  waTer Usage (global, unit: 1,000 tons) 2011 1,602 2010 1,915 2009 1,219  waTer recycleD (global, unit: 1,000 tons) envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report vehicle recycling 2015 target: Achieve 95% vehicle recoverability rate by weight We are striving to minimize vehicle waste at the end of the vehicles life. For example, we have made  significant investments to the development of recyclable materials and recycling technologies. In  addition, we have established the Automobile Recycling Center to process over 4,000 vehicles which  are at the end of their lives, per year. HMC is also investing in research for Design for Recycling and  for more efficient vehicle recycling technologies that will generate less waste. recycling seat foam The cushion foam used in car seats, which accounts for over 10kg per car, are made of urethane,  which is a type of thermosetting polymer, which is far more difficult to recycle than other types of  polymers and plastics. Despite the challenge, HMC developed a custom designed process to produce  materials which could be used in the noise absorbing panel by shredding the foam and mixing it  with PET fibers, thereby enabling the recycling of seat foam. The materials made using the recycled  seat foams are currently used in luggage partitions and will be used more widely shortly, including  luggage compartment trims and insulation pads. automobile recycling center An Automobile Recycling Center (ARC) was established within the Namyang R&D Center for the  efficient recycling of vehicles at the end of their lives and for the development of vehicle dismantling  technologies. The ARC has an eight step process designed for efficient dismantling and recycling of  vehicles. New recycling techniques and technologies are developed at the center, which are then  transferred to external vehicle recyclers. We are also developing a low-cost vehicle dismantling  system for use by small scale automobile recyclers. The center hosts visitor days more than 10 times  a year and hosts seminars on the introduction of new vehicle recycling technologies. dwindling natural resources has become a serious threat to the sustainability of  the global community, making improved resource efficiency and the reduction of  environmental impact necessary requirements for all corporations who have a sense  of responsibility. HMc as a responsible corporate citizen, is striving to help achieve a  recycling-based society. recycling green vehicles Recycling Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) requires special skills and processes because they are  equipped with high voltage batteries and electric components. HMC is supporting the safe recycling  of its HEv by supplying manuals on how to handle the high voltage lithium ion battery of the Avante  Hybrid and Sonata Hybrid to vehicle recyclers. HMC will also continue to work towards developing  recycling technology for HEVs and EVs to ensure the efficient and safe recycling of green vehicles.  48 49 envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report Hazardous  Materials  1 2 3 minimizing wasTe Improving the waste treatment process In 2011, the total amount of waste produced increased to 586,750 tons, a 9.5% increase from  2010. The increase in waste volume was largely due to the construction of a new engine and  transmission manufacturing plant in Korea. Waste from automobile manufacturing consists mostly of waste paint and thinners from the paint  shops, packaging materials made of vinyl, paper and wood used for shipping parts, and molding  sand used for the production of parts such as engine cylinder blocks. All metal scraps are recycled  by HMC or outside recyclers for use in other industries. In order to reduce waste and improve recyclability, we have replaced real-time waste collection  methods with sequenced collection methods to improve the separation and collection efficiency of  different materials. We have also developed and applied a new technology to reduce the water content of paint sludge  to 40% in order to improve the incineration efficiency of the sludge. Installation of waste paint  compression equipment is also contributing to a reduction in paint waste. recycling waTer Zero discharge system in Asan and India Plants HMC has been paying particular attention to the issue of water shortage. Recognizing the need  to reduce water usage, HMC has implemented a zero-discharge water circulation system, which  reprocesses and reuses water within our plants in Asan, Korea and India, which has been suffering  from water supply shortages since 2006. The zero discharge system processes all waste water within  the plant for reuse and therefore, does not release any waste water into local water bodies. The  system is helping contribute to a significant reduction in overall water use associated with vehicle  manufacturing. We have also installed a water reuse system that reprocesses and recycles vehicle cleaning water  used during the electro-coating process. Furthermore, we have installed water saving devices in  bathrooms and other water using facilities at Headquarters and the R&D Centers. In 2011, HMCs total global water use was 20.39 million tons, which was a 3.3% increase from  the previous year. However, per sale use of water was 26 tons per 100 million KRW, which was a  decrease of 11%. The amount of water resources recycled has decreased by 16% due to problems  with our zero-discharge water circulation system in India. HMc has established a comprehensive hazardous materials management system  in order to minimize problems associated with the use and disposal of hazardous  materials in the production, use and disposal of vehicles. We are also collaborating  with suppliers to develop alternative materials that comply with regulations and are  safer for the environment and people. Restrictions on the use of materials with potentially negative environmental and health effects are  becoming stricter in many advanced nations. In July 2003, the EU passed legislation that limits the  use of four hazardous heavy metals including lead, cadmium, hexavalent chromium and mercury.  Then in June 2007, the EU passed new chemical management regulations, named REACH, which  require registration, reporting and authorization for chemicals that are used in the EU region in  amounts greater than one ton per year. Strict regulations and even a ban on the use of hazardous materials are being adopted in an  increasing number of regions. For example, the Korean government placed a ban on the use of four  heavy metals, and the Canadian government has adopted a new policy that requires companies to  report the use of certain chemicals. The U.S. government has also placed a ban on the use of ozone  depleting chemicals and launched the Green Chemistry Initiatives. Finally, the Chinese government  has placed a ban on the use of four heavy metals and bromine flame retardant. We are striving to ensure that none of the banned or restricted chemicals are used in our final  products. We are also making strong efforts to develop alternative materials that will meet the new  regulation standards before we even need to. eliminaTing The Use Of fOUr heavy meTals Establishing HMC Global Standard on four heavy metals HMC has placed a complete ban on the use of four heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, and  hexavalent chromium), which are known to be hazardous to human health and the environment.  Our efforts to find alternative materials to the four heavy metals began in 2002. In 2006, we  created a voluntary ban on the use of these four heavy metals with the announcement of the HMC  Global Standard on four heavy metals, with a strict timeline for phasing out the four heavy metals.  Following the phase out plan, in July 2003 we began prohibiting the use of the heavy metals in all  cars produced for sale in Europe. From January 2008, all HMC vehicles sold in the Korean market  were made free from the four heavy metals. In 2009, we began enforcement of our policy on ban of  the four heavy metals in all cars produced in our overseas plants for sale in markets with relevant  regulations. We plan to expand the scope to include all vehicles, even those sold to markets that do  not have the relevant regulations yet.  50 51 envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report 3 4 2 2011 1,817 2010 2,241 2009 2,520  hazarDOUs chemicals UseD  (domestic, unit: tons) the negative health impact associated with  exposure to carcinogens such as benzene,  asbestos and formaldehyde has become  a significant social issue for labor unions,  consumers, the media and nGos.  For example, the eu introduced ReAcH in 2007  and the Global Harmonized System (GHS)-based  classification, labeling and packaging Regulation  in January 2009, strictly limiting the use of  hazardous chemicals. the Ministry of employment  and labor and the Ministry of environment are  in the process of drafting a revised, GHS-based,  hazardous chemical management policy as well.  Regulation in the workplace on exposure to  carcinogens is expected to become stronger due  to the sustained increase in the number of cancer  patients.  Although, lifestyle habits such as smoking are  regarded as the most important causes of cancers,  chemical exposure in the workplace are also  known to be significant causes of cancers. HMc has been strengthening management policy  on the use of carcinogenic materials in order to  protect its employees from occupational cancers.  in october 2011, a carcinogen Management task  Force was established and their work led to a  formal agreement between the labor union and  management regarding the replacement of 15  carcinogenic chemicals and three highly hazardous  chemicals with safer substitutes. the task force conducted a survey on the use  of the 18 chemicals using the Material Safety  data Sheets (MSdS) and identified 236 products  containing one or more of the 18 chemicals.  Further research was conducted to assess  the availability of replacement materials and  management plans were established for each one  of them. Work is under progress to introduce  GHS/MSdS standards in order to improve the  reliability of the MSdS. the task force plans  to strengthen internal policy on carcinogenic  materials and hazardous chemicals in order to  create a safer working environment. preventing workplace  exposure to carcinogens establishment  of carcinogen  management Task  force in 2011 respOnDing TO eU reach Implementation of EU REACH compliance process The EU REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemicals) policy became  effective in 2007. Commonly referred to as the No Data, No Market policy, REACH requires all  companies manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the EU, in quantities of one ton or  more per year, to register these substances. As of mid-2012, 73 chemicals have been identified as Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) and  14 substances has been identified as substances that require authorization for use, due to their  potentially negative impact on health and environmental impact. In response to the implementation of this directive, HMC created a chemical substance management  system and a database containing materials information in order to reduce not only the chemicals  currently subjected to EU REACH but substances which are likely to be subjected to restrictions in  the future. prOhibiTiOn On The Use Of OzOne DepleTing chemicals  The use of Ozone Depleting Chemicals (ODC) leads to an increase in the risk of skin cancer and  causes significant damage to the ecosystem. Since 1989, the U.S. imposed strict regulations on the  use of ODCs and placed a special tax on the use of these substances. The Korean government also  instituted a ban on the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halon, and carbon tetrachloride (CCI4) in  2010. The Korean government plans to institute a ban on the use of methyl chloroform (1.1.1-TCE)  after 2015. HMC prohibits the use of ODCs at all of its production facilities in Korea. We are also  monitoring the use of ODCs by our suppliers and have been maintaining full compliance. esTablishmenT Of a hazarDOUs chemicals managemenT  sysTem A comprehensive electronic database that tracks data including the weight of parts and materials  information and an effective supplier communication network is necessary in order to comply with  the various regulations on hazardous chemicals. In 2004, HMC joined the International Material  Data System (IMDS), which was created in collaboration with a group of automakers to enable more  effective management of hazardous materials used in automobile parts and to ensure regulation  compliance from the vehicle development stage. We also developed a propriety chemical management system, e-Chemical Management System  (e-CMS), which creates a customized database using the information collected using the IMDS  system. Scope has also been expanded to vehicles sold in markets that do not have strict  regulations yet to preemptively meet new standards. A regular check-up system is also in place at  each manufacturing plant to check for the use of hazardous chemicals. In 2011, the total amount of  hazardous materials used in domestic operations was 1,817 tons, down by 19% from a year ago.  HMc is developing new technologies including clean diesel engines and nox emission  technologies, whilst enforcing stricter internal emissions standards than current  regulation require, with the goal of complete elimination of emissions from both  vehicle tailpipes and plants. 1 2011 2,987 2010 2,506 2009 2,276  Organic sOlvenT recOvereD (global, unit: 1,000 tons) AIR QUALITY 2011 528 2010 608 2009 599  air pOllUTanT releaseD (domestic, unit: tons) 52 envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report vehicle Tailpipe emissiOns Developing improved engines and emission reduction technologies Tailpipe emissions have improved dramatically, however the increase in the number of automobiles  and the population concentrations in cities have made further improvements necessary. In  response, the EU has adopted the Euro 5 standard, which required new models to meet more  stringent standards for PM and NOx emissions from September 2009 and required all models to  meet the same standards starting in January 2011. The Euro 6 standard, which requires a 56% cut  in NOx emissions from diesel cars compared to Euro 5, will become effective in 2014. In the U.S., the  Californian government is requiring auto makers to sell an increasing number of vehicles that meets  the zero emission vehicle standards. The Korean government also revised is clean vehicle standards,  imposing much more stringent requirements for NOx and PM emissions. HMC is continuing to invest in emission reduction technologies in order to develop zero emission  vehicles. For instance, a number of new technologies including an optimized combustion chamber  design, high pressure fuel injection (1,800~2,000 bar), high efficiency turbocharger, low pressure  exhaust gas recirculation system and catalyzed NOx reduction system are all now incorporated in our  new diesel engine vehicles. In Europe in 2009, we began selling a number of vehicles equipped with Euro 5 compliant engines.  In 2012, we also released an all new Santa Fe model which satisfies the Euro 6 standard which will  come into effect in 2014. clean diesel engines Although diesel engines are more fuel efficient than gasoline engines, diesel engine exhaust  contains higher concentrations of NOx and PM. However, diesel emissions can improve significantly  using technologies such as the Common Rail Direct injection (CRDi) system, Diesel Particulate Filter  (DPF), NOx catalyst and combustion improvement. Application of the technologies reduces NOx and  pM in diesel emissions, and also reduces noise while improving performance. In fact, the application of various emissions improvement technologies has improved diesel engine  fuel efficiency making it 30% better than comparable gasoline engines. As a result, new diesel  vehicles emit up to 20% less CO2 emissions. We have developed Euro 5 compliant clean diesel  engines, the R and U2 engines, and produced compact cars and SUv models using these engines,  for sale in Europe. Development of nOx reduction technologies Among the pollutants in diesel exhaust, soluble organic fraction in CO, HC and pM are all cleaned by  the oxidation catalyst. Most of the PM in the exhaust is removed by the DPF. However, the solution  for achieving a 56% reduction in NOx emissions compared to Euro 5 level, as required by the Euro 6  standard, is still under development. We have strengthened our NOx reduction technology research including the development of the  Lean NOx Trap (LNT), and a Low Pressure EGR System (LP EGR) for diesel engines. The LP EGR  system can reduce up to 60% of NOx emissions through recirculation of low pressure exhaust which  has been released from emission treatment devices. The new Santa Fe released in 2012 comes  equipped with a newly developed R engine, compliant with the Euro 6 standard.  54 55 envirOnmenT SociETy AppEndix Economy SuSTAinAbiliTy mAnAgEmEnT HmC 2012  sustainability  report  sOnaTa hybriD: carbOn fOOTprinT  Carbon Footprint reduCtion since 2009, HmC has been calculating the carbon footprint of  new models over the complete product life cycle including the  production, use and disposal of vehicles. the calculation results  are expressed in tons of Co2, and the data collected is used as the  basis for achieving further carbon footprint reductions. in 2011, we calculated the carbon footprint of six new models  including the veloster, accent, grandeur (azera), i30, i40, and  sonata Hybrid. among these, the sonata Hybrid achieved a 29%  reduction in its carbon footprint and was awarded a low carbon  product certification granted to products which have achieved  more than 4.24% reduction in emissions compared to the baseline.  the difference in the carbon footprint reduction of the sonata  Hybrid compared to the non-hybrid model was 7.3 tons. according  to the assessment, the hybrid drivetrain was capable of achieving  a 35% reduction in the Co2 emissions associated with vehicle use,  which has the added benefit of significant savings on motoring  costs. reductions were also made in other models. for example, the  carbon footprint of the grandeur (azera) was 4.4 tons less than  comparable models in its class. the i40 wagon also had a 1.7%  smaller carbon footprint than comparable models. we worked  with tv nord, an internationally recognized certification agency  which issued lCa (life Cycle assessment) certification for the  tucson ix in 2010, and, for i10 and i20 in 2011. the test results  confirmed that life cycle Co2 emissions of the i10 and i20 were  reduced by 7.9% and 12.9% assuming a life cycle driving distance  of 150,000km. sonata hybrid conventional sonata powered  with gasoline engine only  7.3 tons  29%  reduction 24.9 tons 17.6 tons  the sonata Hybrid earned low carbon product certification in Korea.  7.3 tons-Co2 reduction = amount of carbon sequestered     by 1,090 pine trees HmC established the global environmental workshop in 2010 to strengthen  collaboration among our global teams and to improve our environmental regulation  compliance. in 2011, a workshop was held to discuss new environmental regulations  in the u.s. and europe to enhance our understanding of emerging regulations and to  strengthen networks among staff in charge of compliance management. the 2012  workshop is expected to focus on improving effectiveness in regional environmental  regulation responses.

The number of employees in China and India increased  even more significantly to 15,420 up by 19% compared to 2010. Local hiring is expected to increase  further as our overseas production and sales activities increase. Our overseas operations are making  a positive contribution to local communities by creating jobs and stimulating local economies, with  the added benefit of enhancing HMCs brand image. promotinG DiVerSity On the surface, rapid globalization has turned the world into several economic blocks where  universal qualities are respected and similar goals are pursued. However, HMC recognizes that  there still exists a strong need for personnel affairs policies which respect different lifestyles and  cultures. Attracting talent from diverse backgrounds is a matter of strategic importance because the  development of the right vehicles for different markets requires innovative ideas from people who  understand each market. It is practically impossible for employees from a single culture and similar  background to come up with innovative ideas that work for peoples of different cultures and tastes.  Recognizing this, HMC is striving to create a corporate culture which respects diversity and creative  thinking. 2  60 61 EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt 60 61  Female employee StatuS (domestic, unit: persons) 15.1 12.3 10.7 no. of female  employees change in proportion  of females amongst  new recruits (%) 2009 2,261 2010 2,321 2011 2,512 equal opportunity: attracting female employees Increasing recruitment of female employees Due to the auto industrys labor-intensive job characteristics, the balance of male and female  employees is not very strong at HMC. Therefore, HMC has been making an extra effort to attract  female talent to create a better balance, including a number of benefits ranging from work   environment improvement to increasing the number of female employees. Thanks to these efforts,  the number of domestically employed female employees has been increasing steadily and was 2,512  at the end of 2011, which is equivalent to 4.4% of the domestic workforce. The other benefits include  90-days maternity leave. Maternity leave of up to three years is available for employees working at  certain overseas plants. Furthermore, childcare centers have been built at a number of operation  sites for working mothers. Increasing local hires and increasing the proportion of females are some of our key policies in  promoting diversity within HMC. HMC will continue promoting diversity within our organization and  will more effectively tailor our product lineup and business management strategies to meet the  diverse needs of our customers in different regions, using the local knowledge and expertise of our  employees. Human reSource manaGement Our long term objectives are to promote diversity and to support an aging workforce. Strengthening  the link between performance and reward, integrated human resource management for effective  management of a global workforce, and fostering global competency are the three immediate  human resource management objectives. HMC strives to be an equal opportunity employer and does  not discriminate against race, age, gender or any other factors in all human resource management  activities including recruitment. We are also actively protecting employees from human rights  violations and striving to foster an open corporate culture. open recruitment Introducing a new recruitment process through job fairs To secure the very best talent, we are diversifying our recruitment channels. In 2011, we replaced  our traditional biannual graduate recruitment program with a job fair-based system. The new job fair system has been well received particularly for including an opportunity to  communicate our corporate values and philosophy to interested people and or attracting talented  students that understand and respect HMCs values. Participants were provided with opportunities  to introduce themselves to allow recruitment officers to assess their qualifications and whether  their talents matched with HMCs current needs. Students were also provided with opportunities to  meet with HMC staff from specific areas, to enable their talents and interests to be discussed and  assessed. We have also implanted a number of innovative recruitment programs overseas. For example, the  Global Top Talent Forum is a unique recruitment program where participants are briefed on HMCs  research activities and achievements, followed by interactions to identify students with a strong  interest in automotive research and adequate capacity to be part of HMCs work. HMC also has a number of programs for the early identification and hiring of talented students  including local scholarship programs, the H Innovator internship program and global scholarship  programs. The global scholarship program has a special significance because the program provides  financial support to students in emerging economies. The program also has the practical benefit of  securing top local talent as a part of HMC workforce. We are continuously trying  to diversify our recruitment channels and methods to attract top talent  as we hope to lead the transformation of recruitment culture in Korea. For example, HMC was one of  the first companies to utilize social network services to advertise job opportunities. increasing performance-based pay Implementation of standardized employee evaluation system Performance evaluation and compensation scheme has to be designed to boost job satisfaction and  foster personal development, and to be managed in a fair and transparent manner. HMCs reward scheme has strengthened the links between business performance and rewards,  ensuring that employees are fairly evaluated and rewarded in respect of their achievements. We  have also established a standardized job performance evaluation system for increased transparency  and fairness. 3  62 63 EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt Employee rights support programs   We are currently operating an Employee Complaint Review  Committee and an Employee Complaint Counseling Office to ensure the speedy resolution of all  issues. A new online-based employee complaint center named Once Click HR was established on  November 2011. One Click HR can be accessed from the company intranet Autoway and users can  file their complaint in one of six categories: work location, office conflict, job description, personal  affairs, sexual harassment and others. Personnel affairs department then provides appropriate  solutions to the employees. Employees receive regular classes on sexual harassment prevention and  human rights protection. HMC also operates employee complaint processing units at its overseas  sites and is making an effort to ensure full compliance with local laws and regulations. labor relations management Entering a new era of collaborative labor relations The enforcement of fair employment policies is the foundation of shared growth and positive labor- management relations. HMC management fully recognizes the freedom of association, the right  to organize, and the right for collective bargaining. A large number of HMC employees who work at  domestic sites are members of the HMC Labor Union. Employee representative bodies are also in  place at our overseas operation sites. The Labor-Management Consultation Committee represents  union members at Hyundai Motor India (HMI), and the Public Assembly of Beijing Hyundai Motor  Company (BHMC) represents BHMC employees. The employees of Hyundai Motor Manufacturing in  the Czech Republic (HMMC) have formed a union which has become a member of the large Czech  metal workers union, OS KOVO. A Management-Labor Council is also in place where matters such as  collective bargaining, the settlement of collective agreements and review of employee suggestions  are discussed. Salary negotiations and collective bargaining agreed for three consecutive years without a strike     Labor relations issues in a single company can sometimes lead to significant social conflict and the  HMC labor union, the largest labor union in Korea, has been involved in many such conflicts in the  past. Following our roadmap for improved labor relations, we are pursuing a long-term relationship of  mutual benefits through regular management briefings and by holding honest discussions of labor  issues. A dedicated advisory committee was also created to help ensure constructive employee- management relations. As a result, we have been able to settle salary negotiations for three  consecutive years between 2009 and 2011 without a strike. Many experts believe that the three successful salary negotiations can be interpreted as a  new beginning for labor-relations and a shared growth. HMC management and the labor union  are determined to respect all laws and policies on labor relations and to make an active effort  to understand each other better to help establish a positive labor-management relationship.  Supporting an aging workforce Signing a MOU with ministry of education, science and technology on academia-industry  collaboration with the Meister high School An aging society is an issue that can lead to complicated issues on many levels including reduced  income for retirees, the devaluation of property, and reduced taxable income for governments. HMC  is no exception to the risks of an aging society. In 2011, the average age of HMC employees engaged  in production activities was 43, and the number of retirees was 250. We expect the number of  retirees to rise to more than 1,000 per year by 2016. As a response, we have created the Aging  Workforce Research Collaboration Team with members of both management and the labor union, in  order to identify and implement effective mitigation measures. EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt 62 63 All employees are evaluated both on their job performance and their  development potential. We also conduct a 360 degree evaluation to  increase the fairness and objectivity of the personal evaluation.  Unlike associates and deputy managers who receive standardized salaries  regardless of job performance, employees in managerial positions receive  performance-based salaries in order to strengthen the link between job  performance and compensation. In addition, promotion criteria have  been changed from the previous seniority-based system, which favored  researchers with more experience, to a promotion point system that favors  staff with significant achievements. improving employee satisfaction Conducting all staff survey on employee satisfaction HMC has been assessing employee satisfaction using a customized  employment satisfaction index, the ESI (Employee Satisfaction Index),  developed in 2008. The employee satisfaction assessment was  conducted with all 18,280 employees stationed at headquarters and R&D  centers, with a total of 92 questions in 11 areas including job satisfaction,  performance evaluation, promotion, compensation and other benefits.  The response rate was 54%.  The results indicated a slight decrease in overall job satisfaction  compared to the previous year which is assumed to be a result of an  increase in the sample size. The result indicated that employees with  longer experience were more satisfied than the junior staff. The survey  results are used as a basis for improving areas which were identified as  sources of dissatisfaction, such as personnel affairs policies and work  environments. Human rights protection Online employee complaint program We publicly announced the HMC Ethics Charter which conveyed our  commitment to protecting the human rights of all members of HMC. We  have reinforced our commitment to protecting human rights in all of our  business conduct by selecting Respect for People as one of our new five  core values. We are determined to comply with local regulations on human rights  protection and to strive to promote human rights beyond what is legally  required.

Core training modules Implementing global human resource development standard Last year, HMCs employee training program structure was renewed for more effective capacity  building and personal development in line with the HMC long-term global human resource  development strategy. The new training structure consists of four themes: Leadership, Professional,  Value and Global. The Leadership curriculum consists of several training modules designed for employees in different  ranks, and aims to strengthen trainees global competency and capacity to generate positive  business outcomes. The trainees are offered various exercises to develop their leadership skills  during the training program, preparing them for leadership positions. The Professional curriculum consists of the Academy module, which focuses on core specialist  skills, and the Innobiz School module which focus on improving capacity for problem solving and  increasing knowledge in new areas. The Value curriculum is designed for employees who have  recently been promoted to enhance their understanding of HMCs management philosophy, vision  and core values and their ability to uphold these in their role. HMC signed an MOU with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology on academia-industry  collaboration with Meister High Schools, which are highly specialized high schools for the training of  highly skilled industrial workers. The MOU sets out an agreement on the fostering of 1,000 expert  industrial technicians for the advancement of the automotive industry.

Since 1988, HMC has provided pension benefits as a measure to provide social insurance for  retirement. Pension plans consist of both national and personal pension plans. HMC contributes  20,000 KRW to personal pension plans per month. For the national pension plan, each employee  pays 9% of their average salary into the program, HMC pays half of the pension installments. 5 The Global curriculum focuses on increasing the global competency of the trainees, internalizing  core values, fostering global leadership and enhancing the ability to communicate with staff and  stakeholders from different cultures. The Global Human Resource Development Standard (GHRDS)  curriculum is designed to provide structured training and professional development of our locally- hired personnel at overseas business sites. Developed at the HMC headquarter, the GHRDS  curriculum consists of core training modules (HMC values, diversity, job skills) and complimentary  custom modules developed by our overseas offices. Online versions of some of the core training  modules have been created to provide high quality training for locally-engaged employees overseas. Global competency building Offering tailored training programs for building global competence The Global Human Resource Development Standard (GHRDS) was established in 2007 to enable  the effective personal development of our overseas employees including expatriate employees and  those hired locally. In 2009, an on-line Global Learning Center was established as a part of our  strategic global workforce cultivation program, which offers courses designed to build a common  understanding of HMCs history, vision, management policies and core values. The Global Learning  Center was also established to support the creation of locally-managed training programs that meet  the needs of each subsidiary. The Global Learning Center will be further upgraded in the future  as a central training resource that contributes to improved business performance. In addition, we  are operating inward visit programs for locally hired employees stationed in overseas. Participants  visit our domestic business sites including our R&D center and at the same time boost their  understanding of Korean culture, foster a one-team spirit, and strengthen their sense of belonging. Our foreign language training program has been expanded with the increase in HMCs overseas  business. We have extended our support by offering more online foreign language courses including  Chinese and English courses. We also operate offline intensive English courses, English conversation  programs, and the in-company English communication practice space Y.E.S (Your English Square).  We are also experimenting with new methods to improve language skills such as conducting some  of our regular training courses in English. Overall, HMC offers a comprehensive training program,  tailored to individual needs and job requirements, to support the development of its employees. Establishment of a Global hR Community   As HMCs operations become increasingly globalized,  global competency has become an important development goal for HMC employees, In 2010,  we created the Global HR Community within the companys intranet to help the development of  global competency among HMC employees. It is full of information and useful tips based on the  experiences of our employees based overseas, as well as guidelines for adapting to local culture in  overseas operation sites. The site also offers administrative support to help staff prepare for going  and returning from overseas. Full of lively details of the real life successes and mishaps of real of   HMC staff, the online community has become an important resource for all HMC employees.  68 69 EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt HealtH & SaFety Ensuring employee health and safety is an essential part of corporate social responsibility. HMC  has been making a sustained effort to provide a safe and healthy working environment since its  incorporation. Since assuring employee safety is our highest priority, we are taking various measures  including industrial safety pre-assessment, accident prevention activities, increased investment in  safety improvement facilities and safety training. In addition, we are also operating an industrial  health and safety center, a health fitness center, and free health check-ups to ensure the best health  of all our employees. Safety Industrial accident rate down by 24% in Korea and down by 43.2% in overseas Due to the industrial characteristics of the auto manufacturing business, HMC employees are  exposed to a higher risk of industrial accidents compared to other industries. Therefore, HMC has  been offering comprehensive safety training to better protect employees from the risks. In addition,  we are continuously improving safety, as well as improving physically demanding processes in order  to create a more pleasant and safe working environment. Thanks to the efforts made, the number of  industrial accidents decreased by 24%, lowering the accident rate to 1.22%. Sustained efforts will be  made to achieve a zero accident work place in the nearest future possible. Establishment of Environment, health and Safety (EhS) management system   HMC has the EHS  system at the Asan and Ulsan Plants which meets occupational health and safety management  systems (OHSAS 18001). The new system is interlinked with the existing Integrated Environment,  Safety and Health System (i-ESH), which can be accessed via HMC intranet (http://iesh.hmc.co.kr).  The i-ESH ystem collects information and data on safety, health and environment related issues.  The data is then repackaged into various forms of statistical data to be used by employees working  at relevant work sites.  The senior management of HMC places the uttermost importance on employee safety with a focus  on four core elements of man, machine, management and media. Detailed risk assessments are  conducted every time any of the employees identify a potential risk and processes and changes  are made when deemed necessary to ensure improved safety. A comprehensive risk assessment is  conducted once every three years to proactively manage risks associated with new technologies and  processes incorporated in each production plant. Rigorous safety management system   Each business unit at HMC operates a separate ESH  team for rigorous safety management. We also have a Health & Safety Team staffed with qualified  professionals including a professional physician who offers health consultation services to  employees as well. Furthermore, the Industrial Health and Safety Committee, which is comprised of an equal numbers  of labor and management representatives, makes decisions on the companys ESH polices and  other key issues to better prevent safety-related accidents and to continue improving overall  workplace safety. Overseas plant safety management   HMC is making uttermost effort to protect our growing number  of overseas employees from industrial accidents, with a firm understanding that ensuring the highest  employee safety is a fundamental requirement of our business and also the foundation for high  productivity.   In 2011, creation of safe work place was made a top business objective of HMC and we began  making renewed efforts to prevent industrial accidents and to maintain smooth production  operations. As a first step, we introduced an industrial accident data monitoring system and set a target rate,  which are reviewed on a regular basis. The definition and reporting scope of industrial accidents  varies by country and therefore each overseas plant has a slightly different target that best complies  with local requirements yet is in line with relevant international standards. Various programs on  awareness raising and accident prevention activities are conducted as well. All employees receive mandatory safety training and other activities are conducted to eliminate  potential risks as much as possible, including a safety check of all high-risk facilities and the  installation of additional safety equipment. The increased efforts being made in safety are proving  to be effective with a reduction in the industrial accident rate at overseas HMC plants from 1.18%  in 2010 to 0.67% in 2011. We are striving to further reduce the industrial accident rate to 0.57% in  2012. We are also conducting strengthened training programs to build the capacity of safety managers at  overseas plants. In November 2011, we held the first Global Safety Management Seminar at our  Czech Plant, to raise awareness of safety at overseas plants. Following the establishment of OHSAS 18001-certified Health and Safety (H&S) system at domestic  plants, we are preparing to improve H&S management systems at our overseas plants for OHSAS  18001 certification by 2014. We expect the improvements of the H&S system and certification to  demonstrate our commitment to protecting our employees and local communities. The certification  is also expected to provide the basis for sharing our belief that great quality is only achieved in a  safe workplace. managing employee health Employee health and stress management and counseling center HMC currently operates an industrial health center which provides a comprehensive range of  medical services to create a healthy working environment. We are also operating a fitness center  to help our employees maintain a healthier life. HMC provides regular health check-ups for all  employees, in addition to collecting health data to control and better prevent illness in advance.  In 2011, a total of 238.9 billion KRW was paid to support employee pension plans. Expense on  pension support is increasing every year. A new defined-benefit corporate pension scheme was  introduced in 2011, as a measure for strengthening pensionable rights. In 2013, employees will be  provided with the option of a defined contribution pension scheme. 6  70 71 EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt 71 Free health check   Free health check-ups are provided biennially to  administrative and R&D workers and annually to plant workers. HMC  is the first company in Korea to provide a Chinese medicine check-up  program as an alternative to its regular medical check-up program. For  employees over the age of 35, as well as their families, full health check- ups are provided. Through our on-line medical service site, Online Med,  our employees can conveniently make arrangements for full health checks  at their hospital of choice at a time that suits them. Preventing accidents in the workplace and providing advanced medical  support   HMC operates an Industrial Medical Center and Medical Clinic  in every domestic manufacturing plant and at the Namyang R&D Center  as part of the industrial accident prevention program. Each site also has  a 24-hour emergency clinic in operation. Our Industrial Medical Centers  have comprehensive facilities, including a physical therapy room, a clinical  laboratory, and a radiation room. Employees working at HMC and its  suppliers can receive a full range of medical services, from preventive  medicine, to diagnosis and treatment. The center also conducts annual regular and special check-ups for  employees working in hazardous environments and based on the  results, provides additional medical services as required. On average,  approximately 100,000 HMC employees and supply company employees  visit the Industrial Medical Center for medical services each year, most  commonly for treatment of respiratory and digestive ailments. Strengthening health care measures for an aging workforce   HMC is  taking strong measures to address chronic diseases such as high blood  pressure, dyslipidemia, diabetes and other diseases that are becoming  more prevalent particularly among the older population, as the average  age of HMC employees is increasing especially at the Ulsan Plant.  Employees who have been diagnosed with symptoms are Placed in a  health management program and receive regular medical check-ups and  treatment. The employees being treated may work flexibly with less work  hour to ensure a speedy recovery.  Results have been incredibly positive, with 90% showing improvement.  Since 2004, health treatment services have been provided to employees  suffering from muscular skeletal diseases. By the end of 2011, a total of  6,212 employees had received treatment for muscular skeletal diseases,  and in 97% of cases the symptoms had improved as a result of treatment  received during working and non-working hours. A small number of  workers have been officially identified to be suffering from occupational  injuries. Stress management and counseling services   We have established  employee grievance and stress management centers, talk talk center at  headquarters, Maum-Shimter at Namyang R&D Center and Hangbok  Shimter at Ulsan Plant. The centers have received favorable reviews  for their professional counseling services and for providing a variety of  support to alleviate problems reported by employees.  72 73 EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt 73 EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt  cHanGe in JD power iQS anD VDS ScoreS  Low score indicates better quality. 75% 44% 532 192 108 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 132   initial Quality  Study (iQS)   Vehicle  Dependability  Study (VDS) Quality FirSt manaGement Quality is incredibly important for an automobile because it directly affects customer satisfaction and  safety.

Currently, senior executives meet twice a month to  discuss quality management issues. The biweekly meetings of top executives have fostered a sense  of shared responsibility, and have made quality a high-priority issue for all divisions within HMC  including R&D, production, purchasing, financial administration and sales. In 2010, we also strengthened our quality-focused marketing effort with the goal of positioning  HMC as a Best Buy Brand. In addition to achieving high build quality, we are also improving vehicle  characteristics that affect the emotional quality of our vehicles. improving customer satisfaction on quality hMC receive third highest record in JD Power vehicle Dependability Study  Many HMC vehicles have been ranked highly in the Initial Quality Study (IQS) conducted by JD Power,  a U.S.-based global marketing information services company.

The customer opinions  collected at the center are internally referred to as the Voice of the Customer. The information is  analyzed and fed to the relevant teams to improve processes and resolve identified issues.  We also regularly assess customer satisfaction by surveying customers who have recently purchased  a HMC vehicle on the services they received. We are also operating channels for collecting Voice of  the Customer data in overseas markets. In addition to conducting customer satisfaction surveys on  a regular basis, we are also conducting in-depth interviews with customers through focus groups, to  analyze customer complaints and implement measures to address them thereby improving customer  satisfaction in overseas markets. Ultimately, we are striving to achieve customer satisfaction  throughout all areas of our business including purchasing, operation and end of life treatment of  vehicles that we have manufactured. We are also working with HMC dealers who are both important internal customers and the ultimate  point of contact for HMC customers, to build their capacity through HMC Dealer Enhancement  Program which is a training program designed to enhance customer service, dealership improvement  and staff development. Dealers are also invited to visit Korea to enhance their understanding of  HMCs operations and to strengthen partnerships with Korea-based staff. HMCs strong partnership  effort with dealers was well received by members of the National Automobile Dealers Association  who picked HMC as the best company to work with in the dealer attitude survey conducted in 2011. 2 Hyundai customer Satisfaction index In 1999, we developed the Hyundai Customer Satisfaction Index (HCSI) to measure the satisfaction  of customers who own our vehicles. The survey collects customer opinions in four areas: product  quality, sales service, maintenance service and corporate image. The data is then analyzed to  calculate an HCSI score and to identify areas for improvement. HMC scored 64.3 points in 1999,  79.2 points in 2010 and 82.1 points in 2011. In addition to its use in improving specific business  processes, the survey result is also used as a basis for policy decisions throughout our business  practices. We are also paying close attention to the customer satisfaction surveys conducted by third parties  including the National Customer Satisfaction Index (NCSI) by the Korean Productivity Center,  the Korean Customer Satisfaction Index (KCSI) survey conducted by the Korean Management  Association Consultancy (KMAC), and the Korean Standard Service Quality (KSSQ) Index conducted  by the Korean Standards Association (KSA). customer service Establishing global service network - Going above and beyond complete customer satisfaction We opened a Five Senses Brand Experience Center to offer visitors an opportunity to experience  the HMC brand and our vehicles using all five of their senses.

The first trend I see pretty regularly these days is the attempt to understand what Premium  looks like. Does premium have an aesthetic, and if so, is it universal?  Other trends include are- birth in new aerodynamics, and intensive investigations on how new materials can improve  the weight of the vehicles. Those two areas are perhaps the most effective ways design can  influence the cars of the future. Im happy to see, more and more, design trends which have a  functional endeavor again-not just a style-for-style-sake movement.  what do you think of Fluidic Sculpture? what will be the next  phase of Hmc since Hmc is getting very positive reaction on  Fluidic Sculpture design language nowadays?  To me, it is about energy, constant movement, and the idea of never-ending flow. Fluidity implies  continuous motion.  I think this design philosophy connects seamlessly to the type of customer  we want to attract.  Balance the energy with stability and control. Maintain and foster originality. Continue our  message by solidifying belief in our philosophy. Creating an approach is hard work- sticking with  it requires tremendous belief.  We need to continuously chant our mantra. where do you think Hmc design is compared to other brands,  specially to German and Japanese brands?  Taking calculated risks is important to maintaining identity and differentiation.  And  acknowledging the successes of the competition is essential to healthy growth.  Bench-marking  and comparing oneself to the competition should result in differentiation, not emulation. If the  Germans and Japanese have success, it is because they ultimately stay true to themselves and  their culture.  We should hope to do the same. interView ChriStopher Chapman chiEf dEsignEr, hyundAi AmEricA tEchnicAl cEntEr  80 81 EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt 80 81 r&d motor show tHree core StrateGieS For SHareD GrowtH We have been operating various supplier support programs in areas such as financial support, as  well as the establishment of a global management system, in order to sustain growth of our suppliers   as independent companies. In 2010, HMC began to implement our new shared growth strategy which builds on our partnerships  with suppliers, founded on a mutually-beneficial cooperation initiative. The new strategy focuses  on supporting the growth of our suppliers in becoming globally-recognized partners through a  combination of support programs. HMC has identified global competency building, strengthening a  sustained growth foundation, and the establishment of a shared growth system as the three core  strategies for realizing shared growth with our suppliers. We then launched technical assistance  programs for quality improvement as well as overseas sales expansion support. Various programs  were also launched to foster a corporate culture that embraces the concept of shared growth. Global competency building Establishment of supplier R&D Support Corps, new technology development know-how transfer Supplier support programs for fostering global competency includes technology development  support, quality management capacity building and productivity improvement support programs. We were already operating a number of supplier support programs including the Guest Engineer  Program, on-site training for second-tier suppliers and supplier participation in R&D Motor Shows.  In addition to these programs, we established the Supplier R&D Support Corps, the Supplier Quality  Management Training Center and a number of tailored policies for different types of suppliers in  order to boost technological competency and product quality. In 2010, we held our first R&D Motor Show during which suppliers were briefed on the features of  recently released competitors models. Designed as one of the first shared growth programs, the  motor show provided an opportunity to learn about quality management of competitor companies  for supplier employees in charge of R&D and quality management. Over 4,000 members of supplier  companies participated in the event. Launched in 2011, the Supplier R&D Support Corps, which has 300 employees including 40 full- time, is another important organization established for the on-site support of R&D activities and  to improve quality by transferring HMCs R&D expertise to suppliers participating in new vehicle  development projects. The Supplier Quality Management Training Center was established to encourage enhanced quality  management and offers Quality Management Expertise courses for staff from supply companies in  charge of product quality management. The courses are evaluated thoroughly using feedback from  participants and revised in order to ensure effectiveness. Strengthening a sustained growth foundation Supporting overseas sales of suppliers and promoting sustainable growth We operate various supplier support programs including overseas sales expansion support,  improving financial stability and the establishment of infrastructure for growth. Programs within the  overseas sales expansion support include overseas business expansion in collaboration with HMC,  increased use of second and third-tier supplier products in overseas plants, and direct assistance for  overseas sales to non-HMC buyers. SUpplierS hmC is striving to achieve sustained growth while maintaining a collaborative  partnership with its suppliers who are responsible for the manufacturing of parts and  materials for hmC vehicles. hmC will continue to foster a culture of fair trade and  to strengthen supplier competitiveness in order to ensure shared growth with our  business partners. 1  82 83 EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt 82 83 Since 2003, Hmc has invested a total of five billion krw in our Supply chain Green  partnership program in collaboration with the korean government to help under- resourced suppliers establish an effective green business management system.

As a first step, we announced the HMC Environmental Standards Guideline which contains  information on the environmental requirements for manufacturing auto parts to be used in our  products. The HMC Environmental Standards provides guidelines on materials which are prohibited  including four heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium) and various other  hazardous materials which are subject to regulations. The guidelines provides a wide array of  information including a data entry method for the International Material Data System (IMDS) for  calculating a vehicle recyclability score as well as Material Safety Data Sheet management, which  are both necessary for ensuring compliance with applicable environmental regulations. We are also encouraging all suppliers to obtain ISO 14001 environmental management certification.  As a result, 100% of our first tier suppliers had received certification by the end of 2011. 2 We established a Supplier Global Business Promotion Support Program in 2011 which is designed  to promote the overseas businesses of suppliers that manufacture high quality parts. The program  has four areas of focus including; export competitiveness support, overseas demand identification,  export work support and the establishment of an export activities monitoring structure. We also held  various promotional events such as an overseas auto parts roadshow. We have set an ambitious goal of increasing total exports of target suppliers from 7.4 billion USD in  2009 to 20 billion USD by 2015. We will increase supplier export support measures in collaboration  with suppliers to achieve the goal and to strengthen the competitiveness of our suppliers. establishment of a shared growth system Establishment of web sites for shared growth, supplier volunteer corps and more HMC has organized a Win-Win Supplier Consultation Group, which consists of suppliers from all  tiers in order to strengthen the network among suppliers, provide stronger support for second-tier  suppliers, and to foster a shared culture of growth. Overall, we are aiming for the establishment of a  shared growth system. Specifically, we have increased support for information exchange sub-groups  which consist of members of consultation groups who belong to the same region or industry sectors.  HMC staff also visit suppliers to foster a network among suppliers of similar industry sectors. Establishment of a shared growth website and the supplier volunteer corps are new initiatives  designed to promote a culture of shared growth among suppliers. HMC is also increasing supplier  visits to listen to their concerns and ideas more closely in order to ensure the effectiveness of our  supplier support programs.  84 85 EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt EnvironmEnt Society AppEndix Economy sustAinAbility mAnAgEmEnt HMC 2012  SuStainability  RepoRt FocuS on cSr proGramS easy move improving transport access for people with limited  mobility - installation of emergency escape chutes and alarms - establishment of social enterprise, the easy Move ltd. - Donation of special playrooms for disabled children Safe move  promotion of traffic safety awareness - kids auto park traffic safety training center - Child traffic safety training bus and programs in Russia - Distribution of angel wing-shaped boarding/unloading    stickers for kindergarten buses green move  restoring nature - Hyundai green Zone korea:   Reintroduction of the Myungju butterfly - Hyundai green Zone China:   forestation in Chakanor desert -  funding support for various ecosystem protection      activities happy move  Volunteer activities in partnership with local communities - employee volunteer corps - the blue Santa volunteer activities - Happy together family volunteer corps - Home repair services other cSr activities - Categories of CSR programs    Sports, arts & Culture, education, Social welfare - focus CSR program fund projects   for people with disabilities, the elderly, young people       and children 84 85 Focus on cSr programs Happy  moVe volunteer activities in  partnership with local  communities  promotion of  traffic safety  awareness SaFe  moVe Green  moVe restoring nature eaSy  moVe improving transport  access for people with limited  mobility categories of cSr  program areas Social welfare Sports education arts &  culture  cSr actiVity areaS the elderly people with  disabilities young people and  children moving the  world together:  cSr project areas information on carbon emissions energy/ghg emissions information information on energy/ghg  emissions energy use data management of life cycle Co2 emissions installation of digital electric meters  node Concentrato Middleware global environmental regulation  information management Supplier  energy  management monitoring  data supplied  from smart  meters integrated greenhouse gas emissions monitoring agp auto agp poRtal agp paRtneR Carbon footprint labeling parts  manufacture vehicle  assembly transport Use recycling/Scrapping of vehicle energy use status analysis of energy use  pattern management of  greenhouse gas emissions Finished  vehicle online Supplier  tHree SyStem aGp-eco SolutionS automotiVe Green partnerSHip -baSeD eco-enerGy manaGement Solution In 2010, HMC began the development of the Automotive Green Partnership-based Eco-Energy Management Solution (AGP Eco  Solution) with funding from the National IT Industry Promotion Agency. The AGP Eco Solution was designed as a response to  rising demands for reduction of GHG emissions and energy use and was implemented at the Ulsan Plant and three supplier  plants. The AGP Eco Solution consists of three sub-systems including the AGP Auto for lifecycle GHG emissions management of vehicles,  the AGP Partner for GHG emissions of suppliers and the AGP Portal for integrated monitoring of GHG emissions and energy use by  HMC and suppliers. Using the AGP Auto, a company can assess direct and indirect GHG emissions associated with the manufacturing of vehicles. The  data from the AGP Auto can be used to reduce the carbon footprint of each vehicle model. The AGP Partner is a supplier energy use management program which consists of smart meters and a centralized energy  management system. The AGP Portal collects and processes real-time information on the energy use and GHG emissions  of HMC and supplier facilities and provides the information to its user, enabling real-time monitoring of GHG emissions. The AGP  Portal offers information on global environmental regulations as well.  The AGP Partner allows HMC suppliers to monitor their electricity use and to help them achieve energy savings. For instance, the  three suppliers who participated in the AGP Eco Solution project achieved annual saving of 200 million KRW on their electricity  bills. HMC plans to mandate implementation of the AGP Partner to all of its suppliers in order to strengthen the GHG reduction  management structure throughout its value chain and to ultimately transform the automobile manufacturing business into a low  carbon green industry. loCal  CommUnitieS we firmly believe that the value of CSr activities in areas such as social welfare, art &  culture, education and the environment are as high as our main business activities. we  will continue our investments in CSr activities in order to make a positive contribution  towards improving peoples quality of life and creating a sustainable society.

The management of Hyundai Motor Company is responsible for preparing the Report. Our responsibility is to carry out a limited level of  assurance engagement on the information presented in the Report and to provide our conclusion. We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 (International Standard on Assurance Engagement 3000-Assurance  Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards  Board (IAASB). The extent for a limited level of assurance is less than that of a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore a lower level of  assurance is provided for the Report. An engagement is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and review procedures applied to the  data Hyundai Motor Company provided. The scope of our work was restricted to 2011 performance only. Information relating to the earlier periods  has not been subject to our assurance. Our work included the following activities. 	 	Interviews	with	the	personnel	responsible	for	aggregation	and	reporting	of	the	subject	data. 	 	An	evaluation	of	the	design,	existence	and	operation	of	the	systems	and	methods	used	to	collect	and	process	the	subject	data.
