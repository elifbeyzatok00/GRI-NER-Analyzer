Thamrin no. 51  Jakarta 10350  Contact  Position  Sustainability and  Stakeholder Engagement  Country  Indonesia  Contact Ph.  +62-21-392 9266 - 69  Sector  Pulp and Paper Industry  Member Since  28 August 2008                         PT. Indah Kiat Pulp & Paper, Tbk. (IKPP) is part of the Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP) family  of companies. It was established in 1976 and has produced wood-free paper since 1978. It has  been listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (formerly Jakarta and Surabaya Stock Exchange)  since 1990.     The company has production facilites in three locations -- Perawang, in Riau Province, and   Tangerang and Serang, in Banten Province. It produces pulp and paper for the consumer market,  including writing and printing papers (coated and uncoated free-sheet) and photocopy paper. The  company also manufactures industrial papers, including container board, corrugated shipping  containers, boxboard and specialty colored papers.         Statement of Continuing Support  Company at a Glance     IKKP and the United Nations Global Compact    In its commitment to corporate social responsibility, IKKP fully supports the United Nations Global  Compact to improve human rights, labor rights, protect the environment and fight corruption.    The company is committed to aligning the principles of United Nation Global Compact with its  strategy, culture, and day-to-day operations, and to clearly state this commitment to its  employees, business partners, and the public. In addition, the company espouses public  accountability and transparency and pledges to report its progress publicly in regular  sustainability reports.                IKPPs approach to the environmental issues are in line with the three principles of the UN  Global Compact:    Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental  challenges.  Principle  8:  Business  should  undertake  initiatives  to  promote  greater  environmental responsibility.  Principle 9: Business should encourage the development and diffusion of  environmentally friendly technologies.    As a responsible paper company, IKPP is committed to ensuring that the impact of its activities  and operations do not harm the global environment. To that end, it aims to achieve continual  improvement in its environmental performance by following global best practices and adopting  environmentally friendly production technologies..      Each IKPP facility has a team of people designated to manage environmental issues and  communicate its efforts to stakeholders through regular discussions with representatives of  local communities.  As a result, the communities environmental concerns and aspirations are  effectively addressed.     IKPP regularly evaluates the impact of the companys operations on the environment through  strict internal and external audits.     All of IKPPs mills have been ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) certified.  Indah Kiat Tangerang became the first mill in Indonesia to be awarded an ISO 14001 EMS,  followed by the other two mills, IKPP Perawang and IKPP Serang, which earned their ISO  14001 EMS in 1997 and 2004, respectively. All IKPP mills have since upgraded to ISO  14001:2004, the latest Environmental Management Standard.       In 1999, IKPP Perawang was SMK3 (Occupational Health and Safety) certified, meeting or  exceeding government requirements. Since then, the plants compliance has been verified  through annual, third-party audits. In addition, the companys products comply with product  safety regulations for Europe, Japan and the United States, including regulations pertaining  to the use of potentially hazardous substances or materials.        AREA 1: ENVIRONMENT     In 2008, IKPP, along with a number of other APP mills, applied for a PROPER certificate, a  multi-level certification established by the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of  Indonesia, based on the requirements of its Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation and  Rating (PROPER). IKPP was awarded with Blue certificate in 2009.  The Ministry gives  PROPER certificates to mills that produce emissions at levels below those permitted by  government standards and which use clean technology, minimize waste, prevent pollution  and conserve resources.     IKPP mills implement Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) on waste management so  that the quality of the waste meets and often exceed government regulations. These SOPs  include Solid Waste Management, Waste Water Treatment, and Landfill Operations.  All IKPP mills continually implement programs and support investment to  reduce their  consumption of fresh water, chemicals, and energy as well as lower their waste and  emissions. The program uses ISO Environmental Management Systems (EMS) protocols to  drive these actions. The Company enforces waste management policies to reduce pollutants.  These include a Source Control Policy and a Reduce, Reuse and Recycle Policy.  Wastewater plants employ activated sludge treatments, as well as physical and chemical  treatments to prepare wastewater for safe discharge into the local waterways. In addition,  Perawang mill uses its black liquor, solid waste, sludge and residues as an alternative fuel  source. Currently it uses this biomass fuel as its main fuel source, providing more than half of  the plants energy. Further demonstrating the companys commitment to produce paper with  environmentally-friendly technology, Indah Kiats mills have incorporated the three Rs of  good resource stewardship into their quarterly Environmental Management System  management review of operations.  As a result of these efforts:  o  The Perawang mill reuse and recycles a significant amount of its solid waste:  sludge, fly ash and dregs-and-grit (residual material from the recausticizing units)  are reused into fertilizer, and recovered fiber from sludge are recycled to produce  low-grade pulp.   o  The Serang mill recycles reject plastic originated from the waste paper they use  as raw material into core plugs for paper rolls and into plastic seeds for sale to  molders who make various types of plastic products.   o  Tangerang mill has commercialized a program to mix mill sludge with coal in its  power boiler. Now the mill uses its sludge to create energy for the mills  operation.       Coal ashes are sent to PT. Semen Padang as cement substitute in Ready Mix.       To further realize its commitment toward reducing Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, IKPP  initiated a series of projects based on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the  United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC). IKPP Serangs  Hybrid Waste Water Treatment facility, which produces and captures methane gas that can  be recycled back into energy to fuel operations, is already approved by UNFCCC while other  projects are currently under way.      IKPP and APP initiated a Carbon Footprint Assessment to provide a benchmark against  which to measure and reduce their GHG emissions and assist IKPP to reduce its carbon  footprint in the future and chart its progress toward the long-term goal of producing carbon- neutral paper.     In 2008, APP released the results of its first Carbon Footprint Assessment. The assessment  showed that APPs pulp and paper mills, including IKPP, are operating well within industry  norms with regards to GHG emissions.       During 2009, IKPP together with APP and independent consultant, Environmental Resource  Management (ERM) continued its Carbon Footprint Assessment. This second phase has  been conducted starting second quarter of 2009 known as Carbon Footprint Monitoring. In  addition, a Life Cycle Assessment was also conducted simultaneously. This assessment will  be finalized by the end of 2010.      By involving the local community, the Serang mill reuses paper waste to produce souvenirs  and handicrafts, and recycles plastic waste into core plugs for paper rolls and plastic seeds  for sale to molders who make various types of plastic products. This program helps to  empower the local communities and provide additional income for them.     Local communities around the Serang mill reuse paper waste to produce handicrafts.      Together with a team from Riau University, the Perawang mill measures water quality of the  Siak River, while the Tangerang mill helps socialize and train villagers to become teachers  and nurses in the surrounding communities using the 6R/GS (the Toyota Way) approach.  Developed by Toyota 6R/6S is a management philosophy to handle working tools, materials,  and people in an efficient way while simultaneously eliminating waste.     To realize its commitment to sustainable forest management for all its fiber sources, IKPP  applies a strict and rigorous Chain of Custody (CoC) system to ensure that pulpwood  entering its operations are legal and come from non-controversial sources. All pulpwood, pulp  and waste paper purchased by IKPP mill have a documented supply chain ensuring they can  be traced back to their original sources.    In 2009, Indah Kiat Perawang mill achieved Chain-of-Custody (CoC) certification under the  Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). Three of Indah Kiat Mills are  PEFC CoC Certified. The other two mills were certified under PEFC CoC standard in 2008.  PEFC is a leading, internationally recognized forest certification endorsement program which  promotes forest certification through independent third party verification and provides an  assurance mechanism to purchasers of wood and paper products that they are promoting  responsibly managed forests. Its endorses national forest certification standards balance  economic, social, and environmental concerns related to the commercial use of forests. With  about 30 endorsed national certification systems and more than 220 million hectares of  certified forests, PEFC is the worlds largest forest certification system. In addition, IKPP  Perawang Mill has also introduced procedures to avoid raw material from controversial  sources. This procedure has been verified by an independent third-party certification body, to  confirm that no illegal or controversial wood enters the mills pulpwood supply chain.         One of the checking points before the transported logs enter the mill.        During 2009, Indah Kiat Perawang mill has successfully achieved the LEI Chain-of-Custody  (CoC) standard. LEI or the Indonesian Ecolabelling Standard is a constituent based  organization that promotes sustainable forest resource management in Indonesia through  developing forest management system into forest certification system.      To maintain its commitment to consistently procure raw material from sustainable and  responsibly managed sources, in 2009 IKPP Perawang and its pulpwood suppliers were  audited against Legal Origin Verification (LoV) and CoC systems subject to the Indonesian  Ecolabelling Institutes standard for fiber supply and raw material.  They were also evaluated  for Timber Legality and Traceability Verification – Verification of Origin (TLTV-VO) by an  independent third-party auditor, SGS (Socit Gnrale de Surveillance). All audits confirmed  the integrity of the mills raw material.     For its world market purchases of paper pulp, the company ensures the integrity of its fiber  supply by buying only environmentally certified market pulp that meets PEFC or equivalent  certification standards and criteria.    APP, IKPP and their pulpwood suppliers are committed to protecting biodiversity through its  commitment to Conservation Beyond Compliance. During 2009, APP and its pulpwood  suppliers implemented the ongoing development of the Senepis Buluhala Tiger Sanctuary.     In 2007, the company, through APP and their pulpwood suppliers, joined with other forest  concession holders, the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry, local governments and non- governmental organizations to create and finance a 106,000-hectare tiger sanctuary in the  province of Riau, Sumatra. In 2008 they actively participated in various activities organized by   the sanctuarys Working Group, whose primary goals are to preserve the tigers and their  habitat, and avoid human-tiger conflict in the area. One of the Working Groups activities was  to put up signs along the perimeter of the protected area to clearly mark its boundaries to  increase awareness of the areas status and reduce the threats posed by human activities –  which are among the most threatening to the survival of Sumatran Tigers.     Today, APP, its pulpwood suppliers and other Working Group members plan to implement a  study to develop strategies to protect tigers and keep them away from settlements.    Another example of the companys commitment to Conservation Beyond Compliance is its  leadership in establishing the Giam Siak Kecil – Bukit Batu (GSK-BB) Biosphere Reserve in  Riau Province, Sumatra. Biosphere reserves are designed to meet one of the most  challenging issues facing the world today – achieving conservation objectives while  concurrently accommodating development needs.   In collaboration with the Riau Forest Department, APP, the Company and Sinarmas Forestry  are moving forward with plans to establish the GSK-BB Biosphere Reserve. This is the first  Biosphere Reserve initiative in the world proposed by members of the forest industry.  The Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu (GSK-BB) Biosphere Reserve received official approval by  the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Man and the  Biosphere Programme. The Chief Court of the 21st Session of the International Coordinating  Council of the Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB/ICC) made the decision at its  meeting in Jeju, the Republic of Korea. The 178,000 hectares GSK-BB reserve was one of 22  proposed biosphere locations in 17 countries to receive approval.  The Biosphere Reserve will be unique due to the inclusion of a large swath of pristine peat- swamp forest, and will be home to a diverse range of flora and fauna.     All IKPP mills actively plant trees in barren or unused land surrounding the operations,  providing a green area that can be enjoyed by surrounding communities.     At the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company together with APP started to develop its third  Sustainability Report. The report will cover activities for January 1, 2008 through December  31, 2009. The Sustainability Report will assess the companys performance against indicators  established by the Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) framework. The contents of the report  will be verified by the independent, international, third-party auditor, SGS (Socit Gnrale  de Surveillance), which adheres to the principles and practices of the Institute for Social and  Ethical Accountabilitys AA1000 Assurance Standard. The 2008-2009 Sustainability Report is  expected to be released at the end of 2010.                 IKPPs approach to anti-corruption efforts is in line with Principle 10 of the UN Global  Compact:  Principle 10: Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including  extortion and bribery.      The company endorses a whistle-blowing program to support its Good Corporate  Governance (GCG) Program. This program gives employees a way to report any activities  that might not adhere to GCG policies. GCG Guidelines state that a Whistle Blowing  Program is part of the ethical driver for implementation of GCG, besides regulatory  requirements. This program is also considered as one of the most effective means for  preventing and combating practices that compromise good corporate governance.     This program is wholly supported by top-level management. In accordance to the Sarbanes- Oxley Act, the company guarantees the confidentiality of whistle blowers. Upon receiving a  whistle blowers report, the companys ethics team investigates the charges.    In support of the program, the company has formed an Internal Control and Audit Division  (ICAD), which manages anonymous reports from employees and conducts investigations to  verify the truth of the reports. ICADs investigation reports then serve as the basis for any  decision the company takes related to the suspected individual or party.    The program is promoted through banners and posters posted throughout  the office and mill  areas, and through employee seminars to provide workers with a deeper understanding of  the program and to encourage their involvement.
