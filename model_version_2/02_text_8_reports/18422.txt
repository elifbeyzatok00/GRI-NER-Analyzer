Introduction Johnson Controls (NYSE: JCI) is a global diversified technology and industrial leader serving customers in over 150 countries. Our 162,000 employees create quality products, services and solutions to optimize energy and operational efficiencies of buildings; lead-acid automotive batteries and advanced batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles; and interior systems for automobiles. Our commitment to sustainability dates back to our roots in 1885, with the invention of the first electric room thermostat. Through our growth strategies and by increasing market share we are committed to delivering value to shareholders and making our customers successful.  More information about Johnson Controls, Inc. can be found on our web site: http://www.johnsoncontrol... Statement of Continued Support Message from Stephen A. Roell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer  As an early signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, Johnson Controls is committed to aligning our operations and strategies with the Compact's Ten Principles, which are universally accepted and cover human rights, labor, health and safety, the environment and anti-corruption. Our Human Rights & Sustainability Policy, introduced in 2011, defines how we abide by these principles and related global standards. Our Ethics Policy, which is reviewed annually, guides us as we grow and confront new business issues in the countries in which we operate. Our Ethics Policy defines how we treat each other with fairness, dignity and respect, and provides guidance regarding acceptable and appropriate practices and actions for all of our employees.  As part of our commitment to support the Compacts Ten Principles, we have updated our Communication on Progress (COP) Report as well as met each of the 24 criterion required to achieve Advanced Level status. Our COP Report provides details on how we are implementing the Ten Principles and meeting many, if not most, best practices under each criterion relevant to our company.  In addition to posting our COP Report on the UN Global Compact web site, http://www.unglobalcompac..., we also post it on our public website: http://www.johnsoncontrol.... We also post our most recent Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Report, Business and Sustainability Report, Philanthropic Report, Ethics Policy and Human Rights & Sustainability Policy on the same web page as the COP Report.  Overall, we work to make our customers businesses, products and operations more sustainable:   Building Efficiency optimizes the energy and operational efficiencies of buildings for its customers. In 2011, we introduced our innovative Panoptix solution, a new approach to building efficiency that makes it easier and more affordable for owners and operators of any size facility to achieve better building performance.   Automotive Experience responds to automaker requirements for new interior products and technologies, particularly for smaller and more energy-efficient vehicles. In 2011, we introduced a modular front seat structure, believed to be the lowest-weight structure of its kind on the market. Lightweight seats help improve vehicle fuel consumption and reduce CO2 emissions.   Power Solutions is leading the advanced battery industry for more fuel efficient vehicles. Over the next several years we will invest $520 million globally to add battery capacity for Start-Stop vehicles that improve fuel economy and reduce  http://www.one-report.com/report/cop_rept_adv.html?year=2012&companyid=136&for_pdf=1[9/21/2012 4:16:18 PM] emissions by turning off the engine when a car is stopped. In 2011, we continued to lead the development of an electrified vehicle industry through the launch of our Lithium-ion hybrid and electric vehicle battery facility in Holland, Michigan.  Besides helping customers reduce energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, we seek opportunities to reduce energy in our own facilities around the world. Major goals for reducing energy use and GHG emissions include: energy efficiency retrofits; fleet efficiency improvements; on-site renewable energy; manufacturing process improvements and green power purchases.  We lead efforts to improve sustainability in our supply chain through our Johnson Controls Supplier Sustainability Rating System, a tool designed to promote sustainability, and through the Carbon Disclosure Projects corporate supply chain program. Johnson Controls also reports to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and responses to their investor, water and supply chain questionnaires. In addition, we are a member of the CDP Supply Chain Program and are committed to driving sustainability into our supply chain.  Johnson Controls was ranked #1 among the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in 2011 and #5 in 2012 by Corporate Responsibility Magazine. In 2012, we were listed for the sixth consecutive year as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Magazine. We are proud of our 162,000 employees around the world who demonstrate professionalism and integrity every day. Our culture encourages and supports their efforts to advance our leadership in philanthropy, diversity, health and safety, and ethical behavior.  Stephen A.
