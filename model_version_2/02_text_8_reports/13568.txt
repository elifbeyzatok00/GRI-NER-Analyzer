Im afraid some of  our customers experienced disruptions due to  Hitachis supply chain in the aff ected disaster areas.  Although the earthquake damaged several Hitachi  Group plants, we restored most of the aff ected  manufacturing operations through concerted  companywide eff orts.  Hitachi was established a century ago in Hitachi  City, Ibaraki Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, and  just south of the accident at the Fukushima Nuclear  Power Station. Hitachi has since grown within the  community of Ibaraki as well as the region as a  whole. We believe that it is our responsibility to give  back to the city and the region that nurtured our  business, as well as to help eastern Japan recover  from the earthquake by rebuilding devastated towns  in safer and more sustainable ways. To that end, we  are focusing our energies to use our technologies  and expertise in a concerted eff ort to help deal  with and overcome the accidents at the Fukushima  Daiichi Nuclear Power Station.  Changing Perceptions of Value  Following the Great East Japan  Earthquake The earthquake damage temporarily halted  production at many plants across Japan, while it  deeply aff ected the global value chain, and has  cast doubt on the business continuity planning of  Japanese manufacturers. As part of Japans social  infrastructure, we are reinforcing our risk and  crisis management policies for business continuity  planning and the entire value chain. The earthquake caused temporary shutdowns of  electricity, telecommunications, water, and sewage,  as well as other parts of the infrastructure that  people take for granted. It highlighted many risks  for a secure and reliable infrastructure, including  the possibility of major power shortages. Today,  as I write this, I feel that this disaster forces us  to reprioritize our commitments for the social  infrastructure. Accordingly, I now believe that our  mission is to help create safe, secure, and vibrant  communities, and that we contribute to building  a social, industrial, and daily life infrastructure  that can better withstand disasters. We will  continue striving to create a sustainable society  that conserves resources and energy. We will ful ll  this mission by focusing on our Social Innovation  Business. Pursuing Further Growth Despite the impact of the earthquake, our 2012 Mid- Term Management Plan has borne fruit in several  respects during  scal 2010, the  rst year of the plan.  For example, while all business segments were  pro table, we re-engineered our in-house company  system and began other internal reforms.  Im  rmly committed to position Hitachi  to lead the drive toward creating a sustainable  society, amid economic globalization, by devising  and implementing growth strategies centered  on Social Innovation Business. We will therefore  concentrate investments in eleven key regions,  such as the Asian Belt Zone1 where economic   Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  008 growth is remarkable, South America, and Central  and Eastern Europe. We will achieve true global and  transnational management by positioning Japan  as one of the key areas, and by strengthening local  leadership. We will recruit globally and employ the  right people in the right places.  CSR: the Foundation of Global  Management I believe that CSR is the foundation of global  management and, indeed, any management. The  world faces such global problems as climate change  and ecosystem destruction, as well as energy  depletion, human rights abuse, and other issues.  I think that in order to resolve these fundamental  social issues in line with Hitachis corporate credo,  it is important to create value that can be handed  down 10 to 20 years in the future by collaborating  with partners and stakeholders. We will contribute  to building a sustainable society by simultaneously  creating social and economic value and by  integrating CSR with management and strategy. We  aim to become the worlds most trustworthy and  reliable enterprise.

Mr. Stigson lauded Hitachi Groups Social  Innovation Business as an innovative society- focused strategy that clearly delineates the role  of companies. He noted that a combination of  innovation, markets and appropriate regulation  would be essential in achieving a sustainable society.  Dialogue with WBCSD President on Sustainable  Development and the Role of Firms Bjrn Stigson, President, WBCSD (left) Hiroaki Nakanishi, President, Hitachi, Ltd. (right) About the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)  The WBCSD is a CEO-led, global coalition of some 200 companies advocating for progress on sustainable development. Its mission is to  be a catalyst for innovation and sustainable growth in a world where resources are increasingly limited. The Council provides a platform  for companies to share experiences and best practices on sustainable development issues and advocate for their implementation,  working with governments, non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations. The membership has annual revenues of US$ 7  trillion, spans more than 35 countries and represents 20 major industrial sectors. The Council also benefits from a network of 60 national  and regional business councils and partner organizations, a majority of which are based in developing countries. During his May 2011 trip to Japan, WBCSD (World  Business Council for Sustainable Development)  President Bjrn Stigson visited Hitachi to talk with  Hitachi, Ltd. Representative Executive Offi  cer and  President Hiroaki Nakanishi.  Hitachi, Ltd. has been a WBCSD member  company since  scal 2010 and co-chairs the  WBCSD Ecosystems Focus Area Core Team. This  team has been developing ESR*1 and CEV*2 as tools  for evaluating the ecosystem impact of corporate  activities as part of its mission to gauge the impact  of corporate activities on ecosystems and to preserve  ecosystems.  At their meeting, Mr. Stigson and Mr. Nakanishi  discussed issues such as the impact of the Great East  Japan Earthquake on Japan and Hitachi, the status   of the recovery from the disaster, the medium-  WEB  http://www.wbcsd.org/web/esr.htm (various languages) *1  ESR:  The Corporate Ecosystem Services Review WEB  http://www.wbcsd.org/web/cev.htm (various languages) *2  CEV:  The Guide to Corporate Ecosystem Valuation WEB  http://www.hitachi.com/environment/dialogue/ Details of the meeting appear on Hitachis environmental Web site. T O P  D I A L O G U E  Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  010 Eff ect of the Great East Japan Earthquake and  Hitachis Response We wish to express our deepest condolences to all those aff ected by the earthquake that occurred  off  the Paci c coast of northeastern Japan on March 11, 2011 and the subsequent tsunami and  aft ershocks. We sincerely hope for the fastest possible recovery in all regions. The March disaster heavily impacted the Hitachi Group too, particularly our production plants in  prefectures in the Tohoku and Kanto regions. We also lost six of our staff  to the tsunami. The disaster  brought  scal 2010 sales down by 130 billion yen and operation income fell by 75 billion yen. Given  the current economic trends, we expect that  scal 2011 sales will drop by around 350 billion yen and  operation income by around 110 billion yen. Our stakeholders too have felt anxiety and have been  inconvenienced by the damage to production equipment and disruption to material and resource  procurement and logistics. Immediately aft er the disaster, at our head offi  ce we established the Hitachi Group Emergency  Headquarters for Response to the Tohoku Earthquake, headed by Hitachi, Ltd. President Hiroaki  Nakanishi, to provide support for aff ected areas and customers, gather information on losses and  damage suff ered by employees and their families and our various plants, and to launch emergency  measures. On March 23, the role of the Coordination Headquarters was expanded by launching the  Hitachi Group Headquarters for Post-earthquake Reconstruction and Redevelopment to accelerate  recovery and redevelopment activities. We recognize, however, that the extensive impact of the  disaster will require a long-term response. Drawing on our experiences following the March disaster,  we will build greater disaster resilience into our corporate structure and lend our weight as a  company involved in the Social Infrastructure Business to the recovery of not only Hitachi but also  of Japan. 1. Eff ect of the Disaster on Group Management and Recovery Status (1) Eff ect on Factories and Recovery Status   Our factories in Ibaraki Prefecture in particular suff ered damage to buildings and production  facilities, but extremely rapid recovery work has seen our main factories now almost fully  restored.      Hitachi created business continuity plan (BCP) guidelines back in December 2006, and  many of our factories have BCPs in place to deal with outbreaks of a novel strain of in uenza  and earthquakes. We also conduct yearly tabletop exercises covering the eventuality of a major  earthquake, as well as carrying out regular drills and installing emergency facilities, including  having satellite phones set up in key factories. As a result, we were able to establish the Hitachi  Group Emergency Headquarters for Response to the Tohoku Earthquake on the same day as the  earthquake to centralize information and share it across the Group, and to launch immediate  recovery support. Due also to the hard work of our staff , the recovery proceeded much faster  than anticipated, despite the enormous damage. Pillar damaged at Mito Works Response room at Hitachi Works  Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  011 Timing Action March 11 14:46 Great East Japan Earthquake occurs 15:07 First damage reports received by Risk Management HQ from Group companies 15:10 Hitachi Group Emergency Headquarters for Response to the Tohoku Earthquake established 15:40 First Group-wide noti cation sent out from Risk Management HQ (earthquake outline, request  for damage status reports) March 12 First relief supply delivered (12 loads, mainly to districts in Ibaraki and Sendai), including 50,000  liters of water, 65,000 packages of food, and 11,000 rolls of toilet paper March 13 Meeting of the relevant board members Status update, people  rst policy con rmed March 14 Board meeting held Decision to move swiftly on response measures, including gauging the situation, providing relief  supplies, and dispatching personnel March 15 Board Chairman Takashi Kawamura visits factories to con rm the damage  March 17  Con rmation of one employee death, thought to be due to the tsunami March 23 Hitachi Group Headquarters for Post-earthquake Reconstruction and Redevelopment set up Actions Taken Immediately after the Great East Japan Earthquake On March 11, 2010 at 14:46, Hitachi, Ltd.s Hitachi Works was struck by a powerful shock with a  strong seismic intensity of a high 6. Violent tremors continued for the next two minutes, causing  an unprecedented amount of damage. However, restoration of key infrastructure elements, such as power, gas and water in the  Hitachi district, saw commuting return to normal as of March 22, when Hitachi launched a  full-scale initiative involving up to 2,000 people to restore production line and design offi  ce  operations. Thanks to employees laboring day and nightâ€”with manufacturers of large processing  machinery, tools, and jigs off ering unstinting supportâ€”Hitachi was able to resume production at  the remarkably early date of March 29. A week later, on April 3, a gas turbine was shipped from  the Hitachi Port in Hitachi City, Ibaraki Prefecture, for the  rst time since the disaster. That  rst gas  turbine to ship from Hitachi Port, which was massively damaged in the March disaster, epitomizes  the Hitachi Works determination to get manufacturing back up and running.

Hitachis full and careful response to customers radiation  concerns also prevented any impact on product shipments. Long-term measures will, however,  be needed in areas such as power saving and repairing damage to our reputation. To support  customers safety and security, Hitachi will gear production to the parts and material inventory  on hand and ensure that products are delivered on schedule, as well as enhancing our service  information. 2. Support for Aff ected Regions   Up to June 2011, Hitachi Group companies worldwide have together provided support totaling  940 million yen to aid victims of the disaster and to assist in recovery, including the provision,  free of charge, of  at-panel TVs, dry cell batteries and Disaster Victim Support Systems for local  authorities. Some company housing in Tokyo has also been lent to disaster victims. Hitachi will  continue to take swift  support action geared to conditions in the aff ected regions. We have also  been sending staff  volunteers to the Corporate Volunteer Program Supporting People in Regions  Aff ected by the Great East Japan Earthquake. This program, organized by the Joint Committee  for Coordinating and Supporting Voluntary Disaster Relief Activities,1 enables members of the  One Percent Club2 to volunteer for aff ected regions, in response to local requests.   3. Supporting Social Infrastructure Restoration (1) Assistance at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station   Hitachi established the 24-hour Emergency Response Center for Nuclear Power immediately  aft er the earthquake struck, and has collaborated with GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy to help  improve the situation at the power plant. To date, Hitachi has worked on recovering electricity  within the power station, pouring seawater and fresh water, and installing nitrogen injection  systems. We will continue to install nuclear fuel cooling systems, water decontamination  systems, and nuclear reactor covers. About 2,200 staff  members of Hitachi Group have been  providing support and assistance, with around 1,200 employees dispatched to the site.

Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  013 continue to extend our full cooperation in response to requests from the Tokyo Electric Power  Company (TEPCO) and the government.  (2) Assistance Resolving the Power Supply Shortage   Immediately aft er the earthquake, the Emergency Response Center for Thermal Power that  included Group companies was established and 140 employees were deployed to provide an  immediate response to requests for resumption of operations at the various power companies  thermal power plants. 400 engineers and other staff  have been dispatched to power plants, and  we will continue sending them as they are required. Resolving power supply shortages will  require the installation of new power sources, and the Hitachi Group is throwing its full weight  behind  tting new gas turbines and other power generation facilities as well as expanding  existing facilities. We have also begun to supply some of the power outside the company that is  produced by Hitachi, Ltd.s three in-house power generation facilities. (3) Disaster Recovery Support Services   To respond quickly to requests from aff ected customers, Hitachi has set up a dedicated Damage  Response Reception Center. We are also providing a wide range of disaster recovery support  services for between 3 and 12 months at no charge, including disaster support system creation,  email and Web security services, data backup, teleconferencing systems, and small-scale  wireless telecommunication systems. Our main focus is on systems and cloud services for local  governments and companies.  4. Timing of FY 2012 Recruitment Selection Period and Selection Methods   To provide students who have been personally aff ected or whose families have been aff ected by  the disaster with the same opportunity as all other students for taking examinations, the start  of the recruitment selection period at Hitachi, Ltd. was changed from April 1 to June 1. Open  recruitment  nal selection was also held not only in Tokyo and Osaka but also in Sendai in the  Tohoku Region. 5. Summer Electricity Conservation Activities   Based on the Japanese governments energy conservation action plan, as well as discussions  with customers and various industry organizations, Hitachi will reduce power use in regions  where power is supplied by TEPCO and the Tohoku Electric Power Company (Tohoku EPCO)  by at least 15 percent. In other regions too, we will actively promote various measures, making  every possible eff ort to reduce power consumption at the Groups activities. (1) Equalization of Summer Weekday Power Use through Rolling Holidays and Dispersed    Summer Vacations    From July to September in regions where power is supplied by TEPCO and Tohoku EPCO,  Hitachi will shift  employees regular weekly holidays from Saturdays and Sundays to weekdays  (Monday to Friday) on a rolling basis to spread these holidays throughout the week (generally  excluding hospitals, sales and service divisions). Summer vacations, which in normal years are  concentrated around August 15, will be dispersed based on the business group. Other employee  vacation days, such as national holidays that were originally scheduled for October onward,  will also be rescheduled as substitute holidays to fall within the Julyâ€“September period, adding  approximately  ve vacation days. These eff orts will help cut maximum power use by at least 15  percent during the summer period from July to August when power consumption peaks.      Hitachi will add rolling holidays and spread out summer vacations for a number of  programs to assist employees caring for children or nursing care for family members. These   Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  014 include a subsidy system for child and nursing care facility and service costs; temporary  workplace childcare facilities; and the promotion of working from home and  extime,  together with child-caring and nursing care leave.  (2) Energy Conservation Measures at Each Works   In May 2011, we launched the Hitachi Group Summer Energy Conservation Campaign,  promoting energy-saving measures such as cutbacks in the use of indoor lighting, adjusting  air-conditioning temperatures, suspending the operation of some elevators, and extending the  period of time during which employees may come to work without neckties and jackets (based  on the Ministry of the Environments Cool Biz campaign). At our manufacturing bases, we are  striving to equalize production and increase effi  ciency to level out and reduce production line  power use. We are also promoting other measures, such as using Green Curtains,1 which help  to reduce room temperatures at around 300 production bases, branches, and training facilities,  as well as distributing bitter gourd seeds for planting to Hitachi Group employees.  (3) Use of real-time electric power monitoring systems   Hitachis own smart meters, which measure power use in real time, have already been  installed at most plants for real-time monitoring and data gathering. In regions where electric  power is supplied by TEPCO and Tohoku EPCO, these real-time electric power monitoring  systems will be further expanded, and we will build cloud computing systems using Hitachis  EcoAssist-Enterprise, an environmental information management system. These steps will  increase the visibility of power use at the Hitachi Group in those regions and encourage more  effi  cient management of power consumption. 6. Hitachis Position on Nuclear Power Business   Nuclear power plants are one of the key elements of the social infrastructure, and nuclear  power is a valuable energy source for protecting the global environment, enabling, for example,  reduced CO2 emissions. Recognizing that outside Japan too, several countries are planning to  introduce nuclear power to meet energy demand, we will continue our nuclear power business  while giving full consideration to safety. Nuclear power is an essential element of our core Social  Innovation Business, and we will continue to cooperate with those countries around the world  that need to generate electricity by nuclear power.     We will also reinforce our work on thermal power generationâ€”the current power  generation mainstayâ€”and in natural energies for the future, helping to diversify power sources  and further stabilize the electric power supply. 1  Green Curtains:  When climbing vines are grown in front of windows or on walls, the eff ects of transpiration and sunlight blocking by  the leaves can reduce room temperatures by 3â€“5C.

Responsible Partnership with Business Partners Adopted March 2005 Hitachis Management Strategies and CSR V I S I O N For us, CSR means making our Corporate  Credo and Group Vision a reality. We address  the UN Millennium Development Goals of  ending poverty and hunger, universal primary  education, combating diseases, and environmental  sustainability with our technologies and solutions.  We create social and enterprise value with social  and management sustainability.  Our 2012 Mid-Term Management Plan will help  us tackle societys fundamental problems based on  the Social Innovation Business. We will work on  key areas of our main focusesâ€”global, fusion, and  environmentâ€”looking at them from management  and social perspectives, using dialogues with  stakeholders, and will reduce risks and improve  management.  Also, we will apply our CSR Policy throughout  the Group, drawing on dialogue and stakeholder  engagement to integrate management and CSR,  and to become a truly global company.  Our core competency is Social Innovation  Business, which draws on intelligent IT to  provide an advanced social infrastructure. Social  Innovation Businesses include information and  telecommunication systems, power systems,  as well as industrial, transportation and urban  development systemsâ€”all combined  eldsâ€”  supported by materials and key devices. The   ve major business segments, information and  telecommunication systems, power systems, social  and industrial systems, construction machinery,  and high functional materials & components,  together account for around 60 percent of  consolidated net sales.

The importance for stakeholders includes human rights, international development, the  environment, reporting, ethics, and regional and international requirements. The in uence on business includes the global, fusion, and environmental focuses of our  2012 Mid-Term Management Plan, as well as the perspectives of innovation, risk, reputation, and cost eff ectiveness. The digest of this report presents these important  issues in the two assessment areas. Material Issues for Hitachi 1. Products that deliver   sustainable society  (Sustainable business)  3. Public policy initiatives 5. Supply chain management 4. Respect for human rights 6. Diversity management 2. a. Environmental burden  reductions from operations 2. b. Making energy-effi  cient  products In uence on business Importance for stakeholders Hitachis Management Strategies and CSR V I S I O N Hitachi includes the participation of stakeholders  in the decision-making process for CSR activities. We engage in stakeholder dialogue worldwide  to identify social and environmental issues,  conducting assessments and veri cations from the  perspectives of stakeholder materiality and the  impact on management. We report on these key  issues in the Sustainability Report Digest.  4. Respect for Human Rights As a global enterprise, we face risks because we operate under  diff erent national laws, cultures and business practices. We respect  the laws and ordinances of every country, and we act with respect for  international norms to prevent human rights violations.  5. Supply Chain Management Supply chain risks are gradually increasing with the globalization  of business, especially for the environment and human rights. We  openly share our procurement policies with suppliers, and we reduce  supply chain risk through ongoing surveys of CSR practices with our  suppliers.  6. Diversity Management We believe that diversity is much more than the human rights issue  of gender equality. It is a fundamental challenge for sustainable  management, generating synergies beyond the Hitachi Group,  business  elds, and globalization. We therefore have initiated  worldwide programs that maintain personnel systems while  respecting diversity, by improving workplace environments, and by  cultivating human capital that can accelerate the globalization of  Hitachi and contribute to market-based sustainability needs . 1. Products That Create a Sustainable   Society (Sustainable Business) Developing innovative technologies and products is vital to growing  our business and realizing a sustainable society. We are developing  products that both lower environmental burden and improve the  quality of life so that we can contribute to a prosperous, safe, and  secure society.  2. Protecting the Environment We feel that we can help protect the environment by reducing the  environmental burden of products throughout their life cycles. We  have created our Environmental Vision with three pillars: prevention  of global warming, conservation of resources, and preservation of  ecosystems. Under this vision, we provide environmentally conscious  products and services by reducing the environmental burden from  operations and improving their energy effi  ciency.  3. Public Policy Initiatives Our Social Innovation Business is subject to the policies of national  governments, therefore we assess policy trends while engaging  in dialogue with stakeholders who in uence public policy and  regulations. As a result, we can propose technologies and solutions  that both bene t society and contribute to better policies.

These cities would mainly be in  emerging economies that are continuing to invest  heavily in infrastructure. Hitachi designs cities  with a vision giving consideration to lifestyles  and values. These cities would effi  ciently and  stably supply electricity and sewage systems as  well as provide and treat water, enabling balanced  demand and supply. They would also deliver safe,  convenient, and energy-saving transportation,  advanced medicine and education, and government  services. All these services would be part of a  comprehensive social infrastructure package that  New Cities That the World Desires  Since we entered the 21st century, such issues  as global warming, resource depletion, urban  crowding, economic disparities, and aging  have come to the fore. The common need of all  nations is to resolve these issues to ensure social  sustainability. In cities around the world, people  want their cities to overcome all these challenges.   Hitachis Vision for Next-Generation  Smart Cities In April 2010, Hitachi established the Smart City  Business Management Division for proposing new   Data Center  Parks abundant with  water and greenery Cities would be green and care for their  water resources. They would purify  water discharged from households  and factories, collecting rainwater  and recycling it for park fountains and  greenery. 24/7 health care Wristband monitors would check health  daily. Telemedicine would provide  access to specialists at local hospitals.  People would enjoy healthy and secure  lives.  At the end of a smart  day People would return to smart homes  that can use solar, wind power and  other natural energy effi  ciently, relaxing  with their families. Electric vehicles  would be charged at night, when power  use is low.  Safe and waste-free  shopping CO2 emissions from foods would be  checked according to production  and transportation methods. Mobile  terminals would check refrigerators to  reduce shopping for unnecessary items  and cut waste.

Drawing on Our Expertise in Social  Infrastructure to Build Next-Generation  Cities  To support lifestyles, Hitachi has long been  an innovator of such social infrastructure  systems as energy, transportation, water, and  telecommunications. We believe our mission is to  bring to the world our Corporate Credo: contribute  to society through the development of superior,  original technology and products.  We propose solutions that link infrastructural  components by integrating social infrastructure  systems with IT and telecommunications. The  Hitachi Group contributes to create a sustainable  society by building next-generation smart cities  that maintain an eff ective relationship between  people and the earth.  Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/ 021 Harnessing Our Smart City Business  to Participate in an Eco-Conscious  Urban Development that Has Captured  Worldwide Attention We are capitalizing on our global smart city  expertise to participate in Chinas Sino-Singapore  Tianjin Eco-City Project, an initiative capturing  worldwide attention.  Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City is a large  model eco-city that is a joint venture between  Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City Investment and  Development Co., Ltd. (SSTEC), and the Chinese  and Singaporean governments. The goal is to build  a city of 350,000 with 110,000 houses by around  2020 on a 30-square-kilometer salt evaporation  pond on the outskirts of Tianjin.  The new city will use 26 KPIs to minimize the  environmental burden of housing, energy,  and  transportation. As well, it will recycle resources,  including renewable energy for 20 percent of total  energy, make all tap water 100 percent drinkable,  and recycle 60 percent of waste. The city will have  90 percent green transportation and 100 percent  green buildings.  Leveraging Our Expertise from  Tianjin Eco-City to Contribute to  Environmentally Conscious Urban  Planning in China  The project heads of Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco- City want energy-saving technologies, new energy  and storage battery technologies, and information  control platforms from Japanese companies. In  May 2010, Hitachi and SSTEC agreed to evaluate  and use Hitachis technologies and solutions. We  intend to help develop environmentally conscious  cities by setting up a smart city R&D center in  Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City to create advanced  solutions for further progress in this  eld in China. Speci cally, we will help build the Eco Central  Hitachis Involvement in Tianjin Eco-City   Providing advanced energy and mobility technologies  required for eco-conscious cities and supplying  information control platform solutions.

We also will collaborate on  building data centers and other IT infrastructure.  The smart city business is pivotal to our Social  Innovation Business. Through our involvement in  Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, we will contribute  to lower environmental burden urban development  in China, reinforcing the development of our own  smart city business.  VOICES Solid Collaboration in Low Environmental  Burden Urban Development Lim Kingboon General Manager, Economic Promotion,  Sino-Singapore Tianjin  Eco-City Investment and  Development Co., Ltd.  (SSTEC) SSTEC and Hitachi have cooperated since  signing an agreement in May 2010 to develop  Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City. Hitachi is  unique, off ering all parts of information  control and IT, including products and  solutions. This is Chinas  rst large urban  development that cuts environmental burden  by conserving and recycling. We plan to try  many new ideas, and believe that Hitachis  expertise will be essential. I look for Hitachi to  showcase itself at this city, and I hope to build  stronger ties in the years ahead.   Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/ 023 Hitachi Projects Extending around the World We have undertaken feasibility studies and experiments worldwide for building next- generation cities as part of our Social Innovation Business. We have also started projects in  health careâ€”essential in an aging Japan.

What stands out in the 2011 Report is the clear  description of how corporate social responsibility is  integrated into the companys management strategy  and vision. Sustainability analysis, besides being  an important pillar for the de nition of the key  corporate policies and medium-term targets, is also  used to ascertain the materiality for stakeholders  of the many environmental and social issues  that Hitachi faces. Regular communication with  stakeholders on themes related to sustainability  enables Hitachi to further re ne the business strategy  around its social innovation core competency. Third-party Expert Opinions For companies of Hitachis size, stakeholders  expectations are high: through its operations, the  company has the ability to shape business, society,  and the environment. For that reason, broad and  transparent public communication is paramount.  Besides extensive reporting on key environmental  and social performance indicators, qualitative  aspects and materiality analysis also deserve a  central role in Hitachis reporting. Showing progress  on targets set is considered best practice. Notable is  the section devoted to innovation and intellectual  property management, a  eld where companies tend  to be reluctant in disclosing details to stakeholders.  Hitachis Sustainability Report is therefore very  complete from an international standpoint. The environmental reporting section discusses  the direct environmental impact of the companys  own operations and the indirect environmental  impact of its products and services. Hitachi  addresses both aspects extensively by describing  its approach, formulating targets, and presenting  achievements and examples for diff erent product  groups. Noteworthy is the comprehensive product  lifecycle approach Hitachi uses for evaluating the  environmental performance of its products.  In the social section of Hitachis Sustainability  Report, material challenges impacting employees,  communities and supply chains, are seriously  discussed, supported by numerical evidence and  targets. For a global company like Hitachi, the  management of diversity and community impact  deserves special attention. The report covers aspects  such as diversity development, human rights, and  supply chains, providing suffi  cient data. Considering  Jvan Gaffuri Senior Manager Sustainability Services SAM Research AG The number of companies integrating sustainability in their business strategy is growing every  year, underlying the importance of non-financial aspects in increasing the value of a company.  Considering sustainability aspects in corporate strategy is perceived to have a positive impact on  long-term value generation, innovation capability, operational efficiency, and reputation through  the better management of stakeholders expectations. Companies are required to demonstrate  a superior ability in managing sustainability issues and communicating transparently to their  stakeholders.  Management  Report  Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  027 M E S S A G E Management Report From a global perspective, CSR has progressed dramatically  in recent years, in part because of the trend that CSR is core  to management and strategy, but also because of a new  international standard (ISO 26000), which is a newly signed  international social responsibility agreement. We have  also seen vigorous debate, particularly in Europe and the  United States, over corporate transparency, especially on  disclosure obligations related to corporate governance, the  environment, and social issues. All Hitachi Group companies have traditionally grown  their businesses independently, in line with a spirit of respect  for management independence and innovation originality.  However, today when we generate more than 40 percent of  our business outside Japan, its not enough  to comply with  other countries business practices, laws, and regulations.  We need to extensively and continually communicate on  sustainable corporate strategies, business operations and  compliance based on leading international concepts, customs  and trends. These considerations prompted us to create the Hitachi  Group Codes of Conduct in  scal 2010. This document  codi es our corporate philosophy, the Hitachi Founding  Spirit, and respect for human rights and so on. We shared  these codes with Group companies globally by translating it  into 17 languages. We will establish a global framework of  six regionsâ€”the Americas, Europe,  India, Southeast Asia and  China, complementing Japanâ€”to reinforce local governance  by giving them regional corporate responsibilities.  To  respond swiftly to social demands and expectations, we will  implement highly transparent CSR management by engaging  regularly with our stakeholders. Through our Social Innovation Business, we aim to solve  fundamental global issues and contribute to social and  environmental progress that creates a sustainable society.  Moreover, we will respond to market-based sustainability  challenges by collaborating with local communities and  pursuing activities tailored to their particular circumstances in  order to help them resolve their sustainability challenges. Globally Reinforce Group Governance to Cultivate Highly Transparent CSR Management Toshiaki Kuzuoka, Senior Vice President and Executive Offi  cer  in charge of Human Capital, Government & External Relations and  Corporate Auditing Hitachi, Ltd.  Management Report  Corporate Governance Environmental Report Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  028 By enhancing corporate governance, the  Hitachi Group is promoting speedier, more  effi  cient management and is meeting the  expectations of stakeholders as a business that  merits the publics trust. Strengthening Governance Hitachi operates under a committee system.1 We  have strictly separated business supervision and  execution to establish a business structure for  speedy, highly transparent management. We task  outside directors to draw on their knowledge,  experience, and independent perspective when  supervising executives and other senior managers  to reinforce the role of the Board of Directors. We  formulated the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct to  develop common values for all Group members and  to enable us to share among all Group companies  a common understanding of our corporate social  responsibility.  Compensation Compensation for every director and executive  offi  cer is set by the Compensation Committee  based on the Japanese corporate law governing  companies with committees. Corporate Governance Compensation for directors and executive  offi  cers consists of monthly salaries together  with year-end allowances for directors and  performance-based bonuses for executive offi  cers.  While compensation for directors is generally   xed, performance-based bonuses for executive  offi  cers are set at around 30 percent of annual  compensation. Bonuses are determined individually  according to business performance and the  outcome of work carried out under the offi  cers  management. Beginning with compensation for  scal 2008,  the scheme for directors and executive offi  cers was  revised to eliminate retirement allowances. In  scal  2010, executives were compensated as follows: Internal Control As a public company listed on the New York Stock  Exchange, Hitachi, Ltd. is registered with the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission and is subject  to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX1). A comparable  assessment and report on internal control over   nancial reporting (J-SOX2) came into eff ect in  Japan at the beginning of  scal 2008.

The Hitachi Group is committed to full  compliance with these and other applicable laws  and regulations. Beyond that, we consider it an  important social responsibility to thoroughly  implement our internal control systems, to improve  the transparency and credibility of our businesses,  and to strengthen our management structure  by clarifying, examining, and visualizing our  management and operational frameworks. As a conglomerate of many companies, we have  adopted a framework that assigns accountability  at the Group level, including responsibilities for  the design and operation of internal controls.  Therefore, all Hitachi Group companies are required  to revise, document, and evaluate the eff ectiveness  of their operations in line with guidelines  determined by speci c levels of corporate scale  and business content. Management assessment of  each company is collected at the Group level, and is  reported to Hitachi, Ltd. along with certi cations. Group Management Hitachi, Ltd. optimized the management structure  and instituted an in-house company system in  October 2009 to ensure swift management action  and to become more competitive by restructuring,  particularly in the Social Innovation Businesses.  These eight in-house companies (businesses) are  Power Systems, Rail Systems, Industrial & Social  Infrastructure Systems, Urban Planning and  Development Systems, Information & Control  Systems, Information & Telecommunication  Systems, Defense Systems, and Battery Systems.  From  scal 2011, we rated each company and  transferred authority to them so that they could  speedily pursue independent management. We  base the ratings of each company on such factors  as FIV,1 operating pro t, and cash  ow, re ecting  these ratings in compensation evaluations for  company management teams.  The Group Strategy Committee deliberates on  Group-wide management measures to optimize  overall Group strategies and management  resources.  1  SOX:  Section 404 of this act, enacted in July 2002, mandates company  management with the responsibility of establishing, maintaining, and  evaluating internal control over  nancial reporting, and requires that control  be assessed by independent auditors. 2  J-SOX:  A framework for evaluating and reporting internal control over   nancial reporting under the Japanese Financial Products Transaction Law.

We are also mindful of our vision  to contribute to the solution of fundamental  global issues and to pursue the realization of  a better, more prosperous global society. We  intend to become a truly global entity that  shares its values with society by integrating  CSR into management and operation strategies. CSR Management Structure To promote CSR, Hitachi executive offi  cers in  charge of corporate divisions on the CSR Promotion  Committee discuss Group-wide CSR issues and  policies. The committee develops speci c global  initiatives with the CSR Promotion Team of the  CSR-related departments within Hitachi, Ltd. and  CSR promotion offi  cers at regional headquarters  outside Japan. Hitachi, Ltd. and Group company  CSR promotion offi  cers meet regularly to discuss  issues that need attention and to follow a common  direction. To meet our responsibilities as a global  enterprise, we take on sustainable activities for the  entire Group by using two management systems.  CSR Management One is the jointly developed CSR Self-Assessment  Tool, which we use to improve Group-wide activities  and to clarify the issues that we face as a global  entity, and the other is the materiality process. By  engaging in dialogue with global stakeholders,  we proactively integrate global social issues within  management to create sustainable management  and social programs. Management issues identi ed  through these processes are presented to and  discussed at the CSR Promotion Committee on a  semiannual basis to investigate and decide on new  initiatives for the upcoming  scal year. The Five-Year CSR Roadmap We marked the centennial of Hitachi, Ltd. in  scal  2010 by creating the Five-Year CSR Roadmap,  a medium-term plan for CSR. The goal is to  coordinate this initiative with the medium-term  management plan, or corporate strategy, to  become a truly global enterprise. Using this  roadmap, we have reinforced the foundation of  Group-wide operations, quantitatively measured  CSR activities, and improved corporate transparency  to demonstrate leadership in resolving global  challenges and opportunities confronting society.

CSR Self-Assessment Tool In  scal 2008, Hitachi, Ltd. and Group companies  jointly developed the Hitachi Group CSR Self- Assessment Tool, which benchmarks our companies  against other leading global companies. The goal  is to tackle issues and clarify initiatives based on  our policies for pursuing CSR and continuously  improving performance. Including Hitachi, Ltd., 35 Group companiesâ€”23  in Japan and 11 in North America and Asiaâ€” employ this tool, which has been translated into  English and Chinese. Results of Fiscal 2010 Self-Assessment Hitachis scores in  scal 2010 were higher than  a year earlier, including those for commitment  to CSR, corporate ethics and human rights, and  the working environment. The prime reasons for  this success are holding CSR courses for Group  company directors, the Hitachi Group Codes of  Conduct, wider implementation of e-learning, and  the creation and publication of the Hitachi Group  Health and Safety Policy. In  scal 2011, we plan  to review these evaluation items, using ISO 26000  standards, to attain even higher global results.

Responding to the Great East Japan  Earthquake A massive earthquake, followed by a devastating  tsunami, hit Japans Tohoku region and the  Paci c coast on March 11, 2011. We responded  by immediately setting up the Emergency  Headquarters for Response to Large-Scale  Earthquakes to con rm the safety of all employees  and their families, while assessing the damage.  Some facilities were heavily damaged, particularly  some in Ibaraki and Fukushima prefectures.  In response, we broadened the emergency  headquarters role and established the Hitachi  Group Headquarters for Post-Earthquake  Reconstruction and Redevelopment, headed by  the president, on March 23, which functions as a  control tower, combining information on damage  with assistance requests. The headquarters is  driving the concerted Group initiative to optimize  support and restoration (see pages 010â€“014).  Reinforcing the Risk Management System  We manage the business and operational risks  of every division with internal audits. The entire  Group is reinforcing management systems to  address increasingly global and complex risks. In   scal 2009, we audited the risks of Hitachi, Ltd.  Group corporate divisions and those at regional  headquarters outside Japan (in the Americas,  Europe, China and elsewhere in Asia). In  scal 2010,  we expanded auditing to all in-house companies,  Group companies, and research institutes to  assess risks that could undermine Group-wide  credibility and business sustainability. Such risks  include environmental and reputation risks, as  well as emerging human rights issues that include  Risk Management employee diversity and poor working conditions in  the supply chain. Other risks are more traditional,  such as natural disasters, the market environment,  and raw material prices.  We will reinforce our risk management  framework by improving our assessment standards,  by analyzing and evaluating accumulated risk  information in greater detail, and by evaluating  responses at the management level. In addition, we  will improve risk awareness among all employees,  especially through information sharing, education  and training. Business Continuity Plans (BCPs)1  To guard against risks, and being deeply  committed to the social infrastructure, we are  enhancing our BCPs to minimize the impact on  society of any interruption to business operations.  Since December 2006, the Hitachi Group has  disseminated the Guidelines for Formulation of BCPs  to all Group companies to mitigate risks, such as  major natural disasters. In  scal 2010, we translated our BCP guidelines  into English and Chinese, and then distributed them  to all Group companies around the world. Every  Hitachi Group company and business site prepares  for emergencies by producing a BCP using the  guidelines that are relevant to them. 1  Business Continuity Plan (BCP):   A plan for ensuring the continuation of core  operations and for promptly restoring operations in the event of a disaster or  accident.

We also hold  monthly drills that use a satellite communications  system. Providing Information through Our Internal Web Site The Hitachi Group internal Web site has provided  a risk response page for all Group employees since  1997. This internal Web site features information  from wire services and Japans Ministry of Foreign  Aff airs as well as problems that Hitachi Group  employees have experienced. If emergencies arise,  this site presents responses and alerts based on top  management policies and disseminates information  on damage. The risk response Web site adds or updates  around 80 news items every day. Page views per  month reached one million when the H1N1  u  spread worldwide; the average number of page  views per month is about 400,000. These  gures  underscore the essential role that the internal risk  response Web site plays for risk response activities.  This page also has top management policies  and disaster updates for the Great East Japan  Earthquake for the entire Hitachi Group. Novel Strain of In uenza Action Plan and BCPs In 2008, as a precaution against a novel strain of  in uenza that gave rise to fears of a pandemic,  we set up a special organization called the Risk  Management Headquarters, headed by the  president. In the event of a worldwide outbreak,  the Risk Management Headquarters will take the  lead in securing the safety of all Hitachi Group  employees and their families. Every eff ort will  be made to ensure that operations essential for  maintaining social functions, such as medical  services, public security, and lifelines, are continued  without interruption. As part of these preparations, we formulated the  Guidelines for Pandemic1 In uenza Preparedness in  2009. We distributed these to all Group companies  in  scal 2010, after translating them into English  and Chinese. Tabletop Exercise to Prepare for Large-Scale  Disasters Hitachi, Ltd. has held annual disaster simulation  drills since  scal 1998â€”so far at 18 sites throughout  Japan. For these drills, teams of people make  decisions under disaster scenarios that have been  developed over six months and include a range of  crises. The objective is to verify and improve the  eff ectiveness of prevention plans for large disasters.  Personnel in charge of risk management at business  sites participate in the drills, then report on their  experience and results at a general assembly  of around 200 offi  cers responsible for handling  risk.

Formulating and Ensuring Awareness  of the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct Hitachi, Ltd. formulated the Hitachi Group Codes  of Conduct in August 2010 as speci c common  conduct codes for the Group. This was in line with  the shift to a new Group management structure  to mark Hitachis centennial. Based on translations  of this document into 17 languages, consolidated  subsidiaries worldwide then formulated their own  codes of conduct in line with the same content.  We ensure broad awareness of the Hitachi Group  Codes of Conduct by displaying them on computer  startup screens during Hitachi Group Corporate  Ethics Month. We also produced an e-learning  tool based on case studies for speci c code items  to help employees consider how best to act, and  are extending this tool to Group employees in  Japan. We ask managers to submit a statement  electronically con rming that they have taken the  course and are pledging to comply with the code.  In  scal 2011, we are extending this request to  consolidated subsidiaries outside Japan.  Implementing Corporate Ethics Month Corporate ethics and compliance are the bedrock  of all our activities. Every October has been Hitachi  Group Corporate Ethics Month since  scal 2009.  Top management leads the way to improving  adherence to ethics and complying fully with laws  and regulations. Executives and employees are  making compliance central to all their actions. In   scal 2010, we also distributed top management  messages on compliance to all Group employees  and familiarized employees with the Hitachi Group  Codes of Conduct (described here). In addition, we  arranged a presentation by an outside, non-Hitachi  lawyer for compliance offi  cers and managers to  Compliance  Management Report  Compliance Environmental Report Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  037 Group in Japan have participated in seminars and  video courses on speci c risk levels. Compliance Reporting System To prevent illegal or unethical behavior, to promptly  address infractions, and to enhance the ability  to self-regulate, we instituted a company-wide  compliance reporting system. Employees can  report directly to the division responsible at Hitachi  (Compliance Division) or to an outside attorney.  This system can be used not only by Hitachi  employees but also by former employees, business  partner companies, and temporary staff . Another  systemâ€”Channel to the Board of Directorsâ€”has  been introduced to allow employees to report  problems anonymously straight to Hitachis board  of directors. Preventing Corruption Our 2012 Mid-Term Management Plan focuses  on Social Innovation Businesses and strategic  progress in emerging nations. Global compliance is  now becoming ever more important, as Japanese  corporations face tighter controls on bribery of  foreign public offi  cials. Key examples include the  United Kingdom and the United States, which have  enacted new bribery prevention laws.  In  scal 2008, we formulated corporate rules  and guidelines to prevent bribery worldwide, and  we are ensuring adherence through audits and  education. In the second half of  scal 2010, we  requested top executives at Group companies in  the Americas, Europe, China, and elsewhere in Asia  to further improve compliance. In March 2011,  we held a meeting at which legal and compliance  offi  cers from subsidiaries overseeing businesses in  the Americas, Europe, China, and Asia reported on  bribery prevention. Two hundred and twenty-four  compliance offi  cers and managers from Hitachi,  Ltd. and Group companies in Japan attended the  meeting and shared information and case studies. Worlds Most Ethical  Companies mark Hitachi Data Systems employees TOPICS Recognized as One of the Worlds Most  Ethical Companies After a rigorous review, Ethisphere  Institute, a U.S. think tank that researches,  develops and promotes best practices in  CSR and corporate ethics, awarded its  Ethics Inside Certi cation to Hitachi Data  Systems Corporation in the United States  in November 2010. Ethisphere certi es  organizations that establish, maintain,  and share ethical conduct beyond legal  requirements and which can be models  for other organizations. In March 2011,  Ethisphere also chose Hitachi Data  Systems as one of the Worlds Most Ethical  Companies for 2011. For this award,  the institute evaluates several thousand  companies from 36 industries in more  than 100 countries, choosing one or  two companies per industry. Ethisphere  recognized the commitment to compliance  of Hitachi Data Systems management and  lauded the companys innovative initiatives,  including a video-based education program  and computer tools that give employees  timely, relevant information on ethics.  Management Report  Compliance Environmental Report Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  038 Protecting Personal Information We established a personal information protection  management system based on our Personal  Information Protection Policy. With this system,  through e-learning courses for all employees and  through periodic audits, we ensure the protection  and safe handling of personal information. Hitachi, Ltd. received Privacy Mark certi cation  in March 2007 and renewed certi cation in  March 2011. As of March 2011, 72 Hitachi Group  companies have received the Privacy Mark.1 In July 2007, the Odaira Memorial Tokyo  Hitachi Hospital became the  rst corporate  medical institution in Japan to earn Privacy Mark  certi cation. The Hitachi Yokohama Hospital and  Ibaraki Hospital Center (both are located in Japan)  also obtained certi cations. These hospitals work  hard to protect and carefully handle personal  information. Hitachi also strives to safeguard  personal information at Group companies outside  Japan based on the Personal Information Protection  Policy and in accord with all national and regional  legal and social requirements.  Preventing the Recurrence of  Misleading Representations The entire Hitachi Group is working to prevent a  recurrence of misleading information following  the Hitachi Appliance, Inc. misrepresentation of  refrigerators in  scal 2009. Hitachi Appliances  has since reinforced their systems to check  environmental information in catalogs and  other publications. We decided to make April  the month for improving representations, and  now use intensive education to ensure that all  regulations are followed, particularly the Act  against Unjusti able Premiums and Misleading  Representations. In June 2010, representatives  from consumer groups inspected manufacturing,  product testing, and appliance recycling at Hitachi  Appliances Tochigi Works, which manufactures  refrigerators and air conditioners.  The entire Hitachi Group is now setting up a  check system for corporate rules, making internal  audits, and building understanding through  ecology awareness education and training  tailored to personnel levels. By February 2011, we  had held seven regular meetings of an advisory  group on product environmental information  and expressions, which we created in  scal 2009,  and obtained advice on consumer perspectives  from outside experts. We explained this advice  at a training seminar, sponsored by the Nippon  Association of Consumer Specialists, to consumer  product managers. Protecting Personal Information and  Information Security The Hitachi Group emphasizes two points in policies  to protect personal information and information  security: (1) Precautionary measures and prompt security  responses Hitachi clearly classi es information assets to be protected and  takes safeguarding measures based on vulnerability and risk  analysis. We also have an emergency manual for security breaches,  based on the assumption that these are inevitable, not just  possible. (2) Promotion of stronger ethical and security  awareness among data users Hitachi has prepared a curriculum tailored to various personnel  levelsâ€”staff , managers, etc.â€”and is working to raise the  prevailing sense of ethics and security awareness through Group- wide education using e-learning. We are also working on the use of  audits to identify and address problems early on.

Export Control For basic export control, we use the Hitachi  Standards of Corporate Conduct, which states  that we shall help maintain international peace  Information Security Initiatives The rapid spread of digital information and  computer networks has made it essential for  businesses to strengthen security to maintain public  trust. For that reason, we established information  security policies and processes. We are striving  company-wide to improve security in line with  our information security management system.  For example, we develop information security  procedures, educate employees about security, and  audit information security.  We formulated the Three Principles for  Preventing Leakage of Con dential Information,  ensuring accident prevention and the highest level  of care of customer information. Our policies ensure  that we minimize damage in the event of accidents  by promptly contacting customers, reporting to  government agencies, investigating causes and  acting to prevent recurrences.  Group companies worldwide are taking these  steps to prevent information leaks: using Hibun  encryption software; security PCs that do not store  data; Katsubun electronic document access control  and expiration processing software; and email and  Web site  ltering. Group companies worldwide are reinforcing  information security management in line with  Global Information Security Administration  standards.

In principle, con dential information cannot be taken from the  workplace. Rule 2. Permission must be obtained from an information assets  administrator when employees are required to take con dential  information from the workplace for business. Rule 3. Necessary and appropriate measures to prevent information leaks  are mandatory for con dential information that needs to be taken  from the workplace for business. Notes: 1. Con dential information includes all trade information for which access is  restricted to internal areas and relevant third parties. 2. These rules also apply to con dential information taken from customer  business sites.

We adopted rules for controlling  security exports based on this policy in 1987, and  we continue to strive for the strictest possible  export controls. This means screening the destination, end- use, and end-user of all goods and technologies  intended for export and promoting all legal  compliance. In addition, we are promoting Group- wide export controls by providing guidance to  all Hitachi Group companies worldwide on rules  and organizations for export control, as well as  supporting education and compliance training to  ensure that every Hitachi employee follows the  same export control policies. In  scal 2010, we held meetings for export  control managers at regional Group companies  in China, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and  Thailand, and provided practical training on export  control. We augmented the Japanese version of  the e-learning course with a Chinese version, and  broadly implemented basic education courses.

Further, to enhance R&D effi  ciency and speed up  technology development supporting the Social  Innovation Business, locally-led research outside  Japan will be increased and the role of domestic  laboratories in disseminating cutting-edge  technologies to the world will be reinforced. In  April 2011, the Technology Strategy Offi  ce was  established within the Research and Development  Group to integrate the technology strategy for  the entire Hitachi Group as well as to formulate  medium-to-long-term technology and development  plans linked with business strategies.  Since the beginning, Hitachi has applied R&D  to ful ll our Corporate Credo of contributing  to society through the development of  superior, original technology and products.   The sustainable growth of the Hitachi Group  is driven by this continuous generation of  innovation with R&D at its core. Research and Development Strategy The Hitachi Group is investing 670 billion yen in  R&D in the Social Innovation Business areas in order  to accelerate research and promote growth in the  global market based in this business area.

For R&D investment effi  ciency, our target  is to deliver an ROI,1 operating income divided by  R&D expenditure, of greater than 1.0. For the R&D  contribution to the environment, we use a green  research index, which is de ned as research for  the development of environmentally compatible  products.  The target is for 100 percent of research  to be green research by  scal 2015.  We also use  the number of papers accepted by the Institute  of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the  worlds largest professional technology association,  as a benchmark for the Hitachi Groups technology  standards and activities worldwide.  In  scal 2010,  the IEEE adopted 47 research papers from the  Hitachi Group, ranking us number three in the  world electronics industry and number one in  Japan. Enhancing Overseas Research Bases As our Social Innovation Business expands  globally, the four key R&D bases outside Japan  will be enhanced to target regional needs. First,  the number of R&D personnel outside Japan will  be doubled from the current 150 to roughly 300  in  scal 2012, localization will be reinforced, and  collaboration with local government, business and  research institutions will be strengthened. We will  pursue locally-led R&D that is grounded in regional  needs. Further, we will select R&D themes focusing  on the Social Innovation Business being promoted  in each region.

The goal was to foster mutual  cultural understanding and a sense of  community. Four British students and four  Japanese students, aged 16 and 17, formed  a nanotechnology project team to explore  the future of electronics.  The students designed, assembled,  and measured simple electronic devices,  then made presentations at the end of the  workshop on what they had learned.   Management Report  Innovation Management  Environmental Report Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  043 Examples of R&D Achievements Long-Life Lithium-Ion Batteries  A new manganese-based cathode material which  roughly doubles the life of industrial lithium-ion  batteries was developed. A prototype battery  cell was developed in collaboration with Shin- Kobe Electric Machinery Co., Ltd. employing this  material. After evaluation, it was con rmed that  the battery capacity could be roughly reduced by  half, thus opening the way to achieving a battery  life of 10 years or more. Prospective applications  include power storage in renewable energy  generation such as wind power, and as a power  source for electrical construction machinery and  other industrial equipment designed to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions. Service Robots  Under a unique concept of human symbiosis,  Hitachi, Ltd. has developed EMIEW to co-exist  with humans, applying various technology  such as agility, obstacle avoidance and distance  communication. In EMIEW2, mobility and voice  recognition features are further improved.  EMIEW2 is able to safely move over small ground  obstacles such as thresholds or electric cables, as  well as clearly distinguish human  voices from background noise.   Such features will improve the  functionality of EMIEW2 in safely  serving the daily needs of people  in hospitals or offi  ces as a guide,  or as a surveillance robot during  rounds. We aim to realize a  society in which robots can safely  serve people in various ways. comes from corporate funds and is allocated  for basic and platform research. Sponsored and  advanced sponsored research is conducted with  a target of expanding core business, and aims  at commercialization within three to  ve years.  Basic and platform research is based on the mid- to-long-term Technology Plan, and aims to create  innovative technologies forming the base for future  core businesses.  Hitachi Fellow System  In June 1999, the Hitachi Fellow system was  established to recognize the distinguished service  and contributions of an employee to the progress  of science and technology on a global level, and  for the international acknowledgement of Hitachis  high standard of technology. The position of Hitachi  Fellow is appointed by the Board of Directors,  and it is the highest technical position within  the company. The position of Hitachi Fellow is  equivalent to that of executives. A Fellow is assured  freedom of choice for research theme, research  funding and support for external professional  activities.

While these contributions can vary  from one business to another, we categorize  them by diff erentiation and prevention,  securing business freedom, and patent  licensing income. We will forge ahead with our  IP strategy, that is in line with a management  focus on global, fusion, and environmentâ€”or  more speci cally, global development that  fuses social infrastructure with intelligent IT  and environmental systems. Globalization of Intellectual Property Increasing the number of patent applications is  vital for the globalization of intellectual property  activities. We will strengthen our benchmarks  against those of other companies and reinforce our  patent position. Assuming that revenues from outside Japan will  account for more than 50 percent of net sales in   scal 2012, we intend to generate 55 percent of our  patent applications outside Japan in that year, up  from 51 percent in  scal 2010. Intellectual Property (IP) Reinforcing Intellectual Property Initiatives in  Emerging Markets Our growth strategy mainly targets China and  elsewhere in Asia, as well as emerging countries.  We intend to increase the number of patent  applications in these areas.  The number of patents that the Hitachi Group  has obtained in China over the past  ve years is  comparable to major rivals in the Social Innovation  Business. We will also  le more patents in emerging  countries using Patent Cooperation Treaty  applications. Building a Strategic Patent Portfolio We are supporting management strategies focused  on global, fusion, and environment with our  intellectual property by building a patent portfolio  that is  consistent with our management strategy. Examples of Focused Themes of IP Activities Field Key themes Global Storage systems Smart grids Fusion Information platform for social infrastructure Environment New power devices Inverters Lithium-ion batteries Green mobility 2009 2010 2012 (FY) 47 51 0 60 40 50 (%) 55 (Target)  55 Major Targets Patent Application Ratios outside Japan *Hitachi, Ltd. and consolidated subsidiaries 49% Around 30%  45% Around 20%  Around 20%  Around 35% Breakdown of Patent Filing Countries / Regions Japan U.S.A. and Europe China and other Asian nations* (FY 2012 target) (FY 2010) *Including international  lings through the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which  has a single application for a patent and has legal eff ect in treaty member  countries.  Management Report  Intellectual Property (IP) Environmental Report Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  045 Strengthening International Standardization We are leveraging our combined human capital,  knowhow, knowledge, and other resources for  standardization so that we can expand our strong  businesses. For example, at our environmentally  conscious data centers, we have standardized  interfaces for IT and air-conditioning control  equipment. We also have key leaders from inside  the company working within global standardization  organizations, notably through the vice-presidency,  chairmanship, and other positions on the  International Electrotechnical Commission. Business Contributions Intellectual property activities have no value unless  they contribute to supporting businesses. We  categorize the results from IP by diff erentiation and  prevention, securing a degree of business freedom,  and patent licensing income. We start by building a patent portfolio that  focuses on technology consistent with Hitachis  strengths, from the standpoints of market  needs and technology trends. We prevent other  companies from using our technologies without  our authorization and we diff erentiate our products  and services. We have built a competitive patent  portfolio, and have cross-licensing agreements  with other companies to ensure business freedom.  We also obtain patent licensing income from  other companies and invest it in new research and  development. Constantly aware of these results, we have been   ling and prosecuting patent applications, and  enforcing our patents so that we contribute to and  protect our businesses. Respect for Intellectual Property We respect the intellectual property rights (IPR) of  other companies as we expect them to respect ours.  We follow in-house rules on preliminary searches  of other companies patents to avoid infringements  during product development. For IPR that belongs  to others, we obtain licenses from IPR holders  before using them. For our own IPR, in principle,  we provide licenses to businesses wishing to make  use of these IPRs, subject to royalty payment. If any  company is found to have infringed our IPR, we  encourage them to acquire the necessary license,  and we will take legal actions, if necessary. Reward System for Employee Inventions We motivate employees on the research and  development frontlines with a reward system for  new inventions. We more clearly de ned these  rewards in 2005, when Article 35 of Japans  amended Patent Act took eff ect. We revised,  and carefully manage, our reward system for  employee inventions to increase the satisfaction  of inventors. Hitachi provides rewards for  led  patent applications and granted patents, as well  as performance-based rewards for patents which  are used for our products/services and/or bring in  patent licensing income. We do not set any upper  limit for performance-based rewards. Cultivating Human Capital We drive forward IPR initiatives by cultivating  quality human resources who are highly skilled and  globally aware. As of April 1, 2011, our Intellectual  Property Group had 100 registered patent attorneys  and seven lawyers registered in the U.S.A. or the  UK. Every year, we assign four to six people for  internships at patent and law offi  ces in the United  States and Europe. To date, 60 people have served  as interns outside Japan.  Management Report  Brand Management Environmental Report Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  046 To grow Hitachis Social Innovation Business  worldwide, we must improve our brand  recognition and reputation, and establish the  Hitachi brand as a social innovation company.  We communicate globally in many ways with  stakeholders to ensure a full understanding  so that we increase the value of, or minimize  damage to, our brand. Global Brand Strategy For developing business globally, we need to  correctly communicate our vision and brand  promise to our stakeholders. People have tended  to perceive Hitachi as an appliance or consumer  products manufacturer, particularly outside Japan.  So, to establish a reputation as a social innovation  company, we must promote the brand externally  through advertising, public relations, and CSR  initiatives, while raising our own employees  awareness of the brand promise and encouraging  employees to engage in activities based on that  brand promise. Together as One Hitachi, we will  evaluate the eff ectiveness of our activities to  improve the value of the Hitachi brand. Improving the Global Brand Inspire the Next, our corporate statement,  embodies our brand vision. We set up corporate  communication departments in North America,  Europe, Asia, and China to completely localize  and convey this vision to stakeholders. Market  characteristics and business methods diff er from  region to region. So, by employing eff ective  communications and combining core businesses  and solutions for speci c markets, we convey  messages that are consistent with our commitment  to environmental issues as a social innovation  company. For example, we concluded that mass media  advertising is an eff ective way to promote our  Brand Management brand in such emerging nations as China and  India. There, we focus on corporate advertising  campaigns through television commercials,  newspaper advertising, and on our Web sites. The  corporate advertising campaigns have improved  our brand recognition and brand image in those  countries. In advanced nations, however, we  found that word of mouth and Web sites are more  eff ective, and therefore in those markets we mostly  focus on the Internet. We participate extensively in environment- related exhibitions and other events around the  world, including eco-product shows, to spotlight  how we address environmental issues.

We  convey consistent Group brand messages, while  improving Internet searches, to match local needs.  As well, in every region, we produce content that  focuses on our local businesses. In recent years, we  have built Web sites in the emerging nations that  we position as focused markets. At the end of March 2011, we had 58 Web sites  in 27 languages covering 47 countries and regions,  and we uni ed our brand image with a common  design format. Internal Brand Management Our employees are important contact points for  building the brand, as they deal directly with  stakeholders. We promote internal initiatives  globally as well as increase awareness of Hitachi  Groups brand promise to ensure that employees  thoroughly understand and apply the Hitachi  brands vision, mission, and value. In  scal 2010, 1,103 employees attended  12 brand seminars worldwide. We strengthen  employee awareness of the Hitachi Brand by giving  an award to good initiatives that help improve  Hitachi brand value. These awards are called The  Inspiration of the Year awards. In  scal 2010, we  received 382 applications for the Inspiration of the  Year awards. A program that improved the value  of the Hitachi brand through our UK rail business  won the Special Top Prize. During  scal 2010,  we commemorated our centennial by increasing  the number of awards, with around 50 entrants  receiving Grand Prix, Innovation/Reliability, and  Eco-Spirit Awards.

We summarize the responses and  evaluations of customers and other targeted  stakeholders, then we use this information to  make improvements. We also conduct an annual  brand image survey to create a snapshot of the  global strength of the Hitachi brand. We use these   ndings to analyze and report on the overall impact  of brand initiatives. When conducting these assessments and  brand image surveys, we set benchmarks based  on the Hitachi Brand Platform, and use them for  monitoring brand initiatives. Reputation Management Globally, all Hitachi Group companies share the  Hitachi brand. This sharing generates group  synergies for innovation and trust in the brand. We  recognize that accidents and rumors can damage  the brand globally, so we set up communication  divisions at regional headquarters outside Japan  to handle risks to our reputation. These divisions  ensure the broad recognition of our activities by  regularly informing the media and government  agencies, as well as members of nongovernmental  organizations and opinion leaders in every country  who are particularly interested in human rights and  environmental issues. These divisions work hard to  correct public misperceptions about our operations.  Hitachi, Ltd. and regional headquarters outside  Japan collaborate to mitigate risks to the brand and  resolve problems arising from accidents or rumors.  Moreover, they seek to proactively prevent future  occurrences by investigating similar and related  incidents in other areas or businesses. Action against Infringement of the  Brand Value The Hitachi brand is an important and clear  promise to all stakeholders of our fundamental  worth, and that includes our management  philosophy, social mission, and speci c corporate  activity. To reach our goals, it is essential to  communicate consistently with one voice based on  the integral principles of the Hitachi brand. Management of the Hitachi Brand Impression We globally uni ed the presentation and use of  our logo and trademark to roll out our message as  a single global entity, or One Hitachi. The Hitachi  Group Identi cation Standards Manual lays out  how to use the logo. We have integrated visual  impressions of the Hitachi brand, by developing a  design system for each medium. Safeguarding the Hitachi Brand We provide legal protection for the Hitachi brand  by working hard to eliminate counterfeit appliances  and parts in such high-risk regions as China, the rest  of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In countries or  regions where brand infringements are particularly  widespread, we collaborate with local companies to  step up anti-counterfeiting programs.

We must also foster high  levels of environmental consciousness in each  of our employees and use their core business  strengths to help resolve environmental problems. The Hitachi Group is currently focusing  management resources on the Social Innovation  Business to contribute to the development of  a sustainable social infrastructure. In 2008, we  created Environmental Vision 2025, our long-term  plan for reducing CO2 emissionsâ€”a top-priority  issueâ€”through business operations. Our goal is to  help reduce annual CO2 emissions by 100 million  tonnes by  scal 2025 through Hitachi products and  services. In  scal 2010, we succeeded in reducing  CO2 emissions by 15.51 million tonnes. We achieved  this reduction through the use of highly effi  cient  gas turbines, wind power generation systems, and  other energy infrastructure that emit less CO2, as  well as through the global provision of power- saving products and services. Sales of Eco-Products,  products meeting rigorous environmentally  conscious criteria, jumped by 7 percent on the  previous year to 60 percent of all sales. We aim to  make all Group products and services Eco-Products  by  scal 2025. The recent Great East Japan Earthquake  prompted countries around the world to review  their energy policies as well as energy supply  and demand. Current mechanisms will have to  be revised in the coming years to respond to  increasingly diverse energy-related values and  needs. The Hitachi Group will lead the way by supplying  products and services, such as low-carbon power  supply systems, energy-saving solutions for  transportation and industry, and IT-based energy  control and monitoring technologies. We will  also contribute to the use of sustainable energies  that off er energy security through technology  development geared to diversifying needs. In  the short term, we will focus on optimizing and  boosting the effi  ciency of products and services;  over the long term, that focus will shift to  developing city functions that enable high energy  effi  ciency and minimal environmental loads. In  scal 2011, we launched the Third  Environmental Action Plan, which sets out a high- level goal of reducing global CO2 emissions by  10 percent per unit of production by  scal 2015  (compared with  scal 2005 levels). We will steadily  move ahead with that plan, as well as work to  develop more environmentally conscious products,  factories, and offi  ces. We also look forward to  working together with customers using Hitachi  products and services to help reduce CO2 emissions  through our products. We are committed to re ecting world trends  and stakeholder views in our future improvements  and innovations, growing as a corporate group  that contributes to the realization of a sustainable  society.

Hitachi Group Chief Environmental  Strategy Offi  cer Environmental Report M E S S A G E  Management Report Environmental Report  Corporate Environmental Management  Strategies and Initiatives Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/environment/  051 Corporate environmental management is a  focus of the Hitachi Group 2012 Mid-Term  Management Plan looking ahead to  scal 2012  (see pages 015â€“016). When providing products and services,  and during our business operations, we  believe that initiatives to reduce the load on  the environment are essential for the Mid- Term Management Plan pillars of growth  driven by social innovation business and  establishment of a solid  nancial base. Based  on this management policy, and guided  by the Environmental Vision aimed at  achieving a sustainable society, our corporate  environmental management is being carried  out to implement the long-term Environmental  Vision 2025 and our Environmental Action Plan. The Hitachi Environmental Vision We have drawn up our Environmental Vision  describing the aim of our corporate environmental  management to achieve a sustainable society.  The worlds population will reach 7 billion in 2011  and is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050.1 At  the same time, the annual growth in worldwide  GDP has averaged more than 3 percent for at least  the past 20 years, except for the downturn that  Hitachis Environmental Vision Corporate Environmental Management Strategies and Initiatives occurred in 2009.2  With the increase in economic and social  activities has come growing demand for energy,  water, minerals, and other resources, making  environmental problems worse, from resource  depletion to climate change. These are problems  faced by the entire world. To solve them, the load  on the environment must be limited to the least  possible and society must be made sustainable.  The Hitachi Environmental Vision, giving priority  to actions for prevention of global warming,  conservation of resources, and preservation of  ecosystems, shows our commitment to contributing  through our business to solving environmental  problems. As a milestone on the road to realizing  this Environmental Vision, we drew up the long- term plan Environmental Vision 2025 for the period  to  scal 2025.  Long-Term Plan Environmental Vision 2025 In its Fourth Assessment Report published in  2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  1  According to the United Nations report:  World Population Prospects: The 2010  Revision 2  According to the World Bank:  World Development Indicators World Outlook for Energy-Related CO2 Emissions and Reduction Scenarios Based on energy-related CO2 emissions in IEA World Energy Outlook 2009 2005 2030 0 25 35 30 40 45 (FY) Scenario assuming world energy policies implemented to date Scenario stabilizing at 450 ppm 40.2 billion tonnes 26.4 billion tonnes Power 27.1 (sector and reduction amount) 9.3 billion tonnes 1.6 billion tonnes 1.6 billion tonnes 1.3 billion tonnes Necessary reduction 13.8 billion tonnes (billions of tonnes/year) Transportation Industries Other  Management Report Environmental Report  Corporate Environmental Management  Strategies and Initiatives Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/environment/  052 million in the transportation, commercial, and  residential sectors. A leading indicator on the way to this goal is  the extent to which we can make all our products  Hitachi Eco-Products (see page 063) by  scal 2025,  reducing their burden on the environment. We  plan to expand business opportunities further by  working with partners in global markets and by  developing and creating new environmentally  conscious products and businesses. Since the amount of contribution to CO2  reduction is an important indicator of our business  management that requires eff ective progress  assessment and information disclosure, we are  receiving reviews by a third-party organization  about the calculation methods and results to  ensure trustworthiness. Fiscal 2010 Results and Coming Initiatives Our contribution to CO2 reduction in  scal 2010  is estimated to be 15.51 million tonnes, meeting  the target of 14 million tonnes. A wide range of  services and products contributed to this reduction  in emissions, including high-effi  ciency gas turbines  Change (IPCC), a UN panel assessing and advising  nations on the causes and eff ects of climate  change, concludes that CO2 emissions must peak  by 2015 and be reduced by 50 to 85 percent of  their 2000 levels by the year 2050 in order to  meet the minimum stabilized density scenario for  greenhouse gases (450 ppm stabilization scenario). The International Energy Agency (IEA) has  drawn up a CO2 emission reduction scenario  indicating the  elds where CO2 emissions can  most feasibly be reduced for meeting the 450  ppm stabilization scenario, and the percentages of  reductions in each  eld. These  elds extend widely  across the Hitachi Group, including the electric  power, transportation, and industrial sectors. On this basis, the long-term Hitachi Group  Environmental Vision 2025 states our goal of  helping to reduce annual CO2 emissions by 100  million tonnes by  scal 2025 through Hitachi  products and services. This means that as we reduce CO2 emissionsâ€” by improving the environmental effi  ciency of  Hitachi Group products, and by other meansâ€”our  contribution to lowering CO2 emissions through the  use of our products and services by 2025 from the  products of  scal 2005 will be 100 million tonnes  annually. The target of 100 million tonnes was calculated  based on growth strategies in each business sector.  It breaks down to 70 million tonnes in the power  sector, 20 million in the industrial sector, and 10  Initiatives in Each Sector toward Achieving Targets Power sector*  Building nuclear power plants  Delivering high-effi  ciency coal- red thermal  power plants and gas turbines  Providing equipment for renewable energy Industrial sector  Providing high-effi  ciency inverters and  transformers  Providing high-effi  ciency information equipment  and energy-saving solutions for data centers,  etc. Transportation,  commercial, and  residential sectors  Providing lithium-ion batteries for industrial and  automotive use  Making home appliances more energy effi  cient *The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, due to the Great  East Japan Earthquake, is expected to prompt a global review of and changes  in energy policies, including plans for new installation and operation of nuclear  and thermal power plants.

Due to high-performance  turbine cooling and compressor technologies, the thermal efficiency  when using natural gas is 34.8 percent, the highest level among gas  turbines in the same class. It can be used with multiple fuels including  light oil, natural gas, and LPG, and it supports environmental measures  using wet/dry low-NOX burners. In December 2010 the H-25 began  operation as a gas turbine in cogeneration power equipment 2 at a  coke production plant in China. Gas generated in the coke production  process is used as fuel in the H-25 to supply electrical power. At the  same time, the heat generated by the H-25 is used to produce steam  in a heat recovery boiler, achieving thermal effi  ciency of 80 percent or  more for the facility as a whole and contributing to effective energy  use. Moreover, capitalizing on our experience with conventional power  generation systems, we developed an 80 MW-class H-80 gas turbine  with a thermal efficiency of 38 percent, which is a heavy duty two- shaft gas turbine with the worlds largest capacity. 3 The  rst unit is in  operation at a Kyushu Electric Power Company power plant. In fiscal 2010, some 30 new gas turbines went into operation,  including the 30 MW-class H-25 and the 80 MW-class H-80. These  turbines, along with the 89 units already in operation, contributed to a  reduction in CO2 emissions by 1.55 million tonnes in  scal 2010. 1  Heavy duty design:  Highly reliable gas turbines which need less  frequent maintenance 2  Cogeneration power equipment:  Equipment supplying electric power  and heat at the same time 3  As of February 22, 2010 (Hitachi, Ltd. survey) Gas turbines Power Systems Company, Hitachi, Ltd. Hitachi gas turbines are highly regarded for their reliability and  effi  ciency. They are in operation around the world for power generation  and general industrial use, and as gas turbines in oil and gas  elds. The  30 MW-class H-25 gas turbine achieves high reliability with its heavy  Cogeneration power plant equipment: Jingyuang Redian in China  adopting the H-25 gas turbine Facing sharply rising information volume, and increases in power  use by IT equipment as a consequence, Hitachi servers use the latest  processors and high-capacity memory while applying a variety of  power-saving techniques. Our BladeSymphony 2000 blade server  and HA8000/RS220 PC servers, for example, use high-efficiency  power supplies with 80PLUS GOLD certification (power conversion  effi  ciency of 92 percent or above*). They also use a fan control system  to adjust rotation speed based on the temperature inside the server. In  these ways, they reduce overall power consumption. Wasteful power  and power supply costs can also be reduced through virtualization  techniques that use server resources carefully, and by power capping  to control processor performance so it doesnt exceed a preset power  consumption level. The use of servers with improvements like these in  information processing capacity and energy effi  ciency accounted for a  reduction in CO2 emissions by 0.42 million tonnes in  scal 2010. When supplying electric power, limiting energy loss during  transmissionâ€”in addition to effi  cient generation and natural energy  utilizationâ€”is an important issue for reducing CO2 emissions.  Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems has been working on  ways of raising effi  ciency and reducing energy loss from distribution  transformers. Since  scal 2006, we manufacture and ship transformers  that are top-level in the industry in energy use. Among these,  amorphous transformers which use an amorphous metal alloy as the  steel core, are greatly contributing to CO2 reduction with an energy  effi  ciency of 40 percent or more. Approximately 23,000 high-effi  ciency  transformers including amorphous transformers were shipped in  scal  2010, for a cumulative total of around 124,000 since  scal 2006. The  use of transformers accounted for a reduction in CO2 emissions by 0.28  million tonnes in  scal 2010. Servers Information & Telecommunication Systems Company, Hitachi, Ltd.

One aim is to achieve  emission neutral by  scal 2015. The last year of the  Second Environmental Action Plan was  scal 2010,  so we reviewed the results of the actions to date,  and drew up Third Environmental Action Plan with  high targets that will push us to further lower the  environmental load. Emission Neutral  The emission neutral concept is geared at  minimizing the environmental load throughout the  life cycle of products. Emission neutral is achieved  when the direct environmental load becomes  an equal to the reduction in environmental  load during product use and disposal (social  environmental load). Direct environmental load  means the total impact in the stages from raw  materials re ning and processing to production and  distribution. It includes such impacts as greenhouse  gas emissions, waste materials, chemical emissions,  and other environmental loads that can be reduced  by self eff orts. Social load reduction means the  amount reduced in greenhouse gas emissions  during product use and recycling, waste generated,  and so on compared with products marketed in   scal 2005 through product energy effi  ciency  and resource conservation. Besides pursuing  effi  ciency improvements that will reduce the direct  environmental load from production, we are  expanding eff orts at social load reduction through  development and sales growth of Eco-Products,  with the aim of achieving emission neutral by  scal  2015. Successes of the Second Environmental Action Plan When implementing the Second Environmental  Action Plan, covering  scal years 2006 to 2010, we  used 17 action items and targets as main indicators  for environmental management. In  scal 2010,  the  nal year of the plan, we were able to exceed  our targets for 16 of these items. One standout  achievement, aimed at reducing the environmental  load by providing environmentally conscious  products and services, was reaching 60 percent of  Eco-Product sales (compared with the target of 55  percent). Tackling the global environmental issue  of CO2 emissions, we invested 29.7 billion yen in  energy effi  ciency measures over the  ve-year period  starting in  scal 2006, resulting in a reduction  in CO2 emissions by 290,000 tonnes. In addition,  through energy conservation measures taken by  the Hitachi Group as a whole, such as fuel switching  and energy effi  ciency diagnoses, we achieved a  21-percent reduction in Japan (target: 12 percent)  and a 7-percent improvement outside Japan per  unit of production (target: 5 percent), compared  with  scal 1990 levels.  The one area where we fell short of our target  was in the percentage sales of Super Eco-Products  (actual 26 percent versus target of 30 percent;  Direct Environmental Load Material production/ processing CO2 emissions  from material  production/ processing CO2 emissions  from manufacturing CO2 emissions  from waste recycling Manufacturing Distribution CO2 emissions  from transportation Reduced Social (Indirect) Load Use Take-back/recycling Reduced CO2 emissions  during product use  through energy-saving products Reduced CO2 emissions  in product take-back  and recycling The Emission Neutral Concept  Management Report Environmental Report  Corporate Environmental Management  Strategies and Initiatives Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/environment/  056 see page 066).

New action plans and targets  were also drawn up in order to have the entire  Hitachi Group become involved in preserving  ecosystems, a pillar of the Hitachi Environmental  Vision. In addition, the existing certi cation programs  for Super Eco-Products and Super Eco-Factories  & Offi  ces were changed to Eco-Products Select  and Eco-Factories & Offi  ces Select programs, with  revised certi cation criteria. The new certi cation  program Eco-Products Select has the additional  requirement of a large CO2 reduction rate for the  product, in order to accelerate the contribution to  reducing CO2 emissions through our products. The  new Eco-Factories & Offi  ces Select program now  de nes separate certi cation criteria for factories  and offi  ces, taking into account their diff erent  characteristics, rather than setting the same criteria  as before. Moreover, higher levels of achievement  have been set, re ecting current technology levels.  Through these programs, we will expand the  number of certi ed products, factories, and offi  ces,  promoting a further reduction in environmental  load.  Management Report Environmental Report  Corporate Environmental Management  Strategies and Initiatives Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/environment/  059 Hitachi Action Guidelines for Environmental  Conservation Purpose In order to realize an environmentally harmonious and sustainable  society through products and services, Hitachi is committed to  meeting its social responsibilities by promoting globally-applicable  MONOZUKURI (designing, manufacturing or repairing of products),  which is aimed at reducing environmental burdens of products  throughout their entire life cycles, ensuring global environmental  conservation. Action Guidelines 1. Global environmental conservation is a critical challenge  shared by all humans. Hitachi is committed, therefore, to  ful lling its responsibilities by assisting in the realization of an  environmentally harmonious and sustainable society as one of  its management priorities. 2. Hitachi will make eff orts to contribute to society by developing  highly reliable technologies and production processes, while  identifying needs considering concerns related to the prevention  of global warming, conservation of resources, and preservation  of ecosystems. 3. Members of the board in charge of environmental conservation  are responsible for facilitating appropriate environmental  conservation activities.   Departments responsible for environmental conservation should  endeavor to promote and ensure environmental conservation  activities, including improving environment-related rules  and regulations and setting goals for environmental burden  reduction. These departments should also con rm that their  environmental conservation activities are conducted in a proper  manner and ensure that these activities are maintained and  improved. 4. Hitachi will promote globally-applicable MONOZUKURI with  the aim of understanding and reducing environmental burdens  at every stage, including product research and development,  design, production, distribution, sales, usage, and  nal disposal. 5. Hitachi will investigate and review the environmental impact  caused in the course of its MONOZUKURI processes. Hitachi  will also introduce excellent technologies and materials useful  to safeguard the environment, in other words, to reduce  environmental burdens through energy and resource saving,  recycling, chemical substance management, consideration for  the ecosystem, and other measures. 6. Hitachis environmental conservation eff orts are not only to be  focused on observing international environmental regulations  and those of national and local governments, but also on  conserving the environment by implementing voluntary  environmental standards when necessary. 7. Regarding globally-applicable MONOZUKURI activities, impact  on the local environment and community are to be considered.  In addition, measures that meet local communities requests  should be implemented. 8. Hitachi will educate its employees to take action in order to obey  environment-related laws, raise their global environmental  awareness, and encourage their interest in environmental  conservation having wide-view about society activities. 9. Hitachi will evaluate potential environmental problems  and prevent them from occurring. In the event that any  environmental problem occurs, Hitachi will take appropriate  measures to minimize the environmental burden. 10. Hitachi will make eff orts to disclose information on  its environmental conservation activities to its relevant  stakeholders. Hitachi will also actively communicate with these  stakeholders so as to strengthen mutual understanding and  forge cooperative relationships with them. Adopted March 1993, revised July 2010  Management Report Environmental Report  Corporate Environmental Management  Strategies and Initiatives Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/environment/  060 Activities to Preserve Ecosystems The Concept of Ecosystem Preservation To promote ecosystem preservation, we  have made the preservation of ecosystems  a pillar of our environmental vision. We  have also incorporated consideration for  ecosystem preservation into our Action  Guidelines for Environmental Conservation.  Speci c initiatives in this area are de ned in  the Hitachi Group Ecosystems Preservation  Guideline and are conducted accordingly. Corporations depend on ecosystem  services such as the paper used in the  manufacturing stage (use of wood, a  biological material) and water use in  factories (use of clean water). In order to  maintain and recover these ecosystem  services, we believe that we can contribute  to ecosystem preservation both through  business and through contributions to  society in the area of nature conservation.  Speci cally, for contributions through  business, we are promoting designs  and production that reduce the impact  on ecosystems during the product life  cycle (material procurement, production,  transportation, use, recovery, recycling and  appropriate disposal), as well as increasing  the products and services for direct  preservation of ecosystems in such areas as  water and air puri cation. For contributions  to society in the area of nature conservation,  we encourage tree planting and ecological  surveys of rare plants and animals by  employees in volunteer programs, along  with other programs that lead to ecosystem  preservation. Assessing the Corporate Relationship  with Ecosystems Corporate Ecosystem Valuation (CEV)  is an assessment methodology used to  evaluate both ecosystem degradation  and the bene ts provided by ecosystem  services, so that improved business decisions  can be made that will lead to ecosystem  preservation. The Hitachi Group, as a  member of the World Business Council for  Sustainable Development (WBCSD), has  helped to develop the Guide to Corporate  Ecosystem Valuation, as well as translating  it into Japanese. We will perform CEV  within the Hitachi Group on a trial basis  and contribute to the widespread use of  CEV outside the Group in the days ahead.

The Hitachi Group is  committed to supporting these eff orts and  contributing to ecosystem preservation. Preserving Greenery at Company Sites Since Hitachis Central Research Laboratory  was built in 1942, the wild natural  environment of the site has been preserved,  respecting the instructive message of the  Hitachi, Ltd. founder not to cut down  good trees but to build around them. This  landscape continues to be maintained and  managed today. A pond on the site formed  from the water of natural springs, which are  the source of the Nogawa River, is a habitat  for swans and mallards. Approximately  27,000 trees, including more than 120  species such as zelkova trees and Himalayan  cedars, provide a resting place for over 40  species of wild birds, among them Chinese  bamboo partridges and gray starlings. To understand the role played by this  natural environment in preserving the  ecosystems of the surrounding areas, we  have conducted an analysis of the satellite  images of the area supported by Mitsui  Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd. and InterRisk  Research Institute & Consulting, Inc. The  studies showed that because of its large  scale, the greenery of the Central Research  Laboratory site plays the role of a core  green space necessary for maintaining an  ecosystem, and contributes to the formation  of an ecosystem network of the rivers  having their source in the natural springs on  the laboratory site. The Hitachi Group has many more  business sites that retain green space. Six  of these sites were chosen as among the  100 Outstanding Examples of Preservation,  Creation, or Utilization of Accessible  Greenspace by Corporations announced  in  scal 2010 by the Urban Green Space  Development Foundation. By continuing to  maintain these green spaces in the future,  we will contribute to the preservation of  local ecosystems. Contributions to Society through Nature  Conservation The Hitachi Group contributes to society  through nature conservation at many  company locations (see pages 108â€“110). Protecting endangered species is an  important part of maintaining biodiversity.  Working with the NPO Earth Watch Japan  every year since  scal 2007, we have taken  part in habitat surveys of the Reverdins  Blue butter y (Lycaeides argyrognomon), an  endangered species, around Mt.

Management Report Environmental Report  Environmentally Conscious Products and  Services Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/environment/  063 We assess the environmental burden of  products and services at the design and  development stage, designating those products  with a reduced environmental burden as Eco- Products. In  scal 2010, 60 percent of our sales  were for Eco-Products.  We are moving ahead with designing  and developing environmentally conscious  products to meet the goal set in our long- term Environmental Vision 2025 of making all  Hitachi products Eco-Products by  scal 2025. Increasing the Ratio of Eco-Products In 1999, we introduced a Design for Environment  (DfE) assessment system (see page 064) that sets  speci c environmentally conscious criteria for  designing and developing products and services to  minimize their environmental burden. Products that  meet DfE standards are designated as Eco-Products.  One of our goals is to increase the Eco-Product  sales ratio, or the ratio of Eco-Product sales to total  product sales.  In  scal 2010, the number of models designated  as Eco-Products rose by 1,069 to 9,456. This  brought the Eco-Product sales ratio to 60 percent,  topping our goal of 55 percent. Key factors driving  the improved sales ratio were the registration  of more Eco-Products for systems, software, and  services, as well as business growth in construction  machinery and automobiles.  Next Steps Our Third Environmental Action Plan (FY 2011â€“ 2015) sets the goal of boosting the Eco-Products  sales ratio to 65 percent by  scal 2015.

If a product  scores at least equal to or more than level 2 (the  reference level before the latest major model  change) in all 8 criteria and its average over all the  criteria is level 3 or more, it is designated as an  Eco-Product. Management of the whole environmentally  conscious design and development process is  coordinated using the Hitachi Group Ecodesign  Management Guidelines. Based on the IEC 62430  international standard on generic procedures for  environmentally conscious design, the guidelines  require divisions, such as business planning, design,  procurement, manufacturing, and quality control,  to be environmentally conscious and keep records  on processes and results. This includes the use of  DfE assessment and Eco-Product development.

Management Report Environmental Report  Environmentally Conscious Products and  Services Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/environment/  066 Development of Super Eco-Products Eco-Products that meet even more demanding  requirements are designated as Super Eco-Products.  Super Eco-Products must have either a global  warming prevention factor or resource factor of  10 or more, or be leaders in their industry for their  energy effi  ciency standard achievement rate1 or  other similar factors, or be highly rated outside  the company. Factor 10 or more indicates that the  product has a global warming prevention effi  ciency  or resource effi  ciency of at least ten times more  than reference products that were sold in  scal  2000 in principle. We are committed to increasing  the number of Hitachi Super Eco-Products by  improving the Super Eco-Product ratio, which is the  ratio of Super Eco-Products to total Eco-Product  sales.  In  scal year 2010, an additional 182 models  were designated as Super-Eco Products, bringing  the total to 721. However, booming Eco-Product  sales produced a relatively low Super Eco-Product  ratio of 26 percent, under the 30 percent target. Next Steps  Our Third Environmental Action Plan (FY 2011- 2015) raises the environmental performance  standards for the designation of Super-Eco Products  even higher, introducing a new designation:  Eco-Products Select. The reference products used  to calculate the global warming prevention and  resource factors have been changed from  scal  2000 products to  scal 2005 products. Product  function, one element used in calculating global  warming prevention effi  ciency and resource  effi  ciency, will now be assessed based on the  1  Energy effi  ciency standard achievement rate:  Based on the Act on the  Rational Use of Energy (also known as the Energy Conservation Law), this  value indicates the rate of achievement for energy effi  ciency targets of certain  home appliances. The target values are de ned using the most energy  effi  cient products available at the time. 2  Amount of resources used over the products life cycle:  amount of new  resources + discarded resources Hitachis Eco-Product System Eco-Products Products Products that meet  DfE assessment  criteria  Either a global warming  prevention factor or a resource  factor of 10 or more  Industry leading level  Highly regarded outside Hitachi Super Eco-Products Global Warming Prevention Factor Calculation The global warming prevention factor is the amount of improvement  in effi  ciency of global warming prevention compared with a reference  product. The effi  ciency of global warming prevention is based on  the concept of environmental effi  ciency that balances the value  of products contributing to the quality of life and the reduction of  their environmental load. We gauge the improvement in product  value by function and life span, using the amount of greenhouse  gases emitted over the product life cycle to calculate the reduced  environmental load.

We have also introduced a new condition:  the carbon emission reduction must be at least 50  percent greater than  scal 2005 products. Through  these changes, we aim to lift the environmental  performance of our product development to new  heights, gaining Eco-Products Select for 20 models by   scal year 2011 and 100 models by  scal year 2015. Super Eco-Products that meet these new  standards will be designated as Eco-Products Select.  Addressing Carbon Footprint   The Carbon Footprint of Products (CFP) is  the carbon equivalent of the total amount of  greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted over the entire  life cycle of a product or serviceâ€”from procurement  of raw materials through to disposal and recycling.  It is displayed on an easily understood label.  This allows people to compare the CFP of similar  products and services to select the product or  service with the lowest environmental burden, and  also helps businesses supply products and services  to improve their own global warming prevention  eff orts. We participated in the CFP Pilot Project run  by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and  Industry (METI) and other ministries, and in  scal  year 2010 acquired permission to use the CFP label  for our interactive whiteboard (StarBoard) based  teleconferencing system. Disclosure of Environmental Information In 1999, Hitachi introduced an environmental  information labeling system that uses symbols  and data sheets to provide environmental  information on environmentally conscious products.  Hitachis environmental mark indicates that a DfE  assessment has shown the product to be an Eco- Product, informing stakeholders that the products  environmental burden has been highly improved.  We also use our Web site to disclose environmental  information, such as data sheets that include power  consumption for each environmentally conscious  product and case studies of products that helped  improve environmental effi  ciency. Recycling Product Resources To promote resource recycling, the Hitachi Group  is building used product recovery systems and  developing recycling technologies. Developing Rare Earth Recycling Technologies  Rare earth magnets containing rare earths1 can  be used at very high temperatures and can exert a  strong magnetic force. Since these properties make  products highly energy effi  cient, rare earth magnets  are in increasing demand for cars, generators and  consumer appliance motors, as well as for hard  disk drives (HDDs). However, the uneven global  distribution of rare earths makes it vital for us to  develop alternative materials, as well as to secure a  stable rare earth supply by, for example, recovering  these resources from products. Hitachi has been working since  scal 2008 to  recycle rare earths by developing technologies to  CFP Label for the Interactive Whiteboard StarBoard- based Teleconferencing System The top  gure (4,750 kg) is the amount of GHGs  that will be emitted over the products entire life  cycle, where it is used in the following scenario  during use for ten years.

In  scal 2010, we developed a dedicated device  to separate and recover rare earth magnets from  used HDDs and compressors, and we succeeded  in extracting rare earths from magnets through  an experimental dry process that uses a special  extraction medium.2 This extraction device reduces  the amount of time required to separate and  recover rare earth magnets from used products  to around one-tenth of the time for doing this  by hand. In addition, because the new process  does not employ the chemicals now often used,  recycling will be both cheaper and have a smaller  environmental burden. The next steps will be to conduct more veri cation  experiments using the dry process to extract rare  earths, and to investigate the reuse of the rare  earths from rare earth magnets for launching the full  operation of rare earth recycling in 2013. of resources. In  scal year 2010, we set up the  Product Recycling Service Center to bring in and  recycle even more used IT products. At this center,  we consult with sales and other divisions to devise  plans for recovering end-of-life IT products from  corporations. This includes recycling or purchasing  for reuse, according to the type and condition of  the product. In  scal year 2010, Hitachi recovered  around 5,700 tonnes of used IT products through  the Hitachi Recycle Hotline and product recovery  services. Looking ahead, we plan to improve  recycling using the technologies we are currently  developing for extracting rare earths from used  HDDs. Product Recycling in the Information/ Telecommunications Field  We set up the Hitachi Recycle Hotline in  scal  year 2002 to provide recovery and recycling of  computers and peripheral devices via the Internet  and other methods. Over the nine years up to   scal year 2010, we recovered 284,000 units  (3,090 tonnes) and have recycled 2,090 tonnes  1  Rare earths:  17 elements including lanthanum and scandium.

Registration for the EUs REACH regulations was  completed by November 2010 for the substances  and compounds the Hitachi Group exports to  Europe for more than 1,000 tonnes per year.  Investigations and preparations are also underway  on submitting the REACH noti cation on particular  substances in articles by the June 2011 deadline. Working with the Supply Chain Working closely with suppliers and customers, we  have been gathering and sending out information  about chemical substances across the supply  chain via the Integrated Management System for  Chemical Substances Contained in Products. In  July 2009, we linked this management system to  the cross-industry JAMP1 information exchange  platform via Hitachis enterprise cloud service TWX- 21.2 The direct connection between customer and  supplier databases has opened the way for fast,  effi  cient information collection and transfer across  the entire supply chain. At the end of March 2011,  chemical substance information for 890,000 parts  and products was registered in our integrated  management system. Managing Chemical Substances Contained in Products To manage the chemical substances contained  in products, we created Regulations for  Environmental CSR-Compliant Monozukuri in 2005.  This helps us to manage chemical substances from  product development and design to procurement,  production, quality control, and sales. To voluntarily  control chemical substances, we have de ned 13  prohibited substances (Level 1) and 13 controlled  substances (Level 2), including potential REACH1  substances added in 2009.

Facilities that show a high level  of environmental consciousness as well as  outstanding results in these areas receive  Super Eco-Factory & Offi  ce certi cation as a  way of promoting environmentally conscious  production and encouraging environmental  activities. Creating Super Eco-Factories and  Offi  ces Super Eco-Factory & Offi  ce certi cations are given  to facilities that have achieved an industry-leading  environmental load reduction. We certify those  facilities as Eco-Factories & Offi  ces that have both  met their targets for the  scal year under our  GREEN 21 system for comprehensively evaluating  environmental action (see pages 083â€“084) and  have performed above the given criteria in areas  Environmentally Conscious Production Examples of Super Eco-Factories Hitachi Elevator Motor in Guangzhou, China, makes hoists, a core component of elevators. To save  energy, production effi  ciency has been boosted on production lines, which use many types of machine  tools. The plant has also promoted introducing high-effi  ciency air conditioners, LED lighting, and other  energy-saving devices. For example, all 1,360 ceiling lights are now LED. Also, a new building which  was added due to the need for production growth is designed for optimal use of natural light inside  the building to reduce power consumption. As a result, the  ve-year average energy consumption rate  per unit for  scal 2010 was improved by 10 percent. Other environmentally conscious manufacturing  initiatives include changing the type of forklifts used in the plant from diesel engines to electric (battery)  motors, and using adsorption instruments to lower VOC emissions during the painting process.  The Hamura Works designs and manufactures wireless communications systems, and has many   production areas to accommodate manufacturing of a wide range of the products. Hamura Works has  cut power usage by improving the layout of assembly areas and by sharing facilities with other Group  companies located nearby. Adoption of energy-saving machinery and equipment, such as high-effi  ciency  Hf inverter fluorescent lights and air conditioners, enabled Hamura Works to improve its five-year  average energy consumption rate per unit by 8.2 percent for  scal 2010. Waste paper, including documents on speci cations and other con dential documents, accounts  for more than 20 percent of the Hamura Works total waste. In  scal 2010, the Works achieved zero  nal  waste disposal rate through rigorous sorting and recycling, including using wet shredders so that waste  paper can be recycled into copy paper.  The works has more energy-saving plans, including using LED lamps on employees desks, and  shifting the responsibility of switching on and off the fluorescent lights in the work area from the  managers to individuals. The amount of power used across the whole Works will also be monitored using  a demand controller.  Hitachi Elevator Motor (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd. Hamura Works, Hitachi Kokusai Electric Inc.

Our target was to bring up  to 30 facilities, or 10 percent of the approximately  300 facilities eligible for certi cation, to the level of  Super Eco-Factories & Offi  ces by  scal 2010, and the  facilities themselves have worked hard to achieve a  high level of load reduction in order to be certi ed.  As a result, three more facilities were named Super  Eco-Factories & Offi  ces in  scal 2010, bringing the  total to 35 (23 in Japan and 12 outside Japan). To encourage environmental conservation,  information on initiatives at these facilities are  shared within the Group, along with energy- saving and water-processing technologies that  are relevant to other Group companies. Facilities  yielding outstanding results after introducing  Hitachi Group energy-saving products conduct  factory tours to demonstrate these products to  people within Hitachi and to others. Next Steps As part of our Third Environmental Action  Plan, we will review Super Eco-Factory & Offi  ce  certi cation criteria and mechanisms, launching  a new designation: Eco Factory & Offi  ce  Select. Certi cation criteria will be developed  individually according to the characteristics of our  manufacturing (factory) and non-manufacturing  (offi  ce) divisions. For factories, standards will be  raised for energy effi  ciency, renewable energy use,  as well as water recycling and other Super Eco- Factory & Offi  ce certi cation criteria used to date.  For offi  ces, evaluation criteria will be established in  areas such as energy saving for lighting, renewable  energy use, and a buildings overall environmental  protection. To maintain and raise the level of environmental  activities in Eco Factories & Offi  ces Select, certi ed  facilities will be re-evaluated every year to check  whether their performance for that  scal year still  meets the certi cation criteria. Our goal is for every  in-house company and Group company to have at  least one facility certi ed by  scal 2015.  Facilities already certi ed as Super Eco-Factories &  Offi  ces will be re-evaluated based on the new criteria.

Improving Energy Effi  ciency through Sustained  Investment in Energy Saving  As part of our Second Environmental Action Plan  for  scal 2006â€“10, we implemented sustained  investment. Over that  ve-year period, we invested  29.7 billion yen in high-effi  ciency equipment  and fuel switching, achieving a 290,000-tonne  reduction in CO2 emissions. In  scal 2010, we  installed solar power generation equipment in two  more factories and made progress on switching  to LED tube lamps for a drastic reduction in CO2  emissions.  Fuel Switching Initiative  Based on our plan to reduce heavy fuel oil use  across the entire Group to one-tenth or less  from  scal 2005 by  scal 2012, since 2006, we  systematically switched to natural gas in the  10 plants which accounted for 80 percent of  the Groups heavy fuel oil use in  scal 2005. In   scal 2010, Hitachinaka General Hospital was  also switched entirely to electricity when it was  renovated. This and other measures have reduced  heavy fuel oil use by around 45% compared with  the  scal 2005 level.

Especially now when more factories  are being built in China and Southeast Asia and  when Japanese production lines are being moved  there, CO2 emissions from production facilities  outside Japan account for around 40 percent  of total Group emissions. This is making energy  conservation an urgent task. We provide facilities  outside Japan with energy conservation support  programs to encourage them to make their own  daily and ongoing improvements. Hitachi experts  with energy conservation knowhow developed in  Japan have also gone to the Philippines, Malaysia  and other countries to conduct energy conservation  diagnoses, identifying wasteful energy use and  introducing high-effi  ciency equipment upgrades  to improve energy conservation. In  scal 2010,  energy conservation diagnoses were conducted  in 12 Japanese plants and 4 plants in Thailand,  bringing the number of factories diagnosed since   scal 2005 to more than 50. We will continue  to implement these global energy conservation  diagnoses, outside Japan in particular, to spread  energy conservation expertise and to train energy  conservation personnel. Introducing Renewable Energy We are committed to using solar and wind power,  and other renewable energy sources. In  scal 2010,  we introduced a 170 kW solar power generator,  bringing the amount of power generated from  renewable sources to 1,245 MWh from solar power  and 76 MWh from wind power. We have also  bought Green Power Certi cations from Japan  Natural Energy Company for around 1,000 MWh of  natural energy every year, using it for Hitachi, Ltd.  offi  ces and for trade fairs, etc. Reducing Transportation Energy We have worked to curb CO2 emissions from  transportation toward the target of improving  transportation energy consumption per real unit of  output by 11 percent from  scal 2006 by  scal 2010.  Key steps to reach this goal include reducing product  sizes, weights, and packaging to improve truck load  effi  ciencies; making modal shifts from truck to rail  and ship transportation; shipping complete rather  than part orders for large products; and combining  truck, rail, and ship transportation to boost effi  ciency.  As a result, we improved transportation energy  consumption per real unit of output by 29 percent  in  scal 2010 and reduced CO2 emissions by 63,000  tonnes from  scal 2006.

For production facilities in  Japan, the target is a 16-percent reduction in CO2  emissions from  scal 1990 by  scal 2011, and a  20-percent reduction by  scal 2015. To reach these  overall targets, each in-house company and Group  company has been assigned a target according to  growth in their particular business area.  Steps taken toward achieving our targets include  systematic fuel switching and using high-effi  ciency  machinery. We will also create a mechanism for  monitoring monthly CO2 emissions at every in-house  and Group company and assess the status of reaching  that  scal years goals, bolstering the PDCA cycle. To curb CO2 emissions from transportation, we  are aiming for an ongoing reduction of 1 percent  per year in transportation energy consumption per  unit of output. We will press ahead with modal shifts  and product weight reduction to cut transportation  energy consumption per unit of output in Japan by  12 percent from  scal 2006 by  scal 2011, and by 15  percent by  scal 2015. Reducing Waste We reduce and recycle waste materials generated  during manufacturing, including valuable resources  (reusable resources with residual value). To meet  our goal of reducing waste by 25 percent from   scal 2000 by  scal 2010, we have promoted  the reuse of resources from manufacturing by  recycling material residue as raw resources, as  well as by  ltering and reusing cleaning oil. These  technologies and measures were shared across the  Group, enabling the total-waste reduction group  to achieve a 33-percent cut by  scal 2010 and the  waste-per-unit production reduction group to  achieve a 25-percent reduction, both meeting the  years targets. We will also recycle waste into resources rather  than disposing of it in land lls.

In  scal 2010, we raised the resource  recycling rate1 in Japan by 13 percent from  scal  2005, clearing the years goal of 10 percent. In our  initiative to boost the number of zero emission2  sites that have minimized land ll disposal, 159  facilities achieve that goal in  scal 2010. Promoting Appropriate Disposal To reduce the risk of inappropriate waste disposal,  we have developed a waste management system  that electronically records information from  manifests1 on waste type, disposal method  and disposal completion, and can register the  e-manifests2 being promoted by the government.  We have bolstered our mechanisms for ensuring  appropriate waste disposal, with the system  now issuing a warning if there are mistakes in a  manifest or if disposal cannot be completed. A  function has been added for collating data on  waste volume, disposal methods, and disposal  volume from electronic manifest information to  boost operational effi  ciency and promote resource  recycling. In  scal 2010, enhancing support  mechanisms for the introduction of e-manifests to  promote greater e-manifest use within the Group,  which resulted in 62 facilities adopting e-manifests. 1  Manifest:  An evidence document for industrial waste management issued by  waste generators and relayed along the waste stream to ensure appropriate  disposal  2  Electronic manifest (e-manifest):  Mechanism for centralized management  of digital manifests, with waste generators and waste disposal companies  sharing relevant information 1  Calculated as (base year 3R load minus subject year 3R load) divided by base  year 3R load  2  De ned as a  nal disposal rate (land ll disposal/waste) of no more than 1  percent and less than 5 tonnes of  nal waste in any given year WEB  Zero emission sites  http://www.hitachi.com/environment/activities/data/zeroemission.html 3R Load Concept The 3R load is the expected environmental load from waste disposal.

Water Conservation Given the global shortage of water resources, we  are committed to promoting eff ective use of the  water by reducing the amount of water consumed  in our operations. Outside Japan, where water  conservation is a pressing issue, our production  facilities had recovered and recycled water  during manufacturing process or reused it for  non-technical uses to reach the goal of reducing  water consumption by 10 percent from  scal  2005 by  scal 2010. In  scal 2010, the 10-percent  target was achieved despite increased water  Next Steps Our Third Environmental Action Plan (FY 2011â€“15)  aims to further reduce the amount of waste  generated by increasing the target for improving  waste generation per unit of production from   scal 2005 by 16 percent in  scal 2011 and by 20  percent by  scal 2015. Facilities manufacturing  high-function materials, such as copper products  and magnetic materials, are expected to achieve  a 7-percent improvement by  scal 2011 and 15  percent by  scal 2015, considering the heavy  energy use of production processes in these areas.  To improve appropriate waste disposal rates, our  target is to lift the e-manifest registration rate in  Japan to at least 90 percent by  scal 2015. The  TOPICS Reducing Waste from Transportation  Packaging Hitachi Transport System is promoting  activities to reduce waste by improving  packaging. The initiative in  scal 2010  was to reduce wood waste by switching  from one-way wooden packing crates to  collapsible, reusable metal crates. These  crates were made more compact to  t into  Japan Freight Railway Company  ve-tonne  containers, enabling a modal shift from  truck to rail transport and helping to reduce  CO2 emissions during transportation. The  shorter unpacking time has also enhanced  work effi  ciency and service. Due to these  improvements, the company received an  Electric Equipment Packaging Category  Award at the Japan Packaging Contest 2010,  which is sponsored by the Japan Packaging  Institute.

We will pursue a  range of measures to boost water use effi  ciency,  ensuring a steady reduction.  Next Steps Our Third Environmental Action Plan (FY 2011â€“15)  aims to balance increased production outside Japan  with water resource conservation by improving water  use per unit of production by 16 percent from  scal  2005 by  scal 2011 and by 30 percent by  scal 2015. Chemical Substance Management To deal with chemical risk and comply with laws  and regulations, we assess chemical substances,  managing risk in three ways: prohibition, reduction,  and control. Since 1998, we have operated  an online database for chemical substance  management called CEGNET to index the latest  laws and regulations and our own voluntary  regulations, ensuring appropriate management of  newly introduced chemical substances. Chemical  substances used in our operations are also  registered with CEGNET. Collecting and aggregating  the data on the amount of chemical substances  used, emitted, or transferred helps to reduce our  use of chemicals. In addition, we train chemical  substance managers and regularly communicate  the risks to deepen local residents understanding  of how we manage chemical substance risk. Reducing Chemical Substances To prevent air pollution, we cut emissions of 41  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) based on a  program from the Ministry of the Environment. Our  goal was to reduce VOC atmospheric emissions in  Japan by 50 percent from  scal 2000 by  scal 2010,  and to cut the rate of reduction of VOC atmospheric  emissions1 outside Japan by 10 percent from  scal  2005. The rate of reduction of VOC atmospheric  emissionsâ€”intended to reduce the ratio of  emissions to the volume of VOCs handledâ€”is used  as an indicator outside Japan because of production  growth there. We are improving manufacturing  processes to introduce VOC alternatives and install  equipment to recover and render them harmless.  Hitachi Construction Machinery, for example, has  achieved a 40-percent reduction in the volume of  VOC emissions by adopting low-solvent paints and  introducing an electrodeposition coating process  using water-based paint for coating large hydraulic  shovels. Outside Japan, Hitachi Elevator (Shanghai)  has cut the volume of VOC emissions to less than 1  percent by introducing devices for absorbing and  recovering VOCs during the painting process for  elevator parts and by switching to water-based  paints. As a result of all these activities, in  scal  2010, we cut VOC emissions in Japan by 69 percent  from  scal 2000, and outside Japan reduced  emissions by 29 percent from  scal 2005, in both  cases achieving our targets.

Although some  substances are exempt from reporting due to  their small quantities, our policy is to keep data  on all PRTR substances, provided the amount is 10  kilograms or more per year, so that we can control  these substances as well. Next Steps To reduce the ratio of VOC emissions to VOCs  used, our Third Environmental Action Plan (FY  2011â€“15) established the rate of reduction of  VOC atmospheric emissions as the indicator used  worldwide. It sets the targets of reducing that  rate to 5.8 percent in  scal 2011 and to less than  5 percent in  scal 2015, further reducing VOC  emissions into the atmosphere.  Managing Environmental Risk In the Hitachi Group, we go the extra mile in  environmental management by considering the  environmental burden of all our business activities  and setting voluntary management criteria more  stringent than regulations. At every business site,  we monitor water quality and noise, for example,  and work to minimize environmental risk. We also  share information on environmental regulations  and violations to prevent recurrences and to  strengthen management. In  scal 2010, four incidents exceeded statutory  environmental limits and there were nine noise  complaints, and all were promptly resolved. We  will continue to audit and monitor data to prevent  recurrences. To prevent soil and groundwater contamination  caused by chemical leaks, we replace underground  pipes, pits, and tanks with ones above ground.  We have now completed soil and groundwater  decontamination or con rmed the sites  where chemical substances were used to be  conatmination free. Cleanups and monitoring will  continue at the remaining sites.

Outside Japan, we hold regular regional  environmental meetings to promote environmental  action. In  scal 2010, information was shared  during meetings in China, the United States, and  Europe on the Third Environmental Action Plan (FY  2011-15) and the latest environmental regulations.  In addition, views were exchanged on local  environmental issues. We will continue using these  worldwide regional networks to improve our global  activities, keeping the special character of each  region in mind.

Twenty- ve  business units which have approximately 300 sites  meeting these criteriaâ€”the R&D Group, four in- house companies, and 20 Group companiesâ€”and  the Environmental Strategy Offi  ce have together  developed and implemented the Hitachi Group  Environmental Promotion Organization EMS  to consistently promote the implementation of  environmental policies. In  scal 2010, the Hitachi Group Environmental  Promotion Organization EMS had its  rst ISO 14001  surveillance audit since a recerti cation audit. No  corrective action was required, and certi cation  remains in eff ect. Also, at the same time, the in-house and  Group companies covered by the Hitachi Group  Environmental Promotion Organization EMS have  been working to develop their own EMSs. In  scal  2010, three in-house and  ve Group companies  carried out EMS integration for multiple business  sites. With this completed, EMS integration has  now been done at all major in-house and Group  companies. Every business site meeting the criteria for  environmental management continues to maintain  ISO 14001 certi cation. In fact, business sites  that did not meet the criteria have also obtained  certi cation, so that 591 Hitachi Group business  sites were certi ed as of March 2011. Monitoring Environmental Performance Data For eff ective environmental management, we  collect environmental performance data on  business operations using the Environmental  Load Evaluation System. This system collects  environmental load data from some 300 Hitachi  business sites worldwide on such items as  energy use, CO2 emissions, and waste generated,  together with information on outside complaints,  honors received, and other items. By analyzing  this information, we identify environmental  management issues, share instructive examples  within the Group, and improve environmental  practices. We will continue to expand this system to  keep pace with new laws and policies. For example,  we added a function for registration to the electronic  manifests promoted by the Japanese government to  prevent inappropriate disposal of wastes (see page  76) and upgraded our system to collect and analyze  energy-use data from all relevant sites in response to  Japans amended Energy Conservation Law.1  Further improvements will allow the system  to assess progress toward reduction targets for  CO2 emissions and other environmental load  indicators. These measures will heighten awareness  of what needs to be done to meet the goals of the  Environmental Action Plan.

It divides environmental activities into  eight categories and evaluates achievements and  progress toward Action Plan targets by rating 55  items on a scale from 1 to 5, then showing the  results on radar charts. For any category, a perfect  score is 200 green points (GPs). The results of  GREEN 21 evaluations are incorporated into the  business performance evaluations of all Hitachi  in-house companies and some Group companies.  In  scal 2010, the  nal year, we surpassed the  overall Group target of 1,280 GPs with a total score  of 1,286, due to steady improvements at business  sites around the world. In the areas of reducing  global warming and worldwide environmental  partnerships, where results fell short of their  targets, we intend to improve scores in the future  by continuing the shift to more energy-effi  cient  systems and by ramping up communication on  environmental action outside Japan. Under our Third Environmental Action Plan  (FY 2011â€“15), we are adding new GREEN 21  evaluation items with which we increase the level  of activity: contributing to business growth and  preservation of ecosystem through expanded  environmental business operations, and collecting  and communicating environmental data across our  supply chain. 180 90 0 3.

The Environmental  Activities page on the Hitachis Web site also  provides information on the environmentally  conscious features of the Hitachi Groups main  products, as well as customer feedback. In  scal  2010, for its clear themes and the high standard of  environmental activities, our Web site won the prize  in the corporate category of the Environmental goo  Awards. Our environmental campaign TV commercial on  high functional materials and components, which  began screening in August 2010, won the grand  prize in the environmental TV commercials category  of the 14th Environmental Communication  Awards. Judges lauded Hitachis skilful portrayal  of the environmental contribution of the materials  business, recognizing that while these materials  are critical to the environmental business, they are  diffi  cult to explain to viewers.  Also, we cooperate with socially responsible  investment1 ratings and other environmental  surveys (see pages 102â€“103). Participation at Exhibitions We value the opportunity for direct dialogue with  stakeholders, so we participate in environment- related exhibitions. In  scal 2010, we took part in  exhibitions around the world, setting towards a  sustainable society as our core concept.  In Japan, we participated in Messe Nagoya 2010,  held in October to coincide with COP 10, as well  as the Eco-Products Exhibition 2010 in December  1  An approach to investing where shares are selected partly on the basis of  criteria relating to CSR WEB  CSR/Environmental reports published by Hitachi Group companies http://www.hitachi.com/environment/activities/data/rpt_open.html WEB  External environmental awards http://www.hitachi.com/environment/activities/data/commendation.html Eco-products International Fair in India Environmental Activities page on Hitachis Web site  Management Report Environmental Report  Environmental Management Framework  and Communication Social Report Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/environment/  088 (an annual event for us).

Also, we exhibited at both the 2010 International  Greentech and Eco Products Exhibition in October  in Malaysia and the Eco-products International  Fair 2011 in February in India. At these events,  we demonstrated to visitors our environmentally  conscious products and services, deepening their  understanding of Hitachi.  At exhibitions, we also work to reduce the  environmental load of our booths. The Hitachi  booth at Eco-Products Exhibition 2010 was built  with environmental consciousness in mind, using  LED lamps for all lighting and a carpet made from  recycled plastic bottles. For these initiatives, Hitachi  booth won the Eco & Design Booth Prize granted to  environmentally conscious exhibition booths.  Partnerships with Stakeholders We promote environmental communication,  deepening the exchange on environmental themes  with local stakeholders, and we conduct social  contribution activities with them.  In  scal 2010, we carried out environmental  education and tree planting as well as restoration  projects in various regions worldwide. As far as  environmental education is concerned, to help  raise the eco-awareness of children who will lead  the next generation, we provided easy learning  opportunities through hands-on training and  experiments and explanations of Hitachi Group  activities.  To conserve the environment as a global  citizen, we promote environmental beauti cation  and natural conservation in cooperation with  employees, their families and local residents.  Through these activities, we also support local  environmental conservation, by holding meetings  with local authorities and working with NGOs  and NPOs that specialize in local environmental  situations and activities (see pages 108â€“110).

We must therefore  accelerate the globalization of our entire supply chain while  consistently procuring the materials we need. Our key challenges are to ensure the transparency of our  entire supply chain, to share information with suppliers, and to  cultivate human capital worldwide. In Japan, we have built close  relationships with, and have grown together with, our suppliers  in what is essentially a family relationship. But these ties have  eroded somewhat in a global procurement climate where equal  partnerships have become the prime focus. We intend to build  a global supply chain based on trust by localizing human capital  while cultivating professionals worldwide. Well change our business through sustainable  procurement activities. With such a high aspiration and  commitment, well create a sustainable procurement system  that manages risk and builds business partnerships that meet  mutual social responsibilities. We aim to be a global business solving global issues, and  expect our businesses to grow worldwide and dramatically  over the next decade, particularly in emerging countries. We  therefore need to develop locally oriented management and  employ, evaluate, and cultivate human capital worldwide,   nding leaders to play key roles within the Hitachi Group. That said, we have not yet fully identi ed the career and  educational experience, and the skills, of all of our employees  around the world. In keeping with our commitment to be a  global company, I am eager to create a worldwide human  capital database as well as a global grading system that  we can use for developing the careers of our employees,  worldwide. We must maintain high standards of worker safety to  develop globally, which is why we formulated the Hitachi  Group Safety and Health Policy in  scal 2010. We intend to become a world-class, sustainable corporate  group that motivates employees by helping them to achieve  work-life balance and by accelerating diversity management.

The courses include Reliability  (Fundamentals and Applications) and Product  Safety. In  scal 2009, we augmented management  training with a course that reaffi  rms the mental  attitude of Hitachi engineers. In  scal 2010, we  reinforced our monozukuri capabilities by starting a  new course for section chiefs and above to reaffi  rm  their way of thinking on technology and design. A quality assurance training center at a  manufacturing site in Hitachi City, Ibaraki  Prefecture, Japan, helps to increase production,  inspection, and maintenance skills. Other locations  and manufacturing sites off er their own specialized  technical courses. To reinforce our management structure, we  improve the quality of products and services  globally through our tradition of monozukuri 1  craftsmanship. Quality Assurance Activities To preserve our tradition of monozukuri  craftsmanship from the customers perspective,  we are fully committed to Group-wide quality  assuranceâ€”covering everything from product  planning and development through to delivery and  after-sales service. We support quality assurance  in particular by activities that place the priority  on organizations and management, technology,  and human capital. In  scal 2010, we launched  the three-year Hitachi Group QF (Quality First)  Innovation Movement to ensure product safety,  compliance with laws and regulations, human  resource development, and improved quality.

We are therefore  reinforcing systems and training to improve quality  there. For example, we host the annual Conference  for QA Managers in China to improve quality  awareness and to share information. In  scal 2010,  we held a Conference for QA Managers in Thailand,  our  rst such meeting in Southeast Asia. We provide the two following quality reliability  courses to develop QA skills in people worldwide by  improving their quality awareness and inspection  techniques:  Basic Reliability Course: Deepens understanding  of such basic issues as Hitachis monozukuri  craftsmanship, quality management, and labor  safety.   Intermediate Reliability Course: Boosts  understanding of more practical issues in such  areas as Hitachis monozukuri craftsmanship, ISO  9001, defect elimination, design for reliability, and  purchasing and vendor management. Handling Product Accidents If a product malfunctions, the division responsible  acts swiftly to resolve the problem from the  customers perspective, coordinating with other  business units as needed. For an especially serious  accident, we quickly submit a status report to top  management, and the responsible company and  Hitachi join hands to take fast remedial action.  At the same time, we promptly comply with legal  requirements to report to government agencies.  We then publish the incident information through  our Web site and other channels. When we decide that a product recall is  necessary, we notify the public through newspaper  advertisements or our Web site, then repair or  replace these products. Our Web site also provides  detailed product safety information. Customer Satisfaction Using the Customer Satisfaction (CS) Management  Guidelines, one of the pillars of Hitachis business  management, we continue to improve CS with the  goal of creating innovation through collaboration  with customers. We use CS surveys tailored to  each business operation. In addition, we analyze  customer opinions submitted to the Hitachi  Customer Answer Center. We host the annual Hitachi Group Service  Business Liaison Council, chaired by the president  of Hitachi, Ltd., whose members are presidents and  departmental offi  cers from Group and in-house  service companies.

Web Site Customer Support Our Web site provides comprehensive customer  support. It enables us to process customer inquiries,  opinions, requests, and complaints in collaboration  with the customer support units of Group  companies to improve our products and services.  We also use educational and other initiatives  to speed up and improve our response to these  inquiries. One of our initiatives is to hold the Web Inquiry  Responsiveness Improvement Course, something  we have done since  scal 2009. To date, 176  Hitachi Group employees have taken this course,  which features case studies based on responses to  inquiries.

Based on the survey  ndings, we improve  service by upgrading employee education,  especially through CS training courses and CS  improvement months. Elevators and Escalators, Building Facilities  Management When we design and develop elevators and  escalators, we use proprietary technologies to  ensure peoples safety and comfort. We make  technical improvements based on their feedback.  For elevators, for example, we adopt Universal  Design when we design buttons, sensors to detect  dog leads stuck in doors, as well as emergency  systems that safely stop at the nearest  oor and  evacuation instructions during power outages or  earthquakes.  For building facilities management, our products  improve our customers effi  ciency and we respond  to demands for more eff ective building facilities  management. For example, we developed BIVALE,  an integrated building facility management system  that coordinates energy and security at multiple  locations through the Internet. Our maintenance  services subsidiary, Hitachi Building Systems Co.,  Ltd., has 350 service sites around Japan to swiftly  respond to customers. State-of-the-art remote  building monitoring and diagnostic systems  observe and analyze elevators and escalators, and  building facilities, 24/7, to perform preventive  maintenance. Information and Telecommunication Systems  Products and Services  The IT Systems Division is contributing to customers  business innovation by collaborative creation with  its customers, drawing on Group-wide expertise  and information technology. Collaborative  creation is based on our customers point of  view, so we conduct an annual survey to gauge  customers satisfaction with our products and  services. Another goal of this survey is to improve our  business by re ecting customers opinions, not only  satisfaction with our products and service, but also  expectations of Hitachi. With customers consent,  we have donated the fee that customers received  for participating in our survey to Good Earth  Japan,1 a non-pro t organization, since  scal 2007.

Quality of use means focusing on the traits  that make people feel that the product is easy and  enjoyable to use. Accessibility refers to the range of  people who can use a product or service. Life cycle  covers all the stages of the value chain from before  the product is purchased through to disposal. Product Development Cycle and UD Guidelines In keeping with our UD philosophy, we maintain  an upward spiraling product development cycle  that completely involves customers and experts in  basic research, guideline formulation, and product  development. We draw on extensive research into  consumer behavior and their characteristics to  formulate UD guidelines for product development.  The information obtained during product  development goes into a database that our  businesses share, and we distribute some of this  information externally to promote open-source  standardization and education initiatives. Digital and Home Appliances We de ne people as customers as soon as a  product interests them, so it is essential to consider  quality in everything from pre-sales to disposal.  Key attributes are usability, features, harmony with  the environment, safety, and maintenance. Our  intention is to tailor products to peoples needs and  lifestyles so that they become attached to them. With washing and drying machines, for example,  we widened doors and put in shallower drums to  make it easier to remove clothes from the bottom  of the drum. At the same time, we added a large  white LCD display that is more visible and easier  to use, as well as a talking button that instructs,  indicates status, and helps resolve problemsâ€”at the  press of a button. Public Equipment and Systems Since these are to be used in public spaces, it is vital  to design public equipment and systems that even  children can use while optimizing security, privacy,  and safety. For example, we researched and commercialized  a tabletop electron microscope to encourage more  children to enjoy science. We made this microscope  easy to use for novice teachers and children. This  product received the Minister of Economy, Trade  and Industry (Japan) Award in the Future Products  Category of The 4th Kids Design Award 2010,  sponsored by Kids Design Association.1 The wide door Large white LCD display and talking button  Talking button Tabletop electron microscope 1  Good Earth Japan (GEJ) is a non-pro t organization which is mainly engaged  in helping people to rebuild their livelihoods in post-mine-clearance areas in  Cambodia.

In  scal 2009, however, the Government  & External Relations Division (initially known as  the Government & External Relations Offi  ce) was  established within our headquarters to integrate  and coordinate external relations. Outside Japan,  we set up offi  ces in Washington, D.C. and Brussels  to monitor policy trends in North America and  Europe. The key external relations initiatives include  lobbying and communicating with governments;  participating in government-led study groups  and councils; contributing to policymaking by  sending people to international institutions, public  offi  ces and external groups; and by participating  in international groups such as the World Business  Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).  These activities are reported back to the Group as a  whole through the Hitachi Group External Relations  members meeting. Stakeholder Engagement To help resolve sustainability issues, we invite  local policymakers to stakeholder dialogues that  we hold regularly, worldwide. In this way, we  participate in wide-ranging exchanges of views  on issues such as public-private cooperation  and corporate involvement in policymaking. The  increasingly globalized and complex nature of  social and environmental issues requires  exible,  dynamic partnerships that transcend governments,  international institutions, NGOs and companies.  Through dialogues with stakeholders in many  Partnerships with governments and  policymakers around the world are vital for  creating a sustainable society and growing our  Social Innovation Business. Through external  relations like these, we are able to have  discussions with governments and groups from  Japan, as well as other countries and regions,  with the goal of providing optimal and relevant  solutions for society. External Relations Policy Our basic plan is to participate in decision making  in countries and regions around the world and  to contribute to developing a sustainable social  infrastructure. In particular, we respond to social  expectations by identifying risks within the Hitachi  Group at an early stage and by making policy  recommendations. For example, we may focus  on the environment and smart cities as our  particular area of expertise. With that plan in mind,  we hold dialogues with a range of stakeholders,  including government offi  cials, non-governmental  organizations (NGOs) and research institutes that  have in uence on social policies.

Partnerships for Combating Global  Warming  To help combat global warming, the Ministry of  Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan has  been investigating a new credit scheme where  energy-saving products, high-effi  ciency coal-  red thermal power plants, and other products  and technologies where Japan leads the world,  are only partially being used under the existing  Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). We are  committed to working with Group companies to  contribute to this new scheme with our energy- saving products and solutions. One example: in  October 2010, Hitachi Plant Technologies was  selected by METI for an open call for feasibility  studies on a project to reduce carbon emissions  by air conditioning using deep sea water in the  Republic of Maldives. Global External Relations Initiatives Partnerships to Create Next-Generation Cities We are pushing forward with a range of initiatives  to create next-generation cities that have a low  environmental burden by exploiting advanced  technologies based on smart grids. In  scal 2010, we participated in the Japan  Smart Community Alliance, established by the New  Energy and Industrial Technology Development  Organization (NEDO), as a member of the board.  We are conducting studies and veri cations on  smart community projects not only in Japan but  also in China, Spain, Hawaii, etc. , with the support  of government organizations such as METI, Ministry  of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism  (MLIT) of Japan, and NEDO.  The 12th EU Hitachi Science and Technology Forum Hitachi Europe Ltd. and Hitachi, Ltd. have been  organizing the EU Hitachi Science and Technology  Forum since 1998 to provide a platform for  public policy debate, discussing how science and  technology can contribute to solving Europes social  issues. In May 2010, to celebrate Hitachis 100th  anniversary the Science and Technology Forum  was organized by addressing the theme of Smart  Energy Usage for a Sustainable Society. Over 140  people attended the forum, including business  and government representatives, researchers from  universities and research institutes, and other key   gures from industry, government and academia,  as well as representatives from NGOs. At the forum,  we introduced technologies for a low-carbon  society, such as hybrid trains and environmentally  conscious data centers. During panel discussion, the  topic of policies towards energy-effi  cient end-use  and energy-effi  cient technologies was vigorously  discussed.  Forum results were compiled into a report and  shared with the European Commission, offi  cials  in the various European governments, and our  business partners.

Feedback from  institutional investors and analysts was positive.  One said, "We are better able to understand  Hitachis businesses , which I found useful for  analysis." We plan to hold this event regularly.  We also communicate extensively with individual  investors through brokerage-sponsored brie ngs.  We conduct one-on-one meetings with institutional  investors and analysts worldwide. We convened  more than 600 similar meetings in  scal 2010,  a  To ensure that shareholders and investors can  make sound investment decisions, we provide  the information they need in a fair, transparent  and appropriate way that strives to enhance  communication with them. Policy on Information Disclosure  We communicate with shareholders and investors  guided by our disclosure policy. We disclose not  only information required by laws or regulations,  but also information that promotes deeper  stakeholder understanding of our management  policies and business activities, including their  relation to creating sustainable long-term value. Communication with Shareholders and Investors Disclosure Policy 1. Basic Policy Hitachis corporate credo is to contribute to society through the  development of superior, original technology and products.  With this in mind, Hitachi seeks to maintain and develop trust  relationships with all stakeholders, including shareholders  and other investors, customers, business partners, employees  and regional communities. We will ful ll our responsibility  to stakeholders by disclosing information in a fair and highly  transparent manner, and by conducting various communication  activities. 2. Information Disclosure Standards Hitachi discloses information as appropriate in a fair and highly  transparent way, in compliance with the laws and regulations of  the stock exchanges on which the Company is listed.   Hitachi discloses not only information required by laws and  regulations, but also management and  nancial information that  is regarded as useful in deepening stakeholder understanding  of Hitachi management policy and business activities. Hitachi  also discloses non- nancial information on the social and  environmental impact of Hitachi Group activities. Hitachis  stance on disclosure recognizes that society regards the above  information as important. 3. Disclosure Methods Hitachi uses appropriate means to disclose the information  required by laws and regulations of the stock exchanges on  which the Company is listed. The Company also posts this  information on Web sites immediately after it is disclosed.   Hitachi also discloses information not required by laws  and regulations by distributing news releases, holding press  conferences and presentations, posting information on  Web sites, and conducting other disclosure activities in an  appropriate, precise and timely manner. 4. Quiet Period Hitachi stipulates a quiet period of a certain length prior to  earnings announcements to prevent information leaks and to  maintain disclosure fairness. During this period, Hitachi refrains  from answering inquiries about business performance and  related matters. 5. Forward-Looking Statements For disclosures, Hitachi may make statements that constitute  forward-looking statements that re ect managements views  with respect to certain future events and  nancial performance  at the time of disclosure and include any statement that does not  directly relate to any historical or current fact. Such statements  are based on information available at the time of disclosure and  are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Certain forward- looking statements are based upon assumptions of future events  which may not prove to be accurate. Hitachi discloses the factors  that could cause actual results to diff er materially from those  projected or implied in forward-looking statements.

We are doing our  best to share IR feedback in-house and re ect this  in management and operations. We are committed to timely disclosure and we  post brie ngs and other materials on our investor  relations Web site. A part of the site, speci cally  designed for individual investors, provides  information that cultivates a deeper understanding  of the Hitachi Group. General Meeting of Shareholders At the ordinary general meeting of shareholders,  we off er audio-visual reports designed to give  shareholders a thorough understanding of our  situation. After the general meeting of shareholders,  our Web site discloses management policy  explanations from the president for shareholders  and investors. We post notices of general meetings  of shareholders earlier than legally required to give  stakeholders more time to consider our proposals.

Our environmental initiatives  scored the highest among all the companies. We  also made the Silver Class in the Sustainability  Yearbook 2011, published in February 2011, by  SAM2 and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Basic Policy for Prevention of Takeovers We invest considerable management resources  in basic research for the future and for the  development of pioneering products and  businesses. To ensure that these management  measures bear fruit, it is necessary to maintain  the continuity of management policies over  a certain period of time. To this end, we keep  shareholders and investors informed not only  about management results for each term but  also management measures looking ahead to the  future.  We do not deny the signi cance of stimulating  corporate activities or the economy through the  transfer of management control rights. However,  regarding large purchases of Hitachi and Hitachi  Group companies shares, it is necessary to  cautiously assess the impact that such a purchase  or purchase proposal would have on our corporate  value and shareholders joint pro ts, based on  considerations such as the purchasers business  pro le, future plans, and past investment behavior. At present there is no imminent concern that  any particular party will acquire a large amount of  Hitachis shares, and we have not established any  special measures (anti-takeover measures), should  such a purchaser appear. Nevertheless, as a natural duty to our  shareholders and investors, we constantly monitor  Hitachi share transactions and movements, and  if a party appears attempting to purchase large  amounts of shares, we will immediately take the  measures considered appropriate. Speci cally, this  will mean assessing the purchase proposal with the  assistance of external experts, as well as negotiating  with the purchaser. In addition, when such an  acquisition does not contribute to our corporate  value and the joint pro ts of shareholders, we will  promptly determine the need for and contents of  speci c countermeasures, and set up a framework  for their implementation. A similar response will  be made in the event of any attempt to purchase  large amounts of the shares of any Hitachi Group  company. 1  SRI:  Socially responsible investment, where investment funds evaluate com- panies and select stocks from a CSR perspective. 2  SAM:  Sustainable Asset Management.

We do  this to ensure that the technical and other expertise  that our people have accumulated is useful for the  development of the next generation of engineers. Providing Educational Support in Emerging Countries Emerging markets are vital to Hitachis business,  while these same markets urgently need to create  outstanding engineers and technicians to drive  national development. We provide support for the  development of young engineers and technicians in  these countries.  In India, Hitachi operates the Hindu-Hitachi  Scholarship Program in conjunction with a leading  Indian newspaper, The Hindu. Under this program,  three young engineers are invited to Japan every  year from India for six months of training in  technical skills, such as design and quality assurance  as well as in the Japanese language. Around 130  young trainees have completed this program since  it began in 1960.   To develop the next generation of leaders  in Indian manufacturing, Hitachi India is also  cooperating in the development of the Visionary  Leadership for Manufacturing Program conducted  by the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta,  the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and  the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and  sponsored by the Confederation of Indian  Industries. This program develops leaders with  a clear vision and creates strong partnerships  between industry and academia through cutting- edge research and development based on the  needs of Indias manufacturing sector. So far,  Hitachi India has held two month-long internship  programs, where students have gained a deeper  understanding of the Hitachi Group. They also  participated in a real industry project.  Hitachi will continue with these activities to help  boost the level of manufacturing technologies in  India.  Elsewhere in Asia, we have conducted the  Hitachi Young Leaders Initiative since 1996 to  off er university students from Indonesia, Japan,  Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and  Vietnam, opportunities to raise their awareness of  common issues in Asia by taking part in forums,  panel discussions and  eldwork. In  scal 2010, to  celebrate the 10th anniversary of the program, and  our own centennial, a special Alumni Forum was  organized. We brought together alumni to discuss  the theme of Driving Asia to a new paradigmâ€” what is Asias role in the global arenas? At the  opening of the forum the guest of honor, Mr. Teo  Chee Hean, Singapores Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister for Defense, spoke of his hope that the  program alumni and other promising young leaders  would make a sustained social contribution. Asias  now global importance is expected to grow still  further in the years ahead, so we will continue to  contribute to a bright future and further growth in  Asia through the development of next-generation  human resources.  Supporting Science Education We provide children with many opportunities to  learn about science and technology. Our goal is to  overcome an increasing disinterest in science, math  and technology among the young generation and  stimulate their interest and desire to learn.  Having concluded a basic agreement on  partnership and cooperation with Hitachi City,  Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, in 2009 to back the citys  drive to enhance science education, Hitachi, Ltd.  provides support for the operation of the Hitachi  Science Club, a non-pro t organization founded  in May 2009.

This  program shows children the importance of  UD from a product developers perspective.  In 2010, this program received the Minister  of State for Special Missions Outstanding  Performance Commendation in the Ninth  Barrier-Free, Universal Design Contributors  Awards sponsored by the Cabinet Offi  ce in  Japan. Since the program was launched in  2005, approximately 6,000 children from 98  schools have participated in 187 workshops.  Drawing on the experience of this  program in Japan, a similar program  has been launched, as of 2009, for  elementary school students in the United  States. Preparations are also underway  for programs in the United Kingdom  and Malaysia. This program will also be  gradually extended to other countries and  regions where the Hitachi Group operates,  helping more children understand the UD  philosophy.

The Environment  Hitachis environmental management mitigates  increasingly serious global environmental  threats and helps to achieve a more sustainable  society. In our social contribution activities  too, Group employees and members of their  families are involved in planting trees and other  environmentally conscious projects in keeping  with the two main Environmental Vision priorities:  prevention of global warming and preservation of  the ecosystem. Desert Aff orestation Volunteer Program  Since  scal 2007, Hitachi, Ltd. has been organizing  annual volunteer experience tours in conjunction  with G-Net, a non-pro t aff orestation organization  working in the Horqin Desert in Inner Mongolia,  China. This program was designed to raise  awareness of the environment and ecosystems  among Hitachi Group employees in Japan and  China and their families through their participation  in aff orestation. As well, it encourages them to  consider what they can do personally and how they  can begin to take action.  In  scal 2010, 22 peopleâ€”employees of the  Hitachi Group in Japan and China and their family  membersâ€”participated in the fourth tour, which  ran for six days from September 17. To celebrate  the International Year of Biodiversity, as well as  Hitachis 100th anniversary, one area of the desert  was designated the Hitachi Group Forest. For  the next decade, we will provide support for this  aff orestation project.

Woodland Preservation Hitachi Volunteer Seminars encourage employees  to volunteer for worthy causes. In  scal 2010, to  mark the International Year of Biodiversity, three  outdoor seminars were held in Okutama, Tokyo.  The theme was going out into local woodlands  on weekends. These woodlands are critical for  preserving local ecosystems, recharging water  resources and preventing natural disasters, but the  impact of urbanization, depopulation, and aging in  rural villages has caused woodlands to deteriorate.  To help stem this trend, Hitachi Group employees  and their families take on practical seasonal tasks,  such as cutting back summer undergrowth, autumn  thinning, and winter pruning. They learn  rsthand  the importance of preserving woodlands and the  bene ts of forests. About 100 people participated  in these three seminars.

Hitachi Group Activities in North America The Hitachi Community Action Partnership (HCAP)  is a program of The Hitachi Foundation (U.S.)  and  the Hitachi group in North America. Community  Action Committees (CACs) led by employees from  Hitachi Group companies throughout the region,  provide support for non-pro t organizations  with programs focused on local needs. Today, 40  CACs are active in North America, with employees  representing 47 business locations from 19 Group  companies. In April 2010, 16 Hitachi Consulting employees  from the southern California area volunteered  to build houses with Habitat for Humanity. This  NGO builds houses for people in need, including  victims of disasters, in 100 countries around the  world. In July, more than 7,350 employees from  28 Hitachi Group companies in North America  also took part in the 11th Annual Hitachi North  America Food Drive, a month-long food donation  campaign. They collected around 21 tons of food  and received about US$80,000 (around 6.8 million  yen) in donations. All the food and cash donations  were given to local food banks and NPOs (non- pro t organizations) in North America off ering food  programs. The total was about enough to feed  27,000 people for a week.  To improve their eff ectiveness, CACs use a self- assessment tool called the Mastering Community  Action Framework that measures their operations  and activities against clear, concrete benchmarks.  Making a Social Contribution through Sign Language For visitors with impaired hearing, Team Swan,  formed in February 2005 by Hitachi Group  employees with hearing disabilities, provides sign  language services at events around Japan. Team  Swan began with the goal of providing accurate  information through detailed explanations for the  hearing impaired, who are often left behind as  information becomes more diverse and complex.

They also hold exchange meetings with  schools for the hearing impaired. These volunteers  normally work in their departments, but say that  being able to help other people in the same  position through Team Swan has boosted their  own motivation to work. In 2010, Team Swan was  featured on The Nikkei Web site and in Shougaisha  ga Kagayaku Soshiki (Organizations Where the  Hearing Impaired Shine), a book available from  Nikkei Publishing. TOPICS Hitachi Information Academy Co., Ltd. (Hitachi  IA) is an IT training organization that operates  Smile Delivery, a program that sends Hitachi  volunteers to child care centers to teach  children basic computing skills. In June 2009,  the company launched a wish system for all  employees to suggest ideas; the Smile Delivery  program grew out of a suggestion from one  employee. In February 2009, this Hitachi IA  employeeâ€”who was participating in social  contribution evening classes1 organized by  Hitachi, Ltd.â€”heard a lecture on support for  child care institutions. She realized that if  she didnt act, nothing would change. Once  her suggestion was adopted, an email was  sent to all employees looking for volunteers.  Thirty people responded, and thanks to their  cooperation and understanding, the program  was launched in March 2010. It operates under  the auspices of Kibo-no-Ie (Hope House), a social  welfare public corporation based in Katsushika  Ward, Tokyo. Three classes have been held so far.  The children have said that it was an interesting   rst-time experience, and that it was so much  IT Education at Child Care Centers fun that they would like the volunteers to visit  again. Ms. Asami Matsuno, the person who  suggested this idea, hopes that the project  will continue,  becoming a model not just for  her own company but also for other Group  companies.  1  Social contribution evening class:  Lectures given regularly to foster the  volunteer spirit in Hitachi Group employees Asami Matsuno (right) from the Training Service Division, original  proponent of Smile Delivery, and volunteer Aoi Kozuki from the  Marketing Division  Management Report Environmental Report Social Report  Social Contribution Activities Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  113 Company  Initiative  Overview Hitachi Information Systems,  Ltd.

Yoshiyama Young Entrepreneurs Program  In  scal 2010, The Hitachi Foundation (U.S.)  launched the Yoshiyama Young Entrepreneurs  Program, the successor to the Yoshiyama Award  for Exemplary Service to the Community, which  had run since 1988, more than two decades. The  original Yoshiyama Award honored high school  seniors in the U.S. for their community service and  social change eff orts. The award included a cash  prize and participation in a four-day program that  included a commendation ceremony and leadership  training.  The new program provides young entrepreneurs  who are operating a business aimed at helping to  improve the lives of underprivileged individuals in  the United States, and who began their businesses  before they reached the age of 30. In  scal 2010,  nine young people were named Yoshiyama Young  Entrepreneurs. They represent six enterprises that  help farm and forestry workers, female immigrants,  and support underprivileged entrepreneurs. Each  enterprise received a cash prize of US$50,000  (given out over two years) as well as mentoring and  technical assistance to help grow their business.  The Hitachi Foundation looks forward to  drawing on the experiences and lessons learned  by these young entrepreneurs to address the  sustainable business practices and the role of  business in improving lives and strengthening  communities.   Support for Volunteer Activities We support employees who volunteer in three  ways: with information, time off , and funding  support. For information, we publish information  about volunteer activities at seminars and on  our intranet. In  scal 2010, we sponsored four  seminars, including three outdoors.

We augment  business units regular group training, seminars,  and video education sessions with the human rights  e-learning course that the 260,000 employees of  all 440 Group companies in Japan take once every  three years.  We collaborate with our European CSR team  to produce educational materials that include  concepts from regions where human rights  practices are advanced. We maintain a framework  to more swiftly detect and resolve internal and  external human rights violations. This framework  includes the Compliance Reporting System, a sexual  harassment consultation system, and employee  awareness surveys. We strive to identify human  rights risks globally through regular management  and business risk assessments.  Applying Human Rights Worldwide  We have developed educational programs and  management best practices in Europe, which we  believe is the most advanced in addressing human  rights and business. We intend to apply these  programs and practices worldwide as a global  enterprise to ensure that Hitachi Group employees  and businesses consistently respect human rights. Our European CSR team collaborated with  European Group companies to launch a human  rights project. We follow the work of Professor John  Ruggie, Special Representative of the Secretary- General of the United Nations on business and  human rights, and support his framework, Protect,  Respect and Remedy. The work during the early  stages of the project is setting up Hitachi in Europe  to implement the framework across its businesses.  We are educating employees on human rights,  ensuring that all relevant standards and policies are  up to date, and establishing business speci c action  plans.  Sixty percent of senior management-level  employees at European Group companies  completed Senior Manager training in  scal 2010.  In March 2011, Hitachi Europe, Ltd. conducted  a stakeholder dialogue on human rights with  representatives from the European Commission,  international bodies, national governments, and  nongovernment organizations. Executives from  Hitachi, Ltd. attended this gathering. We gained  valuable insights into the human rights activities  that the Hitachi Group must consider in global  business activities.

We will share global  supply chain issues within the Group and reinforce  procurement in line with the Hitachi Guidelines for  Procurement Activities. One priority in the 2012 Mid-Term  Management Plan is to expand our global  procurement ratio, particularly by stepping  up purchasing in emerging nations. This  will reinforce our global competitiveness  and operational foundation. For global  procurement, we respect the human rights  and the basic work rights of everyone in the  supply chain. We collaborate with suppliers  in promoting CSR by sharing guidelines and  communicating proactively.  Promoting Globalization Using the 2012 Mid-Term Management Plan, we  intend to raise the Groups global procurement  ratio from 36 percent to 50 percent by  scal  2012. We therefore formulated the Hitachi Group  Medium-Term Procurement Strategic Plan. The  key aims are to establish global partnerships to  create Group procurement strategies, to stabilize  the supply of materials, and to reinforce CSR and  sustainability within the supply chain. In order to  accelerate these Group-wide activities, we set up  the Global Procurement Promotion Department  within the Corporate Procurement Division to boost  the global procurement ratio. We are continuing to  reinforce our responsiveness to CSR risk, a growing  concern as the global supply chain expands.

We strive to  maintain and reinforce mutual understanding  and trust over the long term. We also employ  worldwide perspectives, choosing suppliers in line  with the principles of free competition and equal  opportunity. One special priority is to cultivate  and expand the pool of suppliers in the emerging  nations that we have positioned as major markets. Following a 2009 initiative, we dispatched  another team in October 2010 to seek new  suppliers in Vietnam. We gathered information  from the Japan External Trade Organization and  other countries trade bodies on companies that  were the focus of our research. We are reinforcing  procurement in Southeast Asia, China, South  Korea, India, and Eastern Europe to build our Social  Innovation Business. We also set up a procurement  unit in Brazil in April 2010 to broaden our South  American supplier network. Helping Create International Guidelines  As a founding member of the advisory group for  the United Nations Global Compact on Sustainable  Supply Chains, we support initiatives to build and  foster sustainable supply chains that follow UN  principles on human rights, labor, the environment,  and anti-corruption. In  scal 2010, we helped  formulate guidelines on supply chain sustainability,  supply chain Web sites, and on-line assessment  and study tools for organizations participating  in the UN Global Compact. We will keep serving  as an opinion leader by supporting these UN  activities, drawing on our expertise from our global  operations in dealing with  sustainability issues, such  as human rights and the  environment. Sharing CSR Awareness  In  scal 2009, we produced the Hitachi Group  Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook,  which conforms to the guidelines of the Japan  Electronics and Information Technology Industries  Association. We distributed this publication both  throughout the Group and to our suppliers.

For requirements (1) through (4), we present case studies of initiatives  that have bene ted both the environment and  suppliers because they have cut costs and improved  product functionality. For requirement (5), we specify  the chemicals used in products from suppliers and  have them register those substances in the Green  Procurement System.  Helping Build Environmental Management  Systems To promote green procurement, we ask suppliers  to develop environmental management systems  that third parties can certify. Suppliers with these  certi cations become Green Suppliers. With these  Green Suppliers, we launched the New MMM  Club,1 where members exchange information on  advanced environmental technologies, regulations,  and outstanding environmental initiatives by  suppliers. We will continue to encourage suppliers  to lower environmental risk and costs, while we  keep building win-win relationships with these  suppliers through green procurement. Orientation on REACH1 Compliance  Hitachi, Ltd. business sites and Group companies  held a supplier orientation on REACH compliance.  To ensure compliance with Europes REACH  regulations, they focused on surveys of chemical  substances in products. Suppliers found the event stimulating.

Promoting Green Purchasing We are improving our green purchasing  rateâ€”the ratio of environmentally conscious  products purchased to total offi  ce suppliesâ€”by  using a Group-wide online purchasing system,  the e-sourcingMall. This system has a range of  environmentally conscious products. It promotes  purchasing by clearly labeling these products. For   scal 2010, our green purchasing rate reached 95  percent, clearing the years goal of 90 percent. Response to Con ict Minerals1 Issue The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act was signed into law in the United  States in July 2010. One provision under the Act  obliges companies with securities registered in the  U.S. that use in their products any con ict minerals  produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo  (the DRC) and adjoining countries (together the  DRC countries) to report this to the U.S. Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC). The aim of the  provision is to cut off  revenues from armed groups  that are engaged in violence and other serious  breaches of human rights in the con ict-ridden  DRC countries. Pursuant to the Act, the SEC plans to  promulgate regulations requiring that companies  using any con ict minerals in their products disclose  in their annual reports whether these con ict  minerals originated in the DRC countries.  Hitachi is committed to the pursuit of  responsible procurement practices and has no  intention, directly or indirectly, of abetting the  human rights violations identi ed in the DRC  1  REACH regulation: Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of  Chemicals (EU) 1  The MMM Club is an organization run primarily by suppliers who have  acquired environmental certi cation through Hitachis activities to support  their environmental programs.

Month As part of the Diversity Development Project, we  are improving  employees work-life balance. In  November 2010, we held the Work-Life Balance-up!  Month (WLB-up! Month) throughout the company  to increase awareness and understanding of how  we support work-life balance. At the start of the  month, a message from the president was sent  out, and a pamphlet was distributed outlining  child care and nursing care support programs  and how to use them. Other steps included  delivering a mail magazine, calls for senryu (satirical  poetry) submissions, and release of the WLB-up!  Declaration.1 Individual companies and offi  ces  also had their own campaigns geared to their  particular circumstances. Employees reported back  that the campaign was easy to understand, and  that they would like it to keep going. To meet these  expectations, we will continue, as well as improve,  these programs. We have a range of initiatives that help us  become a company that develops employees  abilities or ideas and empowers them to  realize their potential. We are committed to  creating an attractive work environment by, for  example, appointing more female managers,  and improving child and nursing care support.  Diversity Development Project We launched the Diversity & Inclusion Development  Project in  scal 2006 to encourage a good work- life balance. Initiatives within the program include  developing and enhancing support for employees  in balancing work with child care or nursing care  for family members. We also advance women in the  workplace through the strategic development of  female managers and a proactive hiring policy, in  line with our goal of ultimately achieving an equal  ratio of males and females in key management  positions.  In addition, we continue to educate and raise  the awareness of employees. We are expanding our  training options to include courses on deepening  understanding of diversity management as well as  courses that employ corporate lectures and World  Caf-style dialogues.  In May 2010, we received the Corporate Prize  in the Best Mother Awards held by the NPO Japan  Mothers Society in recognition of our programs.

Employees families were invited to the  headquarters offi  ce on a holiday to see the  place where their family members work,  to learn about Hitachis history and to eat  in the cafeteria. The goal was to deepen  the families understanding and empathy  toward employees jobs and encourage a  sense of pride and satisfaction for working  at Hitachi.  On that day in December, 180 people  from 56 families came to the offi  ce, getting  an up-close look at workplaces and learning  about our company.

Hitachi Group  companies in Europe have undertaken the  European Human Rights and Diversity Project  as one way of addressing the priority issue of  human rights, promoting equal opportunity and  eliminating all forms of discrimination.  According to a survey conducted by Hitachi  Group companies in Europe in  scal 2010, the ratio  of Group female employees, including managers,  was below the average of other European  companies.  To boost diversity awareness among all  employees at Hitachi Group companies in Europe,  the European Human Rights and Diversity Project  team developed an e-learning program available  in English, French, German and Italian that was  distributed to all Group companies in Europe. The  aim is to educate 80 percent of employees by the  end of  scal 2011.  In the coming years, Group companies will track  the goals and ratios for gender in employment and  management positions, and Hitachi Europe Ltd. too  is looking at appointing female executives by the  end of  scal 2013. These activities have been welcomed in Europe  and have been presented at the Enterprise 2020  MarketPlace of CSR Europe and other international  conferences. VOICES Internship Program for Female Athletes  Lisa Dearborn Senior Director, Diversity, College  Programs, and Communications Hitachi Data Systems Hitachi Data Systems is launching a program  in the United States that focuses on recruiting  college women who are athletes: the Womens  Athletic Intern Program (WAIP). The motivation  for WAIP is simple: to be successful in their  chosen sport while attending top colleges,  athletes must possess a winning combination  of teamwork skills, competitiveness, time  management, and determination. These are  attributes that the company seeks in recruiting  new employees. For the pilot program,  10 women athletes are being selected for  internships from top colleges in the area,  including Stanford and Santa Clara University,  and will receive development and mentoring  speci cally tailored for the program. Hitachi Data Systems is focusing not only on  recruitment of women with winning attributes  but on leadership development. Its Womens  Leadership Network (WLN) begins its fourth  year in 2011 and has continued to expand its  activities and membership. In addition, the  company hand selects women managers with  high potential for participation in the year-long  Women Unlimited leadership programs.

When I started my career in 2004 at Hitachi  Power Europe GmbH in Germany, we were  only 4 female professionals out of some 300  employeesâ€“until today this did not change  fundamentally.  I am grateful that I not only had the  chance to start my career in this male-driven  surrounding but was also promoted to lead a  core department in our companyâ€”as a woman.  The necessary improvement from a quantitative  view is with the company until today. From  the quality side it is with our society, which is  often not used to women in technology-driven  companies and/or executive positions. Therefore I would advise all women, who  currently have to decide where to apply for a  job, not to leave out companies such as Hitachi,  which might not be known as typical female,  but which grants great chancesâ€“as I might be  the perfect proof for.  Balancing a Ful lling Job and Family Ms. Hua Ping Chief Representative/ Shared  Services / Human Resources Hitachi GST China Operations As a woman leader, especially an Asian woman,  I think family is in equal importance with career.  How to balance our work and life is usually one  of the biggest challenges women leaders have. I would say Hitachi GST does a good job  at diversity. There are a number of excellent  women leaders in our company who are  making important business decisions and  who are involved in the companys strategic  planning and development. At our China sites,  nearly half of our management teams are  women. We do not feel any gender barriers  in promotions nor other career advancement  opportunities. Flexible working schedules  and locations in some positions which do not  impact business delivery will further support  womens career development by providing  them more  exibility in arranging job and  family issues.  Bearing a positive mindset, maintaining our  professionalism and try as much as we can to  manage self-emotions at all times, especially  when handling tough situations, can always  help us mitigate the stress from work and  achieve success. Enjoy your work and enjoy  your life as well.

After  working for two years on launching research  projects and building research teams, I was  promoted to the position of research laboratory  director. Looking back a few years, I think I  was able to advance this far thanks to Hitachis  corporate culture of giving opportunities to  employees regardless of gender. As research laboratory director, I was in a  position to foster young researchers. Based  on my own experience, when I was hiring  researchers or instructing them, I placed priority  on their abilities. I realize that men and women  of course diff er in certain respects, but I think  it is more important to understand the unique  characteristics of each individual and provide  opportunities for them to realize their full  potential. In addition, rather than attempting  to foster the same kind of human resources in  the organization, I try to bring together people  with diff erent abilities and diverse personalities  in order to bring innovation into our research.  I will continue to strive to foster the human  resources who will be the future of Hitachi.  Management Report Environmental Report Social Report  Diversity Management Hitachi Group Sustainability Report 2011 http://www.hitachi.com/csr/  129 Employing People with Disabilities We employ around 3,000 disabled people in a  broad range of areas. To help them adapt to work  environments, we have taken actions geared to  their particular needs. These include installing  magnifying reading devices, computers with speech  recognition, and warning lights for those with  hearing impairments.  There are also four special subsidiaries within  the Hitachi Group where 200 or so disabled or  challenged employees perform tasks such as  collecting and distributing internal mail, offi  ce  cleaning, and clerical work. In  scal 2010, those  in charge of employing disabled people came  together for information exchange meetings,  workshops, visits to special support schools,  and other events. The goal was to deepen their  understanding of disabilities. We have also  collaborated on the employment of disabled  workers with Public Employment Security Offi  ces  by holding a Hitachi Group job fair for disabled  jobseekers.  In June 2010, the employment ratio of people  with disabilities was 2.05 percent at Hitachi, Ltd.  and 1.88 percent as a consolidated domestic Group  company. This reached the legally mandated ratio  of 1.8 percent. We are committed to creating even  more employment opportunities. Model Project for Promoting the Employment of People with Mental Disabilities  We have a number of programs that create  attractive environments for people with mental  disabilities. These are part of our two year  commitment, from May 2009, to the Ministry of  Health, Labour and Welfare to undertake a model  project entitled Promoting the Employment of  People with Mental Disabilities. Key measures  include creating work geared to the particular  kind of disability, promoting understanding in the  workplace, and training natural supporters with  whom employees can feel comfortable consulting  on workplace issues. Within the workplace, we  have assigned psychiatric social workers to manage  the health of mentally disabled employees and  provide them with advice. We are also using special  training and group work to ensure healthy work  for people with mental disabilities and how to  develop smooth personal relationships. This project  has led to the employment of new employees with  mental disabilities since  scal 2009 and six have  joined the company as of March 2011. Hitachi  has also adopted a  exible work system that has  the new employees gradually building up from  three four-hour days per week. One employee  commented that Hitachi was the  rst place where  he had been able to continue working for more  than a year, while another was grateful that there  was someone close at hand to provide advice. We  will report on these results to Group companies and  other companies to help promote understanding  and recognition of the employment of people with  mental disabilities. Source: Hitachi, Ltd.

By matching the positions that  applicants want with where we need staff , we are  increasing both the satisfaction of new hires and  the quality of our human resources.  For hiring outside Japan, we are prioritizing  regions and jobs with an eye on establishing  common Hitachi Group hiring practices, in  cooperation with head offi  ces in each region. Global Education for Young Employees We are considering several ways of strategically  securing and training people who will thrive in  the global business arena. For young employees  in particular, we have created programs that  include practical training outside Japan,  eldwork,  and overseas language study. By giving these  employees the opportunity to experience life in  other countries, we will equip them to handle  the challenges of globalization. We are currently  developing programs to send young employees  outside Japan from  scal 2011 so that they can  acquire not just language skills but experience  working with a variety of people. Along with the  business experience they will receive, they will  grow to understand local cultures and lifestyles   rsthand. We plan to send 2,000 employees outside  Japan through these programs by the end of  scal  2012. We consider speaking English an essential  skill for global business, so we will strengthen  English language training for future leaders, with a  particular emphasis on global business. To deepen overseas employees understanding  of Hitachi and of Japan, we are also systematically  increasing opportunities for high-potential  employees to work in Japan.  Global Manager Training With our operations taking on an increasingly  global focus, it is necessary that all managers  working on the global frontlines to understand  our history, founding spirit, company operations,  Because we believe that maximizing employee  potential is vital for creating new value, we  work hard to improve employees abilities and  to develop their careers. Given the accelerating  pace of globalization, we urgently need to  develop leaders capable of competing in the  global arena. We are pushing ahead with a  range of initiatives to enhance and expand our  global business.  Aligning Hiring with Global Business To globalize more eff ectively, we have identi ed  eight key qualities for global human resources.  These include the ability to see from the other  partys perspective and the ability to communicate  clearly. These key qualities are being used in  the selection of new employees from the 2012  graduate pool. We approach hiring with the goal  of having all new graduates move into global  business at sometime in the future. This includes  new graduates hired in Japan for offi  ce jobs and  50 percent of those hired for engineering jobs. We  also intend to have foreign students make up 10  percent of our new graduate intake.

To instill this understanding,  we provide a four-day course called Global  Fundamental Courseâ€”Ready to Inspire, which  off ers the same training to all Hitachi managers  around the world.  Since  scal 2006, when it was launched, this  course has been taken by approximately 1,369  managers. We plan to continue to off er this course  from  scal 2011 on, while broadening the regions  and personnel covered, as well as improving the  training methods.   Training Future Managers To compete with the worlds top companies in the  years ahead, Hitachi Group managers will have to  create their own business models as well as develop  and manage the methods to achieve them. We  intend to off er intensive business training courses  to help them reach their goals. Business training  for managers within Japan has been completely  revamped, and we plan to have around 4,000  staff  take the new training courses. In addition to  training managers for a global leadership styleâ€”  identifying a vision, motivating, and providing  clear feedbackâ€”senior management candidates  in particular will learn strategic business planning  and leadership over a six-month period through  weeklong sessions taught in English with  eldwork  outside Japan. We also provide opportunities  for discussions between talented non-Japanese  employees and executives at Hitachi headquarters,  and they are given training in Japan to help  them build networks and groom them for senior  management positions.  HITACHI BASIS We have speci ed the HITACHI BASIS as a common  basic education platform for sharing our Corporate  Credo, work approach, and way of thinking with  all Hitachi Group companies worldwide. On that  foundation, we operate a two-tiered employee  education system that uses human resource  development tailored to the needs of individual  business  elds and regions. As of  scal 2010, we have begun evaluating  the eff ectiveness of education in the main Group  companies. As part of the HITACHI BASIS initiative,  we also took the opportunity of Hitachis centennial  to develop Discover Hitachi, a program targeting  Group employees worldwide that reaffi  rms our  history, Hitachi Founding Spirit, management  policies and business operations. Training System We have supplemented in-house educationâ€”based  on on-the-job trainingâ€”with an extensive training  system consisting of a number of educational  programs: Management Development, Education  for Engineers, Production Worker Training,  Education for Globalization, Sales Education, and  Training by Job Function. These programs are  off ered across the Hitachi Group by the Hitachi  Institute of Technology, the Hitachi Institute of  MONOZUKURI Skills and Engineering, and the  Hitachi Institute of Management Development as  common Group educational courses. During  scal  2010, 22,666 Hitachi Group employees took these  training courses. Other kinds of training are provided by diff erent  companies and offi  ces.

Reports on best practices and new  measures learned from serious mishaps in the  past were followed by vigorous discussions that  stimulated health and safety activities across the  Group as a whole.  At the same time, health and safety levels  within the Group are far from perfect, with serious  accidents continuing to occur.

Basic Attitudes to HIV/AIDS Since 1995, Hitachi, Ltd. has promoted an  understanding within the Hitachi Group of HIV/ AIDS based on the following three points: Mental Health Care Ensuring physical and mental health is another  key priority. To enable every employee to work in  a healthy environment, we consult with health  insurance associations and other groups to  maintain high levels of employee health.

This small, light, battery-operated device  is attached to the wrist and records the  wearers movements as well as pulse, body  temperature, and other information. As this  device can capture detailed, objective data,  such as levels of activity and sleep periods,  we may use it to support the return to work  of people who took leave for mental health  issues. Worn when someone is preparing  to return to the workplace, and then for a  period after their return, the information  obtained can be used as reference data  for consultations with industrial doctors,  for example. This device is proving to be  eff ective as a tool to support the return to  work. We will increase the number of trial  subjects before full-scale practical use.
