The more favourable climate  for paperboard and sawn timber as well  as good conditions for Holmen Skog and  Holmen Energi made a positive contribution  to our progress. Despite this, the year ended  with a decrease in earnings due to the sub- stantial deterioration in earnings at Holmen  Paper, resulting from low newsprint prices  combined with high costs of recovered fibre.   In light of the weak result for 2010 and  major investment commitments ahead but a  stable financial situation in spite of this, the  Board proposes an unchanged dividend of  SEK 7 per share.  our products  Demand for newsprint in Europe rose some- what towards the end of the year, but was  weak for the year as a whole. The demand  was about 15 per cent lower than the peak  level achieved in 2006. Through exports  outside Europe, capacity utilisation in the  industry stayed at a relatively high level.  The very low profitability during the year is  mainly a result of sales prices, which were  dramatically lower for newsprint in 2010  than in 2009.  Newsprint will continue to be a key prod- uct for Holmen, but we are seeing growing  evidence that our focus on niche products is  a step in the right direction. Demand is rising  most in our MF Magazine product area, in  which we increased our deliveries. The intro- duction of our new products was well received  in the market. We consider that customers  who buy magazine paper will increasingly  look for alternative products in order to cut  their costs in competition with other media.  The past year was positive for our  paperboard operation, with price rises for  both folding boxboard and solid bleached  board. Greater demand and higher capacity  utilisation teamed with an improved sales  mix contributed to an excellent result. Our  concentration on more demanding products  reinforces our position as a leading supplier  of paperboard for consumer products. This  focus is important for the continued develop- ment of the business.   The harsh winters of recent years have  entailed production disruptions and delays  in deliveries of sawn timber. Price increases  contributed to improved earnings, while the  market in Europe was hesitant towards the  end of 2010 due to the general economic  situation and because the expected upturn in  construction activities had not yet taken off.  The new sawmill at Braviken was commis- sioned at the turn of 2010/2011. The facility  complements our other operations well and  makes Holmen a complete supplier of sawn  timber products. The aim is to increase  volume substantially in coming years. A high  level of productivity in large-scale facilities is  a key strategy for Holmen. our raw materials operations Strong demand for timber and pulpwood at  attractive prices generated high earnings from  our forest assets. We also harvested a great  deal in our own forests, which is a com- pletely natural strategy when prices are high.  Substantial purchases of wood were made,  partly to meet the future needs for spruce  saw timber at the new sawmill, at which the  Dear shareholder  3 Holmen Annual report 2010 supply plan has proved effective. The work  to boost growth in our forests through new  silviculture measures progressed during the  year. We started work on producing an inven- tory of our forest holdings, which will form  the basis of a new harvesting plan that will be  drawn up in 2011.  The recovered paper market gradually  grew stronger during the year and prices rose  continually. This had a very adverse impact  on costs, particularly in Spain. The underly- ing variation in one of our most significant  cost components is the reason why we are  aiming to secure shorter pricing periods in  contracts with newsprint customers.   Holmen Energi achieved its  best earnings of all time,  which is largely attribut- able to high electric- ity prices, but also to  increased production.  Our peat production  operation is ongoing –  albeit still on a modest  scale – alongside hydro  power, our largest  source of income. Wind  surveys for wind power  on our own land took place  throughout the year and are  now being followed by applica- tions for permits. Holmen benefits from  electricity generated by wind power by being  one of the owners of the company VindIn  AB. The wind farm inaugurated at Skutskr  in 2009 has produced positive results.  Sweden was hit by another cold winter,  and electricity prices climbed to levels that  rendered paper production impossible dur- ing the hours when the price peaked. This  cannot be completely counteracted using the  long-term contracts we have as a basis for our  operations. Intermittent production as a result  of variations in electricity prices also affected  total productivity, mainly for Holmen Paper.  Lower costs and improved   operations Further reductions of the workforce at   Hallsta Paper Mill were announced dur- ing the year; about 150 employees were  given their notice, the aim being to lower  fixed costs. By adapting one of the paper  machines, PM 11, we increased potential for  further development of our MF Magazine  products.  The number of employees at the mill in  Madrid was reduced during the autumn.  A survey of PM 61, the smaller of the two  paper machines, was conducted in paral- lel. The mill, at which production is based  entirely on recovered paper, was hit hard by  the rising prices of raw materials and a weak  domestic market for printing paper. During  the autumn, temporary lay-offs and long  production stoppages were implemented  with the aim of stabilising the situation. At  the beginning of 2011 we decided to shut  down PM 61, which had been running at a  loss for a long time. The modern newsprint  machine still in operation has good potential  of being profitable.  The change that took place at Iggesund  Paperboard at the end of 2009, when one of  the board machines at Workington Mill was  shut down, proved successful. The objec- tives of greater competitiveness  through lower fixed costs and  a switch to a higher quality  segment in which we also  increased capacity, were  achieved. Investment and  development One of the most impor- tant decisions made dur- ing the year was to invest  in a new recovery boiler  and turbine at Iggesund  Mill. This bolsters Holmens  sustainability focus and constitutes  the major step in our plan to modernise  the mills pulp and energy supplies, putting  the plant in a position to become self- sufficient in electricity without the use of any  fossil fuels. The installation is under way and  is one of Swedens largest current industrial  investments. The equipment is due to be  commissioned in June 2012.  Apart from the major sawmill and recovery  boiler projects, investments were kept at a  limited level – particularly at Holmen Paper.  Via the Holmen Biorefinery Development  Centre, a unit set up in 2009, we are work- ing on identifying new profitable business  based on forest raw material, as well as  residual and by-products. Several promis- ing projects are being conducted, meaning  that we will be seeing other products from  the forest besides paper and paperboard in  the not too distant future. Biogas produced  through anaerobic digestion of our waste- water is an interesting possibility. Sustainability – part of everyday  operations This is the first annual report in which we  have included an extensive section on our  sustainability activities. Such activities are  regarded as a natural part of our everyday  work, and Holmen meets the requirements  for the highest sustainability reporting  level, GRI A+. We also attract considerable  positive attention in the world around us.  Holmen features in several international  corporate indexes and environmental funds  that value companies from a sustainabil- ity perspective, and that aim to make it  easier for investors and other stakeholders  to identify companies that run ambitious  sustainability activities. Our commitment to  and membership of the UN Global Compact  is an important starting point. This means  that Holmen takes a clear stance on issues  concerning human rights, social and environ- mental responsibility and the right to form  trade unions.  My ambition is naturally also for Holmen  to be known as a company that has a good  HR policy and that offers its employees  stimu lating tasks. We therefore attach sub- stantial importance to improving leadership.  outlook The conditions for growth in profit are  favourable in 2011. Ongoing price nego- tiations for newsprint in Europe indicate  significant increases, although the demand  trend is difficult to estimate.   The market for paperboard remains good,  and implemented price rises should have an  impact on profit during 2011. For sawn tim- ber, supply currently exceeds demand, which  risks putting pressure on prices. The commis- sioning of the new sawmill at Braviken will  initially have an adverse impact on earnings.  Wood prices remain high, which may mean  another good year for Holmen Skog, while  Holmens industrial operations continue to  feel the burden of the high cost of wood. The  level in the water reservoirs is lower than  usual, which will negatively affect the com- panys production of hydro power during the  first few months of the year.  For several years, Holmen has taken tough  measures to arrive at its current position as  a strong, highly competitive company that  has good potential to develop its business.  I would like to highlight all employees at  Holmen who have contributed in various  ways to the future-focused, yet also difficult,  changes that have characterised the past year.  Thanks to their efforts, we are now stronger  as we enter a new phase in our development.

The result for printing paper operations fell considerably, while profitability in the other parts of  the Group improved. The years investments amounted to SEK 1 597 million and mainly com- prised the new sawmill at Braviken and a new recovery boiler and turbine at Iggesund Mill.  Net financial debt increased by SEK 89 million, to SEK 5 772 million. At year-end, the debt/ equity ratio was 0.34 (0.34). The Board proposes an unchanged dividend of SEK 7 per share. tough year for printing paper Falling prices and high recovered fibre costs entailed a loss in Holmens printing paper   operation. Strong growth for paperboard Demand for paperboard was robust and it was possible to introduce several price rises.  Profit doubled. High prices for wood and electricity Strong demand for pulpwood and timber boosted prices to historically high levels, and earn- ings from the companys own forests were very high. Electricity prices were periodically also  very high, leading to good results for Holmens own hydro power. Investment in recovery boiler In the spring, Holmen decided to invest in a new recovery boiler and turbine at Iggesund Mill.  This doubles the mills production of electricity, and the production of pulp can gradually be  increased. This SEK 2.3 billion investment is one of the largest current industrial investments  in Sweden and makes it possible to run the operation without using fossil fuels and pur- chased electrical energy. New sawmill The construction of Braviken Sawmill kept to schedule and production started at the turn  of 2010/2011. Construction using wood has a positive climate impact. The new sawmill, a  billion-kronor investment largely made of wood, will be the largest and most modern sawmill  in Scandinavia. Measures at Holmen paper Holmen Paper is implementing further efficiency improvements and measures to maintain a  high level of competitiveness and improve profitability. Holmen VIEW, a new grade of paper  for magazines and catalogues, was launched. Negotiations were started about cutting staff  by 150 people at Hallsta Paper Mill. At the beginning of 2011, Holmen decided to shut down  PM 61, the smaller of the two paper machines at the mill in Madrid. This machine accounts  for just under 10 per cent of the business areas production capacity. About 170 people are  affected. Wind power investment Wind power surveys are under way on Holmens land in Hallstavik and rnskldsvik. The  process is continuing with applications for permits. Expansion via the partly owned wind  power company VindIn is progressing. GrI A+ All of Holmens information on sustainability was audited by an external party for the first time.  Holmens reporting achieved A+ according to the guidelines issued by the Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI) for sustainability reporting.

Holmens manufacturing operations in the  product-oriented areas are based on renew- able raw materials from sustainably managed  forests. The Holmen Paper business area  manu factures printing paper for daily newspa- pers, magazines, catalogues, directories/manu- als, advertising print and books. The paper  is manufactured at two mills in Sweden and  one in Spain. Iggesund Paperboard produces  board for consumer packaging and graphics  printing at one mill in Sweden and one in the  UK. Holmen Timber produces sawn timber at  two Swedish sawmills.   Holmen Skog is responsible for managing  and developing the Groups land holdings,  which comprise around 1.3 million hectares  – of which 1 million are used for forestry.  The normal annual volume of wood har- vested in company forests is some   2.5 million cubic metres.  Holmen Energi is in charge of the Groups  hydro power production and of developing  energy-related operations. During a normal  year, hydro power production amounts to  around 1 100 GWh.   Holmens forest and energy assets are  highly valuable to the company, helping to  give it a stable foundation. In addition to  generating even and high earnings, they cre- ate advantages in supplying raw materials to  the product-oriented business areas. Forest  raw materials and the energy area also have  immense development potential. The Group  is about 60 per cent self-sufficient in wood,  and self-sufficiency in electricity is around   30 per cent. A significant proportion of the  thermal energy required is covered by bioen- ergy produced at the companys own facilities.  The Group has five production plants in  Sweden and one each in the UK and Spain.  The forests and hydro power facilities are  located in Sweden. Around 90 per cent of  sales take place in Europe via Holmens own  sales companies.  Holmens two classes of shares are listed  in the Large Cap segment on the Nasdaq  OMX Nordic Exchange. Holmen is a forest industry group that manufactures printing paper, paperboard   and sawn timber and runs forestry and energy production operations. The com- panys  extensive forest holdings and its high proportion of energy production are  strategically important resources that reinforce Holmens position and future growth.  Holmen in brief  the production process RAW MATERIALS Pulp Wet section Press section Drier Paper/board This highly simplified diagram illustrates the production process  in a paper and board machine. In reality, the machines differ  quite significantly. The raw materials consist mainly of wood  and/or recovered paper, electricity and chemicals. The pulp,  produced by chemical or mechanical means, passes along a  web in the machine – firstly through a wet section, then a press  section and finally the paper/board is dried on the web, which  at that stage runs between numerous cylinders. It is finally rolled  on reels and cut to the reel or sheet sizes that the customers  have ordered.

Holmen Annual report 2010 8 BUSINeSS CoNCept  product-oriented business areas Holmen Paper manufactures printing paper  for daily newspapers, magazines, catalogues,  directories/manuals, advertising print and  books at two mills in Sweden and one in  Spain. Just under half of sales comprise niche  products in the areas of improved newsprint,  directory paper and book paper, where the  market share in Europe is 27 per cent. The  greater part of other sales is made up of  standard newsprint, with a market share of  8 per cent in Europe. Holmen Paper has a  strong position among European newspa- per publishers, who account for more than  half its sales. Retailers, printers and book,  catalogue and directory/manual publishers  are examples of other significant customer  segments.  Iggesund Paperboard produces paper- board for consumer packaging and graphics  printing at one Swedish and one UK mill. Ig- gesund Paperboard is a market leader in the  top quality segments in Europe. The market  share in Europe for paperboard based on  solid bleached board and folding box board  is 15 per cent. The largest customer segment  consists of converters who make consumer  packaging. Wholesalers and printers who  buy board for graphics products are also key  customers.  Holmen Timber produces sawn timber  at two Swedish sawmills that are integrated  with the Groups paperboard and printing  paper production, respectively. Braviken  Sawmill was commissioned at the turn of  2010/2011 and produces spruce construction  timber for the building sector. The sawmill  at Iggesund uses pine as its raw material  and focuses on joinery products for exposed  applications. The main markets are Europe,  North Africa and the Middle East. Holmen  Timber is a relatively small operator in Eu- rope and has a market share of less than one  per cent for sawn timber. raw-material-oriented   business areas Holmen Skog has responsibility for manag- ing and developing the Groups forest assets.  The companys forest holdings amount to  one million hectares of productive forest  land in Sweden and the volume of wood  amounts to 120 million m3  standing volume.  Sales take place to sawmills and paper and  pulp producers in Sweden. Holmen Skog is  also responsible for supplying wood to the  Groups Swedish industrial facilities.  Holmen Energi manages the Groups  hydro power assets and develops the Groups  energy operations. Hydro power produc- tion during a normal year amounts to 1.1  TWh and the power is sold in the Swedish  electricity market. Holmen Energi is also re- sponsible for supplying the Groups Swedish  industrial operations with electricity. StrAteGY  Development and quality Holmen operates on large, well-established  markets, namely its product markets for  paper, paperboard and sawn timber, and its  raw materials markets for wood and energy.  The Groups strategic focus is to expand, to  develop and to remain a strong supplier with  efficient production. Most of the growth is  organic and takes place by improving prod- ucts and/or increasing production volumes in  existing product areas.  Holmens business concept is to grow and develop and to run profit- able and sustainable business within three product-oriented busi- ness areas for printing paper, paperboard and sawn timber, as well  as within two raw-material-oriented business areas for forest and  energy. Europe is the main market.

Strategy: Grow and develop our ve business areas PRODUCT-ORIENTED RAW-MATERIAL-ORIENTED 25 per cent higher growth rate in Holmens forests in 30 years  time.  Holmen Annual report 2010 9  Development also necessitates reor- ganisation and the closure of unprofitable  production facilities – measures that have  characterised Holmen Paper in recent years.  Production of standard newsprint has  decreased. Instead, more advanced grades of  paper have been developed. Iggesund Paper- board has adapted production to prioritise  top-quality paperboard. Sawn timber is con- tinually developed in close cooperation with  customers and specialised subcontractors.  The new Braviken Sawmill is an efficient  and technologically advanced sawmill for  construction timber.  Holmens own wood and energy produc- tion is continually developing and expand- ing. The silviculture measures taken are  expected to result in gradual increases in  annual wood production (harvesting) to  achieve a rise of 20 per cent in 40 years  time. Good potential is also expected for in- creasing the growth rate in the Groups for- ests by roughly 25 per cent in 30 years time  through improved silviculture. This will lead  to higher harvesting levels in the future. In  production of energy, the company believes  that there is real potential for developing  new, profitable production of wind power  and biofuel. The aim is to be able to produce  1 TWh of electricity from wind power per  year. productivity and profitability The overall ambition of the Groups opera- tions is to provide a customer offering that  contains attractive, high-quality products as  well as good service. This is to be done cost- effectively to maintain Holmens position as  a competitive supplier. Large-scale, efficient  production facilities and skilled employees  create high productivity and efficient use of  input goods and capital. Effective interac- tion between marketing, product develop- ment and production increases is essential  to achieve successful long-term investments,  economies of scale and development. Basic  volumes of certain products are combined  with selective ventures involving improved  or more advanced products for both existing  and new categories of customers.  Alongside efficient production processes,  the cost of raw materials and transport has  an important impact on competitiveness.  The main raw materials in the processes for  producing printing paper, paperboard and  sawn timber are fibre in the form of wood,  recovered paper and pulp, and energy in  the form of electricity and heat. Holmen  produces more than 95 per cent of the pulp  and thermal energy that it requires at its  own mills using a highly integrated process.  The procurement of other raw materials is  underpinned through backward integration  along the production chain by owning forests,  hydro power plants and recovered-paper  procurement units. The Group is around   60 per cent self-sufficient in wood. The Group  produces around 30 per cent of the electrical  energy that it requires. Moreover, the prices  of 50 per cent of the electricity supplies are  hedged through long-term supply contracts.  Significant volumes of recovered paper are  purchased via wholly and partly owned  paper collection companies. Sustainability Aspects of sustainability are an integral part  of all decisions made at Holmen. This brings  the company closer to its set goals every day.  Holmen is essentially already part of the  sustainable society through its operations, by  being a successful and profitable company  that manufactures products from natural  raw materials. The raw materials – wood  and recovered paper – and the products are  recyclable and adapted to the ecocycle.   Healthy profitability and a strong financial  position are key factors that create conditions  for development that is sustainable in the  long term. This in turn creates employment  opportunities and makes it possible to buy  input goods, pay taxes and pay a return to  Holmens owners and financiers. Profitability  is also a prerequisite for investments that  allow the company to evolve in line with  gradual changes in market conditions. In this  way, Holmens financial targets support long- term and sustainable financial growth.  The Group is a participant in the UNs  Global Compact and thus supports interna- tional guidelines relating to human rights,  social conditions, the environment and  labour rights. Holmen is to respect ethical  and social standards, be a good business  partner and community player, and motivate  and develop its employees through commit- ted leadership.

The main emphasis is on  skills supply, leadership and organisation.  The goals for the HR work focus on devel- oping leadership, the organisation and em- ployees. To reach these goals, various types  of measures are implemented, and the devel- opment programme Manager at  Holmen was  one such measure implemented in 2010. A  further reduction in the number of industrial  accidents is important – not only for current  employees, but also for future recruitment  possibilities. As a minimum, the proportion  of women managers is to correspond to the  proportion of all women employed in the  Group. Most goals are followed up via the  employee survey that the Group conducts  every two years. The results provide a foun- dation for strategic HR activities and local  action plans.  Environmental activities are organised and  managed based on Holmens environmental  policy. The policy clarifies the significance of  energy and climate issues to the business.   The overall goal of the Groups environ- mental activities is to make efficient use of  electrical energy and heat, reduce emissions  of fossil carbon dioxide and increase energy  self-sufficiency. A number of long-term  targets have been set for these areas. In   addition, the Groups ambition is to increase  the rate of growth in its own forests and the  extraction of biofuels.  Goal-oriented work is required to at- tain these targets. While the Group-wide  environmental targets are long-term, there  are short-term environmental targets at local  level in the Groups units. These are moni- tored within the framework of the certified  management systems applied.  Holmens work on sustainable devel- opment is described in more detail on  pages 22–34 and in the separate publication   Holmen and sustainability. 2010 was a difficult year in the printing pa- per operations due to a large drop in prices  at the start of the year, at the same time  that the costs of recovered paper, a key raw  material, rose substantially. Profitability in  the Groups other operations rose, however,  which partly compensated for the decrease  in profit from printing paper.   The situation for 2011 has changed, and  the conditions for healthy profit growth  are favourable. Ongoing price negotiations  for newsprint in Europe indicate significant  increases, although the demand trend is dif- ficult to estimate. The market for paperboard  remains good, and implemented price rises  should have an impact on profit during  2011. For sawn timber, supply currently  exceeds demand, which risks putting pres- sure on prices. The commissioning of the  new sawmill at Braviken will initially have  an adverse impact on profit. Wood prices  remain high, which may mean another good  year for Holmen Skog, while Holmens  own industrial operations continue to feel  the burden of high costs of wood. The level  in the water reservoir is lower than usual,  which will negatively affect the companys  own production of hydro power during the  first few months of the year.   The currency situation is important to  the Group. The krona is now considerably  stronger against the euro and the dollar,  which is negative. Thanks to currency hedges  at sound levels, the stronger krona is not  expected to have a major impact on the  Groups profit for 2011. Investments are  estimated to remain high in 2011 as a result  of final payments for the construction of  Braviken Sawmill and the ongoing invest- ment in a new recovery boiler and turbine at  Iggesund Mill. Business outlook  Holmen Annual report 2010 11 proFItABILItY. Holmens profitability tar- get is a return that is consistently higher than  the market cost of capital, and this target is  used to govern the business. At Group level,  the key figure used to calculate profitability  is Value Added; this is defined as operating  profit/loss less the cost of capital and tax. It  provides a simple and sufficiently fair yard- stick that is continuously followed up for the  Group, business areas and production units.  For a long time, profitability has exceeded  the cost of capital, but as a result of the diffi- cult situation for printing paper, profitability  has been unsatisfactory in recent years.  Holmens business is capital intensive and  much expansion is the result of investing in  additional capacity, improved production  and more efficient use of energy. Investments  are often combined with cost rationalisa- tion measures. To assess the profitability of  investments, a model is used to calculate the  present value of cash flows; that is, estimated  future cash flows are discounted by the  weighted cost of capital, which totals about  11 per cent (before tax) for investments in  the product-oriented business areas.  Computing the cost of capital involves  weighting the cost of borrowed capital and  equity and multiplying the result by the  capital invested in the business. The cost  of  equity is computed as interest plus a  premium based on the level of risk for the  operation, with capital invested in product- oriented business areas being assigned a  higher risk premium (5 per cent) than capital  invested in raw-material oriented business  areas (2 per cent).   In evaluating operating activities, the cost  of capital is determined annually based on  short-term market interest rates; in 2010 it  was a 5.5 per cent (before tax), on average. CApItAL StrUCtUre. Holmen is to  have a strong financial position that provides  financial stability and enables the company  to make correct, long-term business deci- sions that are not solely dependent on the  state of the economy and external financing  possibilities. The debt/equity ratio is to be  in the interval of 0.3–0.8, and adjustment to  this target is one aspect of Holmens strategic  planning.  DIVIDeND. Decisions on ordinary divi- dends are based on a total appraisal of the  Groups profitability, future investment plans  and financial position.    The Board has proposed that the 2011  Annual General Meeting (AGM) resolves in  favour of dividend of SEK 7 per share, cor- responding to 3.5 per cent of equity. During  the past decade, the ordinary dividend has  averaged 5.3 per cent of equity. As a result,  around 67 per cent of earnings per share  have been paid out in ordinary dividends  each year.   In addition to ordinary dividends, Holmen  paid extra dividends for the 1998, 2000 and  2003 financial years.   In recent years, the AGM has authorised  the Board to buy back up to 10 per cent   of all the shares in the company. During  2008, Holmen bought back 760 000 class   B shares. These share buy-backs were linked  to the Groups incentive scheme. There is no  specific target for share buy-backs. Holmen  has used them as a complement to dividends  as a means of adjusting the capital structure  when conditions were deemed favourable.  Share buy-backs took place in 2000 and  2008. Financial targets     Holmens profitability shall  consistently exceed the market cost  of capital.  The financial position shall  be strong with a debt/equity ratio  within the interval of 0.3–0.8.   Decisions on dividends shall  be based on an appraisal of the  Groups profitability, future  investment plans and financial  position.

Holmen Papers operations continued to  focus on quality enhancement and product  development, in parallel with cost cuts and  efficiency improvements.  The proportion of standard newsprint  continued to decline, replaced by niche prod- ucts within MF Special. The new product,  Holmen VIEW, produced at Hallsta Paper  Mill, was launched during the year.  The 100 redundancies at Braviken Paper  Mill, which were announced in 2009, were  carried out.   In June, negotiations began on further  reducing the workforce at Hallsta Paper  Mill by about 150 employees. Temporary  lay-offs were made in Madrid in the autumn,  and in October it was decided that 29 jobs  would be cut permanently. The shortage of  recovered paper entailed extensive produc- tion limitations in Madrid.    During the year, Holmen assessed various  options for the smaller of the two paper  machines, PM 61, at the mill in Madrid,  including adapting the machine for different  products. In conjunction with preparation  of the annual accounts, the Board decided  to shut down PM 61, which represents just  under 10 per cent of the business areas  production capacity.   About 170 employees are affected. After  the shutdown, the mill will have a capac- ity of 330 000 tonnes of newsprint on one  machine.  Excluding items affecting comparability,  an operating loss of SEK 618 million was  generated for 2010, compared to an operat- ing profit of SEK 340 million for 2009.  The deterioration was mainly due to lower  sales prices. High prices of recovered paper  and pulp also made a negative contribution.  In conjunction with the annual accounts,  impairment loss of SEK 555 million was   recognised on non-current assets in Spain  and a SEK 231 million provision for restruc- turing costs was made. Market Despite a stronger economy, demand for  printing paper has not returned to previous  levels. The European market for wood-  containing printing paper amounted to   22 million tonnes in 2010, a recovery of just  under 1 million tonnes, or 4 per cent, after  falling by 15 per cent in 2009. On the whole,  the price level in 2010 was much lower than  in the previous year. NEWSPRINT. About 9 million tonnes of  the European market for wood-containing  printing paper consist of newsprint. Paid-for  daily newspapers account for the main part  of consumption, while free newspapers  represent just under 5 per cent.  Newsprint demand is increasingly affected  by the widened range of electronic media  and the change in media habits of consumers  and advertisers. This has led to a structural  decline in the western world, while demand  is increasing in countries with vigorously  growing economies, principally in Asia.  Global demand for newsprint rose by 1 per  cent during 2010. European demand grew by  2 per cent, but the North American market  displayed a further decline of 6 per cent.  Imports to Europe from North America  Holmen Paper is the fifth-largest manufacturer of wood-containing  printing paper in Europe. Its share of the European market is 8 per  cent for standard newsprint and 27 per cent for MF Special paper. Holmen Paper 14 per cent  higher deliveries of MF Magazine in Europe.

Holmen Papers newsprint deliveries  decreased by 8 per cent, largely due to the  reorganisation to focus on more improved  products at Swedish mills and due to pro- duction limitations at the mill in Spain.  The prices for 2010 were cut substantially  at the start of the year. Subsequently, the  prices for new contracts – mainly outside  Europe – were gradually increased. MF SPECIAL. This contains the product  groups MF Magazine, book paper and  telephone directory paper.   Holmen Papers deliveries within MF  Magazine rose substantially during the year,  especially in the brighter segments. Holmen  Papers strength lies mainly in the segments  with low grammages and products with high  brightness.  Holmen VIEW was launched during the  year and is a new cost-effective alternative  to coated paper for magazines and product  catalogues.  Wood-containing book paper, which is  mainly aimed at the market for paperback  books, is a niche product that has become  more important to Holmen Paper. Sales  climbed 23 per cent in 2010. The European  market for wood-containing book paper  totals about 450 000 tonnes per year.  The market for telephone directory paper  is dominated by a small number of buyers  and suppliers. In total, Holmen Papers  deliveries decreased by just under 5 per cent,  while its deliveries to Europe rose some- what – in a market that is estimated to have  declined by about 20 per cent. MAGAZINE PAPER. In 2010, demand for  magazine paper recovered, although not to  historic levels. The European market for  SC paper was down 1 per cent to 4 million  tonnes, while coated paper rose by 11 per  cent to 7 million tonnes. A historically low  price for coated products has led to a clear  shift from other grades to coated paper. Holmen Paper has relatively small volumes  in SC and coated paper. Deliveries of SC  paper decreased marginally, but deliver- ies of coated paper from Madrid increased  somewhat. Change and development At Hallsta and Braviken, Holmen Papers  Swedish units, production is gradually being  changed to comprise a higher proportion  of niche products, at the same time that  standard newsprint is being reduced to a  volume that corresponds to what can be sold  in nearby markets. Further steps are being  taken towards increasing the proportion of  virgin fibre in the pulp base to support this  production change. Holmen Paper enjoys a  strong position in MF Special with products  such as Holmen Book, Holmen XLNT and  Holmen VIEW.   Since 2008, capacity corresponding to   300 000 tonnes has been transferred from  newsprint to these improved products.  Following the closure of PM 61, the mill in  Madrid focuses on newsprint produced for  nearby markets.

Deliveries  from European producers to Europe rose by   8 per cent and to non-European markets by  13 per cent. Prices were increased during the  year for both solid bleached board and fold- ing boxboard.  Iggesund Paperboards orderbook was  very good, and capacity utilisation has been  high at the mills in Iggesund and Working- ton. The upgrade of board machine BM 2  at Workington Mill was a success and led  to further refinement of the product mix  and higher productivity. The Swedish Paper  Workers Union at Iggesund Mill went on  strike in April, which involved a two-week  stop to production. Financial compensation  for this was obtained from the Confedera- tion of Swedish Enterprise, but the conse- quences for Iggesund Paperboards customers  were significant.  In the first half of the year, a decision was  taken to invest SEK 2.3 billion in a new  recovery boiler and turbine at Iggesund Mill.  This investment is an important step in mod- ernising the mills pulp and energy  supply,  putting the plant in a position to become  self-sufficient in electricity without the use of  any fossil fuels. The new recovery boiler will  be commissioned in June 2012.   Operating profit amounted to SEK 817  million, compared to SEK 419 million for  2009. An improved sales mix, higher prices  and high productivity boosted the result.  Staff and maintenance costs were reduced  after the board machine was shut down at  Workington Mill at the start of 2010. Market Global consumption of paperboard amounts  to roughly 34 million tonnes per year. The  European market for the grades produced  by Iggesund Paperboard is approximately  2.7 million tonnes. Demand, which fell in  2009 due to a combination of the economic  slowdown and financial unease, recovered  in 2010. The largest European markets for   solid bleached board and folding boxboard  are Germany and the UK, with 22 per cent  and 14 per cent of consumption respectively.  Asia has overtaken North America as the  largest market for solid bleached board and  folding boxboard. Iggesund Paperboards  share of the European virgin fibre board  market is just under 15 per cent, and the  company is the clear market leader in the  solid bleached board segment in Europe.   Iggesund Paperboard concentrates its  sales on two product segments: paperboard  for packaging and paperboard for graphics  printing. The main customer categories are  converters, who make packaging, and whole- salers and printers, who buy paperboard for  use in graphics printing.   Iggesund Paperboards Invercote and  Incada brands lead the European paperboard  market. Invercote solid bleached board (pro- duced at Iggesund Mill) is the number-one  brand, and Incada folding boxboard (pro- duced at Workington Mill) is ranked fourth. PACKAGING BOARD. The type of board  manufactured by Iggesund Paperboard has  a variety of uses, including packaging for  confectionery, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics,  perfume and tobacco. The trend in private  consumption therefore has a major impact  on demand.  The requirements set on packaging,  and thus also on packaging materials, are  Iggesund Paperboard has a leading market position in solid  bleached board in Europe, but is also a significant operator in folding  boxboard. Taken together, Iggesund is the third-largest manufacturer  in Europe in these product areas. The market share is 15 per cent.  Iggesund Paperboard 2.3 SEK billion  is being invested in a new recovery boiler at   Iggesund Mill.

Convenience, quality  requirements and the need for brand-name  profiling are giving rise to customised func- tions in packaging solutions. The appearance  of packages in stores is an important factor  that affects the choice of material and design.  In the chocolate and confectionery seg- ment, Iggesund Paperboard benefits from  the demands for packaging to be neutral in  terms of odour and taste.   With its two grades of paperboard, Inver- cote and Incada, teamed with the finishing  options created by the companys lamination  facilities in Strmsbruk, Iggesund Paper- board offers the markets most comprehen- sive product portfolio suited to the needs of  the packaging industry. GRAPHICS BOARD. The graphics market  uses paperboard for covers of publications,  cards, advertising materials and other appli- cations. The large number of end customers  in the market means that the greater part of  the volume is sold through a wide network  of wholesalers.   The high and consistent quality of Invercote  and Incada make them very versatile. They are  particularly in demand for graphics printing  thanks to their good colour reproduction. Development Productivity at Iggesund Paperboards facili- ties has steadily increased. Marketing has  intensified and the product mix has gradually  become more advanced. Iggesund Paperboard  has a tradition of continuously developing   Invercote and Incada. Improvements have  been achieved through several major rebuild- ing projects and a series of smaller invest- ments to enhance efficiency, as well as an  extensive product development programme.  One of the key prerequisites for the develop- ment in recent and coming years was the  adaption of board machine BM 2 that took  place at Iggesund Mill in autumn 2007. This  aims to give customers the possibilities of cre- ating packaging with new and more advanced  designs, using less material, yet maintaining  the same protective properties.   In May 2010, Holmens Board agreed  to invest SEK 2.3 billion in a new recovery  boiler and turbine at Iggesund Mill. The new  facility will provide greater energy efficiency,  increased pulp production and improved  environmental performance.   A recovery boiler is an important com- ponent of a pulp mill. It produces thermal  energy in the form of steam and is also part of  the system that recovers chemicals during the  pulp process. This makes an efficient recovery  boiler crucial for the production capacity  of a pulp mill. It will be possible to increase  pulp production gradually from 355 000 to  420 000 tonnes per year. A larger supply of  pulp means that in the long run the mill will  also be able to raise its production of paper- board. Furthermore, the new recovery boiler  will make it possible to increase the capacity  for the mill to generate its own electricity  from 210 GWh to 520 GWh. The mill is cur- rently 50 per cent self-sufficient in electricity.  The new facility will raise this figure to 100  per cent and will also create the conditions  for eliminating fossil fuels entirely from the  mills production operations. The invest- ment also includes equipment for capturing  and incinerating weak gases, which will cut  the emission to air of malodorous sulphur  compounds. The plan is that the new recovery  boiler will be taken into use in June 2012.  At the mill in Workington, an investment  project for more efficient production and  improved product quality began in autumn  2010. Around SEK 40 million will be invested  in a refit of the mills pulp line, which will in- clude modernising the lines main refiner. The  refit will boost production capacity as well  as pulp and board quality. At the same time,   energy consumption and maintenance costs  will drop, paving the way for greater profit- ability. The refit is scheduled to be complete   in March 2011.

Demand  was low in many markets, while produc- tion gradually recovered from low to more  normal levels. Sales prices were substantially  higher than in 2009, but the rise in prices  ceased towards the end of the year.   After a weak start to the year, partly due  to the harsh winter, Holmen Timbers deliv- eries rose to a high level in the latter part of  the year. Overall, however, deliveries fell by   9 per cent to 285 000 cubic metres.   The construction of the new Braviken  Sawmill was an intensive process that  spanned the whole of 2010. Piling and  casting took place in February and the first  buildings were erected in March. The cali- bration of all machines started in October  and was completed in December. Commer- cial production started in January 2011.   Operating profit for 2010 was   SEK 20 million, compared to SEK 21 million  for 2009, and was positively affected by  higher sales prices while higher raw material  prices had the opposite effect. The figure in- cludes costs of SEK 28 million for Braviken  Sawmill. Market Consumption of sawn timber in Europe  amounted to about 85 million cubic metres  in 2010 – a slight increase on  the previous year, but still  25 million cubic metres  lower than the top level  achieved in 2007.   Holmen Timbers  share of the sawn  timber market in  Europe is less than  one per cent, and the  market is fragmented  with numerous small  operators. Iggesund  Sawmill saws pine, and  its customers are primarily  in the joinery industry, in- cluding manufacturers of window  frames, solid wooden floors and edge-glued  panels, as well as planing mills. The key  markets are Scandinavia, the UK, Algeria,  Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and the latter three  of these markets have become increasingly  significant. Sales to North Africa and the  Middle East take place via the sales company  Uni4 Marketing, of which Holmen Timber is  one of four owners.    The customer base for Braviken  Sawmills spruce construction  timber consists of builders  suppliers, planing mills and  manufacturers of buildings  and roof trusses. The main  markets for the products  from Braviken Sawmill  are Scandinavia, the UK,  Germany, France and the  Netherlands. Development Braviken Sawmill, which  is the largest in Scandinavia,  has had the capacity to produce  around 550 000 cubic metres of spruce  construction timber a year since production  started at the mill. The number of employees  is about 110. During 2011, production is  Holmen Timber produces pine sawn timber at Iggesund Sawmill.

This corresponds to consumption of more  than 1 million cubic metres of spruce timber  per year. Since Holmens own forests are  mostly in northern Sweden, the majority  of the timber will be sourced from external  suppliers, chiefly private forest owners. The  sawmill is designed to be able to produce  750 000 cubic metres, although this would  require extra investments in expanded drying  and planing capacity.  The combination of Holmen Papers  existing paper mill at Braviken and the new  sawmill will result in significant synergies,  not only through wood sourcing but also be- cause the sawmill can utilise the infrastruc- ture already in place at the site. It will also  open the door to efficient energy solutions,  as the Group will gain access to substantial  supplies of biofuels from the sawmill and  forest fuels in connection with harvesting.  Excess heat from the paper mill can also be  used in drying the sawn spruce.   In recent years, production at Iggesund  Sawmill has risen steadily thanks to optimal  use of drying capacity and investments in  a new grading unit and a new log infeed.  Iggesund already has the type of efficient  integrated facility that is now being installed  at Braviken. Woodchips and biofuel from the  sawmill are delivered to the paperboard mill,  where the woodchips are turned into board  pulp and the biofuel is used for energy pro- duction. Heat from paperboard production  is used to dry the sawn timber.   Holmen Timber is working on technical  sales and product renewal to increase sales  of value-added products. These products are  classed as industrial wood and account for  around a third of Iggesund Sawmills total  volumes. Finger-jointed window components  that are free of knots have become a key  product supplied to the window industry.  The new production facilities at  Braviken  will make Holmen Timber a one-stop   supplier of construction and joinery timber,  reinforcing the business area and providing  synergies in logistics and sales.   Holmen Annual report 2010 18 Operations in 2010 The year started with continued strong  demand for saw timber. Low stocks of  pulpwood at the years start, along with an  increased rate of production in the forest in- dustry boosted demand for pulpwood during  the spring. Overall, the year was charac- terised by strong demand for timber and  pulpwood. The access to forest fuel – mainly  branches, treetops and bark – was generally  good throughout Sweden.    As a result of the robust demand, pulpwood  prices rose during the first six months and  were subsequently stabilised at record levels  equivalent to those recorded in 2008. The  increase in timber prices that started in the  second quarter of 2009 continued until the  fourth quarter of 2010, when prices fell some- what in southern and central Sweden. The  prices of imported wood have risen over time  in the same way as prices in Sweden. Exports  of roundwood from Sweden were marginal.   Holmen Skogs operating profit reached  SEK 1 868 million (605). Earnings from  operations (before change in value) amounted  to SEK 766 million (589). The improvement  was due to higher prices and a high level of  harvesting. The change in value was SEK 1 102  million (16) and includes SEK 1 050 million  as a result of altered price assumptions in the  valuation of Holmens own forests.  Market The Swedish forest industry consumes about  80 million cubic metres (m3 solid volume  under bark – m3 sub) of roundwood per year,  the majority of which is harvested in Sweden.  Half of this consists of saw timber, around   40 per cent comprises pulpwood and ap- proximately 10 per cent is forest fuel. Compe- tition for Swedish wood as a raw material is  increasing, partly because of the greater need  for biofuels used at thermal power stations.   The Baltic Sea region is now regarded as  one single market in which pricing is largely  the same. Harvesting Holmens own   forests Annual harvesting is based on a long-term  harvesting plan that takes account of factors  such as the age structure and growth of the  forest. Calculations include future extrac- tions of wood that correspond to a forest   rotation period of about 100 years. About  18 per cent of Holmens forest land is ex- cluded from forestry in order to preserve the  variety of forest types in the landscape and  thereby also biological diversity. The harvest- ing plan is updated every 10 years. An  inventory of Holmens forests was launched  in 2010. Using this as a basis, the long-term  harvesting plan will be updated in 2011.  Wood supply Most of Holmens forests are located in  northern Sweden where the Group does not  have any industrial sites. Through its own  logistical solutions and wood swap arrange- ments with other players, Holmen can utilise  this wood in its own facilities, reducing the  proportion of expensive imported wood.  The Holmen Groups Swedish units used  4.2 million (4.1) cubic metres of wood in  2010. Holmen Skog acquired a total of   10.8 million (9.9) cubic metres of wood,  of which 6.2 million (5.6) cubic metres  was sold to external customers. The Group  harvested 3.0 million (2.9) cubic metres in  its own forests.   Braviken Sawmill, at which production  started at the turn of 2010/2011, will use  around 0.6 million cubic metres of spruce  saw timber during its first year; this will  Holmen Skog is responsible for the Groups forests, which cover  more than one million hectares of productive forest land in Sweden.  The wood volume amounts to 120 million m3 standing volume.

Holmen Annual report 2010 19 subsequently increase to 1 million. As a stage  in the preparations for the new sawmill,  the purchasing concept BravikenGran was  launched during the year, with the aim of  securing the sawmills wood supply.  Marketing and purchasing activities have  been in progress throughout the year and  have been mainly focused on the local wood  market. Development INCREASED HARVESTING OPTIONS. A sig- nificant proportion of the growth in Holmens  forests takes place in young forests that are not  ready for harvesting, so Holmen only harvests  around 85 per cent of annual growth. As these  young forests age, the extraction of wood can  be increased to the same level as growth.   The effects of the silviculture programme  introduced in 2006 are also notable. It is  estimated that the programme will be able to  raise the growth rate in the Groups forests  by about 25 per cent in 30 years time.  This also means that Holmen will be able  to increase harvesting by the same amount  in future. The most important measures in  the programme are greater use of lodgepole  pine, forest land fertilisation and improved  reforestation. The investment in Friggesund  nursery decided on during the year plays a  key part in this work, because it will lead to  more efficient cultivation of seedlings and  open up opportunities for the technology of  the future for the improvement of seedlings.  NATURE CONSERVATION METHODS UNDER  DEVELOPMENT. In collaboration with  researchers at the Swedish University of   Agricultural Sciences, a project is under way  to develop methods of nature conservation  in forests. Various ways of helping to in- crease the biological values of forest land are  being tested as part of this project. The water  environments of forests are important to  biodiversity. During the year, Holmen trained  about 1 000 employees and contractors to  minimise the impact on water in daily work. GREATER TRANSPORT EFFICIENCY.  Holmen expects to reduce its energy consump- tion in harvesting and transporting wood by  approximately 15 per cent in the next few  years. This will take place through various  measures, including using harwarders for har- vesting, a combined machine that uses less fuel  than traditional forwarders and harvesters, as  well as a through transition to electric hybrid  power. A project through which to increase the  loading capacity of timber trucks is in progress  to reduce the number of transport runs.  MORE FOREST FUEL. Holmen Skog is  helping to develop technology for harvest- ing forest fuel in response to the growing  demand for this fuel. Holmen increased  deliveries of forest fuel during the year.

They are valued by   estimating the present value of expected future  cash flows, which consist of future revenue from  wood extraction, less the costs of harvesting,  reforestation and other silviculture work. The  harvesting plan and an estimate of future price and  cost development form the basis of the calculation.  Holmen has set aside large areas of productive  forest land for nature conservation. The value of the  growing forest on this land is not included in the  carrying amount of forest assets. Similarly, revenue  from hunting and other leasing is not included.

Operating profit reached SEK 495 (414)  million; the improvement mainly stems from  higher volumes and higher prices. Market A total of 145 TWh of electricity was  produced in Sweden during 2010, 66 TWh  of which came from hydro power. The  hydrological balance, which is the quantity  of water stored in the Nordic countryside,  was at a historically low level at the end  of the year. The average spot price in 2010  was SEK 543/MWh, which was 38 per cent  higher than in the previous year. Electricity  prices rose at the start of the year to excep- tionally high levels following the combina- tion of extremely cold temperatures and  low production of nuclear power. Very high  electricity prices were also noted in Novem- ber/December. The highest electricity price  recorded during the year was SEK 13 757/ MWh for one hour and SEK 4 969/MWh  for one day. Measured as an average over a  month, the highest spot price was   SEK 931/MWh in February and the lowest  was SEK 383/MWh in May. Energy supply Holmen Energi is in charge of supplying  the Groups Swedish mills with electricity.  Holmens total consumption amounted to  4 625 GWh (4 680) in 2010 – mostly used  by its Swedish newsprint mills. The Groups  own production, at its 21 wholly and partly  owned hydro power stations together with  the  back pressure power production at   Holmens large mills, corresponds to around  30 per cent of the Groups electricity con- sumption; the remainder is purchased.   The Groups exposure to fluctuations in  electricity prices is limited through long- term, fixed-price supply agreements, comple- mented with financial price hedges (see page  36). Market prices apply to Holmens own  electricity production. Development NEW SOURCES OF ENERGY. Holmen  Energi is running a series of development  projects aimed at establishing new profitable  business operations in the area of energy.  Wind power and peat harvesting are two   such examples. The aim is to produce   1 TWh of electricity from wind farms in the  future, mainly located in forested areas on   Holmens own land. There are major advan- tages of building facilities on the companys  land.  Selecting the best locations for wind  increases the profitability of the projects  and reduces the risk, because Holmen itself  consumes a large amount of electricity. Land  leased for wind power generates revenue.  Forestry operations within wind farms will  be able to continue more or less as normal.  Wind power surveys have been conducted  on Holmens land in areas around rn- skldsvik and near the mill in Hallstavik  since 2009. The results of the surveys are  positive and the work is now continuing  with applications for the necessary permits.   Energy peat has been produced on  Holmens  land at Stormyran north of rnskldsvik  since summer 2009. In 2010, volumes were  more than doubled. The volume of peat  produces 47 GWh of energy, which is an   addition that corresponds to the annual  energy needs of more than 1 800 detached  Holmen Energi is responsible for the Groups energy assets and   energy supply. During a normal year, hydro power production  amounts to around 1 100 GWh of electricity. The business area   runs development projects linked to energy.

Stormyrans annual future produc- tion is estimated at 70 GWh.   Peat consists of plant material that, owing  to a lack of oxygen, has only partly decom- posed into bogs and fens. The incomplete  breakdown means that much of the energy  content of the biological material is retained,  enabling peat to be used as fuel. Peat har- vesting provides a way of utilising several of  the value-creating resources that the Group  has at its disposal.  Holmen Biorefinery Development Centre  was established in 2009 with the task of  running long-term development work. The  possibility of extracting bioenergy and green  vehicle fuels in biorefineries linked to the  Groups factories is being studied, as is the  possibility of manufacturing chemicals and  brand new types of fibre and lignin products.   A survey is already under way at Hallsta  Paper Mill, looking into a possible facility  for production of biogas from wastewater.  After being refined, the biogas can be sold as  vehicle fuel. ENERGY COOPERATION. A number of  electricity-intensive companies in primary  industries, including Holmen, set up VindIn  AB in 2006, a company that develops,  constructs and operates wind turbines in  Sweden. VindIns goal is to generate 1 TWh  of electricity each year. The first wind farm  is located at Skutskr and has been in use  since October 2009. Its annual production  totals 28 GWh, of which Holmens propor- tion comprises 4 GWh. An additional wind  farm, Trattberget, is under construction and  will produce around 180 GWh per year, of  which Holmen is estimated to receive about  30 GWh. Permit applications for more wind  farms have been submitted.   In collaboration with four other compa- nies, Holmen has founded a company called  Industrikraft i Sverige AB to secure fossil-free  baseload power for the future. To this end,  a letter of intent was signed with the power  utility Vattenfall during autumn 2009. ENERGY SAVINGS. Responsibility for  improving energy efficiency is decentralised  to the mills, but coordinated centrally. The  new recovery boiler being constructed at   Iggesund Mill is the key to the mills long- term plan to be self-sufficient in electricity  and to be 100 per cent run on biofuel. At  Braviken, co-location of the existing paper  mill and the new sawmill will produce  significant benefits. Existing infrastructure  can be used jointly and opportunities will  be created for efficient energy solutions. An  old oil-fired boiler is being replaced with  a new electric boiler at Hallsta Paper Mill.  This will radically reduce dependency on  oil and improve the efficiency of the way in  which energy consumption is controlled. The  pulp line at Workington Mill is being rebuilt,  which among other things will reduce energy  consumption.

The Holmen website contains further  information, including descriptions of environ mental work in the various business areas  and a complete GRI register. Together, this  constitutes Holmens GRI report. INFORMATION ABOUT  WORK ON SUSTAINABILITY  Holmen Annual report 2010 23 Sustainability work is integral to Holmens  operation and its strategy for growth and  creation of value. These efforts are driven by  a desire to improve competitiveness, reduce  costs and level of risk, motivate and involve  staff, and make sure that production does  not adversely affect people or the environ- ment. The Groups forestry meets exacting  environmental requirements. The environ- mental impact of its facilities meets the  requirements of authorities. The products are  recyclable and adapted to the ecocycle.   Healthy profitability and a strong finan- cial position create the necessary basis for  development that is sustainable in the long  term. Holmen has a clear role to play in the  sustainable society by being a successful and  profitable company.   Beyond its core operation, Holmen con- tributes to economic development through  investments, research and development and  through co-operation with companies and  organisations in several of the places where  the Group operates.  The brand The expectations and demands of custom- ers and the world at large for products  and manufacturing processes to be made  environmentally sound are becoming ever  clearer. Active sustainability efforts are made  in all the Groups operations to meet these  demands. In the long term this is deemed to  boost the companys profitability.   Active sustainability efforts strengthen  the brand and goodwill, while contributing  towards raising the level of expertise. Retain- ing key customers and jointly enhancing  commercial relations with them are good  examples of such strategic values.  Internal management processes The Board and Group management regularly  address current sustainability issues. The  Group CEO has ultimate responsibility. A  special group led by the Director of Sustain- able and Environmental Affairs and consist- ing of representatives of the Group staff  units co-ordinates the work on sustainability,  which is described in detail in the publica- tion Holmen and sustainability. Holmen has  published sustainability-related information  annually since 2004.   Holmen has been following the Global  Reporting Initiatives (GRI) recommenda- tions for sustainability reporting since  2006. Account has been taken of GRIs 10  reporting principles in compiling Holmens  sustainability report.  Policies Holmens policies and guidelines are jointly  to be regarded as a guidance tool – code of  conduct – focused on sustainable develop- ment. With the legislation in each country, it  provides a framework and governs Holmens  actions in different areas.   Holmens production takes place in the  EU, where the majority of the products are  also sold. There are some sales to the US and  countries in Africa and Asia. In all countries,  Holmen complies with local laws and agree- ments, and observes good business practice.  Holmen also endeavours to ascertain how  the Groups stakeholders deal with issues  relating to the environment and personnel.   Altogether there are around 20 Group-wide  policies and guidelines, broken down into the  areas of environmental responsibility, social  responsibility and economic development.  Policies and guidelines more than three years  old are reviewed and revised as necessary.  Global Compact Holmen is a member of the UN Global  Compact. As such, the Group has taken  a clear stance on issues related to human  rights, social conditions, the environment  and the right to establish trade unions.   Holmen and sustainability comments on  how the Group fulfils and works on the 10  principles that make up the Global Compact.   There is little risk of anything in Holmens  operations conflicting with the UN Declara- tion on Human Rights, because all produc- tion takes place in the EU, where such matters  are closely regulated. A renewed analysis will  be made in 2011 of whether any of its sup- pliers or customers in countries where risks  exist are failing to comply with the Global  Compact.  Holmens operation is based on the natural and renewable raw  materials provided by the forests. The business concept is to pro cess these raw materials into products and energy that fulfil important  functions in society and generate added value for customers, share holders and other stakeholders. Sustainable development is a bed rock of the operation. Economic development, environmental respon sibility and social responsibility form a trinity, each part of which has a  significant bearing on the future ability of the Group to develop. Principles for   sustainability efforts Economic  development Social  responsibility Environ- mental  responsibility  Holmen Annual report 2010 24 Sustainable products Renewable raw material  Wood – the natural and renewable raw  material – is a factor of strength for Holmen.  Products and biofuel are made from renew- able raw materials sourced from sustainably  managed forests. Holmens products can  replace other products made from materials  that are finite or have an impact on climate.  Paper and paperboard can additionally be  recovered as material and/or bioenergy.  Sawn timber makes an excellent biofuel at  the end of its useful life. Sustainable production   processes  Holmen aims to take long-term responsibil- ity throughout the production chain:   18 per cent of Holmens forested land  is excluded from forestry in order to  preserve the variations of forest types  in the landscape and consequently also  biodiversity. All wood can be traced back  to its origin.   Active forestry has increased the stock of  wood in the forests by 7 per cent in the  last 10 years.   Recovered paper is used at Braviken Paper  Mill and Holmen Paper Madrid.   Biofuels and recovered thermal energy  provide 70 per cent of the thermal energy  needed in production.   Hydro power generated by the company  and back-pressure power at the mills meet  around a third of electrical energy needs. Research, development,   innovation The Group conducts research and develop- ment both in-house at business area level  Profitability in the company is based on manufacturing products  for which there is demand in society. Printing paper, paperboard  and sawn timber are basic materials in peoples everyday lives. The   starting point is the renewable raw material provided by the forests. 70 per cent of the thermal energy needed in production comes   from biofuels and recovered thermal energy.  Holmen Annual report 2010 25 and externally. Internal R&D is focused  on functional products and energy and  resource-efficient processes. This has led to a  steady decline in specific use of raw materials  and energy, while the characteristics of the  products have been refined.  Holmen has had a process in place for  handling ideas that have potential to provide  new business outside the established core op- erations since 2009. An innovation council is  tasked with piloting the projects through to  finished products.  Alongside the R&D efforts made in the  business areas there is a Holmen Biorefin- ery Development Centre (HBC). Focusing  on innovations and the opportunities that  exist within Holmen, based firmly on the  forest raw material, Holmen assesses busi- ness potential in the biorefinery area. The  principle is that in future it will be possible  to use wood to produce everything that is  currently based on oil. Holmen is examining  opportunities for profitable deals in the areas  of transport biofuels, biogas, new materials,  chemicals and biomass fuels.  A Group-wide team is investigating ways  of identifying environmentally sound uses  for the waste that arises in operations. The  focus is on identifying product areas in  which various materials can be regarded as a  valuable resource and therefore lead to new  business.  The external R&D activities are jointly  run with other players – often at an industry- wide level, and in collaboration with  universities and institutes of technology. The  main emphasis is on product development  and enhancing process efficiency, although  forest growth and improving the efficiency  of forestry are also important focal areas.  Co-operation is in progress, for instance,  with Svenska Innventia, MoRe Research,  SweTree Technologies, the Royal Institute of  Technology, Ume University, Mid Sweden  University, Karlstad University, the Swed- ish University of Agricultural Sciences and  Skogforsk. Holmen co-operates with the  University of Manchester in the UK and   the Universidad Complutense de Madrid   in Spain.   Group investments in research and   development in 2010 totalled around   SEK 100 million, of which around a   quarter consisted of external costs.

Thats how much  lower emissions are when Holmens carbon foot print is added up. Holmen Annual report 2010 26 Forest management and use of forest  products are the most important contribu- tion of the forests in efforts to tackle global  warming.   The forests provide raw materials and  bioenergy that, unlike those based on oil,  do not add new quantities of fossil carbon  dioxide to the atmosphere. Society is there- fore increasingly turning its attention to the  forests as part of the solution to the problem  of climate change. Managed forests better than  unmanaged forests A managed forest is planted, cleaned,  thinned and felled at regular intervals. A  stock of wood is built up over a period of  about 70 years. Most is then harvested, and  a new growth cycle can begin.  An unmanaged forest is allowed to devel- op freely over 300 years. The stock of wood  is built up just once – and then changes  insignificantly over time. The trees act as a  carbon sink, but in the unmanaged forest the  substitution effect goes completely unused.  It is this effect that represents the most  important role of the forests with regard to  climate, as wood is used as a substitute for  other materials. There is a dual effect:   Greenhouse gas emissions from produc- ing and using materials and sources of  energy with a harmful climate impact are  avoided.   Used forest products make excellent bio- fuels, replacing fossil fuels.  Increasing stock of wood   = carbon sink Holmens forestry has positive effects in  relation to climate change. This is because  of a steadily increasing volume of wood that  binds more and more carbon dioxide in the  trees, and the fact that wood and bioenergy  are replacing products and sources of energy  that have an impact on climate. In the longer  term this positive climate impact can be  further strengthened.   There are several reasons for the increas- ing stock of wood. The most important  one is that a significant portion of growth  takes place in young forests that are not yet  sufficiently mature for harvesting. Holmen  therefore only removes around 85 per cent  of annual growth. As these younger forests  grow to a harvestable age, it will become  possible to increase the removal of wood to  put it on a par with growth. There is twice  as much wood on the same acreage today as  there was 60 years ago. It also contains twice  as much carbon.  Holmens forest stewardship also contrib- utes considerably to the increasing volume of  wood. This means that naturally occurring  flora and fauna are given the conditions they  need for their long-term survival in the forest  landscape. In the 2010 evaluation by the  analysis company EIRIS of 1 800 companies  around the world, Holmen was ranked,  together with eight other companies, in the  biodiversity leaders group with regard to  policy and working practices for handling  risks to biodiversity.   More wood also creates opportunities  to make more products capable of replac- ing those that have an adverse impact on  climate. The quantity of bioenergy that can  replace fossil-based energy sources is in- creasing to the same degree. There is strong  justification for concluding that Holmens  positive impact on climate will increase. The issue of climate change highlights the need to rationalise en ergy use in the world and to make greater use of renewable energy  sources. The forest industry has long been a pioneer in this area and  is already a major user of bioenergy. Positive climate effects   Reduced use of fossil fuels at the Swedish  units.  More efficient use of energy.  Increased rate of growth in Holmens forests.  Increased extraction/deliveries of biofuel.   Increased production of electricity from wind  power. Holmen contributes to a positive effect on  climate by prioritising work on environmental  goals in the following areas:  Holmen Annual report 2010 27 Carbon footprint A carbon footprint reveals the quantity of  greenhouse gases that a product generates  during its entire lifecycle. The calculation  begins with the raw material and ends with  the disposal or recycling of the product. The  carbon footprint can thus be said to be a  measure of the products climate impact. Holmens carbon footprint The combined impact of the operation on  climate can be calculated by establishing:   The greenhouse gas emissions caused by  production.  The products capture of carbon dioxide.   The ability of the products to replace  materials and sources of energy that have  an impact on climate and the fossil carbon  dioxide that is consequently avoided. Holmen makes these calculations in ac- cordance with the guidelines issued by the  industry association CEPI.   Calculations of Holmens carbon footprint  clearly indicate that the Groups operations  have positive effects in relation to climate  change. Carbon dioxide capture and the  effects of substitution are greater than  Holmens emissions of fossil-based carbon  dioxide.  The positive effect on climate will gradu- ally be further strengthened by the environ- mental goals stated above.   The Groups production of sawn timber  is increasing sharply with the start-up of  the new sawmill at Braviken. This will more  than double the substitution effect of the  sawn timber and increase the quantity of  carbon dioxide held in temporary storage. Six basic facts about forests and  climate 1)  Forests capture carbon dioxide and  store it as carbon in the trees and soil. 2)  Just as much carbon dioxide is re leased whether biofuel is burnt or the  same quantity of wood and tree parts  are left to rot in the forest. 3)  The carbon present in the trees forms  part of the atmospheres natural  carbon cycle. 4)  By using wood and biofuel instead of  materials and sources of energy with  an impact on the climate, greenhouse  gases are reduced to an equivalent  extent. 5)  The better the forests grow, the more  wood and biofuel they produce and  the better their benefit for the climate. 6)  The same quantity of carbon dioxide  as is released when biofuel, used  cellulose fibres or wood from demoli tion is burnt, can build up the same  quantity of wood in the trees again. -1000 -500 0 500 1000 The carbon footprint of the Holmen Group 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide 1 8 9 11 3 2 6 7 4 5 10 12 9 Emissions of fossil carbon dioxide Total  climate effect 285 000 tonnes Capture and storage of carbon  dioxide, and fossil carbon dioxide  emissions eliminated by substitution 1 250 000 tonnes 1 535 000 tonnes  1.  795 000 tonnes Annual increase in stock of wood =  carbon sink.  2.  57 000 tonnes Fertilisation increases the growth of  the trees and enables them to capture more carbon  dioxide.

The effect is calculated as the quantity of fossilbased  carbon dioxide avoided when sawn timber is used.  9.  236 000 tonnes Holmens sawn timber stores carbon  dioxide for as long as it is used, and thus acts as a  temporary carbon sink.  10.  1 250 000 tonnes Total fossil carbon dioxide emis sions caused by Holmen operations.   11.  1 535 000 tonnes Total positive climate effects of  Holmen operations.  12.

Secondary biofuel, which consists of using paper pro ducts and sawn timber that are burnt, is not included in the  calculation above. It is not possible to establish exactly how  much is involved. Holmen has made a cautious estimate  that 20 per cent of the Groups paper and paperboard  (based on 2010 production) and sawn timber (based on the  Groups production during the 1960s) is finally burnt as a  substitute for oil. The effect is calculated as the quantity of  fossil carbon dioxide avoided, and is approximately 540 000  tonnes. The actual figure is probably significantly higher. The data are based on information  from page 88 and calculations  of carbon footprints for the  Groups products. The data for  the increasing stock of wood and  estimated effects are the average  for 2005–2010. The calculations  are based on guidelines issued by  the European industry organisation  CEPI.  28 Holmen Annual report 2010 Environmental efforts are concerned with working proactively to  reduce the Groups environmental and climate impact and ensuring  compliance with rules and conditions in the environmental area. The environmental standards at Holmens  sites are high. This is a result of investments  made in process and treatment equipment,  and continuous improvements implemented  within the framework of the environmental  and energy management systems at the sites  and statutory supervision conducted by  authorities. The main environmental impact  of the sites consists of emissions to air and  water and the generation of noise and waste.  As considerable attention is currently being  focused on energy and climate change, fossil  fuel and biofuel issues are of great interest.  Holmens environmental impact has  gradually diminished over a long period as  a result of several different measures. The  trend per tonne of final product has been  favourable for many years for several of the  prioritised environmental aspects, such as  emissions to water and air. This can be seen  in the diagrams on page 29 and the table on  page 88.  Efforts to improve energy efficiency and  reduce the use of fossil fuels are increasing  for reasons related to climate change and  resources. Holmen is therefore making active  efforts to identify and implement energy- saving measures and to increase its level of  self-sufficiency in energy. Environmental goals The Group-wide environmental goals (see  table above) contribute to a focus on climate  and energy issues.   Emissions of fossil carbon dioxide from  several of the units increased in 2010 in  comparison with 2009. A severe winter at  the start and end of the year meant that  oil combustion was required to provide  the units with thermal energy. Very high  electricity prices, together with stoppages  due to market conditions in Holmen Paper,  also contributed to increased dependence on  oil. These factors also meant that efforts to  rationalise energy use were made more dif- ficult, and the outturn for 2010 remained at  the 2009 level. Environmental efforts in 2010 Several projects, investigations and measures  related to the environment were carried out  during the past year. Here is a selection: Forestry   Together with five Swedish forest  companies, Holmen is taking part in an  industry-wide initiative to enhance the  sustainability efforts of forestry in line  with FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)  requirements. This co-operation, which  began in 2010, focuses on combining  economics, the environment and social  values in forestry, and on strengthening  the concept internationally.   In order to be able to fulfil the goal to  reduce the impact of forestry on water- courses and lakes, Holmen Skog provided  training for all its own personnel and  those of its contractors who plan and  implement measures in the forests. Alto- gether nearly 1 000 people were trained.   A new FSC standard came into effect in  June 2010. This makes greater demands  on offering consultation to local interests  affected by rejuvenation felling and on  giving greater consideration to endan- gered species. Holmen Skog is working on  putting the new standard into practice.   The updated version of the PEFC standard  for forest stewardship was adopted at the  Environmental responsibility Environmental targets TARGET OUTTURN  UP TO 2010 REMARKS Reduce the use of fossil fuels at   the Swedish units 2020: decrease of 90 % 55 % Reference year 2005 Improve efficiency of energy use   (MWh/product unit) 2020: 15 % 5.2 % Reference year 2005 Increased rate of growth in Holmen  forests 25 % within 30  years   –    Reference year 2007.

Holmen Annual report 2010 29 beginning of 2011. Holmen has a seat on  the PEFC Board and played an active part  in this work. Energy and climate   Calibration continued on the line for  energy-efficient production of thermo- mechanical pulp at Braviken Paper Mill,  commissioned in 2008. The need for  electrical energy has decreased by just  under 20 per cent in comparison with the  previous line.   Holmen is investing in a new recovery  boiler with a turbine and gas treatment at  Iggesund Mill. This will make it possible  to run the entire operation without the use  of fossil fuels or purchased electricity. The  investment totals SEK 2.3 billion.   A second cogeneration plant was commis- sioned at Holmen Paper Madrid. Emis- sions of nitrogen oxides have decreased as  a result.   Hallsta Paper Mill is investigating the  possibility of installing a facility for  producing biogas from wastewater. After  being refined, the biogas can be sold as a  transport fuel.   At Workington Mill an investment is being  made in refitting the mills pulp line. This  will reduce energy consumption by 10 per  cent.   An environmental study was conducted  at Workington Mill on the prospects of  installing an energy boiler for biofuel.   A 50-year-old oil-fired boiler is being  replaced with a new electric boiler at  Hallsta Paper Mill. Wastewater treatment plants   The wastewater treatment plant at  Iggesund Mill dating from 1977 was sup- plemented by a chemical flotation facility  in 2009. Emissions have decreased by as  much as 25–40 per cent for different types  of substances in the past year.   Action taken in the wastewater treatment  plant at Workington Mill has led to a  reduction in emissions. Transport   Holmen is taking part in industry-wide  efforts to reduce the impact of transport  on climate. Joint sustainability criteria for  procuring transport services were estab- lished in 2010.   A rail-based transport solution for finished  products was introduced for the Swedish  mills during the year. As well as lowered  costs, this means reduced emissions to air. Waste   Efforts to identify ways of making good  use of the waste that arises in operations  from the point of view of profitability  and the environment were stepped up in  2010. The volume of waste sent to landfill  represents only 2 per cent of the waste  that arises in Holmen operations. Discontinued operations   Studies were conducted in consultation  with the authorities at contaminated  discontinued industrial sites where   Holmen has operated in the past. In 2010,  studies relating to the sawmills at Stocka,  Hstaholmen and Lnnaholm, the sulphite  mills at Strmsbruk, Domsj and Loddby  and at the former mechanical pulp mill in  Bure had reached various stages.   Wargn Mill closed at the end of 2008.  Demolition took place in 2010. The land  was sold. Supervisory authorities took  decisions at the end of the year on the  remedial measures required for the indus- trial site. Holmen will take measures in  2011. Permits for operation At the end of 2010, Holmen was running  production operations at seven facilities that  Environmental permits for the Groups production facilities Hallsta Paper Mill1) 2000     Braviken Paper Mill2) 2002    Iggesund Mill1,3) 2003     Iggesund Sawmill1) 1994     Braviken Sawmill2) 2010    Workington Mill4) 2002    Holmen Paper Madrid4) 2006    1) Environmental Protection Act 2) Environmental Code 3)  In addition to this, operations subject to notification requirements take place at the production unit in Strmsbruk,  as well as port activity (at Skrns Terminal) alongside Iggesund Mill, which requires an environmental permit  (obtained in 19992)) 4) IPPC Emissions to air, fossil carbon dioxide 0 50 100 150 200 10 09 08 07 06 05 134 79 Group Sweden Kg/tonne end product Emissions to water, COD (organic matter) 0 3 6 9 12 10 09 08 07 06 7.7 Kg/tonne end product Waste, sent to landll 0 5 10 15 20 10 09 08 07 06 10 Kg/tonne end product Emissions to air, nitrogen oxides 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 09 08 07 06 0.65 Kg/tonne end product  Holmen Annual report 2010 30 require environmental permits. The permits  include conditions on permitted production  volumes and permitted emissions to air and  water.  Five of the facilities are located in Sweden,  with sales equivalent to 57 (58) per cent of  Group net sales. The two remaining facilities  are Workington Mill in the UK and the mill  in Madrid in Spain, whose share of Group  sales was 19 (21) per cent in 2010.  An application for a new environmental  permit at the paperboard mill in Iggesund  was submitted in early 2011. Equivalent  work began in 2010 for Iggesund Sawmill.  It is intended that the permits will provide  opportunities for increased production in the  future. No other major permits need to be  renewed or revised in 2011. An application  for an environmental permit was submitted  at the end of 2010 for biogas production at  Hallsta Paper Mill.   The production of electric power at   Holmens wholly and partly owned hydro  power stations requires a permit for water  operations (rules under the Swedish Environ- mental Code), which includes environmental  conditions. A review may be requested under  the terms of the Environmental Code. Permits  are held for all the power plants. A review is  in progress for the equivalent of 2 per cent   of the Groups production capacity.   Permit applications were submitted in  2010 for wind turbines at Blodrotberget and  Blackfjllet in the Municipality of   rnskldsvik and at Varvsvik in the Munici- pality of Norrtlje. Certifications At the end of 2010, operations at the com- panys facilities were certified according to  quality, environmental and energy manage- ment systems. In addition, all the facilities  at which wood raw material is used had  chain-of-custody certificates for used wood  raw material.   The forestry operations are certified in  accordance with environmental management  systems and additionally were the subject of  certification under the Forest Stewardship  Council (FSC) and the Programme for the  Endorsement of Forest Certification schemes  (PEFC).  Information on chain-of-custody certifica- tion, the proportion of environmentally  certified forests in Sweden in 2010 and the  proportion of certified wood at Holmen sites  can be found in Holmen and sustainability. Policy instruments The Groups mills have participated in the  EU Emissions Trading Scheme since 2005.  The Groups measures to reduce the use of  fossil fuels and consequently carbon dioxide  emissions have made it possible to sell  emission allowances. The Swedish mills are  also active in trading electricity certificates.  Holmen has been producing renewable  electricity for several years. This has yielded  revenue. Holmen takes part in voluntary  programmes for energy efficiency and re- duced climate impact in Sweden and the UK.  These programmes give the energy-intensive  industries an alternative to energy taxes.  Exceedances and complaints  During the year there were a number of  cases of exceeded threshold values, as well  as complaints and incidents in the indus- trial and forestry operations. None of these  were of a material nature or had an impact  on earnings, and they were all resolved by  means of corrective measures in the opera- tions management systems. The incidents  were reported to the supervisory authorities.

The alloca tion of environmental responsibility and  the organisation and management of  environmental activities are based on  the Groups environmental policy. All the  units at Holmen apply certified environ mental management systems. Holmens  forestry is certified in accordance with  the international PEFC and FSC forest  standards. At the production sites, vari ous types of rules are integrated as key  elements in the planning of production  and investments.  The Group Board, the CEO and the  heads of the business areas have overall  responsibility. Operational responsibil ity is held by mill managers and forest  region managers. Holmens Director of  Environmental and Sustainable Affairs  chairs Holmens environmental council,  monitors activities relating to the Groups  environmental goals and runs joint action  groups. THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY con- tains general principles for the Groups  environmental activities. It covers the  environmental aspects that Holmen and  its stakeholders prioritise. The focus is  on the significance to the business of  energy and climate change issues. HOLMENS GUIDELINES FOR SUSTAIN- ABLE FORESTRY indicate how the forests  are to be managed from the points of  view of both production and the environ- ment. The requirements in the PEFC and  FSC forestry standards are built into the  total of 60 guidelines. 1)  Certificates can be found on the Holmen website. 2)  Environment/ISO 14001, Energy/SS 627750, Quality/ ISO 9001. 3)  Certification to SS 627750 and UNE 216301. In  2010 certification to European standard EN 16001. 4)  The certifications include the production unit in  Strmsbruk and Skrns Terminal. 5)  Energy management system introduced. Certification  will take place when international standard has been  adopted. 6)  Auditing for certification of the management systems  will take place in April 2011.  Holmen Annual report 2010 31 Customers and business   partners Customers have expectations of Holmen  with regard to products and services, good  business practice and the way in which the  company deals with key sustainability issues.  Holmen demands the same of its suppliers.  The Group also continuously monitors how  customers perceive the company by conduct- ing surveys. The results are converted into  action plans where necessary.  Suppliers and purchasing The purchase of goods and services is  co-ordinated at Holmen with the aim of  reducing total costs. The requirements of  quality and sustainability are emphasised in  the purchasing policy.  Shareholders, investors and  analysts  Holmens shareholders, investors and  analysts are informed about economic, en- vironmental responsibility and social issues  in the Group through publications, analyst  meetings and the website.  At the Groups Annual General Meeting,  shareholders have an opportunity to put  questions to the Board and company  management on such matters as Holmens  sustainability efforts. Society Holmen maintains regular contact with   authorities, other land users and the rest of  the business community. The general public,  the media and opinion leaders are regu- larly informed about the Groups activities.  Permits for operations are continuously  reviewed, and local residents are consulted  in cases where Holmens industrial sites are  located close to communities.   The land holdings in large areas of north- ern Sweden overlap Sami winter grazing land  for reindeer. Holmen consults the Sami com- munities to arrive at solutions that meet both  parties requirements as closely as possible.  The operations are of great significance  to employment in the places where the  company is active. The Group has a total of  around 3 000 employees in Sweden. Further  jobs are created at subcontractors. Stud- ies carried out by the Group show that the  average Holmen employee generates another  3.0 jobs elsewhere in this way. A total of  around 12 100 jobs were created in Sweden,  approximately 900 more than in the previ- ous year. The rise since last year is explained  by increased purchase of forest raw material  from private forest owners. Converted, this  has led to an increase in the number of full- time equivalent jobs among the suppliers of  raw material. The workforce reductions   Holmen has made in recent years have,  however, had a negative impact. Social assets The forests also represent significant social  assets. A large number of people enjoy them  Social responsibility Holmen conducts a continuous dialogue with its stakeholders, which  raises the Groups awareness of what the stakeholders expect from  it – and viceversa. This in turn is an important basis on which to  identify strengths and weaknesses and enhance sustainability efforts.  There are Groupwide goals in prioritised areas such as leadership,  the working environment and gender equality.

Holmen land is used for  hunting and angling and to aid general well- being. Recent research demonstrates clearly  that forests and nature have a beneficial  effect on peoples physical and mental health. Present and future employees If a company is to be able to survive, it must  satisfy the demands of its staff with regard  to the working environment and opportuni- ties for advancement. Holmen has an explicit  aspiration to be an attractive and responsible  employer by offering motivating and chal- lenging work. High quality and service are  only brought about by knowledgeable and  motivated people. The company must create  conditions and a working climate that enable  the employees themselves to feel that they  can take responsibility for their personal  development. Target fulfilment Holmen has been setting targets for work in  HR (Human Resources) for several years    (see table). The results are followed through  key indicators and in Holmen Inblick, the  Groups employee survey. The most recent  survey was conducted in January 2011. The  results were not available when this publica- tion went to press, and certain results from  the previous survey are therefore presented.  The response rate was 76 per cent   (2009: 78 per cent).  The Inblick index, leadership index  and proportion of women managers have  continuously improved or increased over the  past 10 years. Holmen endeavours to raise  both the leadership index and the propor- tion of performance reviews conducted. The  target is zero managers with low leadership  indexes in 2011.  Measures are being taken to reduce the  number of industrial accidents. This is  important not just for present-day employees  but also for future recruitment opportunities. Leadership development Leadership issues come high on the company  agenda, and there is a clearly defined strat- egy for this work. All managers take part  in the development programme Manager  at Holmen. The overarching purpose of the  programme is to clarify Holmens view of  key leadership issues.   Employees who have what it takes to be  promoted to higher positions and who are  interested in such advancement are regularly  identified. The aspiration is to fill at least   75 per cent of all managerial vacancies  through internal recruitment. More women managers The proportion of women in the annual  induction programmes for graduate recruits  has been just over 30 per cent for several  years, creating the necessary basis for an in- crease in the proportion of women in senior  positions.   The proportion of women managers has  doubled to 16 per cent since 2006. The aim  is to reach at least 19 per cent by 2012.

Over the period 2008 to 2010,  a total of 109 new managers were appointed  at Holmens Swedish units, of whom 32 were  women, equivalent to 29 per cent.   The number of women in the manage- ment teams of the Group, business areas  and mills has increased from 6 to 16 in  the past five years. The management team  at Iggesund Mill has steadily increased its  number of women members, and in recent  years has had a preponderance of women,  six compared to five men. The Holmen  Board includes two women, of whom one  was elected by the AGM and the other is an  employee representative. Health and safety The number of industrial accidents is at an  unsatisfactorily high level. Activity in the  companys working environment network  has been stepped up in order to reverse this  trend. A programme has been developed to  improve the safety culture. This entails a  great commitment to behaviour-based safety  training (BBS) for all employees.  No Holmen employee has been involved  in a fatal accident since the start of the new  millennium.   The rate of sickness absence has steadily  fallen over the past decade and in 2010 it  was 3.5 (3.7) per cent. Long-term sick leave  (more than 60 days) remains at a low level  of 1.1 (1.4) per cent. Short-term absence in  Sweden (1–14 days) has been below 2 per  cent for several years. The rate of sickness  absence at Holmen is on a par with the rest  of the industry. An attractive employer The ability to attract, recruit, develop and  retain committed and skilled employees is  crucial to Holmens ability to operate its  business successfully, both today and in  future.   In 2010 the Framtidsresan [Journey into  the Future] theme day was held at 135 upper  secondary schools together with the Swedish  Forest Industries Federation. The Group also  ran the annual continuing professional de- velopment course for some 30 social science  teachers from all parts of the country.  In association with other forest compa- nies, industry evenings are arranged for  students at institutes of technology, as well  as forest training programmes.  Development of skills Skills development is a matter of becom- ing more proficient in ones occupation and  gaining qualifications for new duties.   The business areas annually conduct training  programmes to raise the skills levels of their  employees.   A total of around 140 adepts have taken  part in the Groups mentorship programme  since it started in 2003; 15 adepts took part  in 2010, each with their own mentor from a  different unit in the Group.   In addition to local induction pro- grammes, there is a Group-wide programme  for newly recruited university graduates.   50 new recruits from five countries took part  in 2010. The aim of the programme is to  improve knowledge of the Group and offer  participants an opportunity to network. Workforce reductions When changes or closures occur at industrial  sites affecting the size of the workforce,   Holmen endeavours to take clear social re- sponsibility in order to mitigate the problems  faced by those affected.   Over-staffing arises when the companys  organisation is larger than is required for the  long-term operation of the business in   accordance with the established strategy.  When this happens, the employer negotiates  with the trade union organisations and tries  to find consensus solutions so that redundan- cies are minimised.   As a consequence of low profitability, a  decision was taken in June 2010 to reduce  the workforce by 150 at Hallsta Paper Mill.  In February 2011, 55 had left at their own  request, either with redundancy settlements  or by accepting the offer of early retirement.  The administrative processes in the Group  are being reviewed with the aim of improving  efficiency and reducing costs. As a conse- quence, facility management services have  been transferred to an external consultancy.  The IT function is centralised in Norrkping.  A preliminary project is under way with the  aim of improving the efficiency of account- ing and related business administration in the  Group.  At the beginning of 2011, the Board decid- ed to close down the smaller paper machine  at Holmen Paper Madrid, which results in a  level of over-staffing of around 170 jobs. Union co-operation Holmen co-operates closely and in a spirit  of trust with the union organisations on all  major issues, and regards this as fundamen- tal to the companys development.   The level of union membership at  Holmen  was 85 per cent in the Swedish units in  2010. The equivalent figures for the UK and  Spain were around 50 per cent and around  40 per cent. How the work is done HR work is governed by laws, contracts  and internal policies. HR forms a natural  part of the business areas business  plans. The work is coordinated by a  management group for Human Resourc es (HR), which comprises the personnel  managers of the business areas and is  chaired by the Groups Director of Hu man Resources. The employee survey  Holmen Inblick is an important tool for  use in identifying what initiatives need to  be taken in the area of HR.    THE PERSONNEL POLICY reflects the  Groups stance on what constitutes  sound human resources policy. It high- lights the joint responsibility of manage- ment and staff for maintaining a good  work and development climate.  THE POLICY FOR GENDER EQUALITY  AND DIVERSITY expresses the Groups  view of the equal value of all people and  its endeavour to bring about a more even  gender distribution and greater diversity.  The gender equality policy was broad- ened in 2010 to also cover diversity. BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION. The policy  makes it clear that employees must  consider very carefully the meaning and  purpose of any favours offered in their  contacts with customers and suppliers. COLLABORATION WITH the trade unions  takes place in the Holmen European  Works Council and in consultation  groups at each unit. Trade union repre sentatives take part in project and work ing groups. The companys employees  are represented on the Group Board  by three members and three deputy  members.  34 Holmen Annual report 2010 Holmen has opted to base its sustainability reporting on the guidelines for sustainability reporting issued  by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The Group reports at reporting level A+. At Holmens request,  KPMG has performed a general review of the contents of the Groups GRI reporting and shares Holmens  expressed reporting level regarding the GRI guidelines. A complete GRI register and the auditors assur ance report can be found on the Holmen website. Company indexes and funds Active sustainability efforts and clear com- munication on them strengthen the brand  and goodwill. Stakeholders evaluations of  sustainability efforts are important so that  these efforts can be developed. This also  raises the skill level in the company.   Financial analysts have shown increased in- terest in sustainability issues in recent years.  Holmen is continuously evaluated by  sustainability analysts and is included in  a number of international sustainability  indexes and funds. The purpose of these is to  make it easier for investors to identify   companies that operate responsibly in rela- tion to economic, environmental and social  aspects.

Assurance report George Pettersson Authorised public accountant se Bckstrm Expert member, Far  Holmen Annual report 2010 36 The business areas are responsible for the business operations and handle business risks such as credit  risks in relation to the Groups customers. They also make decisions on issues such as volume and pric- ing, with the goal of consistently generating a good return on invested capital. Group Finance manages  the Groups financing and financial risks, based on a financial policy that is established by the Board and  is characterised by a low level of risk. The purpose is to minimise the Groups cost of capital through suit- able financing as well as efficient management and control of the Groups financial risks. Risk management  The Group is exposed to price fluc- tuations for its products and significant input goods.  Deliveries may be affected by fluctuations in the market.  Holmens income in its product-oriented business areas  is generated from the sale of printing paper, paperboard  and sawn timber. Changes in prices and deliveries largely  depend on the development of the European market.  This in turn is influenced by several factors, such as  demand, production among European producers and  changes in imports into Europe, as well as the opportuni- ties for exporting profitably from Europe. Holmen has  limited opportunities for making rapid changes to its  range of products, but the company adapts its product  focus, steering it towards the products and markets  deemed to have the best long-term potential. Three-year  business plans are used as a basis for this; they are  updated annually in consultation between the business  areas and the Group and are thoroughly assessed by  the Board. Holmen aims to have a broad customer base  and an offering that spans several product areas. This  aim, combined with long-term customer relationships,  reduces vulnerability to changes in the market.  Income from the raw-materials-oriented business areas  is generated from the sale of wood and electricity in  Sweden. Deliveries may vary from one year to the next,  but can be forecast in the long term. The price trend  depends on market equilibrium in Sweden for wood  and electricity, which – in the longer term – is expected  to follow the trend in Europe. Wood and electricity are  the two most costly raw materials for the product- oriented business areas, which makes the Group a net  buyer of wood and electricity. In addition to wood and electricity, recovered paper,  pulp and thermal energy are significant input goods  in the production of printing paper and paperboard.  Holmen produces more than 95 per cent of the pulp  and thermal energy that it requires at its own mills  using a highly integrated production process. The  procurement of raw materials is underpinned through  backward integration along the production chain by  owning forests and hydro power production facilities.  Significant volumes of recovered paper are purchased  via wholly and partly owned recovered paper collection  companies. Purchases of other input goods to Group  units are coordinated centrally, and the purchasing  work is organised in product groups with a number of  selected suppliers per group.  To reduce exposure to electricity price fluctuations, the  Group uses physical supply agreements at fixed prices,  as well as financial hedges. In 2010, the companys  net purchases of electricity amounted to 2 995 GWh,  of which about 2 580 GWh in Sweden. The prices for  the estimated net consumption of electricity in Sweden  during the 2011–2012 period are 85 per cent hedged.  For 2013–2015, the price of about 80 per cent has  been hedged. The hedges predominantly consist of  physical fixed price contracts. In December, Holmen  signed a new agreement for supplies of electricity for  the 2016–2021 period at a fixed price corresponding  to around 30 per cent of Holmens net consumption in  Sweden.  OTC trade in financial contracts exists for certain paper  and pulp products. Holmen did not trade in such  contracts during the year. Price-hedging opportunities  for other input goods are limited.  Gains/losses on financial hedges are recognised in  the income statement when they expire; for 2010  they totalled SEK -36 million (64). The fair value of  outstanding financial hedges at 31 December 2010  amounted to SEK 28 million (57), which was recognised  in other comprehensive income as hedge accounting  is applied, of which SEK 21 million refers to 2011 and  SEK 7 million to 2012. With the current hedging, a one  percentage-point increase in the price of electricity  would have a SEK 1 million impact on equity.   Earnings sensitivity A one percentage-point change in deliveries, prices  and costs is estimated to have the impact on operating  profit/loss shown below. The table is based on income  and expenses for 2010.

The price of the Groups net consumption   of electricity, including facilities abroad, is around   80 per cent hedged for coming years. Earnings during the year are relatively constant. The  main seasonal effects are that staff and maintenance  costs are lower during the third quarter, maintenance  costs are higher in the fourth quarter and that a large  part of electricity production at the hydro power plants  takes place during the first and fourth quarters.  Holmen Annual report 2010 37  Transaction exposure  A significant proportion of Holmens sales revenue is in  currencies that are different from its costs.   To reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on  earnings, Holmen hedges its net flows, mainly using  forward foreign exchange contracts, sometimes sup- plemented by currency options. The net flows in euro,  sterling and US dollars for the coming four months  are always hedged. These normally correspond to  trade receivables and outstanding orders. The Board  can decide to hedge flows for a longer period if this is  deemed suitable in light of the products profitability,  competitiveness and the currency situation. At the start of 2010, the Group had currency hedges  for the main part of estimated payment flows in euro  for 2010 and 2011, as well as parts of 2012, while  the flows in sterling and dollars were partly hedged for  2010. Gains/losses on currency hedges are recognised  in operating profit/loss as and when the hedged item  is recognised, and in 2010 they amounted to a gain of  SEK 227 million (loss of 408). The result was primarily  due to the average hedging rate for euro being   SEK 10.0 during the year, compared to the average  spot exchange rate of SEK 9.5. Taking account of  currency hedges, the average rates for the Groups net  flows in 2010 were SEK 9.7 (9.5) for euro and SEK 7.2  (7.8) in US dollars. The hedging of estimated net flows  is shown in the table below.  Earnings sensitivity Calculated on the basis of existing hedges and the  exchange rates at the turn of 2010/2011 (euro: 9.0 and  dollar: 6.8), exchange rate differences are expected  to have a positive impact of roughly SEK 100 million  on consolidated operating profit for 2011 compared  to 2010. A one percentage-point weakening in the  Swedish krona compared to the level at year-end would  have a positive impact on operating profit for 2011 by a  further SEK 15 million ompared to 2010. Without considering currency hedges, a one percent- age-point weakening of the Swedish krona in relation to  the currencies below would have the following effects  on operating profit: SEKm  NET SEK/EUR 45 SEK/USD 10 SEK/GBP 5 SEK/other currencies 3 Currency exposure arising when investments are paid for  in a foreign currency is distinguished from other transac- tion exposure. Normally, 90–100 per cent of the currency  exposure associated with major investments is hedged.   Translation exposure  The reported profit/loss is affected by changes in ex- change rates when the profits/losses of foreign subsidi- aries are translated into Swedish kronor. Equity is affected  by changes in exchange rates when assets and liabilities  of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Swedish kronor. Exposure that arises when the profits/losses of foreign  subsidiaries are translated into Swedish kronor is not  normally hedged. Hedging exposure that arises when  the subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into  Swedish kronor (known as equity hedging) is judged  from case to case and is arranged based on the value  of net assets upon consolidation. The hedges take  the form of foreign currency loans or forward foreign  exchange contracts. During the year, the hedging of the  Groups net assets in euro fell by SEK 1 816 million and  stood at SEK 1 916 million at year-end.

The fair value of hedges for  investment purchases is recognised in other comprehensive income until expiry, at which point the gain/loss is added  to the cost of the non-current asset that was hedged. The fair value of outstanding hedges for investment purchases  amounted to SEK -43 million at 31 December 2010. During the period, SEK -35 million affected the acquisition cost  of hedged items.

The fair value of outstanding  equity hedges at 31 December 2010 was SEK 88 mil- lion (-159), of which SEK 35 million relates to loans and  SEK 54 million to financial derivatives.  A one percentage-point weakening of the Swedish  krona would have a negative impact of SEK 33 million  on equity, including the translation of foreign subsidi- aries and taking account of currency hedges.  Holmen Annual report 2010 38  Group exposure to not being able to  meet the need for future funding and refinancing of  maturing loans. Holmens strategy states that the company is to  have a strong financial position that provides financial  stability and gives the Group the opportunity of making  correct and long-term business decisions relatively  independently of the state of the economy and external  financing possibilities. The debt/equity ratio is to be in  the interval of 0.3–0.8, and strategic planning includes  harmonisation with this target. Holmens financing  mainly comprises bank loans, bond loans and the issue  of commercial paper. Holmen reduces the risk of future  funding becoming difficult or expensive by using long- term contractually agreed credit facilities and maintain- ing a good spread of maturities for the liabilities. The  Group plans its financing by forecasting financing needs  over the coming years based on the Groups multi-year  business plan, budget and profit forecasts that are  regularly updated. Net financial debt rose by SEK 89 million during the  year and stood at SEK 5 772 million at 31 December  2010, divided among financial liabilities and interest- bearing pension provisions of SEK 6 227 million, cash  and cash equivalents of SEK 193 million and financial  receivables of SEK 261 million. During the year, new  long-term financing was raised amounting to   SEK 500 million and an agreement for a new seven- year credit facility of SEK 570 million was signed. Other  financing during the year was managed mainly via  Holmens commercial paper programme and short-term  bank loans. At 31 December 2010, current borrowings  were SEK 2 349 million, of which SEK 1 964 million  in the commercial paper programme. A new five-year  contractually agreed credit facility of EUR 400 million  (SEK 3 600 million) was signed with a 10-bank syn- dicate in January 2011. This replaces a contractually  agreed credit facility of EUR 600 million, originally due  to mature in 2012. In addition, Holmen has a bilateral  credit facility of SEK 1 300 million that matures in 2016,  and a further facility of SEK 570 million that matures  in 2017. All credit facilities remained unutilised at  year-end. They are available for use provided that the  Groups debt/equity ratio is below 1.25; at year-end,  this ratio was 0.34. Standard & Poors long-term credit  rating for Holmen is BBB with a stable outlook. The  short-term rating is A-2/K-2. The Swedish commercial  paper programmes have a facility amount of   SEK 6 000 million. Commercial paper with a time-to- maturity of up to one year can be issued in both Swed- ish kronor and euro. Holmens medium term note (MTN)  programme, for issuing bonds, has a facility amount of  SEK 6 000 million. Bonds with maturities of 1–15 years  can be issued in both Swedish kronor and euro.  Changes in the market interest rate   affect the finance cost. The fixed interest periods for the Groups financial  assets and liabilities are normally short. The Board can  decide to lengthen the periods in order to limit the effect  of a rise in interest rates. Derivatives in the form of inter- est rate swaps and FRAs are used to manage the fixed  interest periods without altering underlying loans.  During the year, the interest for SEK 500 million was  fixed for 5 years and SEK 600 million for 10 years,  which increased the average fixed interest period to   28 months at the end of 2010. The net debts fixed  interest periods, the breakdown by currency and the  average interest rate for various fixed rate periods are  shown in the next table, in which derivatives that affect  the currency distribution and fixed rate periods of the  liabilities are taken into account. The Groups average borrowing interest rate was   3.9 per cent in 2010. At the turn of 2010/2011, the  average borrowing cost was 4.5 per cent, based on  applicable market interest rates and existing fixed  interest periods. A one percentage-point increase in the  average market interest rate from the level at year-end  would have a negative impact of about SEK 19 million  on profit/loss for 2011. As loans with fixed interest rates  mature, the exposure to changes in market interest  rates rises. Disregarding the fixed rate periods, the ex- posure to a one percentage-point change in the market  interest rate is SEK -58 million. The fair value of the  instruments used to manage the fixed interest periods  amounted to SEK 14 million (-60) at 31 December 2010,  which was recognised in other comprehensive income  as hedge accounting is applied. This value is expected  to be recognised in the income statement during 2011  and later. With existing interest rate hedges, a one  percentage-point increase in market interest rates would  have a SEK 27 million impact on equity.

Holmen Annual report 2010 39  Sudden and unforeseen incidents  causing damage, such as fires and machine  breakdowns may damage facilities and goods in transit. Risks to facilities are managed pursuant to a Group- wide policy, in which the balance between preventive  protection and insurance in each area is highly  significant. The aim is to protect employees, the environment,  assets and operations well and cost-effectively, but  also to constantly increase involvement in preventive  work. Risks are minimised through damage prevention  measures, good maintenance, training, foresightedness  in the modernisation/renewal of facilities and good  administrative procedures. Holmen insures its facilities to their replacement value  against property damage and consequential loss. The  excess varies from one facility to another, but the maxi- mum is around SEK 30 million for any one claim.  The Groups forest holdings are not insured. They are  widely dispersed over large parts of the country, and  the risk of large-scale simultaneous damage is not  judged to justify the cost of insuring the holdings.  The main environmental impact  consists of emissions to air and water and the occur- rence of noise and waste. There is a risk of incidents  occurring and conditions being breached. Landfills and  phased out operations may lead to costs for restoring  the environment. The organisation and management of the environmental  activities are stipulated in Holmens environmental pol- icy. In disruptions, the environment takes precedence  over production. In ongoing and concluded operations,  the environmental impact must be acceptable to  humans and the environment. Forestry must be under- taken with as much consideration for the environment  as possible. The forests are to be managed in such  a way that ensures the long-term survival of flora and  fauna in the forest landscape. In product development  and investments, the possibilities of combining efficient  production with consideration to the environment and  energy must be utilised. These points are examples of how Holmen continually  works on managing the environmental risks that may  arise:   Internal controls of compliance with emission regula- tions issued by environmental authorities.  Controls of how chemicals and waste are handled.  Environmental risk analyses.  Authority controls and inspections.  Group-wide climate and energy targets.   Certified environmental and energy management  systems.   Environmental certification and traceability certification  pursuant to the FSC and PEFC forestry standards.   All certified systems are checked regularly by exter- nal, certified auditors.   Assessment of suppliers and transporters with regard  to environmental aspects.   Internal controls of compliance with the power indus- trys guidelines for dam safety.   When industrial facilities are phased out, surveys and  any remediation measures required are performed;  the work is carried out in consultation with environ- mental authorities.  Customers who are unable to fulfil  their payment obligations give rise to credit  risk.  The risk that the Groups customers will not fulfil their  payment obligations is limited by means of credit wor- thiness checks, internal credit limits per customer and,  in some cases, by insuring trade receivables against  credit losses. Credit limits are continually monitored. At 31 December 2010 the Groups trade receivables  totalled SEK 2 518 million, of which 47 per cent (50)  were insured against credit losses. Exposure to individual  customers is limited. Sales to the five largest customers  accounted for 12 per cent of the Groups total turnover in  2010. During the year, credit losses on trade receivables  in the form of provisions and impairment losses had a  negative SEK 14 million (negative: 14) impact on earn- ings. At 31 December 2010, trade receivables of SEK 35  million (92) were past due for more than 30 days. After  individual assessment of all trade receivables, a provision  of SEK 20 million has been made for expected credit  losses. The credit quality of the financial assets that are  neither past due nor impaired is deemed to be good.  Financial transactions give rise to  credit risks in relation to financial counterparties.  A maximum credit risk and settlement risk are estab- lished for each financial counterparty and are monitored  continually. At 31 December 2010, the Group had outstanding  derivative contracts with a notional amount of about   SEK 11 billion and a fair value of SEK 750 million, net.  The credit risk of derivative transactions is calculated  using risk factors based on historic volatility and the  time-to-maturity of the transaction. Calculated on the  basis of the risk factors and in accordance with the  Swedish Financial Supervisory Authoritys regulations  for financial institutions (FFFS 2007:1), Holmens total  counterparty risk on derivative contracts amounted to  SEK 1 628 million at 31 December 2010. The maximum  credit risk for other financial assets is estimated to   correspond to their notional amount. CREDITS FACILITIES ENVIRONMENT  40 Holmen Annual report 2010 Stock exchange trading Holmen was listed on the Stockholm Stock  Exchange in 1936, but was called Mo och  Domsj AB at that time. Holmens two series  of shares are listed on Nasdaq OMX Nordic,  Large Cap. During the year, the price of  Holmens class B shares rose by SEK 38.4  (21 per cent), to SEK 221.4. During the same  period the Stockholm stock exchange rose  by 23 per cent. Holmens market capitalisa- tion of SEK 18.5 billion (15.4) represents  some 0.5 per cent of the Stockholm stock  exchanges total value. Holmens class B  shares reached their highest closing price for  the year, SEK 226.3, on 22 December and  the lowest closing price, SEK 172.5, was re- corded on 7 May. The daily average number  of class B shares traded was 367 000, which  corresponds to a value of SEK 71 million.  The daily average number of class A shares  traded was 1 500.   Some 80 per cent of the trade took place on  Nasdaq OMX Nordic. The Holmen share has  also been traded on other trading platforms,  such as BATS, Burgundy, Chi-X and Turquoise. Return During the past decade, the Holmen share has  yielded a total return, including reinvested divi- dends, of around 6 per cent per year. During  that same period, the Affrsvrlden General  Index also returned some 6 per cent per year.  Earnings per share (EPS) Diluted earnings per share equalled SEK 8.4  (12.0). Holmens diluted earnings per share  have averaged SEK 12.6 over the past five  years. Dividends Decisions on dividends are to be based on an  appraisal of the Groups profitability, future  investment plans and financial position. The  Board proposes that the AGM, to be held on  30 March 2011, approves a dividend of   SEK 7 (7) per share. The proposed dividend  corresponds to 3.5 per cent of equity. Over  the past 10 years the ordinary dividend has  averaged 5.3 per cent of equity. This means  that 67 per cent of earnings per share have  been paid out in ordinary dividends each year.   The final date for trading in Holmen  shares including right to dividend:   30 March 2011.   Record date for dividend: 4 April 2011.   Payment date for dividend: 7 April 2011. Share structure Holmen has 83 996 162 shares outstanding,  of which 22 623 234 are class A shares and  61 372 928 are class B shares. The company  also has 760 000 bought-back class B shares  held in treasury. Each class A share carries  10 votes, and each B share one vote. In other  respects, the shares carry the same rights.  Neither laws nor the companys articles of  association place any restrictions on the  transferability of the shares. Ownership structure Holmen had a total of 28 339 sharehold- ers at year-end 2010. In absolute numbers,  Swedish private individuals made up the  largest category of owners: 25 732 share- holders. This corresponds to 91 per cent of  the total number of shareholders. Sharehold- The share & shareholders During 2010, the price of Holmens class B shares rose by SEK 38 or  21 per cent. Earnings per share equalled SEK 8.4 and a dividend of  SEK 7 is proposed.  Holmen Annual report 2010 41 ers registered in Sweden own 77 per cent  (73) of the share capital. Among foreign  shareholders, the largest proportion of  shares are held in the US and the UK,   accounting for 8 per cent and 6 per cent of  the capital, respectively.  The largest owner at year-end 2010/2011,  with 52 per cent of the votes and 28 per cent  of the capital, was L E Lundbergfretagen  AB, which means that a Group relation- ship exists between L E Lundbergfretagen  AB (corporate ID number 556056-8817),  whose registered office is in Stockholm, and  Holmen. The Kempe Foundations holdings  of Holmen shares amounted to 16.9 per cent  of the votes and 7.0 per cent of the capital at  the same point in time. No other individual  shareholder controlled as much as 10 per  cent of the votes.  The employees have no holdings of   Holmen shares via a pension fund or similar  system. There is no restriction on how many  votes each shareholder may cast at the AGM.  Share buy-backs  The company has no specific target for share  buy-backs. A mandate to buy back up to  10 per cent of all the companys shares has  applied in recent years. Any buy-backs are  regarded as a complement to dividend pay- ments to adjust the capital structure when  circumstances have been deemed favourable.  The 2010 Annual General Meeting renewed  the Boards mandate to decide on acquisition  of up to 10 per cent of the companys shares.  Shares corresponding to about 0.9 per cent of the total number of shares were  bought back in 2008 to secure the com- panys commitments under the terms of the  incentive scheme (see below). The Board  proposes that the 2011 AGM also authorises  the Board to buy back and transfer up to   10 per cent of all shares in the company. Incentive scheme In 2008, the Groups employees were invited  to acquire call options on class B shares in  Holmen at market price.  As a result, a third  of the employees bought a total of 758 300  call options at a price of SEK 20 per option;  their exercise price is SEK 224.50 per share.

Holmen Annual report 2010 44 Laws and articles of association First and foremost, Holmen AB is obliged  to comply with the Swedish Companies Act,  the rules accompanying its listing on Nasdaq  OMX Nordic, Stockholm, and good stock  market practice. The Code is an integral part  of the stock exchanges regulations; it is part  of self-regulation in Swedish business and is  based on the comply or explain princi- ple. This means that a company complying  with the Code may deviate from individual  rules but must report the reasons for each  deviation. In its operations, Holmen shall  also comply with the companys articles of  association. Shareholders At year-end, Holmen AB had 28 339 share- holders. See pages 40–42 for information on  the share and ownership structure. General meetings of   shareholders The notice convening the Annual General  Meeting (AGM) is sent no earlier than six  and no later than four weeks before the  meeting. The notice contains information  about registering intention to attend and  entitlement to participate in and vote at the  meeting, a numbered agenda of the items to  be addressed, information on the proposed  dividend and the main content of other pro- posals. Shareholders or proxies are entitled  to vote for the full number of shares owned  or represented and can notify the company  of their intention to attend the AGM via the  companys website and other means.   Notices convening an Extraordinary  General Meeting (EGM) called to deal with  the companys articles of association shall  be sent no earlier than six and no later than  four weeks before the meeting. Notices con- vening other EGMs shall be sent no earlier  than six and no later than two weeks before  the meeting. Proposals for submission to the  meeting should be addressed to the Board  and submitted in good time before the notice  is distributed. Information about the rights  of shareholders to have matters discussed at  the meeting is provided on the website.  The 2010 AGM was held in Swedish, and  the material presented was in Swedish. The  notice convening the meeting, the agenda, the  CEOs speech and the minutes are available  on the website. The entire Board, the Group  management and the companys auditor were  present. During the AGM, the shareholders  had the opportunity to ask and obtain an- swers to questions. The topics raised included  integration of sustainability aspects into  Holmens product and production strategy  and purchasing and supplier strategy, the  Groups wood supply, its target for the debt/ equity ratio and its currency hedges. The  Annual General Meeting adopted the income  statement and balance sheet, decided on the  appropriation of profits and granted the  departing Board discharge from liability.  Marianne Nilsson from Swedbank Robur  Fonder and Leif Trnvall from Alecta  Pensionsfrskring checked and approved  the minutes of the meeting. It was not pos- sible to follow or participate in the meeting  from other locations using communication  technology. Similarly, no such possibility is  planned for the 2011 meeting.  It was announced on 25 March 2010   that the 2011 AGM would take place in   Stockholm on 30 March 2011. Holmen AB is a Swedish public limited company, listed on the Stock- holm Stock Exchange (Nasdaq OMX Nordic) since 1936. The stock  exchange incorporated the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance  (the Code) into its rules for listed companies in 2005. The preparation of  a corporate governance report has been mandatory pursuant to the  Annual Accounts Act since 2010. This corporate governance report  complies with the rules of the Code and the directions for its application. Corporate governance   report  Holmen Annual report 2010 45 Nomination committee The AGM decided to set up a nomination  committee to consist of the chairman of the  Board and one representative from each of  the three shareholders in the company that  control the most votes at 31 August each  year. The composition of the nomination  committee for the 2010 and 2011 AGMs is  shown in the table.  The nomination committees mandate isto  submit proposals for election of Board mem- bers and the Board chairman, for the Board  fee and auditing fees and, where applicable,  for election of auditors. The committees  proposals are presented in the notice con- vening the AGM.   The nomination committee proposes to  the 2011 AGM the re-election of the board  members Fredrik Lundberg (who is also  proposed for re-election as Chairman of   the Board), Carl Bennet, Magnus Hall,   Carl Kempe, Hans Larsson, Louise Lindh,  Ulf Lundahl and Gran Lundin.   Curt Kllstrmer has declined re-election.  The nomination committee also proposes  that the AGM elects Lars G Josefsson as a  new board member.  The proposed Board fee is SEK 2 700 000  (previous year 2 475 000), including   SEK 600 000 (550 000) for the chairman   and SEK 300 000 (275 000) for each of the  other members. The CEO does not receive a  Board fee. Composition of the Board The members of the Board are elected each  year by the AGM for the period until the  end of the next AGM. According to the  companys articles of association, the Board  shall have 7–11 members, and they are to be  elected at the AGM. The companys articles  of association contain no other rules regard- ing the appointment or dismissal of Board  members or regarding amendments to the  articles. There is no rule regarding the maxi- mum period a Board member may serve. The 2010 AGM re-elected Fredrik Lundberg,  Carl Bennet, Magnus Hall, Carl Kempe,  Curt Kllstrmer, Hans Larsson, Ulf Lundahl  and Gran Lundin to the Board. Louise  Lindh was elected to the Board to replace   Lillian Fossum, who declined re-election.  Fredrik Lundberg was elected chairman. At  the statu tory first meeting of the new Board  in 2010, Carl Kempe was elected deputy  chairman and Lars Ericson, the companys  general counsel, was appointed secretary of  the Board. Over and above the nine members  elected by the AGM, the local labour organi- sations have a statutory right to appoint  three members and three deputy members.  Eight AGM-elected members are deemed  independent of the company as defined by  the Code. Of these, three are also deemed  independent of the companys major  shareholders. The largest shareholders, each  controlling more than 10 per cent of the  votes, are L E Lundbergfretagen and the  Kempe Foundations. The CEO is the only  Board member with an operational position  in the company.   Information about the members of the  Board is provided on pages 48–49. The Boards activities The activities of the Board follow a plan  that, among other things, is to ensure that  the Board obtains all requisite information.  Each year the Board decides on written  working procedures and issues written  instructions relating to the division of  responsibilities between the Board and the  CEO and the information that the Board is  to receive continually on financial develop- ments and other key events. Employees of  the company participate in Board meetings  to submit reports. The secretary of the Board  is the companys general counsel.   The Board held 10 meetings in 2010,  four of which were in connection with  the companys publication of its quarterly  reports. At one of these meetings, the Board  visited Braviken Paper Mill and Braviken  Sawmill, which was under construction. A  two-day meeting was devoted to strategic  business planning. One meeting dealt with  the Groups budget for 2011. The Board also  paid special attention to strategic, financial  and accounting issues, follow-up of business  operations and major investment matters.  On two occasions the companys auditors   reported directly to the Board, presenting  their observations from their audit of the  and the companys internal control. Attend- ance levels at the Board meetings were very  high.   The Board evaluates its activities each  year, and the nomination committee has been  informed of the content of the 2010 evalu- ation. This will serve as a basis for planning  the Boards work in the next few years. Group management The Board has delegated operational respon- sibility for management of the company and  the Group to the CEO. The Board annu- ally decides on instructions covering the  distribution of tasks between the Board and  the CEO.

Auditors Share- holders Board of Directors CEO Five Group staffs  Five  business areas Group manage- ment General  meeting of  shareholders Nomination committee Remuneration committee  Holmen Annual report 2010 46  Holmens Group management consists of  11 individuals: the CEO, the heads of the  five business areas and the heads of the five  Group staffs.   Group management met on 13 occa- sions in 2010, dealing with matters such  as earnings trends and reports before and  after Board meetings, business plans, budget,  investments, internal control, policies and  reviews of market conditions, general devel- opment of the economy and other external  factors affecting the business. Projects relat- ing to business areas and Group staffs were  also discussed and decided on.   Information on the CEO and other mem- bers of Group management is provided on  page 48-49. Internal management processes Management at  Holmen is based on the  business concept, strategies and goals of  the Group and the business areas. Under  the Board, CEO and Group management,  responsibility for operational activities has  been decentralised to five business areas. The  Group staffs are in charge of coordinating  certain matters, such as business administra- tion and finance, human resources, legal  affairs, techno logy and public relations.   The Group uses annual, rolling, three-year  business plans to break down goals and  strat egies into action plans and activities  that can be measured and evaluated. These  business plans are important to the long- term strategic control of the Group. Annual  budgets, forecasts and action plans are used  for day-to-day management of operations.  Various business processes, such as sales,  purchasing and production, are used to man- age operational activities at business area  level with a view to achieving the business  targets and implementing the agreed action  plans.   The results are followed up through regu- lar financial reports, and approved measures  are reviewed through additional follow-ups. Remuneration The Board has appointed a remuneration  committee consisting of Fredrik Lundberg  and Hans Larsson. The committee held  several meetings during the year at which it  prepared matters pertaining to the remunera- tion and other employment conditions of the  CEO and proposals for decisions. Remu- neration and other employment conditions  of senior management who report directly to  the CEO are decided by the latter in accord- ance with a pay policy established by the  remuneration committee.   The Group applies the principle that each  managers manager must approve decisions  on remuneration in consultation with the  relevant personnel manager.   At the 2010 AGM, an account was  given of the Boards proposed guidelines  on remun eration to the CEO and other  members of senior management. The AGM  adopted the guidelines in the proposal. The  Board is proposing unchanged guidelines to  the 2011 AGM; they are presented in note   4 on page 64.  The 2010 AGM approved the Board fee  and payment of the auditors fee as invoiced.   In 2008, the Groups employees were  invited to acquire call options on class B  shares in  Holmen at market price. One third  of all employees bought a total of 758 300  call options. Holmens commitments pursu- ant to this scheme were secured by buying  back some of the companys own shares. See  the section on the share and shareholders on  page 41 for more details. The 2010 AGM  renewed the Boards authorisation to decide  on buying back up to 10 per cent of the  companys total shares. No buy-backs took  place in 2010.   Information about remuneration is pro- vided in note 4 on pages 64-65.

KPMG has  since appointed George Pettersson, author ised  public accountant, as the principal auditor  for Holmen. KPMG audits Holmen AB and  almost all of its subsidiaries.   The interim accounts are examined  for the January–September period. The  examination of internal procedures and  control systems begins in the second quarter  and is thereafter ongoing to year-end. The  examination and audit of the final annual  accounts and the annual report take place  in January– February. The interim report for  January– September is subject to review by  the auditors.   Holmen allows the Board to perform du- ties that would otherwise be performed by  an audit committee. The Boards reporting  instructions include requirements that the  members of the Board shall receive a report  each year from the auditors on whether  the companys organisation is structured to  enable satisfactory supervision of account- ing, management of funds and other aspects  of the companys financial circumstances. In 2010 the auditors reported to the entire  Board at two meetings. Over and above this,  the auditors reported to the Board chairman  and the CEO on one occasion and to the  CEO at another two meetings.   In addition to the audit assignment,  Holmen has consulted KPMG on matters  pertaining to taxation, accounting and  investigations, and in some countries also  on matters of business law. The remuneration  paid to KPMG for 2010 is stated in note 5 on  page 65. KPMG is required to assess its inde- pendence before making decisions on whether  to provide Holmen with independent advice  alongside its audit assignment. Internal control The Boards responsibility for internal  control is laid out in the Swedish Compa- nies Act, and internal control related to  financial reporting is covered by the Boards  reporting instructions to the CEO. Holmens  financial reporting complies with the laws  and rules that apply to companies listed on  the  Stockholm stock exchange and the local  rules in each country where the company  operates. In addition to external rules and  recommendations, financial reporting is also  covered by internal instructions, directions  and systems, as well as internal distribution  of roles and responsibilities with the object  of ensuring sound internal control over  financial reporting. Financial reports are pre- pared quarterly and monthly in the Group  and its business areas, units and subsidiaries.  Forecasts and extensive analyses, along with  comments, are provided in connection with  the reports to help ensure the accuracy of  the financial reports. Financial functions and  controllers with functional responsibility for  accounting, reporting and analysis of finan- cial developments operate at Group level, at  business area level and at major units.   The audit includes the annual statutory  audit of Holmen ABs annual report, the  statutory audit of the parent company and  all subsidiaries (where so required), the audit  of internal reporting packages, an audit of  the final accounts and a review of one in- terim report. Reviews of the internal control  system are used in this work.   Holmens internal control activities aim to  ensure that the Group lives up to its objec- tives for financial reporting (see box). These  activities are based on a common set of  instructions and common checklists for key  procedures and processes for the Groups  financial reporting. The structure adheres  to guidelines issued by the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread- way Commission (COSO) for small listed  companies in respect of internal control  over financial reporting. COSOs guidelines  contain 20 principles in five areas: control  environment, risk assessment, control activi- ties, information and communication, and  follow-up. They have been modified to suit  the estimated needs of Holmens various  operations. Holmens greatest risks regard- ing financial reporting are linked to the  valuation of biological assets and property,  plant and equipment as well as to financial  transactions.  Holmen has no separate internal auditing  function. The Board does not believe that  specific circumstances in the business or other  conditions exist to justify having such a  function. In 2008 the company introduced a  type of audit procedure in which experienced  accountants and controllers in the Group  examine the internal control procedures of  other Group units. Investor relations Holmens information to shareholders and  other stakeholders is provided in the annual  report, the year-end and interim reports and  press releases. All are available on the com- panys website. The website also contains  presentation materials for recent years and  information on corporate governance. The  provision of information by the company  complies with an information policy estab- lished by the Board.

Holmen Annual report 2010 50 Income statement Financial statements  Operating profit reached SEK 1 596 million  (1 620). This figure  in cludes revaluation of forests (SEK +1 050 million) as a result of   changed price assumptions as well as impairment losses on   property, plant and equipment in Holmen Papers Spanish operation   (SEK 555 million) and provisions for restructuring costs at Holmen  Paper (SEK 231 million). Operating profit excluding the above items decreased by   SEK 288 million to SEK 1 332 million due to weak earnings at  Holmen  Paper resulting from lower newsprint prices and higher costs for  recovered fibre. Earnings for the other parts of the Group improved. Net financial items for 2010 amounted to SEK -208 million (-255).  During the year, interest costs of SEK 24 million (1) were capitalised   in conjunction with major investment projects and thereby reduced  the recognised interest costs. The average borrowing cost rose to   3.9 per cent (3.5), while average net debt was lower than during the  pre ceding year. Tax recognised totalled SEK -684 million (-360) in  2010. In relation to profit before tax, recognised tax amounts to   49 per cent, which is substantially higher than usual. This is due to   the negative result and impairment losses in the Spanish operation,  for which no tax asset was recorded.

A translation difference on foreign operations is also included, which  was above all affected by the stronger krona against the euro. This  impact was partly counteracted by the results of hedging equity in  foreign subsidiaries.

Impairment losses of SEK 555 million on non-current assets in  Spain were recognised during the year. The years investments in  non-current assets mainly comprised the new sawmill at Braviken  and the new recovery boiler and turbine at Iggesund Mill. Biological  assets were revalued during the year, resulting in a SEK 1 050 million  increase in value. This entailed a SEK 276 million increase in deferred  tax liability. No deferred tax asset for impairment loss on non-current  assets in Spain was recognised. Other operating receivables and  other operating liabilities include derivatives used to hedge foreign  currency flows. In net terms, the fair value of these items rose, mainly  because the Swedish krona was strengthened against the euro. The  payment of tax regarding the ongoing tax case reduced other provi- sions by SEK 611 million during the year.  Holmen Annual report 2010 53 changes in equity In 2010, the Groups equity increased by SEK 409 million, to SEK 16  913 million. Profit for the year amounted to SEK 704 million, and the  dividend paid was SEK 588 million. Other comprehensive income is  additional and consists of items such as revaluation of pension liability,  currency revaluation of loans, revaluation of transaction hedges and  translation of assets in foreign entities as well as tax on these items. In  2010, other comprehensive income reached SEK 292 million, which  is mainly attributable to the stronger Swedish krona against the euro  having a positive impact on the fair value of outstanding transaction  hedges.

The accounting policies for the Group presented below have been applied consistently  to all periods included in the Groups financial statements except where otherwise  stated below. The Groups accounting policies have been applied consistently to the  reporting by and the consolidation of the parent company, sub sidiaries and associates.  Compliance with standards and statutory   requirements The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International  Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Stand- ards Board (IASB) and the interpretative recommendations issued by the International  Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), which have been approved  by the EU. The Swedish Financial Reporting Boards recommendation (RFR 1 Sup- plementary Accounting Rules for Groups) has also been applied.  The parent company applies the same accounting policies as the Group except in the  cases that are commented on separately under each section. The parent companys  accounts are prepared in accordance with RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities. The  differences between the policies applied by the parent company and those applied by  the Group are due to restrictions in the parent companys possibilities of applying IFRS  as a consequence of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, Tryggandelagen (a Swedish  act safeguarding pension obligations), and in some cases due to tax reasons.  Valuation principles applied in preparing the   financial statements of the parent company and  the Group Assets and liabilities are stated at acquisition cost, except for biological assets and  certain financial assets and liabilities, which are valued at fair value. In the parent  company, biological assets are not valued at fair value. Functional currency and reporting currency  The functional currency is the currency used in the primary financial environments in  which the companies conduct their business. The parent companys functional cur- rency is the Swedish krona, (SEK), which is also the reporting currency of the parent  company and the Group. This means that the financial statements are presented in  Swedish kronor.  Assessments and estimates in the financial   statements Preparing the financial statements in accordance with IFRSs requires the companys  management to make assessments and estimates, as well as to make assumptions  that affect the application of the accounting policies and the recognised amounts  for assets, liabilities, income and costs. The actual outcome may deviate from these  assessments and estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Changes in estimates are rec- ognised in the accounts for the period in which the change is made if the change only  affects that period, or in the period the change is made and in later periods if the change  affects current and coming periods. See also note 26 Key  assessments and estimates. Changes in accounting policies New or amended IFRSs effective as of 2010 had no material impact on the consoli- dated accounts.  Amendments to Recommendation RFR 2, issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting  Board, as a result of an amendment to the Swedish Annual Accounts Act (RL),  entailed greater demands on disclosures about fees and compensation for expenses  to auditors for the Group and parent company. These disclosure requirements affect  note 5 and comparative data have been provided.  New and amended accounting policies applicable as of 2011 A number of new or amended IFRSs are not effective until the coming financial year,  and Holmen has opted not to apply any of these standards in advance. There is simi- larly no plan to apply new or amended standards effective as of financial years after  2011 in advance. New or amended IFRSs effective as of 2011 are not judged to have  any material impact on the financial statements. Segment reporting  The Groups operations are divided into operating segments, based on which parts of  the operation the companys highest executive decision-maker follows up, known as  the management approach. The segmentation criterion is based on the Groups busi- ness areas. This agrees with the Groups operating structure and the internal reporting  to the CEO and the Board. The items recognised in the profit,, assets and liabilities  of the operating segment are measured in accordance with the profit, assets and  liabilities that the companys highest executive decision-maker follows up. See note 2  for more details of the classification and presentation of operating segments. Classification etc Substantially, non-current assets, non-current liabilities and provisions consist solely  of amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid more than 12 months after  the balance sheet date. Substantially, current assets and current  liabilities consist of  amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid within12 months of the balance  sheet date. Consolidation principles  Subsidiaries A subsidiary is a company over which the parent company, Holmen AB, exer cises  control. Control means the right, directly or indirectly, to formulate a com panys  financial and operative strategies with the object of obtaining economic benefits. In  the determination of whether one company has control over another, potential shares  with an entitlement to vote and that can be exercised or converted at short notice are  taken into account. The consolidated financial statements are prepared using the acquisition method,  whereby the parent company indirectly acquires the assets and assumes the liabilities  of the subsidiary, valued at fair value. The difference between the acquisition cost of  the shares and the fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets is treated as good- will. The subsidiary companies income and expenses, and their assets and liabilities,  are stated in the consolidated financial statements as of the date when the Group  gains control (acquisition date) until such time as the Group no longer has control.  Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, transactions between companies in the Group  and therewith related unrealised gains are eliminated in their entirety. Associates Shareholdings in associates, in which the Group controls a minimum of 20 per cent  and a maximum of 50 per cent of the votes, or otherwise exercises a significant influ- ence, are stated in accordance with the equity method.  The equity method means that the carrying amount of the shares in the associates  stated in the consolidated accounts corresponds to the Groups interest in the associ- ates equity and any fair value adjustments arising upon consolidation. The Groups  interest in the net earnings of associates after tax attributable to parent company  owners adjusted for any amortisation or reversal of acquired fair value adjustments,  respectively is stated in the consolidated income statement as Interest in earnings of  associates. Dividends received from the associates reduce the carrying amount of the  investment. Unrealised gains arising as a consequence of transactions with associates  are eliminated in relation to the owned share of capital. When the Groups interest in the recognised losses of the associates exceeds the  carrying amount of the interests stated in the consolidated accounts, the value of the  interests is written down to zero. Losses are also offset against unsecured long-term  financial balances that, in financial terms, consist of part of the owning companys  net investment in the associates. Any further losses are not recognised unless the  Group has provided guarantees to cover losses incurred by the associates. The equity  method is applied until such time as the significant influence no longer exists. Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the  exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities  in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at closing rates.  Exchange differences arising on such translations are stated in the income statement.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are stated at historical acquisition cost are  translated at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. NoTe 1. Accounting policies  Holmen Annual report 2010 59 Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and other fair value  adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated in the consolidated financial  statements, from the foreign operations functional currency, to the Groups reporting  currency (Swedish kronor) at closing rates. The income and expenses of foreign op- erations are translated into Swedish kronor at an average rate that is an approximation  of the exchange rates prevailing on the date of each transaction. Differences arising  during the currency translation of foreign operations and the related effects of hedging  net investments are recognised in other comprehensive income and are accumulated  in a separate component of equity called the translation reserve. In the disposal of a  foreign operation, the accumulated translation differences attributable to the business  are realised, less any currency hedging, in the consolidated income statement. The  company opted to value the accumulated translation differences attributable to foreign  operations at zero at the time of the changeover to IFRSs. Companies operating on behalf of   the parent company The parent companys business is largely conducted through companies operating on  its behalf: Holmen Paper AB, Iggesund Paperboard AB, Holmen Timber AB, Holmen  Skog AB and Holmen Energi AB.  The parent company is liable for all commitments entered into by these companies.  All income, expenses, assets and liabilities, which arise in the operations conducted  by the companies, are recognised in Holmen ABs accounts, except for most parts  of investments made as well as some sales of forest properties, which are instead  recognised in some of the Groups subsidiaries. Income  Net sales  Net sales refers to invoiced sales (excluding value added tax) of products, wood  and energy. The amount recognised is reduced by discounts, and similar reductions  in income, and also includes exchange differences  related to the sales. Sales are  recognised after the critical risks and benefits associated with ownership of the sold  goods have been transferred to the buyer, and there is no remaining right or possibility  to retain actual control over the sold goods.  other operating income Income from activities not forming part of the companys main business is stated as  other operating income. This item mainly comprises sales of by-products, rent and  land lease income, income from allotted electricity certificates, income earned from  emission allowances and gains/losses on sales of non-current assets. State grants are recognised in the balance sheet as deferred income when it is  reasonably certain that the grant will be received and that the Group will satisfy the  conditions associated with the grant. Grants are distributed systematically in the  income statement in the same way and over the same periods as the costs the grants  are intended to cover. State grants related to assets are recognised in the balance  sheet as a reduction in the carrying amount of the asset. Finance income and costs Finance income and costs consist of interest income and interest costs, dividend  income and revaluations of financial instruments valued at fair value, as well as unreal- ised and realised currency gains and losses.  Interest income on receivables and interest costs on liabilities are calculated by using the  effective interest method. Interest costs include transaction costs for loans, which have  been distributed over the duration of the loan; this also applies to any difference between  the funds received and the repayment amount. Dividend income is recognised when the  dividend is established and the right to receive payment is judged to be certain.  Interest costs normally affect profit/loss in the period to which they relate. Borrowing  costs attributable to the purchase, construction or production of qualifying assets are  to be capitalised as part of the assets cost. A qualifying asset is an asset that takes a  substantial period of time to get ready for intended use. Borrowing costs for significant  investment projects are capitalised in the Group.  Taxes Income taxes comprise current tax and deferred tax. Income taxes are recognised in  the income statement except when underlying transactions are recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the associated tax effect is  also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Current tax is the  tax to be paid or received for the year in question, using the tax rates that have been  decided on, or to all intents and purposes have been decided on at the balance sheet  date. This also includes any adjustment to current tax attributable to previous periods.  Deferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet method on the basis of temporary  differences between carrying amounts and  values for tax purposes of assets and  liabilities, applying the tax rates and rules that have been approved or announced at  the balance sheet date. Temporary differ ences are not taken into account in goodwill  arising upon consolidation, nor in tempo rary differences attribut able to interests in  subsidiaries and associates that are not expected to become liable to taxation in the  foreseeable future. In the  parent companys  accounts, untaxed reserves are recognised  inclusive of deferred tax liability.  Deferred tax assets in respect of tax-deductible temporary differences and loss carry- forwards are recognised only to the extent that it is likely they will be utilised and entail  lower tax payments in the future. Deferred tax assets and  deferred tax liabilities in the  same country are recognised net. earnings per share  The calculation of earnings per share (EPS) is based on the Groups profit for the year  attributable to the parent companys owners and the weighted average number of  shares outstanding during the year. In calculating diluted EPS, the earnings and the  average number of shares are adjusted to take account of the effects of any potential  ordinary shares having a diluting effect, which during reported periods stem from  call options acquired by employees within the framework of the incentive scheme.  The dilution effect of options affects the number of shares and only arises when the  exercise price is lower than the listed price, and is larger the wider the spread between  the exercise price and the listed price. Financial instruments Financial instruments are measured and recognised according to IAS 39.    Recognition in and derecognition from the balance sheet  A financial asset or liability is stated in the balance sheet when the company becomes  a party in accordance with the contractual conditions of the instrument. A financial  asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights referred to in the contract  have been realised or mature, or when the company no longer has control over them.  A financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the undertaking in the con- tract is performed or expires in some other way. Spot transactions are stated in ac- cordance with the trade day principle. Trade receivables are recognised in the balance  sheet when an invoice has been sent. Liabilities are recognised when the counterparty  has provided a product or service and there is a contractual obligation to pay, even  if an invoice has not yet been received. A financial asset and a financial liability are  only offset and recognised at a net amount where a legal right to offset the amounts  exists and there is an intention to settle the items at a net amount or simultaneously  realise the asset and settle the liability. Financial assets, excluding shares, and financial  liabilities have been classified as current if the amounts are expected to be recovered  or paid within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Shares have been classified as  non-current if they are intended to be held in the operation permanently. Measurement of financial instruments Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. This category consists of financial  assets held for trading. Financial instruments in this category are measured on a cur- rent basis at fair value, with changes of value recognised in profit or loss. Loan receivables and trade receivables. Bank balances, loan receivables and trade  receivables are measured at amortised cost. Impairment testing is performed continu- ally, using objective criteria for these assets. If impairment is established, the receiv- able is derecognised. However, a provision for doubtful trade receivables is made if  the impairment is anticipated.  Available-for-sale financial assets. The category of available-for-sale financial assets  includes financial assets not classified in any other category or financial assets that the  company initially chose to classify in this category. The assets are valued on a current  basis at fair value with the changes in value for the period recognised in other com- prehensive income, and the accumulated changes in value in a separate component  of equity, although not such value changes that are attributable to impairment losses  (see below), nor interest on debt (receivables) instruments and dividend income as  well as exchange differences on monetary items, which are recognised in profit for  the year. When the asset is disposed of, accumulated profit/loss – which was previ- ously recognised in other comprehensive income – is recognised in profit for the year.  Shares and interests not related to Group companies or associates are measured at  cost. Measurement at fair value could not be applied, because reliable market values  could not be established.  Holmen Annual report 2010 60 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are meas- ured initially at the value of funds received after deduction of any transaction costs.  Normally, the liabilities are measured on a current basis at amortised cost using  the effective interest method. In those cases where funds received fall short of the  repayment amount, the difference is allocated over the duration of the loan using the  effective interest method. Loans recognised using the fair value option are initially rec- ognised excluding any transaction costs and on a current basis at fair value. The fair  value option has been applied to one loan with the object of arriving at a fairer presen- tation of results and thereby reflecting changes in the value of the interest rate swap  that belongs to the loan. This loan and the related swap matured during the year. In  the parent company, no loans were measured at fair value. Profit/loss from financial  instruments is recognised in net financial items or operating profit/loss, depending on  the purpose of the holding. Other financial liabilities. These liabilities are measured at amortised cost. Amortised  cost is determined on the basis of the effective interest that was calculated at the  time of acquisition. Trade payables and loan liabilities are recognised in this category  except for the loan measured at fair value using the fair value option within Holmen.  Loans hedged against changes in value are initially recognised including any transac- tion costs and on a current basis at fair value.  Derivatives and hedge accounting. All derivatives are measured at fair value and are  recognised in the balance sheet.  More or less all derivatives are held for hedging purposes. Where hedge accounting is  applied, the changes in value are recognised as stated below. Cash flow hedges. The effective part of changes in value is recognised in other  comprehensive income and accumulated in equity until the time when the hedged  item influences the income statement, when the accumulated changes in value are  transferred from equity via other comprehensive income to the income statement to  meet and match the hedged transaction. In the hedging of investments, the acquisi- tion cost of the hedged item is instead adjusted when it occurs. The ineffective part of  hedges is recognised directly in the income statement.  Hedging fair value. Changes in value of derivatives are recognised directly in the  income statement. Changes in the value of the hedged item are recognised in a cor- responding way. Net investments. Changes in the value of hedges relating to net investments in foreign  businesses are recognised in other comprehensive income for the Group. Accumu- lated changes in value are recognised as a component in the Groups equity until the  business is disposed of, when the accumulated changes in value are recognised in  the income statement. In the case of derivatives that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge  accounting, the changes in value are recognised within operating profit/loss or within  net financial items, depending on the purpose of the holding. In the parent company,  changes in value are recognised in the income statement as hedge accounting is not  applied.  Computation of fair value. The fair value of financial instruments traded on an active  market is based on listed market prices and belongs to measurement level 1 as per  IFRS 7. Where there are no listed market prices, fair value has been computed using  discounted cash flows. In calculating discounted cash flows, all variables used for  the calculations, such as discount rates and exchange rates, are taken from market  listings where possible. These valuations belong to measurement level 2. Other valua- tions, for which a variable is based on own assessments, belong to measurement level  3. Holmens transactions mainly belong to measurement level 2, with the exception of  one transaction that belongs to measurement level 3. Currency options were valued  using the Black & Scholes formula. Intangible non-current assets Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition cost of business combina- tions and the fair value of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent  liabilities. Goodwill is valued at acquisition cost less any accumulated impairment  losses. Goodwill arising in connection with the acquisition of associates is included in  the carrying amount of the participating interest in such companies.  Research costs are expensed when they are incurred. Development costs are only capi- talised in the case of major projects to the extent that their future financial benefits can  be reliably assessed. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income state- ment as costs when incurred. Development costs recognised in the balance sheet are  stated at their acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.   Intangible non-current assets also include patents, licences and IT systems. The  groups intangible non-current assets are amortised over periods of between 5 and  20 years,  except for goodwill. Any goodwill is allotted to cash-generating units and is  tested for impairment annually. The Group does not currently recognise any goodwill.  Intangible non-current assets in the parent company are amortised over five years. Property, plant and equipment  Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost after deduction of accu- mulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Property, plant and equipment that  consist of parts with different useful lives are treated as separate components of prop- erty, plant and equipment. Additional expenditure is capitalised only if it is estimated to  generate financial benefits for the company. The key factor determining whether or not  additional expenditure is capitalised is if it relates to the replacement of identified com- ponents or parts thereof, in which case the expenditure is capitalised. The cost is also  capitalised in cases where a new component is created. Any undepreciated carrying  amounts for replaced components or parts of components are retired and expensed  in connection with the replacement.  The carrying amount of an item of property, plant or equipment is removed from the  balance sheet in connection with retirement or disposal of the asset or when no future  financial benefits can be expected from the use of the asset. The gain or loss arising  on the retirement or disposal of an asset consists of the difference between the selling  price and the carrying amount of the asset, less any direct selling costs. Gains and  losses are recognised in the accounts as other operating income/costs. Depreciation according to plan is based on original acquisition cost less any   impairment losses. Depreciation takes place on a straight-line basis over the   estimated useful life of the asset. Land is not depreciated. The following useful lives (years) are used: Machinery for hydro power production  20–40 Administrative and warehouse buildings, residential properties  20–33 Production buildings, land installations, and   machinery for pulp, paper and paperboard production  20 Machinery for sawmills  12 Other machinery  10 Forest roads   10 Equipment  4 If there is any indication that the carrying amount is too high, an analysis is made in  which the recoverable value of single or inherently related assets is determined at the  higher of the net selling price and the utility value. The net selling price is the estimated  selling price after deduction of the estimated cost of selling the asset. The utility value  is measured as expected future discounted cash flow. An impairment loss consists  of the amount by which the recoverable amount falls short of the carrying amount.  Impairment loss is reversed if there has been any positive change in the circumstances  upon which the determination of the recoverable amount is based. A reversal may be  made up to, but not exceeding, the carrying amount that would have been recog- nised, less depreciation, if there had been no impairment.  Borrowing costs attributable to the purchase or construction of qualifying assets are  to be capitalised as part of the assets cost. A qualifying asset is an asset that takes a  substantial period of time to get ready for intended use. Borrowing costs for significant  investment projects are capitalised in the Group.   Leasing In the consolidated accounts, lease agreements are classified as finance leases or op- erating leases. The leasing of non-current assets for which the Group is substantially  exposed to the same risks and benefits as if the asset were directly owned is classi- fied as finance leases. The leasing of assets over which the lessor substantially retains  ownership is classified as operating leases and the leasing charge is expensed. Within  the Group, all lease agreements are classified as operating leases.  Biological assets The Group divides all its forest assets for accounting purposes into growing forests,  which are recognised as biological assets at fair value, and land, which is stated at  acquisition cost. Any changes in the fair value of the growing forests are recognised in  the income statement. Holmens assessment is that there are no relevant market prices  availiable that can be used to value forest holdings as extensive as Holmens. They are  therefore valued by estimating the present value of expected future cash flows from the  growing forests. See note 11. In the parent company, biological assets are valued in accordance with RFR 2.  This means that biological assets classified as non-current assets are recognised  at acquisition cost adjusted for revaluations taking into account the need, if any, for  impairment in value.  Holmen Annual report 2010 61 Felling rights are stated as inventories. They are acquired with a view to secure   Holmens raw material requirements through harvesting. Any measurable biological  change does not occur between the acquisition date and harvesting. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition cost or production cost after  deduction for necessary obsolescence, or net realisable value. The acquisition cost  of inventories is calculated by using the First in, First out method (FIFO). The net realis- able value is the estimated selling price in operating activities after deduction of the  estimated costs of completion and effecting the sale. The acquisition cost of finished  products manufactured by the company comprises direct production costs and a  reasonable share of indirect costs.  Emission allowances received are initially recognised at market price when allotted  among inventories and as deferred income. During the year the allocation is recognised  as income at the same time as an interim liability, corresponding to emissions made, is  expensed. employee benefits Pension costs and pension commitments Commitments to pay premiums to defined contribution plans are recognised as a cost  in the income statement as and when they are earned. The Groups net commitment in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated sepa- rately for each plan by estimating the future benefits the em ployees will have earned  by virtue of their employment in current and earlier periods; these benefits are dis- counted to their present value and any unrecognised costs in respect of employment  during earlier periods and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount  rate is the interest rate at the balance sheet date for a first class corporate bond with  a duration corresponding to the Groups pension commitments. If there is no active  market for such corporate bonds, the market interest rate for government bonds with  a corresponding duration is used instead. The calculation is performed by a qualified  actuary using the projected unit credit method for the part of the pension commit- ments that is defined benefit.  When the present value of the commitments and the fair value of plan assets are  being determined, actuarial gains and losses may arise, either as a result of the actual  outcome deviating from earlier assumptions or because the assumptions are changed.  Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. When the benefits provided by a plan are improved, the proportion of the improvement  in the benefit that is attributable to the employees employment during earlier periods is  recognised as a cost in the income statement and is distributed on a straight-line basis  over the average period until the benefits have been fully earned. If the  benefit has been  earned in full, a cost is recognised directly in the income statement. In the parent companys accounts, different grounds are used for computation of  defined benefit pension plans than those referred to in IAS 19. The parent company  complies with the provisions of the Swedish pension security act (Tryggandelagen)  and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authoritys regulations, because this is a condi- tion for the right to make deductions for tax purposes. The main differences in relation  to the rules in IAS 19 relate to how the discount rate of interest is established, the  computation of the defined benefit commitment on the basis of the current pay level  without any assumption regarding pay increments in the future, and the recognition of  all actuarial gains and losses in the income statement when they arise. When there is a difference between how the pension cost is arrived at in the legal  entity and in the Group, a provision or a receivable is recognised in the consolidated  accounts in respect of special employers contribution tax based on this difference.  The present value of the provision or receivable is not calculated. Termination benefits Termination benefits in connection with the termination of employment contracts are  recognised in the accounts if it is shown that the Group has an obligation, without  any reasonable possibility of withdrawing it, as a result of a formal, detailed plan to  terminate an employment contract before the normal date. When benefits are paid in  the form of an offer to encourage voluntary departure, a cost is recognised if it is likely  that the offer will be accepted and the number of employees who will accept the offer  can be reliably estimated.  Short-term benefits Short-term benefits to employees are calculated without being discounted and are  recognised as a cost when the related services are provided.  Incentive scheme The Holmen Groups incentive scheme that runs from 2008 until 2013 is not subject  to the rules in IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, because the employees were invited to  acquire call options at their market price. equity Consolidated equity comprises share capital, other contributed capital, translation and  hedge reserves and retained earnings, including profit/loss for the year. Other contrib- uted capital refers to premiums paid in conjunction with share issues. The translation  reserve consists of all exchange differences that arise in the translation of foreign  operations financial statements that are prepared in a currency other than Swedish  kronor. The translation reserve also includes exchange differences arising in connec- tion with the revaluation of liabilities and derivatives that are classified as instruments  for hedging a net investment in a foreign operation, including tax. The hedge reserve  comprises the effective proportion of the accumulated net change in the fair value of a  cash flow hedging instrument attributable to underlying transactions that have not yet  occurred, including tax. Retained earnings comprise all other parts of equity, including  profit/loss for the year.  Holdings of shares bought back are stated as a reduction in retained earnings.  Acquisitions of the companys own shares are stated as a deduction, and proceeds  from the disposal of the companys own shares are stated as an increase. Transaction  costs are charged directly to retained earnings.  The parent companys equity comprises share capital, statutory reserves, re valuation  reserves, retained earnings and profit/loss for the year. The parent companys   statutory reserve consists of previous compulsory provisions to the statutory reserve  plus amounts added to the share premium reserve before 1 January 2006. The parent  companys revaluation reserve contains amounts set aside in connection with the  revaluation of property, plant and equipment or non-current financial assets. Retained  earnings comprise all other parts of equity, such as hedge reserves and transactions  as a result of share buy-backs. The parent company applies the same accounting  policies as the Group for these items; see above. Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or informal  commitment as a consequence of a past event and it is likely there will be an outflow  of financial resources to settle the commitment and a reliable estimate of the amount  can be made. A provision to cover restructuring is recognised once the Group has  established a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring process has  either begun or been publicly announced. Provisions are made for environmental measures that relate to earlier activities when  contamination arises or is discovered, it is likely that a payment obligation will arise,  and the amount can be estimated reliably. Reserves to cover future silvicultural fees are calculated on the basis of interpretations  of the applicable forestry laws and regulations whenever it is likely that a payment  obligation will arise and once the amount can be assessed to a reasonable extent.  Contingent liabilities  A contingent liability is recognised when there is a potential commitment that origi- nates in past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by one or more  uncertain future events, or when there is a commitment that is not recognised as a li- ability or provision because it is not likely that an out-flow of re sources will be required. Group contributions and shareholder   contributions for legal entities Group contributions and shareholder contributions are recognised in the parent com- pany in accordance with statement UFR 2 of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.  Shareholder contributions are recognised directly in the equity of the recipient and are  capitalised under the shares and participating interests of the donor to the extent that  no impairment in value applies. Group contributions are recognised on the basis of  their financial implications. For example, this means that Group contributions paid or  received in order to minimise the Groups total tax are recognised directly in retained  earnings after deduction of their current tax effect. Miscellaneous The figures presented are rounded off to the nearest integer or equivalent.   The absence of a value is indicated by a dash (-).  Holmen Annual report 2010 62 NoTe 2.

Iggesund Paperboard produces paperboard for  consumer packaging and graphics printing at one Swedish and one UK mill. Holmen  Timber produces sawn timber at one Swedish sawmill. Production at another sawmill  in Sweden started at the turn of 2010/2011. Annual production capacity in 2010 was   1 915 000 tonnes of printing paper, 530 000 tonnes of paperboard and 310 000 cubic  metres of sawn timber. Holmen Skog manages the Groups forests, which cover just  over one million hectares. The normal annual volume of wood harvested in company  forests is about 2.5 million cubic metres. Holmen Energi is responsible for the Groups  hydro power assets and for developing the Groups operations in the energy sector.  Normal yearly production amounts to some 1 100 GWh of electricity at wholly and  partly owned hydro power stations in Sweden. Holmen Skog and Holmen Energi are  also responsible for supplying the Group with wood and electricity in Sweden, which  are important raw materials for the industrial operations.  In the Holmen Group, the business areas are responsible for management of   operational assets and liabilities. Operating capital in each segment includes all assets  and liabilities used by the business area, such as non-current assets,  inventories,  operating receivables and operating liabilities. Financing and tax  issues are managed  at Group level, so financial assets and liabilities – including pension liabilities – and cur- rent and deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are not allocated to the business areas.  Intra-Group sales between segments are founded on an internal market-based price.  The Group-wide and other segment comprises Group staff units and Group-wide  functions that are not allocated to other segments.

Salary and other remuneration the remuneration of the ceO and the senior management shall consist of a fixed  market-based salary. Other benefits, mainly car and accommodation, shall, insofar as  they are provided, represent a limited part of the remuneration. no variable remunera- tion shall be paid. Pension the normal retirement age shall be 65 years. the company and the employee shall  be mutually entitled to request that pension be drawn from 60 years of age. Any  pension drawn before 65 years of age shall be either defined benefit or defined  contribution. pension drawn after 65 years of age shall be in accordance with the Itp  plan. Over and above this, the employee may also be entitled to a supplementary old  age pension. In this case, there shall be a gradual transition from the former existing  arrangement with a defined benefit pension to one in which the pension is defined  contribution.  Notice and severance pay notice of employment termination should normally be one year if it is given by the  company, and six months if it is given by the employee. In the event of notice being  given by the company, severance pay can be paid corresponding to no more than   24 months salary. For new contracts, salary during the period of notice and sever- ance pay shall not exceed a total amount equivalent to two years salary. Incentive scheme Any decision on a share-based and share-price-based incentive scheme for senior  company management shall be made by the AGm.  Remuneration committee A remuneration committee appointed from among the members of the Board shall  prepare business pertaining to the ceOs salary and other conditions of employment  and submit proposals on such issues to the Board for decision. Detailed principles for  determining the salaries, pension rights and other remuneration to senior management  shall be laid down in a pay policy adopted by the remuneration committee.  Departures in individual cases the Board shall be entitled to depart from these guidelines in individual cases should  special reasons exist. In the event of such a departure, information thereon and the  reasons therefor shall be submitted to the next Annual General meeting. Incentive scheme the 2008 AGm approved the Boards proposal to introduce an incentive scheme  for the Holmen Groups employees; it has applied in the Group since may 2008. In  the scheme, the employees were invited to acquire call options on class B shares in  Holmen at market price (calculated by an independent bank). As a result, 1 492 of the  Groups approximately 5 000 employees bought a total of 758 300 call  options at a  price of SeK 20 per option. the exercise price of the options is SeK 224.50 per share.  each option entitles the owner to acquire one share during the exercise period in may/ June 2013. Holmens commitment within the scheme has been secured by means of  a buyback of shares in the company. IFrS 2 Share-based payment is not applicable, because the employees acquired the  options at a market-based price.  Remuneration of Board and senior  management Board A fixed Board fee shall be paid to the members of the Board elected by the AGm,  except for the ceO, who does not receive any Board fee. For 2010, the fee amounted  to SeK 2 475 000 (2 475 000). the chairman received a fee of SeK 550 000   (550 000), and each of the other members (except for the ceO) received   SeK 275 000 (275 000). Senior management the ceOs salary and other benefits for 2010 amounted to SeK 7 366 343   (6 768 603). In 2010, the total pension cost attributable to the ceO (Itp cost and the  cost of benefits over and above Itp), calculated in accordance with IAS 19, amounted  to SeK 3 989 060 (3 263 711). no variable remuneration was paid. In 2010, the salaries and other benefits of the other senior management, i.e. the five  business area managers and the heads of the five Group staff units who report directly  to the ceO, amounted to a total of SeK 17 814 918 (18 206 318). the total pension  cost (Itp cost and the cost of benefits over and above Itp),  calculated in accordance  with IAS 19, for this group amounted to SeK 9 456 367 (10 897 672) in 2010.   no variable remuneration was paid. For senior management, the company is required to give 12 months notice and the  employee six months. In the event of notice being given by the company, termination  benefits corresponding to between one and two years  salary are paid, depending on  age. For the ceO, a termination benefit of two years salary is paid. All members of senior management are employed by the parent company. Pension commitments in respect of the Board and senior management Holmens pension commitments over and above the Itp plan for the ceO amounted  to SeK 17 million (15) at 31 December 2010 and for other members of senior man- agement to SeK 53 million (63), calculated in accordance with IAS 19. the Group also  has a SeK 7 million (7) commitment for one Board member, Gran Lundin, former  ceO of Holmen. the pension commitments are secured using plan assets managed  by an independent pension fund.

Deferred tax liability in respect of  property, plant and equipment is primarily attributable to depreciation in  excess of  plan. for information concerning provisions for taxes see note 26. the deferred tax expense recognised in the Groups income statement relates pri- marily to a change in temporary differences and utilisation of loss carry-forwards. the  amount recognised in other comprehensive income includes deferred tax related to  negative changes of SeK 181 million in hedging reserves (239) and negative impact of  SeK 28 million from actuarial revaluations (4). of the deferred tax asset in respect of the carry-forwards of unused tax losses,   a sum of SeK 56 million relates to loss carry-forwards with no time limitations   regarding when they may be utilised. other loss carry-forwards expire if they are  not utilised 2015–2022. the carry-forwards of unused tax losses and temporary  differences for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised in the income  statement or balance sheet amount to SeK 3 220 million, of which SeK 200 million  expire in 2011 and SeK 1 380 million expire 2022–2025. Whether a deferred tax asset  is recognised or not depends on an assessment of how likely it is that the Group will  be able to utilise it by offsetting it against future taxable profits.

A total of 760 000 class B shares were bought back, which  corresponds to approximately 0.9 per cent of the total number of shares outstanding,  and to approximately 0.3 per cent of the total number of votes. the average price paid  for these shares was SeK 201.70 per share. In all, 758 300 call options were issued at a price of SeK 20 per option. the  exercise  price of the options is SeK 224.50 per share. each option entitles the owner to  acquire one share during the exercise period, may/June 2013. the exercise price of SeK 224.50 exceeds the average share price for 2010   (SeK 195 per share). the options will therefore have no dilution effect as defined in   IAS 33, and were excluded from the calculation of diluted epS.

In 2010, impairment losses of   SeK 555 million  were recognised in the Holmen paper business area following the  decision to shut down one of the paper machines at the mill in madrid. for 2009,  impairment losses of SeK 22 million on property, plant and equipment were attributable  to the shut-down of a board machine at Workington mill that belongs to the Iggesund  paperboard business area. the years investments were reduced by SeK 2 million (2) as a result of the support  received from the Swedish energy Agency of SeK 40 million in total for the construction  of a new pulp line at Braviken paper mill.  the Groups investment commitments for approved and ongoing projects amounted to  SeK 2 130 million (1 581) at 31 December 2010. the companys capitalised borrowing  costs were SeK 24 million (1) in 2010 and are recognised as Work in progress and  advance payments to suppliers. An interest rate of 4 per cent (3) was used to determine  the amount.  the assessed tax values are determined by the Swedish tax Agency by means of a  property assessment and are then used for determining the property tax charge.   no property tax is charged on forest land. Note 11. Biological assets forest assets are recognised in the Group as growing forest, which is stated as a  biological asset at fair value, and land, which is stated at acquisition cost. Holmens  assessment is that no relevant market prices are available that can be used to value  forest holdings as extensive as Holmens. the valuation is therefore made by calculat- ing the present value of future expected cash flows from the growing forests. this  calculation of cash flows is made for the coming 100 years, which is regarded as the  harvesting cycle of the forests. the cash flows are calculated on the basis of harvest- ing volumes according to Holmens current harvesting plan and assessments of future  price and cost changes. the cost of re-planting has been taken into account, because  re-planting after harvesting is a statutory obligation.  In total, Holmen owns 1 032 100 hectares of productive forest land, with a volume of  120 million cubic metres of standing volume, of which 68 500 hectares with 13 million  cubic metres of standing volume have been set aside as nature reserves. the current  harvesting plan, which came into effect in 2000, is based on harvesting during the  2000–2009 period of on average 2.5 million m3 of timber and pulpwood per year. the  same plan states that the annual harvesting for the 2010–2019 period will be more than  1 per cent higher. the harvesting volume is then planned to increase gradually and then  stabilise at about 3.0 million m3 per year in about 40 years time. this corresponds to  an average increase in harvesting of 0.4 per cent per year. Just over 50 per cent of the  wood harvested consists of timber that is sold to sawmills, and the remainder mainly  consists of pulpwood, which is sold to the pulp and paper industry. A new harvesting  plan is estimated to be complete in 2011 and may entail different harvesting rates. In 2010, cash flow from the growing forests rose to SeK 673 million (552), mainly as a  result of higher prices and more harvesting. on average, the cash flows in 2001–2009  amounted to approximately SeK 510 million per year. Holmen based its valuation of  31 December 2010 on the prices prevailing at the end of the year. An assumption  has been made that prices will fall somewhat in 2012, see the following graph. from  2012 and thereafter, long-term price assumptions have been used, with an annual  increase of 1 per cent until 2035 and thereafter a rise of 2 per cent a year. the cash  flow forecast for 2011–2016 is shown in the following figure. costs are estimated to  increase from present-day levels by about 2 per cent per year. the price and cash  flows for the period 2017–2035 are estimated to increase by 0.5 per cent per year,  after which they are expected to increase broadly in line with the assumed level of  inflation of 2 per cent.

Deferred tax, i.e. the tax that is expected to be charged against the earnings from  harvesting in the future, has been calculated on the total value of growing forests. the value of the forest assets was estimated at the end of 2010 at  SeK 12 161 million, i.e. the value of the estimated cash flows before tax. the attribut- able deferred tax liability was estimated at SeK 3 241 million. the net  carrying amount  after tax of the growing forests was SeK 8 920 million.   the change in the value of the growing forests can be divided into: 2010 2009 group opening balance  11 109 11 080 Acquisition of growing forest 8 5 Sales of growing forest  0 0 change due to harvesting  -673 -552 change in fair value 1 775 568 other changes -57 8 closing carrying amount 12 161 11 109 the net effect of the change in fair value and the change as a result of harvesting is  stated in the income statement as change in value of biological assets. In 2010, this  amounted to SeK 1 102 million (16). of this amount, SeK 1 050 million is due to the  assumption about future wood prices in the valuation being raised by just under 4  per cent. following this, the long-term price level in the valuation is about 10 per cent  lower than the current market prices for wood. the table below shows how the value of forest assets would be affected by changes  in the most significant valuation assumptions:  chaNGE iN valuE (SEKm) group Before tAx After tAx Annual change, + 0.1% per year    Harvesting rate 470 350    price inflation 430 320    cost inflation -250 -180 change in level, +1%    Harvesting 170 120    prices 310 230    costs -160 -120 Discount rate, +0.1% -280 -200 Annual change refers to the annual rate of change used in the valuation of each   parameter. for example, an increase of 0.1 per cent means that the annual price   inflation will be increased from 1.0 per cent to 1.1 per cent in the calculations. change  in level means that the level for each parameter and year changes. for  example, a   1 per cent price increase means that the wood prices in the calculations are raised by   1 per cent for all years (change of level).

At 31 december 2010 the groups own shareholding was 760 000 shares   (760 000). none of the groups own shares were sold during the year.  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value according to chapter 4 section 14a of  the swedish Annual Accounts Act had an impact of seK 913 million (132) on parent  company equity. in the group, valuation of derivatives and other financial instruments  had an impact of seK 750 million (96) on equity. Holmens profitability target is a return that is consistently above the market  based cost of capital. decisions on ordinary dividend are based on an appraisal of the  groups profitability, future investment plans and financial position. the aim is to have  a robust financial position with a debt/equity ratio in the interval of 0.3–0.8.  the board proposes that the Agm, to be held on 30 march 2011, approves a divi dend of seK 7 per share. the proposed dividend totals seK 588 million. the preced ing year, the dividend paid was seK 7 per share (seK 588 million).  the debt/equity ratio was 0.34 (0.34).  neither the parent company nor the subsidiaries are subject to external capital require ments, except for Holmen Frskring Ab, the groups insurance company, which  complies with the swedish Financial supervisory Authoritys regulations on the ratio  between equity and risk. For more details about the groups capital management and  risk management, see the administration report on pages 3639.  Holmen Annual report 2010 79 Note 17. Pension provisions Holmen has defined benefit occupational pension plans for its salaried employees in  Sweden (ITP plan) and for most of its employees in the UK. These plans provide ben- efits based on final salary and period of employment. The scheme in the UK has been  closed for new entrants since the end of June 2004. Since then, new employees have  been offered a defined contribution pension scheme. Occupational pension plans for  blue-collar employees in Sweden are defined contribution plans. The commitments arising out of the pension schemes in the UK are placed in trusts.  The defined benefit commitments over and above the ITP plan for Group manage- ment in Sweden are secured by means of a pension fund. These commitments are  recognised in the consolidated accounts as defined benefit plans in accordance  with IAS 19. Most of the defined benefit pension commitments on behalf of salaried  employees in Sweden are secured by means of insurance policies with Alecta. As  Alecta cannot provide sufficient information to permit the ITP plan to be stated in the  accounts as a defined benefit plan it is stated in accordance with statement UFR 6  of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board as a de fined contribution plan. The years  premiums for pension insurance policies taken out with Alecta amounted to SEK  36 million (37), of which SEK 34 million (35)  relates to old age and family pensions.  These are included among staff costs in the income statement. Alectas surplus can  be allocated to policyholders and/or the persons insured. At the end of 2010, Alectas  collective consolidation level was 146 per cent (141).

The county Administrative court ruled against the company in January 2010.  Holmen has appealed against the judgment to the Administrative court of Appeal.   Holmen previously made provision for any costs, and the judgment did not therefore  have any impact on earnings, but entailed a tax payment of SEK 611 million in 2010. Other provisions primarily relate to obligations to restore the environment, as well  as staff costs and restructuring costs. The parent company figures also include a  provision to cover coming reforestation measures to be taken after completion of final  harvesting (SEK 161 million); the measures are normally carried out within three years  of harvesting. In 2010, new provisions made were primarily for restructuring within Holmen Paper  and restoration of the environment. At the end of 2010, provisions of around   SEK 250 million had been made to cover restructuring costs regarding staff cuts.  These are mainly expected to be paid out in 2011. Note 19.

Fair values of derivatives relate substantially to hedging future cash flows; see note 13. Note 20. Operating leases In 2010, the Groups lease payments amounted to SEK 26 million (25), and the parent  companys to SEK 8 million (9). The Groups lease agreements relate to forklift trucks.  no new lease agreements of any significance for the business were entered into dur- ing the 2010 financial year. no leased equipment was rented out. The breakdown of future lease payments is as follows:   GROUP PAREnT cOMPAny   2011 2012  –2016   2017–   2011 2012  –2016   2017– Future lease   payments 21 25   0 5   -   - Present value   of future lease   payments 20 22   0 5 - - The contracts have remaining durations ranging from 1 to 7 years. The Groups future  lease payments for existing lease agreements amounted to SEK 40 million at the end  of 2009. Those in the parent company amounted to SEK 8 million. Apart from lease agreements, Holmen has time charter contracts in respect of 5 ships  that are used to distribute the companys products. The contracts were entered into in  2006 and 2010 and run for a remaining 1 to 6 years.

The parent companys purchases from  Group companies amounted to SEK 141 million (143). There are significant financial receivables and liabilities between the parent company  and its Swedish subsidiaries, which do not carry interest. The parent company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries (see note 23). l E lundbergfretagen AB is a large shareholder in Holmen (see page 42). Holmen  rents office premises for SEK 7 million (7) from Fastighets AB l E lundberg, which is   a group company within l E lundbergfretagen AB. In 2010, Fredrik lundberg, who  is cEO and principal shareholder in l E lundbergfretagen, received a fee of   SEK 550 000 as Board chairman of Holmen. Transactions with related parties are priced at market-based conditions. The equity  holdings in associates that produce hydro and wind power entitle the Group to buy  the electricity produced at cost price in relation to the shareholding, which means  that the associate only earns a limited profit. Purchased electricity is sold to external  customers at market price, and the earnings are stated in the consolidated  accounts  within the Holmen Energi business area.

Re- sponsibility for restoring the environment is determined from case to case, often with  the aid of a reasonability assessment. Holmen has environment-related contingent  liabilities that cannot at present be quantified, but that could involve costs in the future.  Holmen Annual report 2010 82 Note 23.

In 2010, a number of different short-term loans amounting  in total to SEK 5 425 million (8 760) were raised within the Groups commercial paper  programme, and SEK 4 405 million (9 295) was repaid. For a specification of cash and  cash equivalents, see note 13. Note 26.  Key assessments and estimates When preparing financial reports the companys management is required to make  assessments and estimates that have an effect on the stated amounts. The as- sessments and estimates that, in the view of the companys management, are of  importance for the amounts stated in the annual report, and that are at significant risk  of being altered by future events and new information, mainly include:  Biological assets  Holmens assessment is that no relevant market prices are available that can be used  to value forest holdings as extensive as Holmens. The valuation is therefore made by  calculating the present value of future expected cash flows from the growing forests.  The most material estimates made relate to how much harvesting can be increased   in the future, what changes there will be in pulpwood and timber prices, how high  inflation will be, and what discount rate is used. note 11  provides a sensitivity analysis  for the valuation of changes in these estimates. In 2010, estimates of future wood  prices were changed, which increased the carrying amount of biological assets by   SEK 1 050 million in excess of a normal change in value. The attributable deferred tax  liability increased by SEK 276 million. The carrying amount of biological assets at   31 December 2010 was SEK 12 161 million and the attributable deferred tax liability  was SEK 3 241 million, giving a net value of SEK 8 920 million. Tax Holmen has one large tax case still in progress, affecting MoDo capital, a Holmen  subsidiary. In January 2010, the county Administrative court ruled against the com- pany, resulting in a tax payment of SEK 611 million. Holmen previously made provision  for any costs and the judgment did not therefore have any impact on earnings.   Holmen has appealed against the judgment to the Administrative court of Appeal.   See notes 7, 18 and 21. net deferred tax assets of SEK 210 million are recgonised in the consolidated   accounts on the basis of the assessment that it will probably be possible to utilise  them to reduce tax payments in the future. Over and above this, at year-end the  Group had loss carry-forwards and tax-related temporary differences corresponding to  tax of some SEK 950 million not stated in the consolidated accounts on the grounds  for assessment that utilisation must be likely. See note 7.  Pensions The Groups provision for pensions amounts to SEK 213 million on the basis of defined  benefit pension commitments valued at SEK 1 650 million and plan assets of   SEK 1 438 million provided to cover them. The value of pension commitments is  estimated on the basis of assumptions regarding discount rates, inflation, future pay in- creases, and demographic factors. These assumptions are normally updated each year,  which has an effect on the size of the recognised pension liability and equity. Together  with assumptions regarding the expected return on plan assets, these assumptions will  have an influence on the coming years recognised pension cost. See note 17. environment Provisions to cover environment-related measures associ ated with former activities  have been made based on estimated future site-restoration costs. Moreover it is  judged that the company has a responsbility for environ mental measures that cannot  at present be quantified but that could involve costs in the future. See note 21. restructuring Major staff cuts at Hallsta Paper Mill and at the paper mill in Madrid are in progress  and one of the paper machines in Madrid will be shut down in spring 2011. At the end  of 2010, provisions of about SEK 250 million had been made to cover the restructur- ing costs. no additional major changes have been announced, but, should the situa- tion alter, further provisions may become necessary. impairment testing Holmen has an obligation to carry out regular impairment testing to determine the  need to state new impairment losses and/or reversals. In 2007 impairment losses of  SEK 1 603 million were recognised on goodwill and property, plant and equipment  within the Holmen Paper business area. This impairment was based on estimates of  recoverable amounts using assumptions regarding future  changes in prices, volumes  and costs, as well as the estimated market cost of capital. In 2010, further impairment  losses of SEK 555 million on property, plant and equipment were recognised in the  Spanish operation of the Holmen Paper business area as a result of the approach- ing shut-down of one of the paper machines in Madrid. changes in conditions may  have an effect on the estimated recoverable amount applied in connection with future  impairment tests.  Holmen Annual report 2010 84 Appropriation of profits The Board of Holmen AB has proposed that the 2011 Annual General Meeting resolves  in favour of paying a dividend of SEK 7 per share, a total of SEK 588 million, which is  unchanged compared to the preceding year. The proposal complies with the Boards  policy, in that decisions on dividend are to be based on an appraisal of the Groups  profitability, future investment plans and financial position.                     The proposed dividend corresponds to 84 per cent of net profit for 2010 and means  that 3.5 per cent of equity in the Group at 31 December 2010 will be paid out by way of  dividend.  The Board has established that the Group shall have a strong financial position with  a debt/equity ratio – defined as net financial debt in relation to equity – in the interval  between 0.3 and 0.8. The debt/equity ratio at 31 December 2010 was 0.34. Payment of  the proposed dividend would raise the debt/equity ratio by around 0.05.                 Holmen ABs equity at 31 December 2010 amounted to SEK 11 149 million, of which  non-restricted equity was SEK 5 235 million. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value  according to Chapter 4 Section 14a of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act had an impact  of SEK 913 million on equity. The Groups equity at 31 December 2010 amounted to  SEK 16 913 million. Complying with IFRS, no distinction is made at Group level between  restricted and non-restricted equity. The Board considers that payment of a dividend of the amount proposed is justifiable in  view of the demands made on the company and the Group by the nature, extent and  risks associated with the business in terms of the amount of equity required, and taking  into account the need for consolidation, liquidity and financial position in other respects.  The financial position will remain strong after payment of the proposed dividend and is  considered to be fully adequate to  enable the company to fulfil its obligations in both the  short and the long term, as well as to finance such investments as may be necessary.  The Board and CEO declare that the annual report was prepared in accordance with ge- nerally accepted accounting principles in Sweden and the Groups financial statements  were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards referred to in  the European Parliaments and Councils regulation (EG) No. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002  concerning the application of international accounting standards. The annual report and  the Groups financial statements provide a true and fair picture of the performance and  financial position of the parent company and the Group. The administration report for  the parent company and the Group provides a true and fair picture of the development  of the operations, financial position and performance of the Group and the parent com- pany and also describes material risks and uncertainties to which the parent company  and the other companies in the Group are exposed. The annual report and the Groups financial statements were approved for publication  by the Board in its decision of 23 February 2011. The Groups income statement and  balance sheet and the parent companys income statement and balance sheet will be  presented for adoption at the Annual General Meeting that will be held on 30 March  2011.

Corporate identity No. 556001-3301 Our audit report was submitted on 24 February 2011. KPMG AB George Pettersson Authorised public accountant We have audited the annual report, the Groups financial statements, the accounting records and the  administration of the Board of Directors and the CEO of Holmen AB for the year 2010. The annual report  and the Groups financial statements are included in the printed version of this document on pages 4–84.  The Board of Directors and the CEO have responsibility for these accounts and the administration of the  company as well as for the application of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act when preparing the annual  report and the application of international financial reporting standards, IFRSs, as adopted by the EU and  the Swedish Annual Accounts Act when preparing the Groups financial statements. Our responsibility is to  express our opinion on the annual report, the Groups financial statements and the administration on the  basis of our audit.  We carried out our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Those stan- dards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain reasonable but not absolute assurance that the  annual report and the Groups financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit includes  examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the accounts. An audit  also includes assessing the  accounting principles used and their application by the Board of Directors and  the CEO and significant estimates made by the Board of Directors and the CEO when preparing the annual  report and the Groups financial statements as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the information  in the annual report and the Groups financial statements. As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge  from liability, we examined significant decisions,  actions taken and circumstances of the company in order  to be able to determine the liability, if any, to the company of any Board member or the CEO. We also  examined whether any board member or the CEO in any other way acted in contravention of the Swedish  Companies Act, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. We  believe that our audit  provides a reasonable basis for our opinion set out below.  The annual report was prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and gives a true and  fair view of the companys financial position and the  result of its operations in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles in Sweden. The Groups financial statements were prepared in accordance  with international financial reporting standards, IFRSs, as adopted by the EU and the Swedish Annual  Accounts Act and give a true and fair view of the Groups financial position and the result of its operations.  A corporate governance report has been drawn up. The administration report and corporate governance  report are consistent with the other parts of the annual report and the consolidated financial statements. We recommend to the Annual General Meeting of shareholders that the income statements and balance  sheets of the parent company and the Group be adopted, that the profit of the parent company be dealt  with in accordance with the proposal in the administration report and that the members of the Board   of Directors and the CEO be discharged from liability for the financial year.

The next one will be in 2011. Data from all parts of the Group are collected in the same way, col- lated and quality-assured. The key indicators for HR data are those  in common use in the industry. Most of the indicators are collected  monthly through the pay systems.  No material changes have been made to the principles of reporting  in comparison with the previous year, except that the accident rate is  now reported in the same way as is done in the rest of the industry.  The figures for 2006–2009 have been corrected.   As some of the information provided in this report had already  been collected by the end of the year it refers to, it might differ  slightly from the information finally reported to the authorities. Some  of the HR and environmental data now reported for 2009 may there- fore have been revised.   One of the board machines at Workington Mill was closed down  in December 2009. Workforce reductions were made at Braviken  Paper Mill in 2010. This has affected the reporting for 2010. Figures  reported for previous years have not been corrected.   The licensing authorities conditions relating to emissions to air  and water stipulate regular sampling in accordance with specific  rules. Holmen reports its environmental data to the supervisory  authorities monthly and annually.

Costs of the installation for treatment of wastewater at the same mill also  account for a significant share of the sum stated. 2)  Most of the stated sum comprises environmentally related parts of the recovery boiler project at Iggesund Mill. En- vironmentally related costs to improve the efficiency of energy use at Workington Mill also account for a significant  portion. 3)  About 40 per cent of the costs consist of carbon dioxide tax paid. Costs of bought-in water for and waste mana   gement at Holmen Paper Madrid also account for significant portions of the amount stated. 4)  This includes costs of environmental personnel, operation of cleaning equipment, waste management, supervi- sion, applications for permits and various types of environmental consultants. 5)  The environmental cost of forestry is estimated as the value of the wood that is not harvested for environmental  reasons. Holmen sets aside around 10 per cent of its productive forest acreage and thus refrains from harvesting  around 10 per cent of the potential volume. The annual loss of income is estimated at around SEK 70 million.

Back-pressure power is produced at the mills.  The electricity that is purchased in Sweden is mainly  produced at hydro or nuclear power stations. At Iggesund Mill large amounts of thermal energy  are produced by burning wood-containing liquors.  Significant quantities are also generated by burning  bark. At Hallsta and Braviken Paper Mills surplus heat  is recovered from the TMP production process. Natural  gas is used at the mills in Workington and Madrid. Energy supply at Holmen 2010 Comments on the table on page 88 1)  At Group level, wood consumption is computed net, taking into account internal deliveries of chips from the Iggesund Sawmill to Iggesund Mill. 2) 100 per cent active substance. 3)  Thermal energy is produced from the electricity used in the production of thermo-mechanical pulp at Braviken Paper Mill and Hallsta Paper Mill; this is recovered and used in  production. 4)  The reporting includes data for gas consumption and associated emissions linked to Holmens share of electricity production at the half-owned cogeneration (COGEN) plant at  Holmen Paper Madrid. The supply of heating from the facility is also included. 5) In 2010, emissions of fossil carbon dioxide from production of purchased thermal energy and electricity totalled approximately 245 000 tonnes. 6)  Hazardous waste is dealt with by an authorised collection and recovery contractor. Oil-containing waste from docking ships is dealt with at port facilities at three Holmen mills.  The volume of this waste in 2010 totalled 1 360 tonnes. 7) The figure has been corrected. 8) Waste used, for example, as filling material, construction material or for the production of soil products. 9) For delivery to the chemical industry.
