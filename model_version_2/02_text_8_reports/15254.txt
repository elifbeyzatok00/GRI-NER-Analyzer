Our mission covers three key areas: leadership, com- mitment to the community and the environment, and  the third aspect, not least important, the development  of our employees. In 2010, we made sure to monitor  the quality of all these aspects of performance that  made us obtain for the fifth consecutive year the SRC  distinction, improving our score in all indicators. Today, we are a much safer company thanks to the  implementation of the ongoing program A.L.E.R.T.A.  (Logical Actions to Prevent Accidents and Occupa- tional Hazards); the entire workforce was trained in  this matter. Sincerely Victor M. Ochoa General Director We also stand out as a healthy company because  we received the White Flag certification by the  Mexican Social Security Institute after join- ing their program of surveillance and control of  health, VICORSAT. We are still growing steadily. The 2010 was the  best productive year in our history; this compels us  to continue on the path of international competi- tiveness, sustainability and social inclusion. In the following pages we describe all of the above.  Granjas Carroll de Mexico (GCM), today at this pre- cise moment in time, is established as a national  leader in pork production, it is a Mexican com- pany with international performance standards,  socially responsible, incorporating environmen- tally friendly technologies in their processes. It  started operations in 1993; its aim is to offer the  market the best quality meat, fulfilling this with  all health and environmental standards required  by national and international bodies. This is GCM  Sustainability Report GCM 2010 This is GCM 9 8 Considered the most technologically advanced in the country, GCM has  16 farms installed in the valleys of Perote and Guadalupe Victoria, a re- gion bordering the states of Veracruz and Puebla, which are continu- ously improving husbandry techniques. This translates into an annual  production of one million 200 thousand heads, on average, contribut- ing with 13% of total pork produced in the country, getting the first  place nationally while ranked 24 worldwide..  For his work philosophy, which includes the continuing search for a  better life for employees and surrounding communities, as well as em- phasis on respect and preservation of the environment, Granjas Carroll  de Mexico has been certified for five consecutive years as a Socially  Responsible Company.   The company is composed of an equal partnership between - Agroindustrias Unidas de Mxico, S.A.

Sustainability Report GCM 2010 This is GCM 15 14 The success of GCM in the long-term depends on the ability to continu- ally improve our environmental performance. In GCM, environmental care is a value with equal importance to produc- tion, sales, bio-security and costs. We are committed to the well-being of our customers, employees, sup- pliers, shareholders and neighbors in the communities where we work  and live. GCM demands all employees and stakeholders to participate in its activi- ties to maintain a high commitment and visible responsibility in imple- menting this environmental policy.

Sustainability Report GCM 2010 This is GCM 23 22 The effort we make every day in our work has paid off. Thanks to the opportune completion of our mission  by applying our values, we have passed every health and environmental examinations to which we have  been subjected to, we have obtained outstanding results at all times. Since 2007, we have been awarded the So- cially Responsible Company recognition by  the Mexican Center for Philanthropy (Cemefi),  because we have met the established param- eters. The one obtained in 2010 was got with  outstanding grades.     A responsible sustainable company cares to meet the needs  of the present generation without compromising the needs of  future generations.  In addition the environmental impact of their  activities, sustainability takes into account issues ranging from em- ployee satisfaction, quality of its products, the origin of their inputs, to  the social and economic impact that it generates for the development  of a country. This is GCM CORPORATE   Quality Assurance  A fundamental part of our Corporate Responsibility  activities is aimed at ensuring the welfare of our em- ployees. Besides the social security benefits, we have ongo- ing medical care for staff and their immediate fami- lies, the implementation of a new security program  that debuted in 2010, the ongoing training available  to every employee of any area in different areas of  interest, scholarships for their children as well as  recreational activities and promotion of sport. We  believe that those who work at this company have a  wide range of possibilities for career development,  personal growth and family welfare. In 2010, we invested a total of $ 2496, 377.97 for  this area. Quality of life  in the company In Granjas Carroll de Mexico we know  that our most valuable asset is human  capital.

In GCM we look after the health of our workers and  that is why in 2010, for the first time, we applied the  test VICORSAT (Monitoring and Control in Health and  Labor Risks), through this we could obtain a general  diagnosis of our staff. Health aspects were evaluated,  A healthy business not only physical ones but also occupational ones  such as tiredness and work habits. The benefit  was for the entire workforce, 1,007 employees  until August. We obtained the White Flag  Certification because of our  positive health indices.  Sustainability Report GCM 2010 Quality of life in the company 33 32 This program is based primarily on prevention: its ob- jective is to measure the risk factors of the working  population. It is done in combination with the federal  program PREVENIMSS and we will apply it every year.  In 2011, at an event organized by the delega- tion of the IMSS in Perote, the white flag certi- fication will be awarded.  84% of workers had an optimal blood pressure,  74% had good cholesterol and triglyceride levels,  and 74% is in good physical condition, while the  propensity to diabetes occurred in only 2% of staff.  Tobacco and alcohol consumption is minimal, while  only 10% are at risk for osteoporosis. A.L.E.R.T.A.,  Safety First Although we have the institutional instruments  to avoid unsafe conditions in all areas, such as  signage, safe facilities and elements that com- ply with national and international regulations,  we believe that prevention of extraordinary  events is everybodys task. Thus, in accordance with our business ethics,  we implemented the program Logical Actions  to Prevent Accidents and Occupational  Hazards (ALERTA), its function is to provide  knowledge about accident and risk prevention  to over a thousand workers who make up Gran- jas Carroll de Mexico. In 2010 we began the first  stage of the workforce training, which aims to  raise awareness about situations that involve  risks. A second set of lectures about new issues  of equal importance in this area will take place  on the last quarter of 2011. Staff safety has always been our  priority.  Sustainability Report GCM 2010 34 How to make sure that the appropriate preventive  measures are carried out in each of the facilities  and for each activity? In the first instance, through  training, we rely on the responsible behavior of  each employee. In addition, we make available a  form to record and identify malpractices: the report  of alerts to the Security Department. We exhort  employees to have a more proactive involvement  to report any anomaly. The international con- sortium Smithfield recognized us as the part- ners with the best safety measures in August  2011, because of the performance shown in  2010 and the ALERTA program. The heart of our business is the pig production;  we use a process called Segregated Early Wean- ing System. In this process there are three main  phases that are developed at each specialized  site that our farms have: Site I. Farrowing (delivery units) Site II. Nursery (piglet units) Site III. Finishing (grow units) In 2010, a total of 668 936 different stage  pigs were housed in 72 modules that make up  the farms.  Operation  Sustainability Report GCM 2010 Business Ethics 37 36 We have a feed mill that processed 372 627 metric tons last year.   This is how we can directly monitor  the healthy nutrition of our animals. The balance of ingredients is set according to the role and stages  of life: nutritional requirements are different for pregnant sows, lactating sows and boars, or between  early weaned piglets, growing piglets, growing pigs and finishing pigs. Therefore we produce 13 differ- ent types of feed, to which vitamins (A, B, C and D) and minerals (calcium, phosphorus and sodium) are  added to ensure optimal development. 800 tons of grain a day, processed into pellets, is needed to meet the  feed needs of our herd A strict bio security scheme ensures  the protection of animal health. This  is an internal regulation, which is fol- lowed to the letter by each and ev- ery one of those who integrate GCM,  it is essential to respect this scheme  in order to maintain the quality of  our final product.  Sustainability Report GCM 2010 Business Ethics 39 38 Sales Report We reached record numbers last year. We started  2011 with the same momentum, and also with  many expectations because we are growing and we  are constantly improving our processes. Over a period of 12 months we achieved to sell our  total production 1 million 147 thousand 287  pigs for national consumption, surpassing the  estimated budget by 21 075 animals. This transla- tes into 133 millions 790 thousand 495 kilograms of  meat put on the market, this number exceeds that  of 2009 by 14 million 433 thousand 564 kilograms. 2010, the most productive year for GCM Pork Consumption per capita in Mexico  is 14 kilograms per year The average weight of sold pigs  was 116.61 kilograms, higher  than the average weight in 2009,  whose average was 114.28 Our main customers are in the states of Chiapas, Guanajua- to, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Morelos, Oaxaca, Puebla, Tabasco,  Tlaxcala and Veracruz, but especially the Federal District  and Mexico State, with 86.74% of total sales.

That is why the human factor plays a major  role in the organization and is divided as follows: Interest Groups Workers:  1,050 employees, our families and the union Owners:   Agroindustrias Unidas de Mexico and Smithfield Foods Clients:  TIF slaughter houses and butcher shops that prepare the meat  Internal The companys growth parallels the personal growth achieved by every employee who enters the ranks of this  company. Meanwhile, the quality of our products determines the preference of our customers, establishing  from this moment a business relationship with a high sense of mutual responsibility. Aware of the above, the  partners, AMSA and Smithfield Foods bet all decisions on the highest standards, this leads to the complete  achievement of our mission.

Through the GCM Foundation we have  started alliances with companies and in- stitutions to increase the number of ac- tions to benefit education, health, sports,  recreation, culture, community develop- ment and environmental care. Community Involvement In 2010, we invested a total of $ 6442, 730.43 for  this area.

Community development requires a great effort and  enthusiastic cooperation of the parties. As part of the  programs to improve the quality of life around us, a  focus on the surrounding communities was projected  under a proven methodology. We conducted a study in communities of Veracruz and  Puebla, those where the backwardness and poverty  Participatory rural development, a new stage are persist. This participatory rural appraisal, con- ducted for five months in 2010, marked a turning  point in the cyclical history of our company: ap- plying other community involvement mechanisms  based on individual needs.  Sustainability Report GCM 2010 Community Involvement 51 50 Applying a long term action plan, we intend to include other communities, giving feedback to the model and  seeking to establish permanent projects that meet business goals for its participants. We detected that the main causes that lead to stagnation in productive and social levels are middlemen, pests  and crop diseases, droughts and the lack of equipment. Field research allowed us to know the needs of each area, their strengths and weaknesses. At each place we  talked with members of the cooperatives, civil authorities and community representatives, this was how we  could design a specific action plan for each group and each village. At GCM we seek to strengthen the capacities of producers and  promote the full participation of the community. The self-sustainable development is the key to start  improving quality of life levels   These workshops, lectures, courses and anything else that provides tools for the agricultural worker, the goat  producer, housewives and even children can develop their skills and implement the lessons learned in his daily  life in order to contribute to productivity growth, economic and social development of their regions.

GCM joined the National Environmental Audit Pro- gram in 2005 in order to obtain the certification;  this program is administered by the Federal En- vironmental Protection Agency.  The facilities we  had at that time were: eight farms in the state of  Veracruz (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11 and 13) and five in the  state of Puebla (6, 7, 8, 9 and 12). After four years of being audited and having demon- strated compliance with action plans which included  corrective and preventive measures suggested by the  environmental authority, in 2009 we obtained the  Profepa certification for the farms located in Veracruz,  while for the ones located in Puebla we are in the final  stage of compliance with the federal standards. Our immediate goal is to obtain the Clean Industry  certification for the farms located in Puebla. We are  also looking forward to ratifying the certification ob- tained in 2009 for Veracruz and incorporating our  more recent farms (15, 16 and 17) and the Mainte- nance Workshop into the Environmental Audit Pro- gram in order to obtain the same certification.

In 2010, about 100 people (including suppliers, em- ployees, customers and GCM partners) focused on  planting 800 plants of the species white cedar and  stone pine, in the area near the San Carlos Fortress,  which is a historical symbol of the city of Perote. The treatment lagoons The system of wastewater treatment of our facilities  consists of four stages: The first stage takes place inside the farm, where  pig excreta passes through the slotted floor (slats)  and falls into the pit or flooded pit, built of mason- ry, this deposit is 0.30 m deep, that is the same width  and length of the pens where the pigs live. Sewage  water is kept here to disintegrate excreta and facili- tate bacteria to digest organic matter, and also to fa- cilitate its transport to the next stage of treatment. Sustainable Productive  Process  Sustainability Report GCM 2010 Environment Care 73 72 The second stage  is carried out in a primary lagoon or an anaerobic digester, which is a square  shaped structure dug into the ground and it is coated with a high density polyethylene membrane, it  is 1.52 mm width; the top is also coated with a membrane, so it forms a closed container or tank com- pletely waterproof.  The discharge pipes of the pits are connected to the digester, its task is to facilitate the natural fer- mentation or degradation of organic matter, which occurs in the absence of oxygen. The growth and  proliferation of methanogenic anaerobic bacteria transform the waste, the final product is a com- bustible gas called biogas, natural gas, marsh gas or methane (CH4). As a result there is also a small  amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), an effluent enriched in nutrients bio available to plants, and organic  stabilized matter. The water is kept in the digester from 35 to 40 days.  The third stage  takes place in a secondary or recycling lagoon where the treated wastewater is stored. When  these lagoons are built, a layer of compacted clay material (0.60 m thick) is essential to prevent water from infiltra- ting into the ground. From this lagoon the treated water is pumped back into the buildings to flood the pits again.  Since it is exposed to the environment, the secondary lagoon allows the evaporation of a small amount of water. The fourth stage takes place in the evaporation lagoon; it has a much larger area and less depth. Its main  function is to facilitate the excess water in the system to evaporate back to the atmosphere.  Sustainability Report GCM 2010 74 Collecting of Methane Another vital aspect of our production system is the co- llecting of the methane produced by our pigs through  the aforementioned system of digesters. Once organic  waste is converted into liquids and gases, once they are  separated, the next step is to burn the biogas to avoid  polluting emissions into the atmosphere.  Our goal is to use the methane as a power source that  supplies all our farms. We have a pilot project; two sites  are already being illuminated from the gas produced.  We are a social ecological company We donate a useful sub product to groups of producers in  the communities, organic fertilizer, it is obtained by having  completed the process of treating organic waste in the la- goons of our farms.
