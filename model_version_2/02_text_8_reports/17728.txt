We are able to look back at 2011 with pride having made significant strides in  fulfilling our mandate and thank God for his continued sustenance in making our  work possible.  This year we focused our attention on seeking associates who share our passion  to serve the less fortunate. I am pleased to record the positive response that has  enabled World Vision to forge new partnerships and collaborations. This year also witnessed several milestones including the closure of two  programmes after a 15-year journey. These communities have been developed  and transformed and can look forward to a future with better opportunities and  prospects. As they no longer require our presence we were able to expand our  reach to other vulnerable communities elsewhere in the country. This year also witnessed  several milestones  including the closure of two  programmes after a 15-year  journey. These communities  have been developed and  transformed and can look  forward to a future with  better opportunities and  prospects As a responsible NGO it is our duty to maintain both transparency and  accountability. In 2011 we remained firm in providing a more holistic view of our  work through the use of sustainability reporting. Sharing our best practices will  enhance our value among all stakeholders. I thank my colleagues on the Board whose shared passion to serve those less  fortunate continues with zeal. Their time and efforts are given selflessly and they  remain steadfast in chartering our next decade. During the last year the board was able to participate in several field visits to  observe first hand the positive results of our endeavours. On such visits I continue to  be amazed at the impacts we have made on peoples lives and the transformation  of the communities.   Our staff is our strength and asset. I thank our National Director Suresh Bartlett and  his committed staff for their hard work and dedication. It is their tireless efforts and  dedication that motivates and inspires World Vision onwards. It is with this perseverance and commitment that we will continue to help make a  difference in the lives of the children and less fortunate.

In both ADPs we left behind fully empowered communities who now have  ownership of their future development and sustainability. The changes we had  made in these two ADPs was especially heartening. Most families now have  access to clean drinking water, children are now back in school and enjoying  better health and nutrition. Children also have a space for their talents and  voice and families have better housing and sustainable livelihoods. Even as we transitioned from two ADPs we were able to commence three new  ones in the most remote and impoverished areas in Lunugala, Meegahakiula  and Rideemaliyadda. Among the many new programmes we initiated was one to improve the  mental health and well-being of communities in the northern province of Sri  Lanka as they recovered from three decades of war. The year 2011 was another significant year for WVL which saw unprecedented  growth of our programmes marked by some noteworthy achievements in new  approaches to our work. Our main focus during the year was on the forging of new linkages and  partnerships with both the public and the private sector and the humanitarian  community in a bid to broaden our reach and harness the synergies  offered by other like minded organizations. This enabled us to reach out to  a greater number of communities and should bring about real impact and  transformation in the shortest possible time. We also firmly believe that the  rebuilding of the country is the responsibility of all its citizens and everyone has  a part to play in the process. During the year we marked the closure of two of our Area Development  Programmes in Mahakumbukkadawala and Galenbindunuwewa after the end  of 15 years of partnerships with these communities.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      7  A key new initiative that  we have undertaken this  year is our commitment  to sustainability reporting.  Sustainability reporting has  traditionally been used  by international private  sector organisations to  voluntarily communicate  information on economic,  environmental and social  impacts relevant to the  sustainability of their  business operations.  The country continued to be affected by natural disasters and during the year  we provided emergency relief to the East and North Central districts which  were both affected by unprecedented rainfall and flooding. A key new initiative that we have undertaken this year is our commitment to  sustainability reporting. Sustainability reporting has traditionally been used  by international private sector organisations to voluntarily communicate  information on economic, environmental and social impacts relevant to the  sustainability of their business operations. It is perhaps even more important for  not-for-profit organisations such as World Vision whose entire business model  is sustainable development, to do so. Furthering this goal, WVL has signed  onto the UN Global Compact principles and we will use the Global Reporting  Initiatives framework to benchmark our reports. Our sincere gratitude is due to all our donors, sponsors, local and international  partners, Government Ministries, local authorities and other stakeholders as  well as the communities we serve for all their support and encouragement. A special tribute must be paid to our staff whose dedication and commitment  was a key factor in the success of our programmes. Their untiring efforts in often  challenging circumstances should not be underestimated. Our Board Chair and the Board members took time to visit our programmes  regularly and also participated in other events with us and this was an  immense motivation to our staff and the communities we serve. Their close  engagement with us throughout the year and their support, encouragement  and advice is deeply appreciated.

Strong accountability mechanisms are crucial for our organisational  sustainability. Without the trust of our stakeholders we cannot fulfill our Mission.  By holding ourselves accountable, we demonstrate that we are worthy of this  trust. World Vision Lanka is accountable to:  The children and communities we serve – without accountability to our  primary stakeholders our efforts to alleviate poverty and address injustice are  less likely to be realised and our legitimacy and credibility to act and speak out  on such issues will be undermined.  Our donors and partners – without accountability to the individuals donors  and partner organisations who support our work and also those we seek  to engage (i.e. the government, public and private sector partners), our  reputation and opportunity for continued support may be reduced.  Our partners and peers – without accountability to the World Vision partner  offices and NGO peers we work with our capacity to contribute to global  poverty alleviation would be limited.  Our people – without accountability to our staff and volunteers, our  operational capacity and integrity may be eroded.  Our regulators – without accountability to those who help to ensure that  we do our work properly and who shape our legal operating environment our  credibility would not be strengthened. The provision of information on our activities, our performance and our  operations in this Annual Review is one of the ways in which we seek to satisfy  our accountability obligations. We intend to build on this initiative by addressing issues of accountability in all  our future reviews. Reporting period: This Annual Review covers our activities and performance for the period  1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011, in alignment with the World Vision  Internationals financial year. The information included in the report has been determined through  consultation with World Vision Lanka staff and reviewed by the Senior  Management. The report has been prepared in accordance with the Sri Lanka  Statement of Recommended Practice for Not-for-Profit Organisations issued by  the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and informed by the Global  Reporting Initiatives reporting guidelines and NGO Sector Supplement. Strong accountability  mechanisms are crucial  for our organisational  sustainability. Without the  trust of our stakeholders   we cannot fulfill our Mission.  By holding ourselves  accountable, we  demonstrate that we are  worthy of this trust.  10     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Our work Our Work: restoring the right to dream A distinctive feature of World Visions work is its long-term approach towards  sustainable development. World Vision selects the most under-developed and poorest regions in the  country and establishes its Area Development Programmes (ADPs) at these  locations. The ADPs have a life span of approximately 15 years and are initiated in clearly  defined geographical clusters of rural or urban communities, with populations  ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 people.  ADPs serve the communities by equipping them to envision, plan, implement,  monitor and evaluate the programmes in an interdependent relationship with  local governments and other stakeholders. World Vision provides technical  support, funding and expertise for these programmes. Most ADPs have a balance of activities in four key focus sectors - education,  economic development, health and nutrition, and water and sanitation. Cross-cutting themes of gender, environment, disability, HIV/AIDS, child  protection, conflict sensitivity etc are intentionally interwoven into all our  programmes to enhance their effectiveness and add value to our work in the  focus sectors. The grassroots community programming compels ADP teams to build stronger  coalitions with community-based organizations, civil society, government, and  non-government development organizations.  Children are always at the heart of our work and our response and focus  is especially aligned to the wellbeing and empowerment of children, their  families and their communities. We focus on children because they are the best indicator of a communitys  social health. When children are fed, sheltered, schooled, protected, valued,  and loved, a community thrives. The development programmes can sometimes be interrupted and face set  backs due to both natural and man-made disasters. Therefore, ADPs also  integrate processes such as disaster mitigation and disaster risk reduction that  enhance stability and help build more peaceful and resilient communities. World Visions 41 development programmes operate in over 1000 villages in 20  Districts spread across Sri Lanka.  Disaster can instantly destroy livelihoods, negatively impact health and well- being, and drastically decrease access to safe drinking water and proper  sanitation facilities. In these conditions the threat of disease, hunger, and  displacement is great. Sri Lanka is prone to flooding, drought, landslides and  tsunamis. World Vision has been responding to emergencies in Sri Lanka through the  support of livelihoods, ensuring safe drinking water and proper sanitation  facilities, assisting those displaced, preventing hunger and the threat of  disease. Children are always at  the heart of our work and  our response and focus  is especially aligned  to the wellbeing and  empowerment of children,  their families and their  communities.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      11  We believe it is crucial to provide special protection for children during  emergencies as they are often prone to neglect and abuse. Our projects  focus on child protection, health and nutrition, water and sanitation, livelihood  recovery, and community based disaster management. World Vision responds to communities affected by disasters both within and  outside its programme areas. Working in coordination with the government  and other organizations, the Humanitarian Emergency Affairs team covers a  variety of activities from relief responses that meet the urgent and basic needs  of affected populations to long term responses that would ensure lives returned  to normalcy.  World Vision uses persuasion, dialogue and reason to advocate for changes  that will positively impact peoples quality of life and addresses the root causes  of poverty. Often these actions involve changing the hearts and minds of  people from the policy makers to members of the community. World Visions Advocacy interventions are usually achieved through coalitions  and networks within the humanitarian sector to lobby for a range of issues from  the need for humanitarian access, to child rights and child protection, IDPs and  their rights and humanitarian protection issues. World Vision plays a key role in all of these interventions within the country and  strives to ensure a better future for the children of Sri Lanka. World Vision responds to  communities affected by  disasters both within and  outside its programme  areas. Working in  coordination with the  government and other  organizations, World Vision  covers a variety of activities  from instant relief responses  that meet with the urgent  and basic needs of the  affected population to long  term responses that would  ensure lives returned to  normalcy.   12     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Cross Cutting Themes Interwoven throughout World Visions work are central themes that are an  integral part to every project: respect for the environment, protection of children  and their rights, gender equality, HIV AIDS, dignity for the differently-abled and  peace building and conflict sensitivity. Gender All World Vision Lankas programmes include women as key partners and  recipients of assistance. Women who have equal opportunity and access to  resources and education can earn more, become positive role models for girls  and boys and offer solutions to community problems. Disability World Vision programmes are designed to support the needs of the differently- abled, providing them access to education and economic recovery  programmes that are tailored to their special needs. New infrastructure such as  schools, homes and community halls are also constructed with access for the  disabled. Peacebuilding The strategic focus of Peacebuilding and Conflict Resolution consists of  capacity building programmes for children, youth and adults while ensuring  conflict sensitivity in all our programming. Conflict sensitivity of the projects and programmes was ensured through  the conflict sensitivity/ context assessments done using Local Capacities for  Peace/ Do No Harm and Integrating Peace building and Development tools.  Environment In all its activities World Vision is careful to minimise any negative impact on  the environment and to safeguard nature for future communities. Whenever  necessary WV conducts an environmental impact assessment at the  commencement of any project. Most of the rural communities we work with are farmer communities who have  been used to chena or slash-and-burn cultivation – a method of cultivation  where an area of forest is cut and cleared and burnt just before the onset of  rains. It has caused severe damage to the environment, especially to ground  water level. Through the projects such as Integrated Resource Management, Sustainable  Agriculture and Home gardening which involve the environment, World Vision  has replaced these environmentally harmful methods and focuses strongly  on protection and restoration of environment. Communities are introduced  to rainwater harvesting, water and soil conservation methods, use of natural  fertilisers Child Protection As a child focused organization World Vision accords top priority to Child  Protection in all of its programmes, ensuring the wellbeing of children. Child  protection activities typically focus on building community capacity to respond  to such needs. Networking and partnering with government institutions and  other social service organizations is also intentionally included in this process.   Interwoven throughout  World Visions work are  central themes that are  an integral part to every  project: respect for the  environment, protection of  children and their rights,  gender equality, HIV AIDS,  dignity for the differently- abled and peace building  and conflict sensitivity.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      13  Organization Structure  and Governance World Vision Lanka is  also a distinct legal  entity with its own Board  of Directors whose role  is to provide overall  direction for ensuring  standards of ministry  and management of  World Vision Lanka as  well as its participation  in Partnership processes.  The Board is also involved  is the strategic planning  and approval of the  overall country strategy. World Vision Lanka is part of the World Vision International Partnership which  is made up of over 90 offices worldwide, most of which are governed by local  boards or advisory councils. By signing the World Vision International Covenant  of Partnership, each partner agrees to abide by common policies and  standards.  World Vision Lanka applies the policies and standards of the World Vision  International Partnership in accordance with the local context.  While it is a member of the World Vision International Partnership, World Vision  Lanka is also a distinct legal entity with its own Board of Directors whose role is  to provide overall direction for ensuring standards of ministry and management  of World Vision Lanka as well as its participation in Partnership processes. The  Board is also involved is the strategic planning and approval of the overall  country strategy. The internal accountability of offices within the Partnership is managed through  a range audit, review and quality assurance processes at the country and  programme levels, to ensure alignment and compliance with World Vision  principles and policies.  At the Partnership level, four major internal reviews are scheduled for each  office. These are generally carried out by World Vision staff once every three  years:  Peer Reviews Peer Reviews assess the governance of local offices and the effectiveness and  alignment of local Boards and Advisory Councils. The reviews include both a  self-assessment by the office and an independent assessment by a small team  from across World Vision.   Programme Capability Reviews These reviews ensure that sufficient programming capabilities exist to enable  the achievement of strategic objectives, and that the proper relationship  between implementing offices and fundraising offices has been established.  The reviews include both a self-assessment by the office and an independent  assessment by a small team from across World Vision.  Operational and Finance Audits These are carried out by World Visions internal audit team. Operational audits  are basic compliance reviews focused on areas around sponsorship funding.  Finance audits focus on adherence to policy/procedure. During the last two years all of the above reviews have taken place at World  Vision Lanka and acceptable or satisfactory ratings have been received for  each of them.  14     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Making Dreams Real Restoring dreams Bringing healing and hope to vulnerable communities Having spent the last two years or so rebuilding after the 26-year war, the  country was once again faced with similar challenges when unprecedented  rains wreaked havoc in North Central and Eastern Sri Lanka leaving a trail of  despair and destruction. There was widespread destruction of infrastructure and livelihoods and many  families lost all their possessions - house, furniture, cattle and crops. World Vision assisted over 10,000 families in the affected regions with cooked  meals, emergency relief items and dry rations. World Vision also supported  medical teams with transport to the affected areas and also in the bowsering  of water to the affected communities. Infrastructural damage was widespread with most major roads damaged  and submerged and power supply cut off. More than 500 irrigation tanks and  anicuts have been damaged and nearly 400,000 acres of paddy cultivation  and several thousands of acres of other crops destroyed.  An estimated 75,000 wells were contaminated leaving more than 50,000  families with no access to safe water for drinking and cooking. Farmers were distraught after seeing their entire cultivations destroyed;  communities who have spent years struggling to emerge from poverty  suddenly found themselves having to start all over again. Regretfully, many people believe that once the rains cease and the flood  waters recede everything is back to normal. They forget that the rebuilding  process for the affected communities is a slow, painful and arduous journey. The people living in northern Sri Lanka have experienced prolonged conflict,  displacement and extreme poverty.  As families begin resettling in their villages  and re-establishing their livelihoods, mental health and well-being were  identified as an urgent and important need. By addressing peoples well-being there is opportunity to potentially shield  individuals from psychiatric illness, encourage speedier emotional and social  recovery as well as support families and communities to look towards a positive  and peaceful future. Responding to the mental health needs and wellbeing of communities is  essential for meaningful recovery from conflict and displacement. With this in  mind World Vision together with the Ministry of Health and AusAid launched  the Reconciliation through integration of Mental Health in Northern Districts  (REMIND) to support returning communities. Children and youth have particular individual needs to feel connected to  others. However, children often struggle to verbalize such needs and require  targeted activities that support their needs for belonging and community  engagement.  The people living in  northern Sri Lanka have  experienced prolonged  conflict, displacement and  extreme poverty.  As families  begin resettling in their  villages and re-establishing  their livelihoods, mental  health and well-being were  identified as an urgent and  important need.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      15  To reduce the stigma people with mental health face, World Vision used street  drama as a medium to deliver a series of educational skits on the impact  of stigma and how to effectively care for others, including those with mental  illnesses. These dramas were performed in all districts of the North where  communities have returned to start life anew. Upon return, communities have to readjust to a new environment or to an  existing environment transformed by war and conflict which could be a  stressful time for communities eager to rebuild their lives towards a level of  normalcy once again.  WVL continued to conduct Area Rehabilitation Programmes (ARPs) which  are specifically designed for communities that have been adversely affected  by conflict and disaster and focus mainly on rebuilding livelihoods, water  resources, health and education. The targeted rehabilitation programme, is focused on the most vulnerable  groups within these regions including old and new IDPs that return to these  locations. The programmes are based on rebuilding community livelihoods,  basic infrastructure and restoring the dignity and well being of children and  their families.  World Vision has assisted over 15,000 returnee families across four war affected  districts in the North through its livelihoods programme. The Early Recovery Assistance programme focuses on securing the basic  needs of the returnee family through three main initiatives mainly to assist the  families to have access to skills and assets to recommence their livelihoods,  access to shelter and meet the water and sanitation needs of the returnee  families. Each family received a livelihood package valued at LKR 35,000 (USD  307) which was distributed according to the livelihood needs of each  household. Livelihoods packaging and distribution was determined through  a collaborative process with the beneficiaries of the target community and  varied according to their individual requirements. Over the last two years World Vision has been working in all districts in the  North where resettlements are taking place and supporting the returning  communities through livelihood asset recovery programmes. World Vision has initiated Cash for Work programmes to enable communities  to earn an income for themselves whilst also contributing to the infrastructure  development of the area.  World Vision also provided agricultural tools, fishing boats and gear, cattle,  poultry and goats for rearing to the communities. To-date we have provided  over 15,000 families with a means of livelihood enabling them to start  rebuilding their lives once again. The Early Recovery  Assistance programme  focuses on securing  the basic needs of the  returnee family through  three main initiatives  mainly to assist the  families to have access  to skills and assets to  recommence their  livelihoods, access to  shelter and meet the  water and sanitation  needs of the returnee  families.  16     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Making Dreams Real  Making Dreams Real: Niromas Dream Dressed in a white coat and with a stethoscope around her neck Niroma  stands near a hospital bed in the Anuradhapura Base Hospital, listening,  consoling and giving hope to a mother who is distressed about her little  daughters condition. Dont worry, she will get well soon, she assures in her caring voice as she  explains the condition. Sometimes patients or their loved ones wont fully understand the condition  even if we explain, but it is a must that we take time to listen and give hope,  she says, It is difficult if you know that they have no chance of recovering but  you can still take time to give them strength for that day. Niroma is in her final year in Medical College and is now at the Anuradhapura  Base Hospital practicing and gaining experience to be a doctor. She has  assisted in the operating theatre, in different wards and cared for a number of  patients.  One of my unforgettable experiences was when a young boy was brought to  the hospital after an accident. He was unconscious and although the doctors  gave him shock treatment for 40 minutes they were unsuccessful. If the patient  doesnt respond within 40 minutes, he is declared dead. We (medical students)  began to take turns and give him shock treatment again. After an hour he  came back to life, she says, I realised how much responsibility I have in my  hands for another persons life. I always wanted to be a  doctor when I grew up, but  I knew it was difficult for  my parents to support all  three of us (she and her  two sisters) to get through  school, says Niroma, But  my parents always said  that education is the only  way to get out of poverty.  So I wanted to study hard.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      17  Coming from Thammannagama a rural village in Galenbindunuwewa, it was  not an easy journey for Niroma to be where she is now.  I always wanted to be a doctor when I grew up, but I knew it was difficult for  my parents to support all three of us (she and her two sisters) to get through  school, says Niroma, But my parents always said that education is the only  way to get out of poverty. So I wanted to study hard. Many children didnt complete school in my village. Sometimes it was  because parents didnt know the value of education and some had no choice  because of poverty, she says, But with World Vision coming to our village  things changed. I remember I was in Grade four at that time. The sponsorship programme supported every child to be in school providing  them with the necessary school stationery every year. It was a big relief to my  parents too. We received study assistance classes and we even had an English  class and a computer class. That is the only place where I learnt English and  computer and it helped me a lot. Seeing Niromas persistence and hard work, World Vision offered her a  scholarship for her higher education and followed it up with a scholarship for  her university education too.  My first stethoscope is a gift from World Vision, smiles the medical student.  Although she hasnt decided on the field she wants to specialize in, she  wants to serve the rural communities. I come from a rural village and I can  understand their hardships better, she says. My first stethoscope is  a gift from World Vision,  smiles the medical  student.

But she knew it was  next to impossible. The village school she attended not only had minimum  facilities, it hardly had any teachers to teach them. Apart from becoming a  teacher one day, it was already difficult enough to become even an average  student. Our school was situated far away from the main road and there were no  facilities for the teachers to travel or quarters for them to stay, says Chamila.  The teachers came late to school and left early. Every teacher who was given  an appointment at our school tried to get a transfer to a school in the town  almost as soon as they arrived. The children in my village who couldnt afford  to go to a school in town had no access to proper education. Lack of teachers  was the biggest setback to education here. Seeing their plight, World Vision launched a special programme with the  education department to recruit volunteer teachers for the school. Young  people who had completed their schooling and had a desire to teach were  interviewed and provided teacher training. Chamila was among the first batch of aspiring teachers who were selected to  follow the teacher training course and after faring extremely well at the initial  course, she was duly appointed as a trainee teacher in a school in her own  village.  Chamilas dream was to be  a teacher when she grew  up. But she knew it was next  to impossible. The village  school she attended not  only had minimum facilities  it hardly had any teachers  to teach them.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      19  From there onwards Chamilas whole life took on added meaning and she was  able to realize one of her cherished dreams – teaching and serving her own  community. This is my 12th year of service in the school in my village since then, smiles  Chamila. I cannot describe in words the joy and the satisfaction I have in seeing these  children from my village, learning and growing and getting through school  with bigger dreams. I am honoured to be a teacher for the children of my own community. I want  to thank World Vision for showing me the path to walk with love and care for  the poor children in my village. Chamila has now completed the teachers training programme and is in the  process of completing an external degree from the University. When World Vision first came to Mahakumbukkadawela, the school dropout  rate was very high. One of the main reasons for it was the lack of teachers.  The Volunteer Teacher Scheme proved a success in filling the gaps of teacher  scarcity since most of the recruits were from the village itself. The school drop  out rate is now virtually zero.

It is her custom she  explains, to give thanks for all her blessings before she starts her work. It is this  conventional work, for an unconventional purpose, which has changed her life.  Mallika Commester is the jovial and dignified owner of a small business that  provides beautiful clothing for the deceased as they are laid to rest. Five years ago, life for Mallika - a married mother of two daughters - was vastly  different. Living at her sisters small home, with limited income from her sick  husband, her marriage under pressure and possessing little self-motivation,  Mallika knew that her life had to change.  World Vision, active in her community, a busy fishing town called Negombo,  offered workshops on entrepreneurship, business management and life skills,  and Mallika decided to attend. It inspired her to take a chance on a new path. Ceremoniously, she dyed her hair to feel younger and armed with some  training and raw courage, obtained her motorbike license and took out a loan  for Rs 25,000 (USD190) from World Vision to buy a sewing machine. Her mother  had been a seamstress and it was a skill she thought she could develop. She  quickly found that she had a knack for producing quality suits and saris for  funeral parlour needs and set about expanding her business. Five years ago, life for  Mallika - a married mother  of two daughters - was  vastly different. Living at  her sisters small home,  with limited income from  her sick husband, her  marriage under pressure  and possessing little self- motivation, Mallika knew  that her life had to change.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      21  Mallika recounts the early days: It was challenging to start off; I had to take  my goods around on my bike to try and sell them. I made lots of mistakes but  tried to improve the quality of my clothes. I went to the World Vision trainings  on small business and marketing and learnt how to attract bigger clients and  started to offer free samples – such as pillowcases for the coffins. Through her hard work and steady increase in clients and orders, Mallika was  able to pay off her loan within a year, and move into a house fit for her young  family and burgeoning business. A devout Catholic, Mallika found a home  replete with bursting mango trees and a separate workshop, opposite her regal  white church. Mallikas husband is now her business partner, a key ingredient  in the success of the venture. In Mallikas words, It is a blessing. Peace has  returned to my home.  With the better sewing machines she now uses, her team can produce quality  garments, which are sent to the capital Colombo, to major parlours. Her  work-room is home to swathes of fabric and piles of the completed funeral  garments. Smart black suits with brass buttons for males and beautiful white  lace saris embedded with small diamantes for female clients. We make 25  suits a day, Mallika shares with the brightest of smiles, And most of our clients  dont complain, she teases –though maybe they do in Heaven! The business now employs women from the community – especially women  who are widowed or sick - so that they may have a chance at a meaningful  livelihood. Mallika also mentors and encourages other women starting their  own businesses. I want for nothing and have everything to be grateful for,  Mallika concludes. World Vision, active in her  community, a busy fishing  town called Negombo,  offered workshops  on entrepreneurship,  business management  and life skills, and Mallika  decided to attend. It  inspired her to take a  chance on a new path.  22     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Silence gives way to song: Pathums dream The afternoon silence is suddenly broken by a song from a distance. Thats  him, says Susila her face lighting up with a proud smile, He always sings the  moment he turns into our alley while returning from school. Pathum (11) is hearing impaired by birth and Susila didnt know her sons  condition until a month before his first birthday.  I suddenly began to notice that he didnt respond when I called. I clapped  and made a lot of noise but he wouldnt turn. I was in shock and didnt want to  believe he couldnt hear, says Susila. We took him to the doctor and he said that Pathum seemed hearing impaired  but I didnt want to hear it so I consulted another doctor and another doctor  but they all confirmed the same.  Susilas world began to crumble. I couldnt imagine what his future was going  to be like. Will he ever speak? Will he have friends? Will he play? I had so many  questions, she says. With Pathums condition, life completely changed for Susila. For the first time,  she left their locality and travelled long distances carrying him to doctors  and to a special school that taught her how to communicate with him. Her  husband left the country looking for work to support Pathums medical needs.  During that time World  Vision came into our  area and took Pathum  into sponsorship. I was  very glad. World Vision  supported us to get his  other hearing aid and  replaced both after five  years. They even help us  with the repairs. Making Dreams Real   World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      23  Today Pathum converses  freely with everyone. He  hears well and his speech  has greatly improved  from noises into words.  His father is thrilled  because now he is able  to understand him when  he speaks on the phone,  says Susila. The doctor said that a hearing aid might help Pathum, and with a lot of  difficulty we afforded one for his right ear. It seemed to help. During that time  World Vision came into our area and took Pathum into sponsorship. I was very  glad. World Vision supported us to get his other hearing aid and replaced both  after five years. They even help us with the repairs. Today Pathum converses freely with everyone. He hears well and his speech  has greatly improved from noises into words. His father is thrilled because now  he is able to understand him when he speaks on the phone, says Susila. Pathum enters through the door with a smile and starts pouring out to his  mother all that happened in school that day. He pulls out his books and shows  her what he learnt and how he got full marks for Math and how the girl who  competes with him for the first place in class got four marks less.  His teacher says he is able to study in a regular school now, but Pathum wants  to stay in his special school with his friends and follows the curriculum of the  regular school.  My favourite subject is Math and I love cycling and listening to music during  my free time, smiles Pathum. He is also a side drummer for the school band. Pathum gets on his bike after lunch and gets ready to cycle. Careful when you  go to the main road, there are vehicles, calls out his mother. Dont worry, he shouts over his shoulder with a smile, I can hear when they  horn.    Sector Education 26 Economic Development 28 Water & Sanitation 30 Health and Nutrition 32  Review  26     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Education This is the first time in this  primary schools history that  a student has passed the  exam, says Ranjith Kumara  the principal, Even the  other four students who  were in Grade 5 obtained  marks very close to the pass  mark this time. That is a  record in itself! In many poverty stricken communities in Sri Lanka, education remains a privilege and children are easily pulled out of school   and into the labour force. This year we are pleased to see many   school-dropouts back in school; children continuing to be in   school with new supplies of school equipment and slow learning   students benefitted by study assistance classes. In all our ADPs we have not only focused on ensuring education for every child, but also assisted the government in improving the education system by supporting teacher training and providing infrastructure facilities.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      27  Sachini: A ray of hope in a tiny school Since passing the scholarship exam for Grade 5 students, Sachini (10) is a celebrity  in her school and village. A picture of her - smiling proudly after her excellent  performance in the exam - hangs in the principals office, inspiring other students to  emulate her efforts. My favourite subject is English, says Sachini who excels in all her subjects. Yakawewa Primary School in Kebithigollewa has only 26 students through Grade  1 - 5. Only the poorest of the poor children - those who had just one uniform, a few  books, came barefoot to school and walked for miles for lack of bus fare - studied  there. Situated in a village that once bordered the war-zone, it was a struggle to keep the  Primary School functioning. Many times it had to be closed during the war and was  even on the verge of being shut-down completely. This is the first time in the schools history that a student has passed the exam, says  Ranjith Kumara the principal, Even the other four students who sat for the Grade 5  exam obtained marks very close to the pass mark this time. That is a record in itself! World Vision provided study assistance material especially for these Grade 5  students who were sitting for the exam. Together with a dedicated teacher, the  students saw a steady improvement in their studies. These children never went for tuition classes as they could never afford it, says  the Principal, With the study assistance they could really come up and I wanted to  prove to the parents that they dont need to send their children to tuition classes to  make them smart. World Visions sponsorship has provided Sachini and other children in her school  with sufficient school books and other educational material that would help them  continue school. Sachini wants to be a doctor when she grows up and look after old people and  small children. My daughter is always alert and asks things she doesnt know. She is  also very creative, neat in all her work and loves to read, says her mother Niluka. The little girl also won the second place in an open competition (age 6 to 18) on  general knowledge conducted by the Child Societies on World Childrens Day with  the participation of 360 children. Meanwhile Sachinis little school is looking forward to more victories to come.  Principal Ranjith plans to create a wall full of pictures of children who strive to do  their best in studies and help every student maximise their education.

I  cant express it in words,  she smiles, Piumis first  reaction was that we  wont have to go to the  cultivation fields anymore  and she was thrilled. Although there is a gradual drop in the unemployment rate in Sri Lanka, a large  percentage of the employed population does not have a stable income. In all its programme areas World Vision assists families to develop a sustainable  income method and find access to markets through a variety of activities such  as home gardening, agriculture, animal husbandry and cottage industry. The  activities also focus on giving them new knowledge and skills and introducing  them to new economic activities apart from the traditional ones.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      29  Poultry farming: a boon to young mother  Its feeding time in the hen house and little Piumi (6) and her mother Chamila  (29) are surrounded by the hens calling out in their hen language for their  feeders to be filled. Soon the tip-tip sound fills the air as brown, white, grey,  orange hens peck off grains from the yellow and white feeders.  Thats my favourite one, says Piumi pointing to a grey and white hen. Since  receiving the chicks from World Vision her life has become busier and both  mother and daughter enjoy spending time with the hens. It is such a relaxation for me to watch them and to take care of them and I  dont realize the time passing when Im in the hen house, smiles Chamila who  used to work in cultivation fields as a low-paid labourer to earn a living. The  little money she earned was hardly enough to provide even for the meals for  her and her little daughter. I couldnt even buy milk for Piumi not even a biscuit when she asked. I felt  so helpless and often times I cried. There were also days when I didnt have  money to buy medicine for Piumi even for a cold, says Chamila tears still filling  her eyes. There were so many things this mother dreamt of giving her little daughter.  One of them was a good education but with no one else at home to look after  Piumi, the little girl had to quit her preschool and tag along with her mother to  the cultivation fields.  She stayed in the hot sun the whole day with me and played with her rag doll  while I worked, says Chamila, There was nothing else I could do. Chamila was very excited when World Vision selected her for livelihood training.  She received training in poultry farming and received 100 chicks to start with. I was so happy the first time I held the chicks with my own hands. I cant  express it in words, she smiles, Piumis first reaction was that we wont have to  go to the cultivation fields anymore and she was thrilled. In a months time, the hens would start to lay eggs and I would be able to sell  them and get a sufficient income for my family. Also, Piumi will get to eat an  egg everyday. She loves to eat omelets, says Chamila. Chamila and Piumi no longer travel to the cultivation fields. With her mother  staying at home, Piumi has started schooling.  She loves to write letters and is  doing well in school. I no longer fear about her future. I am hopeful that the  chicks would help me provide for her needs and for her schooling all the way  up.

Water is the most essential of basic needs. Despite being surrounded by  water and with many water sources within the country, throughout Sri  Lanka many vulnerable populations have no access to clean water and  basic sanitation facilities.  While supporting the Governments efforts towards achieving its  millennium goals, World Visions water and sanitation activities aim to  assist rural communities to gain access to clean and safe water supplies,  sanitation and hygiene.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      31  Water comes home Swarna watches her little son play in the water. He cups his tiny hands to the  garden tap and splashes the water on to himself as it fills and overflows his  palms. He is a very lucky boy, smiles Swarna, when we were children, we never had  the chance to enjoy water like this. There was no water. Families in Dangaswewa village suffered for generations without water. Located  in Mahakumbukkadawela, one of the driest areas of Sri Lanka, the water level  in this rural village is very low. The community travelled 2-3 km daily to fetch  water for their basic needs and travelled further during drier seasons, even  then the water they used was not safe. Mothers mastered water management by reusing the same water for several  chores; fathers travelled 2 kms to wash after a days work; and children  sacrificed play time to fetch water as soon as they learnt to walk and were  strong enough to carry a little pot. That was the life of every family in Dangaswewa. Each of them has many  stories of hardships because of the lack of water. We spent so much time fetching water that we had no time for our children or  for any economic activity, says Ranmenika. The village school had no water either. Each grade was assigned on different  days to fetch water in the afternoon from a tube well a little distance from the  school. Each child got just one glass of water to drink and the toilets were  cleaned only once a day. When World Vision offered to help solve their water problem, the whole  community of Dangaswewa came together in support. Men and women of  the village, all laboured in the scorching sun, clearing the ground, digging  canals to lay the pipes from the tank to their homes and watched the water  project become a reality before their very eyes. Today, their lives are changed for the better and all their stories of hardships  remain distant memories. The first time we got water, I remember how many times we opened the  taps to check and asked the neighbours if they have got water yet, smiles  Ranmenika.  No words can tell how thankful we are for this water project. It has saved us a  lot of time and we have extra time for our children and they have more time to  study and play, says Swarna. For the villages of Dangaswewa, there is no longer walking lengthy distances  searching for water, instead water has come home to them.

Sri Lanka has done well in the overall health indicators but there are still  wide disparities in the health and nutritional conditions of children living  in challenged areas. The Mother and child remain priority in all our activities which support  the Governments efforts to achieve its Millennium Development Goals  (MDGs).

Ever since the World Vision - Medical Officer of Health partnered mobile  clinic began to visit their village, Radhimalar and others in her community no  longer have to travel far. They dont even have to pay for the doctor or for the  medicine. Before this clinic started, we had to travel either to Vakarai (25 kms away) or to  Valachchenai (30 kms away) to get medicine, says Radhimalar. This did not  include the Ten kilometres we travel on foot to catch the bus from the main  road. Ive had many difficult experiences carrying my children to the hospital when  they fall sick. Sometimes their sickness has worsened by the time I reach the  clinic and sometimes I was faintish and needed medication myself after  travelling, she says, There were also times I missed the bus and the numbers  (appointments) were over by the time I reached and had to come back home  with my sick child and go the next morning once again. At times after she paid for the travel and the doctor she had insufficient money  to buy the prescribed medicines. The doctor is very kind and takes time to talk to us and advises us too, says  Radhimalar. The medical officers not only focus on cure, but also on prevention, providing  the villagers with awareness on health and hygiene practices. The community  has begun to shed most of their false myths on certain sicknesses. The clinic visits Radhimalars village every two weeks. The team, provided by  the Medical Office of Health in Vakarai, includes a doctor, a pharmacist, a  Public Health Inspector (PHI) and at times a midwife. World Vision provides the  medicines and the transport. The clinic visits three to four locations every week  serving over 25,000 people in the Vakarai and Echchalampattu areas. This clinic is saving lives as it helps us reach the most rural and inaccessible  areas, says Dr. Dissanayake, the Medical Officer for Health for Vakarai and the  travelling doctor for the clinic, the medicines provided by World Vision are of  very high quality.

Special     36     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 RIWASH – connecting  communities Effecting Change in local Governance The Rural Integrated Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (RIWASH) Project a joint  programme of AusAid and World Vision Lanka. The programme will run through  2010-13 and will directly provide water supply and sanitation facilities to over  23,000 persons - including 7,500 school children - spread over a number of  estates, schools and rural villages in the Nuwara Eliya District – one the most  impoverished districts in the country. One of the aims of the programme was the building of the capacities of  the community, local government and other stakeholders so that once  empowered, the communities would actively engage in making decisions  concerning them, and enlightened institutions would promote such  participation. The achievements of RIWASH in numbers alone are remarkable as the project  has already established and improved water and sanitation facilities in poor,  disadvantaged plantation communities across 3 DS divisions in Nuwara Eliya  district. But the project needed something more to ensure its successes were  sustainable. This is where the projects innovative design and participatory implementation  strategy has achieved groundbreaking results upending nearly a century old  system in which the plantation community had been treated as second class  citizens. Nobody is better placed to describe the changed circumstances  than 63 year old M.Arumugam from Gartmore Bevys estate in Nuwara Eliya DS  division. I have lived on Gartmore  estate all my life. In  the past we could not  communicate directly with  the estates management.  Now we sign documents  with them. And we are able  to meet them. Previously we  had to convey our issues  to the Thalaivar who in turn  communicated with the  management.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      37  I have lived on Gartmore estate all my life. In the past we could not  communicate directly with the estates management. Now we sign documents  with them. And we are able to meet them. Previously we had to convey our  issues to the Thalaivar who in turn communicated with the management.  Thalaivar got one hour each month to talk to the Superintendent, Since Thalaivar is a political appointee, even concerns regarding basic living  conditions often used to be politicized to the extent that reporting of such  concerns depended less on the urgency of the problem and more on political  affiliations of community members.  The chances of finding solutions would be slim if community members were  found to be supporters of a political party different to that of Thalaivars.  Between political rivalry and disregard by some estate management to  improve the lot of their labourers, problems of the estate families continued  unsolved.Over the years, this scenario dominated communications between  community members, the Thalaivar and the management.  Sometimes Thalaivars would collude with the management and our problems  did not get resolved, Arumugam said.  To change these deeply rooted systemic flaws and discriminatory practices,  RIWASH has empowered estate communities by establishing community based  organizations (CBOs) that could take up the communitys problems with the  estate management and other service providers.  A series of leadership training and awareness raising programs, including  human rights have not only increased their rights awareness but also prepared  them to hold all service providers and decision makers accountable to their  services. Community members are increasingly finding their own voices as  advocates for better services and improved living standards as a result of  inclusive partnerships forged between themselves and service providers.

People living in northern Sri Lanka had experienced prolonged conflict,  displacement and extreme poverty. As families resettle in their villages and  begin to rebuild their lives, often their most urgent and important need is  mental health and well-being. By addressing peoples well-being there is opportunity to potentially shield  individuals from psychiatric illness, encourage speedier emotional and social  recovery as well as support families and communities to look towards a positive  and peaceful future. Through the REMIND project the local health sector has opportunities to better  engage in post-conflict programs, which will ultimately contribute to more  sustainable peace-building efforts. Awareness programs are in progress and include ways people can support  each other; such as using innovative methods of communication, empathy,  comforting others and problem-solving. As families resettle in their  villages and begin to  rebuild their lives, often their  most urgent and important  need is mental health and  well-being.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      39  A key aspect of the  project was the  recruitment and training  of 40 Community Support  Officers (CSO).   A special focus of the CSO  training was Psychological  First Aid (PFA), mental  illness and psychological  disorders and soft skills in  effective counseling. Special training was given to key community contacts, e.g. local shop-owners,  community leaders, teachers, and other people whom communities have  common and frequent interaction with. Here they were also introduced to the  Information, Education, Communications (IEC) materials. One of the key support groups for community members in times of crisis are  their spiritual leaders. Therefore awareness programmes for spiritual leaders  across the four major faiths have taken place in the Northern Province to  enable them to better support their communities as well as know how and  where to refer people who require more clinical support. A key aspect of the project was the recruitment and training of 40 Community  Support Officers (CSO). A special focus of the CSO training was Psychological  First Aid (PFA), mental illness and psychological disorders and soft skills in  effective counseling. The CSO will function as part of the staff of the Provincial Ministry of Health and  will assist to identify people in the community who require specialized support  from the Mental Health Units of the District Hospital. The CSO also provides a range of other services such as monitoring  medication, linking people with other service providers through the provision  of clinical and psychosocial referrals (from psychiatric support at the hospital  to disability support for clients with physical disabilities), raising community  awareness of mental health issues common in Northern Province and one-on- one psychosocial support for clients. Ten Community Support Centers are being constructed across the five districts  of the Northern Province to improve the accessibility of mental health and  psychosocial support services to community members. These centers are  meant to act as a community hub from where the CSOs for each district will  be based. The Centers will offer related information (IEC materials and other  resources), accessible to families and the interested public. They further provide  private consultation areas where community members can speak with CSOs.  40     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Permaculture – new  hope for communities Dignity and new life for Sothinathan Life for Sothinathan was full of challenges. Afflicted by polio from childhood, he  grew up depending on others to take care of him. All my life, I depended on other people to take care of me, says Sothinathan,  I grew up with my grandmother since I was three years old and then some of  my relations took me in. But I knew they didnt want to keep me for a long time.  They passed me from one house to another. I was a burden to them. Although he felt rejected by everyone, Sothinathan found a home for his heart  in Thevida from the first time he saw her at their kovil festival. She gave him  hope and he wanted to do everything possible to take care of her. I tried many ways to earn a living, he says, I plucked coconuts and got paid  around Rs 80.00 for five coconut trees I climb, but my legs soon hurt. I did  manual labour work whenever I could find the opportunity and even cut grass  in the fields. But after their baby was born, Sothinathan knew he had to do much more to  provide for his little family.  But there was no one willing to employ him or give  him regular work. The only thing left to do was go to the town and beg. I knew people may give  me money out of sympathy. I didnt want to be a begger, but that was the best  option I had, he says. I grew up with my  grandmother since I was  three years old and then  some of my relations took  me in. But I knew they didnt  want to keep me for a long  time. They passed me from  one house to another. I was  a burden to them.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      41  He hitched a ride by tractor and traveled 30 km from his home to the  Batticaloa town to beg. Some days he collected around Rs. 1,000.00 (10 USD)  and bought food for his wife and milk for his baby, sufficient for two days. But  quite often his collection was not enough to support their day-to-day needs.  Begging was the best and the only thing that could support his family; or so he  thought. His relations and neighbours did not see anything wrong with it and  the people whom he met on the road, those who put coins in his hands didnt  question or doubt or complain. While his life settled down to the rhythm of his new living, he came to  see a change in his neighbourhood. Many families had begun to grow  home-gardens. This interested Sothinathan. He learnt about World Visions  Permaculture project that had commenced in his village for the farmer  communities and wanted to be a part of the Project. His enthusiasm was  enough. World Vision staff were very positive towards me and encouraged me, says  Sothinathan, the farmers in my neighbourhood, all came to help me build the  fence and prepare the ground. I was overjoyed by the support I received. World  Vision provided the basic awareness, technical knowledge and the necessary  equipment and material to start my home-garden. They also built a well for me  so that I would have easy access to water for my garden.  Sothinathans garden which started with just two vegetables has now ten  varieties of fruits and vegetables growing in it.  It definitely is more challenging and takes more effort than begging, smiles  the new farmer, But the feeling of satisfaction that you have worked hard to  provide for your family and that you can provide for their meals from what you  yourself have grown, cannot be described.  My garden was completely washed away during the last floods. I was very  discouraged and wanted to quit and go back to begging, but World Vision  stood by me and helped me to restart. The vegetables get sold in the village  very quickly and I am confident that I can take care of my family. If I go to the town again, it will not be to beg, but to sell the excess produce  from my garden, smiles Sothnathan, And it gives me relief to know that my little  son would never be called a beggars son. That is the most important thing for  me. If I go to the town  again, it will not be  to beg, but to sell the  excess produce from  my garden, smiles  Sothnathan, And it gives  me relief to know that  my little son would never  be called a beggars  son. That is the most  important thing for me.  Sustainability Reporting Our work is based on the principle  of sustainable development. As  described, sustainable development is  development that meets the needs of  the present without compromising the  ability of future generations to meet  their own needs.   World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      43  World Vision Lanka has included in this annual review a special section on  sustainability reporting to improve our accountability and transparency to  our stakeholders about the work that we do in all our programmes across the  country. We believe it is important to make clear our commitment to sustainability  because sustainability and poverty alleviation are inexorably linked.  Our work is based on the principle of sustainable development. As described,  sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present  without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. We seek to meet the needs of the present through development and relief  programmes that address requirements such as clean water, education,  agriculture, preparation for natural disasters and health. All of our work on  alleviating poverty contributes to progress on achieving the Millennium  Development Goals. We focus on children and their communities to ensure that future generations  can meet their own needs. Our programs are designed to assist transformation  to restore and enable life with dignity, justice, peace, and hope through  empowering children to be agents of change; fostering mutually beneficial  relationships; interdependent and empowered communities; and systems and  structures that contribute to the elimination of poverty. Our Commitment to  Sustainability We focus on children and their communities  to ensure that future generations can meet  their own needs. Our programs are designed to  assist transformation to restore and enable life  with dignity, justice, peace, and hope through  empowering children to be agents of change We aim to meet challenges to sustainability, including food insecurity, climate  change, the decreasing availability of resources - such as water and energy,  weak governance, economic insecurity and the displacement of people. Our programmes are designed to support changes that are economically,  environmentally and socially sustainable.  We believe it is  important to make clear  our commitment to  sustainability because  sustainability and poverty  alleviation are inexorably  linked.  44     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Sustainability Report GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE NGO SECTOR SUPPLEMENT COMPLIANCE TABLE - 2011 This table has been prepared using the G3 reporting framework of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the NGO  Sector Supplement: globalreporting.org.

Partners/  stakeholders include but are not limited to children and families, local  communities and their organizations, and relevant government officials.  Further design, monitoring and evaluation activities are considered as an  opportunity to build capacity among programme partners. Programming staff  respect the confidentiality of personal information disclosed by respondents.  They obtain informed consent from respondents for the purposes to which their  data will be used. Programming staff communicate evaluation findings in ways  that clearly respect our partners dignity and security.  In an emergency response, World Vision endeavours to ensure that people  affected by disasters are active participants throughout the disaster  management process. Special attention must be paid to children and other  vulnerable groups. Community Participation  is practiced as a  foundational principle  in our LEAP standards  and explicitly includes  participation of all partners.  Partners/ stakeholders  include but are not limited  to children and families,  local communities and  their organizations, and  relevant government  officials.   48     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Mechanisms for feedback  and complaints Indicator 2: NGO2 Mechanisms for feedback and complaints in relation to  programmes and policies and for determining actions to take in response to  breaches of policies. Our primary accountability is to the children and communities we serve.  Key principles that promote accountability to children and communities  include transparency, openness, informed consent (providing children and  communities with the information they need to make informed decisions),  appropriate mechanisms for reporting concerns, and accountability for results  (allowing communities to contribute to defining and measuring success). Integrated programming is put into action through a suggested eight-step  approach that programme staff can follow in collaboration with communities  and local stakeholders. It leads staff and communities through a participatory,  empowering process to research, design, manage and end a shared  programme.  In an emergency response, people affected by disasters are always active  participants throughout the disaster management process. Special attention is  accorded to children and other vulnerable groups.  WVLs Advocacy Unit intentionally uses Community Based Performance  Monitoring (CBPM)  and Citizen Voice and Action (CVA) approaches in  engaging with all external stakeholders especially the service providers. Our approach to  community development  work is articulated in our  Development Programming  Approach. It emphasises  the importance of working  with and engaging local  partners.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      49  Systems for programme  monitoring and evaluation Indicator 3: NGO3 Systems for programme monitoring, evaluation and learning,  resulting changes to programmes and how they are communicated. Monitoring and evaluation systems are primarily based on Learning through  Evaluation with Accountability and Planning (LEAP) standards of semi annual  and annual monitoring of indicators. General programme and project review  is done by the staff and also with the children and community on some  occasions. This leads to reflections, lessons learning and adapting to changes  required for the improvement of the project performance, effectiveness,  management and sustainability.  In instances where projects are partnered with other stakeholders, quarterly  or semi-annual reviews also take place among the programme staff and the  respective stakeholders to collectively engage in learning and evaluation.  Furthermore regular monitoring is conducted through monthly reporting  and monthly management meetings within the programme team as part of  programme management.  Occasionally, monitoring and evaluation tools such as Most Significant  Change (MSC), best stories, documentaries are also utilised. World Vision  has also recently introduced its new project monitoring system, LPMS, (Lanka  Programme Monitoring System) to closely monitor programme budget,  activities and indicators, which will be implemented in the entire programme in  near future.  The communication of results and impacts is generally made through monthly  management report, annual and semi-annual reports. The dissemination  of some significant results also takes place through a range of World Vision  publications such as the annual report, quarterly newsletters, brochures,  factsheets and our dedicated website. Some of these are also featured  in external media and in Sponsors and Donor owned websites and other  publications. WVL has also recently  introduced its new project  monitoring system, LPMS,  (Lanka Programme  Monitoring System) to  closely monitor programme  budget, activities and  indicators, which will be  implemented in the entire  programme in near future.   50     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Measures to integrate  gender Indicator 4: NGO4 Measures to integrate gender and diversity into programme  design, implementation, and the monitoring evaluation and learning cycle.  Gender is one of six cross-cutting programme themes identified in the LEAP  Guidelines and prioritised as important to all World Vision programmes. These  guidelines state that: Sustainable development practice and impact cannot be achieved without  explicit recognition that every policy, programme and project affects women  and men differently. Addressing gender as a cross-cutting issue requires that  womens views, interests and needs shape the development agenda as much  as mens, and that programme strategies support progress towards more  equal relations between women and men, girls and boys. WVL integrates Gender as a cross cutting theme in the programme  management cycle. Through this process womens active participation is  ensured during the Assessment, Design, Implementation, Monitoring, Evaluation  and Reflection processes. The inclusion of women in the programmes occurs in both the long term  development process and in Humanitarian Emergencies. Additionally,  depending on the contexts and issues that Women and Girls face, special  projects too are designed to mitigate/address these issues. During the Preliminary assessment processes, separate discussions with  Women and Girl Children are conducted to assess the context to identify  issues faced by Women and Girls. After these discussions, during the designing  process our teams have made it mandatory that Women and Girls actively  participate in the participatory designing process. The team ensures that the  Voice of Women and Girls are heard and included in the designing process. During the implementation, special emphasis is given to encourage women  leadership in the programmes by promoting Self Help Groups, Community  Based Organizations where women become members and get elected as  office bearers and decision makers, where women and girls get priority in  Sectoral programmes (Water and Sanitation. Economic Development and  Education). Through Gender Self Assessment processes/audits the organizations assesses  itself on the extent of integration of gender issues. The Advocacy Unit conducts  special programmes on Gender, Womens Rights, Convention for the Elimination  of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) etc in our projects. Addressing gender as a  cross-cutting issue requires  that womens views,  interests and needs shape  the development agenda  as much as mens, and  that programme strategies  support progress towards  more equal relations  between women and men,  girls and boys.  World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011      51  Advocacy Approaches Indicator 5: NGO5 Processes to formulate, communicate implement and  change advocacy positions and public awareness campaigns. World Visions advocacy work around the globe is guided by the following  principles set out in the World Vision International Advocacy Policy: 	 World	Vision	must	act	judiciously	and	responsibly	when	engaged	in	 advocacy.  	 To	fail	to	speak	or	act	on	behalf	of	the	poor	in	certain	situations	will	be	 failure to enact Core Values and will be inconsistent with World Visions  Christian development stance.  	 There	are	conditions	in	which	neutral	ground	does	not	exist;	silence	or	 absence of action can in fact promote one outcome against another.  	 Advocacy	should	flow	from	listening	to	and	consultation	with	the	poor	who	 are most directly affected.  	 Advocacy	positions	must	be	shaped	by	our	Core	Values	and	must	be	 consistent with our mission.  	 Advocacy	must	promote	perspective	and	solution	as	opposed	merely	to	 formulating a description of a problem or statement of fact.  	 Advocacy	must	be	issue-oriented	and	specific	rather	than	expressing	 blanket endorsement or condemnation of a particular government or  political group.  	 When	there	is	no	formal	policy	position,	advocacy	will	only	be	undertaken	 when there is an urgent situation or crisis where human life or wellbeing  is at stake. When advocacy occurs where there is no formal policy,  appropriate policy discussions and decisions should follow.  	 Advocacy	positions	will	be	based	on	the	widest	possible	consultation,	 especially with those colleagues present in the situation.  	 Advocacy	will	have	careful	regard	for	its	risk	to	life	and	its	impact	on	 ministry in all countries where World Vision has a presence.  	 World	Vision	Lankas	advocacy	work	is	driven	through	the	intentional	 engagement of relevant inter-agency advocacy coalitions and forums  in the humanitarian sector and through trusted networking with external  stakeholders. Advocacy must be issue- oriented and specific  rather than expressing  blanket endorsement  or condemnation of a  particular government or  political group.   52     World Vision Sri Lanka  - Annual Review 2011 Mechanisms for  workforce Feedback  Indicator 7: NGO9 Mechanisms for workforce feedback & complaints, and their resolution World Vision Lanka encourages a culture of performance, accountability and  adherence to values and to this end has in place several mechanisms to  facilitate workforce feedback and complaints including a standard grievance  policy. Staff are also encouraged to use the feedback forum which is available  through its internal newsletter and there is also a special mailbox to which any  feedback or grievances could be sent. Additionally, the Integrity and Protection Hotline (Whistleblower) is available to  all staff for direct feedback of any grievances. World Vision Lanka  encourages a culture  of performance,  accountability and  adherence to values and  to this end has in place  several mechanisms  to facilitate workforce  feedback and complaints  including a standard  grievance policy.

Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and  reductions achieved.  As the natural environment is critical for sustaining life – providing air, water,  food and shelter – good stewardship plays an important part in ensuring the  sustained well-being of children, families and communities. World Vision recognises the impacts that human activities can have on the  natural environment and our planets climate, including our own activities as  an organisation (air travel, energy and resource use, transportation, supply  chain choices, etc). In October 2010, World Vision Lanka resolved to seek ways to improve its  environmental performance and to reduce the organisations contribution to  climate change and environmental degradation. As an initial step the organisation decided to measure the carbon footprint  of its operations in four selected areas - air travel, fuel use of vehicle fleet,  electricity usage and paper use which were identified as the most significant  environmental impacts of our programme activities. The organization set estimates of consumption for the four areas and the  results in the first year have been very encouraging. Despite the all round  growth in our operations – including manpower and programme areas - we   have succeeded in meeting our targets in two of the key areas - electricity  consumption and fuel use The electricity consumption has been due mainly to better management  of office facilities and the optimum use of air-conditioning and lighting.  The  reduction of the fuel use has been due to the pooling of vehicles by  departments. In the future the organization will also explore the possibility of purchasing  carbon offsets where emissions cannot be sufficiently avoided or reduced to  meet our yearly targets.
