Our	approach	to	global	responsibility	 is	straightforward.	Its	all	about	living	 our	values	–	one	of	which	is	We	 do	the	right	thing,	all	the	time. When	a	companys	values	are	in	 alignment	with	employees	values,	 good	things	happen.	My	hope	is	that	 you	will	see	our	values	reflected	in	this	 report	–	both	in	our	performance	and	 in	the	stories	behind	the	numbers. Box	Tops	for	Education,	the	leading	 education	cause-marketing	program		 in	the	U.S.,	is	one	example.	It	was		 two	of	our	salesmen	who	dreamed		 up	the	idea	for	Box	Tops,	which	has	 raised	more	than	US$400	million		 for	K-8	schools	(p.	23). It	was	a	recently	retired	manufacturing	 manager	who	doggedly	pursued	the	 idea	of	burning	discarded	oat	hulls	for	 energy	–	an	initiative	that	continues	to	 be	held	up	as	a	model	of	innovation	and	 creativity	in	the	food	industry	(p.	41). It	was	one	of	our	scientists	whose	desire	 to	lose	weight	sparked	the	creation	of	 Progresso	Light	soup	–	just	one	of	our	 ongoing	efforts	to	steadily	improve	the	 health	profile	of	our	products	(p.	9).	 And	it	was	an	R&D	employee		 who	planted	the	initial	seeds	for	 Partners	in	Food	Solutions,	a	nonprofit	 organization	linking	the	food	expertise		 of	General	Mills	employees	with	small	 food	companies	in	Africa	(p.	25).		 Today,	more	than	500	General	Mills	 employees	contribute	their	time,	 knowledge	and	talents	to	helping	 African	food	producers	solve	a	wide	 range	of	quality	and	other	issues. These	are	just	a	few	examples	of	how	our	 employees	are	making	a	real	difference	for	 General	Mills	and	our	global	community.	 Around	the	world,	General	Mills	employees	 are	working	to	improve	the	health	profile	 of	our	products,	volunteering	in	their	 communities	and	integrating	sustainability	 into	every	facet	of	our	business.	 Every	day,	we	work	to	earn	the	trust	 of	consumers.	Being	a	responsible	 corporate	citizen	is	integral	to	 maintaining	that	trust.	We	are	proud	 of	the	progress	were	making	–	and	 we	are	committed	to	doing	more.	 Thank	you	for	your	interest,	and	 we	welcome	your	questions	 and	comments,	as	always.	 Sincerely, Ken	Powell		 Chairman,	Chief	Executive	 Officer,	General	Mills Welcome to our 2012 Global responsibility report. Were very pleased to provide this  update on the progress were making to enhance the nourishment we provide  to  strengthen the communities we serve  and to protect the planet we share. To	our	Stakeholders: WATCH	VIDEO  General Mills Global responsibility	 	02 Every	day	throughout	the	world,	 our	35,000	employees	work	 to	carry	out	this	mission. Were	proud	of	our	sustainable	 heritage,	which	dates	back	decades,	 and,	in	some	cases,	even	longer. In	the	1940s,	for	example,	our	Green	 Giant	agricultural	research	team	 published	a	report	outlining	the	benefits	 of	crop	rotation	and	later	pioneered	the	 use	of	integrated	pest	management	for	 reducing	pesticide	use	across	all	crops.	 Over	the	past	30	years,	weve	cut	the	 pounds	of	pesticides	used	by	80	percent.	 And	in	the	1990s,	we	worked	with	 paper	mills,	counties,	cities	and	waste	 management	companies	to	promote	 curbside	recycling.	More	importantly,	 we	helped	create	an	even	larger	 market	for	recycled	paperboard	by	 using	it	in	our	food	packaging.	 Today,	our	Cheerios	business	provides	 an	example	of	how	we	bring	our	 Nourishing	Lives	mission	to	life	in	our	 day-to-day	operations	(see	illustration	 on	page	3).	Sustainability	is	built	into	 every	phase	of	our	process	–	from	the	 growing	of	oats	to	the	burning	of	leftover	 oat	hulls	to	fuel	our	oat	milling	plant. Adopting	GRI	reporting	 guidelines Our	2012	report	marks	the	first	time	 we	are	adopting	the	Global	Reporting	 Initiative	(GRI)	3.1	guidelines.	Our	 intention	is	to	increase	the	accessibility	 of	information	for	interested	stakeholders	 –	a	reflection	of	our	commitment	to		 become	more	transparent.	GRI	is	a		 nonprofit	organization	that	has	developed		 one	of	the	most	prevalent	standards	for	 corporate	social	responsibility	reporting.		 In	our	first	year,	our	report	is	undeclared,		 and	the	report	is	not	externally	 assured.	Our	GRI	Index	on	page	68	 has	a	comprehensive	list	of	the	GRI	 indicators	we	are	addressing	this	year. Youll	see	references	to	these	 indicators	throughout	this	report. Health	performance		 &	challenges:	Overview In	2011,	our	U.S.	Retail	division	set	a	new	 record	for	improving	the	health	profile	 of	our	products.	As	measured	by	our	 internal	health	metric,	24.6	percent	of	 these	retail	sales	were	comprised	of	 products	with	improved	nutrition	profiles. In	recent	years,	weve	accelerated	efforts	 to	improve	our	overall	health	profile.	 From	fiscal	2005	to	the	end	of	fiscal	2011,		 64	percent	of	our	U.S.	Retail	product	sales	 volume	has	been	nutritionally	improved. As	significant	as	these	gains	are,	we	–	 and	the	entire	food	industry	–	are	under	 increasing	scrutiny	to	improve	the	health	 attributes	of	the	food	we	create.	Were	 continuing	to	work	with	governments	 and	a	number	of	organizations	around	 the	world	to	promote	healthier	lifestyles. One	of	our	biggest	challenges	is	 maintaining	the	preferred	taste	of	our	 products	while	reducing	ingredients		 such	as	fat,	sugar	and	sodium.	We		 know	from	experience	that	a	healthier	 food	cannot	provide	nutritional	 benefits	if	it	is	not	eaten.		Finding	 that	balance	between	health	and	 taste	is	a	perennial	challenge	–	and	 opportunity	–	for	General	Mills.	 Each	of	our	reformulated	products	–	as	 well	as	new	ones	–	undergoes	extensive	 taste	tests	before	being	introduced.	 All	of	our	Big	G	kid	cereals,	for	example,	 are	now	at	10	grams	of	sugar	or	less		 per	serving	–	down	from	12	grams	or	 more	just	a	few	years	ago	–	and	weve		 	 At	General	Mills,	corporate	social	responsibility	is	at	the	core	of	our	Nourishing	Lives	mission,	culture	and	business	strategy.		We	 believe	that	doing	well	for	our	shareholders	goes	hand	in	hand	with	doing	well	for	our	consumers,	our	communities	and	our	planet.	 Health Communities environment The nourishment we provide The people we serve The planet we share INTRODUCTION conTinued on page 4  w We organize our corporate social responsibility focus areas – and our annual reports – into three basic categories.  General Mills Global responsibility	 	03 Nourishing	communities The cheerios brand supports community  programs such as Spoonfuls of Stories,  which has distributed 60 million   childrens books in cheerios boxes   in the past decade.  6 A	sustainable	crop oats are among the most sustainable  crops and usually require less fertilizer  and pesticide than other major crops.  and they typically rely entirely on  rainfall – instead of irrigation – for water. 1 Efficient	cereal	processing	 Since fiscal 2006, the facilities that produce  cheerios have reduced, on average, their  energy consumption rate by 12 percent,  solid waste generation rate by 20 percent  and water usage rate by 31 percent.  2 Recycled	packaging	 for	decades Like all general Mills cereals, cheerios   boxes are made from 100 percent   recycled paperboard and have  been since the 1930s.  4 Renewable	energy	source our biomass burner in Fridley, Minn.,   is designed to burn discarded oat hulls  from this oat milling plant to supply up  to 100 percent of the processing steam  and heating needs for the facility.  3 Cheerios:	Circle	of	Goodness A	healthy,		 nutritious	breakfast each serving of cheerios contains healthy  whole grain, and just 1 gram of sugar. oats  contain beta-glucan, a soluble fiber thats  been proven to lower cholesterol.* 5 Learn	more	about	Cheerios	and	sustainability	in	the	Responsibility	section	of	GeneralMills.com. *		Three	grams	of	soluble	fiber	daily	from	whole	grain	oat	foods,	like	original	 Cheerios	cereal,	in	a	diet	low	in	saturated	fat	and	cholesterol,	may	reduce	the	 risk	of	heart	disease.	Original	Cheerios	cereal	provides	1	gram	per	serving.  General Mills Global responsibility   04 pledged to reduce all of these cereals to  single digit grams of sugar per serving. On page 11, you can see the progress   on our sugar reductions in cereal and  know that more reductions are on the  way as a result of recent taste tests. We firmly believe that cereal –  sweetened or not – is one of the  best breakfast choices people can  make. It has fewer calories than  many other breakfast options, has  many of the nutrients that make up  a healthy diet, and it is affordable. We continue to work with the   Childrens Food and Beverage   Advertising Initiative in the U.S., the  Department of Health in the United  Kingdom, Health Canada in Canada,  and the World Health Organization  in many other parts of the world  on several health-related issues. Communities performance  & challenges: Overview The important role General Mills plays in  the community around our headquarters  in Minneapolis and throughout the  state of Minnesota is well-known. Since  our Foundation was created in 1954,  weve given more than US$1 billion  to a variety of charitable causes. The same holds true for communities  where we have production facilities, like  Cedar Rapids, Iowa, or Hannibal, Mo.  General Mills employees are typically  leaders in the community when it  comes to giving, volunteerism and  other civic engagement endeavors. A high level of employee engagement is  the norm at General Mills – 83 percent  of our U.S. employees  volunteer in the  community – nearly three times the   29 percent average reported in a survey of  more than 150 Fortune 500 companies.  Today, our challenge – and  opportunity – is to grow these efforts  around the world as we expand to  become a more global company.  In fiscal 2011, Foundation giving  internationally reached nearly  US$400,000 – almost double the  US$220,000 in fiscal 2010. This,  however, represents just a relatively  small slice of our total giving.  Likewise, our volunteerism rate for  employees outside the U.S. is 51 percent   – significantly higher than the average  for Fortune 500 companies, but leaving  plenty of room to grow. Again, the  challenge is to extend General Mills   culture of giving to more of our  international locations and programs. We have been making progress –  particularly with the food security  programs we have helped establish in  several African countries through our  Partners in Food Solutions (PFS)   program. PFS links the expertise  of General Mills employees (as  well as employees from Cargill and  DSM) with small and medium- sized food processors in Africa. To date, more than 500 General Mills  employees have contributed their  time and knowledge to this award- winning program that is helping lay  the groundwork for improved food  security in several countries in Africa. General Mills Global responsibility         04 Eighty-three percent of our U.S employees volunteer in the  community – nearly three times the 29 percent average reported  in a survey of more than 150 Fortune 500 companies. continUEd on pagE 6  w 83 percent  General Mills Global responsibility	 	05 General	Mills	is	one	of	the	largest	 food	companies	in	the	world,	with	 more	than	100	consumer	brands. $14.9	 billion Global	net	sales*	 $1.8		 billion Net	earnings*	 $118.7		 million Community	 contributions 35,000	 employees About	half	work	outside	 the	United	States. 100+	 consumer	brands Our	many	brands	can	be	 found	in	more	than	100	 countries	on	six	continents. $2.9	 billion Net	sales	for	our	 International	 business	segment* 145	 years We	have	been	 making	lives	 healthier,	easier	 and	richer	for	more	 than	a	century. *Includes	$1.2	billion	proportionate	share	of	joint	venture	sales All	figures	represent	fiscal	2011	results.  General Mills Global responsibility	 	06 And	a	separate	program,	Join	My	Village,	 has	been	extended	so	all	of	our	employees	 –	not	just	those	based	in	the	U.S.	–	can	 contribute	to	this	program	that	is	designed	 to	empower	African	women	and	girls.	 In	addition,	Join	My	Village	–	which	to	 date	has	raised	more	than	US$1.3	million	 to	help	2,000	families	in	Malawi,	Africa	–	 has	expanded	to	India	in	recent	months.		 By	designing	programs	like	Partners	in	 Food	Solutions	and	Join	My	Village	–	 and	organizing	all	of	our	philanthropic	 efforts	around	our	core	food	business	 –	we	leverage	our	scale	and	know-how	 to	address	problems	like	food	security	 and	poverty.	Our	work	in	these	areas	is	 still	young	and	the	challenges	great.		 Environmental	 performance:	Overview We	continue	to	move	forward	on	 reaching	our	2015	solid	waste	generation,	 water	usage,	greenhouse	gas	emissions	 and	other	sustainability	goals.	 Were	already	more	than	halfway	 toward	achieving	three	of	the	goals	 –	on	reducing	water	use,	solid	waste	 generation	and	packaging.	And	were	 making	progress	on	reducing	energy	 usage,	greenhouse	gas	emissions	and	 transportation	fuel,	our	other	three	goals.	 In	absolute	terms,	we	improved	 slightly	across	all	of	our	sustainability	 metrics	versus	last	year,	meaning	 that	we	used	fewer	resources	and	 generated	less	waste	in	fiscal	2011	 than	in	2010.	But	fiscal	2011	proved	to	 be	a	challenging	year,	largely	because	 of	a	slight	decrease	in	our	business	 volume.	Because	our	sustainability	 goals	are	rate-based,	they	are	affected	 by	the	volume	of	what	we	produce.	 There	are	many	fixed	costs	–	such	as	 heating	and	lighting	at	our	facilities	 –	that	are	incurred	regardless	of	how	 much	food	is	produced.	So	we	did	 not	make	as	much	progress	against	 our	goals	as	we	had	hoped. But	we	made	significant	 advancements	in	other	areas.	 With	help	from	several	external	 organizations,	weve	developed	 a	sustainable	sourcing	model	for	 ingredients	we	purchase	to	make	our	 products.	We	are	now	developing	 specific	strategies	for	sustainably	 sourcing	several	of	these	ingredients.		 We	also	have	begun	asking	our	suppliers	 to	complete	our	supplier	scorecard,	 which	asks	for	data	on	energy	use,	water	 use	and	solid	waste	generation	that	 is	associated	with	the	ingredients	and	 material	we	use	to	make	our	products.	 In	addition,	we	are	now	in	the	process	 of	rolling	out	a	new	global	safety	and	 environmental	data	management	system	 called	GSTEMS	(Global	Safety	Tracking	 and	Environmental	Management	 System).	The	system	will	enhance	real- time	tracking	of	our	energy	and	water	 use	–	among	many	other	measurements	 –	across	all	of	our	plants,	which	will	 allow	us	to	better	focus	our	operations	to	 conserve	natural	resources	and	money. Taken	together,	we	believe	these	 initiatives	position	us	very	well	to	face	 environmental	challenges	and	to	make	 significant	progress	in	the	years	ahead.			 Engaging	stakeholders We	solicit	input	from	groups	like	Ceres	 (a	coalition	of	investors,	environmental	 organizations	and	other	public	interest	 groups	that	works	with	companies	 to	advance	their	environmental	and	 social	performance)	to	ensure	we	 address	issues	of	concern	to	them. We	are	also	a	member	of	the	United	 Nations	Global	Compact,	a	collaboration	 of	businesses,	NGOs	(nongovernmental	 organizations)	and	the	United	Nations	 dedicated	to	improving	human	rights,	 labor,	the	environment	and	business	 practices.	We	are	committed	to	working	 globally	on	these	important	issues. We	have	been	participants	in	the	 Carbon	Disclosure	Project	(CDP)	since	 its	inception	in	2000	and	regularly	 report	our	greenhouse	gas	emissions	 and	climate	change	strategies	to	this	 initiative.	The	CDP	compiles	data	 from	2,500	organizations	in	some	 60	countries	around	the	world. We	believe	these	initiatives	position	us	very	 well	to	face	environmental	challenges	and	 to	make	significant	progress	in	years	ahead.

General Mills Global responsibility   08 For decades, weve been providing  people with nutrition information –  from the Betty Crocker Cooking  School of the Air in the 1920s to our  EatBetterAmerica.com collection  of healthified recipes today. Weve also worked closely with  governments around the world to  enrich our foods to address health  issues. We began enrichment of Gold  Medal flour with thiamine and iron in  the 1940s and fortified all Big G kid  cereals with vitamin D in the 2000s. To help us reach our health goals,  we created the Bell Institute of  Health and Nutrition in 1998,  and our Health & Wellness  Center of Excellence in 2005. Its also why we began  systematically measuring our  health profile progress in 2005,  and have set specific goals. Long ago, we recognized that  health was very important to our  consumers. Many of our best- selling products carry some type  of government-approved health  claim – whether from the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration, Health  Canada or other governmental entity. Improving the health profile of our   products is integral to our success  as a company. At the same time,  we set a high bar for ensuring that  our healthier products taste good. Because weve learned from  experience that a healthier product is  of little value if no one buys and eats it.  overview *  Reformulated products *  Healthier new products *  Updated marketing  guidelines *  A decade of providing  healthy kids grants *  Promoting school  breakfasts globally Health Goals Reduce sugar in cereals  advertised to children under 12  to single digit levels per serving. Reduce sodium by 20 percent,   on average, in our top 10  product categories. Remove trans fat from  our products. the nourishment we provide HEALTH Our mission is   Nourishing Lives –   making lives healthier,  easier and richer.  Our goal is to provide people with nutritious foods   that – when combined with exercise and activity –   can help people live healthier lives.  General Mills Global responsibility   09 New record set for  improving health profile  Lucky Charms gets a boost  As measured by our internal  health metric, 24.6 percent of  U.S. Retails product sales were  comprised of products with  improved nutrition profiles. The biggest gains came from reducing  trans fat and sodium, which each  accounted for 26 percent of our fiscal  2011 improvement. The next largest  gains came from adding vitamins  and minerals (19 percent), and from  increasing whole grain (12 percent).  In all, from fiscal 2005 to the end  of fiscal 2011, 64 percent of our  U.S. Retail product sales volume  has been nutritionally improved.  Outside the U.S., progress continues   on many fronts, including trimming the  fat and salt from several Old El Paso   products. And with the July 2011  acquisition of the Yoplait international  business, several new healthy  yogurt products have been added  to our international portfolio.   PR1 Lucky Charms now has 20 percent  more fiber, 25 percent more whole  grain and 10 percent less sodium  than it had the year before.  And it has 10 grams of sugar per  serving – down from 12 grams in 2007.  Were working to reduce all of our  cereals advertised to kids under age  12 to single digit grams per serving.  Since 2005, General Mills has   improved the nutrition profile   of more than 600 different   General Mills products in the  U.S. Some products – like  Lucky Charms – have  been improved  several times.  An example of a product we reformulated in fiscal 2011  to improve its nutritional profile is Lucky Charms, one  of our most popular and best-selling cereals. Our U.S. Retail division set a new record in fiscal 2011 for improving  the health profile of its products – besting fiscal 2010. or more of our  U.S. products have  been nutritionally  improved since   2005. Raising the health bar How we measure progress We measure improvements on our internal health  metric in one or more of the following ways: Increasing nutrients such as whole grain, fiber or  vitamins and minerals by at least 10 percent. Increasing key food groups such as  fruits, vegetables, low or non-fat dairy to  reach at least a one-half serving. Reducing calories, fat, saturated fat, trans  fat, sugar or sodium by 10 percent or more. Formulating or reformulating a product  so it qualifies for government-approved  nutrient or health benefit claim. Formulating or reformulating a product  to meet specific internal requirements,  including limiting calories. 600 Health       Communities       environment FY05 16% FY06 21% FY07 33% FY08 40% FY09 45% FY10 FY11 60% 64% percent nutritional  improvement of our U.S. Retail sales  volume in fiscal 2011 was  made up of products that  had been nutritionally  improved – or introduced  with strong nutrition  profiles – since 2005. of our U.S. Retail  sales volume in fiscal  2011 was made up of  products that had been  nutritionally improved or  introduced with strong  nutrition profiles.  64% 24.6  Health       Communities       Environment General Mills Global responsibility   10 Whole grain is No. 1 Whole grain is also listed as the first  ingredient, which is important to  health-conscious consumers who  look to the ingredient list to assess the  nutritional value of the food they eat. The multiyear reformulation effort  represents a continuation of an initiative  begun in 2005 to convert all of our   Big G cereals to whole grain. That effort  was the single-biggest, health-driven  product improvement in our history. Today, our Big G cereals deliver about  38 million whole grain servings  per day – a 50 percent increase in  whole grain servings over 2004.  Big G cereals are the No. 1 source  of whole grain at breakfast  for people in the U.S.  In connection with healthy living, going  with whole grain has been linked to  healthier body weights, and it may  help reduce the risk of heart disease. Big G cereals provide people in the U.S. with more whole grain  than any other breakfast food from any other food company. CPW boosts whole grain Since 2003, CPW has increased global  consumption of whole grain by   more than 3.4 billion servings and  reduced sugar by more   than 9,141 tons.  All of its global brands –  Fitness, Cheerios, Chocapic  and Nesquik – now have  at least 8 grams of whole  grain per serving.  In 2009, CPW pledged to reduce the  sugar by an additional 20 percent in its  cereals that are advertised to children.  CPW is the joint venture between  General Mills and Nestl that  makes and markets cereals  under the Nestl brand globally  outside North America.

We continue to work on reducing  the sodium in our remaining product  categories as we approach 2015. Likewise, were reducing sodium  levels in our international portfolio.  In Europe, we are supporting the UK  Department of Healths 2012 sodium  reduction targets and are working to meet  these goals. In addition, nutrition standards  have been implemented for each brand  to ensure that sodium levels are a key  consideration when developing new products.  PR1 Since 2005, we have  reduced trans fat in  more than 120 of our  U.S. Retail products.  As of the end of fiscal  2011, about 83 percent of  General Mills U.S. Retail  sales volume was comprised  of products with zero  grams labeled trans fat. Most flavors of Betty  Crocker SuperMoist  cake mixes, virtually all  Pillsbury Toaster Strudel  products, and many  Pillsbury Crescent varieties  are among the products  that have been reduced to  zero grams of trans fat.  PR1 Weve made significant progress on our pledge to reduce the  sodium by 20 percent, on average, in more than 400 of our U.S.  Retail products in our top 10 product categories by 2015. We continue to make progress toward our goal of  removing trans fat from our products. Green Giant is lowering the salt in its canned  vegetables by 5 to 35 percent across Europe,  Russia, Africa and the Middle East. This sodium  reduction effort has already been implemented  in 90 percent of Green Giant products –  including sweet corn, artichokes and hearts  of palm – in these markets. The reduction  supports the UK Department of Healths goal of  decreasing dietary sodium to 2.4 grams per day.

Our practice is to learn from   our past so we can make  subsequent products better to  meet consumer demand for  healthy, great-tasting products.  Since 2004, weve increased  R&D spending on health  and wellness initiatives by  75 percent. And we look for  ideas from both inside and  outside the company. Our G-WIN innovation portal is  designed to allow researchers  from around the world to submit  their ideas on how to solve  technical challenges such as  removing salt from products.

In  addition to supplying food, General  Mills Canada employees volunteer  to serve the meals every morning  at Brian W. Fleming School near  our Canadian office in Toronto. In the U.S., our school breakfast  program provides more than   1 million servings of whole grain  every day to school children. We  offer more than 60 products made  with whole grain – from Cheerios  to Pillsbury Mini Pancakes. And in the Philippines, we are  supporting Food for Hungry Minds,   a nonprofit organization that  operates a school for poor urban  children with high potential.  As part of the program, the  students receive daily breakfast  and lunch at the school. Recognizing the importance of breakfast in helping children excel in school,  General Mills supports breakfast programs in schools around the world. The dedication and depth of commitment General Mills  provides through the breakfast program every day means  that our children do not have to go to class without a  breakfast. Providing a healthy meal at the beginning of the  day means that students can go to class without being  hungry and gives them the fuel to think and learn. – Christine Parr, Principal of Brian W.

Since the outreach program was launched in 2010,  weve connected with more than 500,000 people  in Latino neighborhoods in Chicago, Los Angeles,  Houston and Oakland, Calif. A topic of special focus  has been diabetes awareness and prevention. As common as the disease is in the general  population, diabetes is even more prevalent among  Latinos. Hispanics account for 10.4 percent of   adults 20 years and older with this disease,   and African-Americans account for   11.8 percent, while only 6.6 percent of   Caucasian Americans are diagnosed as diabetic.   Weve partnered with medical expert  Dr. Aliza Lifshitz, who has regular health  programs on Univision television and radio  as well as syndicated weekly columns in  several Spanish-language newspapers.  Lifshitz stresses the importance of  both a wholesome diet and physical  exercise in preventing diabetes. General Mills provides health and nutrition information  to our many customers in several different ways. Replacing the front-of-pack labeling  icons that have been in place on  our Big G cereals since 2004, weve  adopted a new system known as  Nutrition Keys. This new voluntary  system, which has been adopted  by other food companies, has four  basic icons for calories, saturated  fat, sodium and sugar. There  are also two optional icons that  represent nutrients to encourage. Weve partnered with universities,  bloggers and other creators  of gluten-free food to build a  new Gluten Freely website that  serves as a one-stop shop for  consumers who are looking for  information and products to  lead a gluten-free lifestyle. Our Eat Better Early website to  help moms on a budget – including  those eligible for the U.S. federal  WIC (Women, Infants and Children)  program – continues to grow.

As part of that pledge, Green Giant  launched its High 5 campaign – which  aligns with the government effort to  get people to eat at least five servings  of fruits and vegetables per day – in  the fall of 2011. Olympic hurdler Colin  Jackson serves as spokesman.

Under the new limits set by the  Childrens Food and Beverage Advertising  Initiative (CFBAI), about one-third of  the products currently advertised to  children in the U.S. would have to be  reformulated, or they could no longer be  advertised to kids after Dec. 31, 2013. Because General Mills has been  aggressively improving the health and  nutrition profile of our products, only three  of our products – Go-Gurt, Fruit Shapes  and Fruit Gushers – would not meet the  CFBAI standard. (Reformulation efforts  are under way on these products.) Our marketing guidelines underscore  the companys commitment to  responsible advertising by stating that  all marketing activity should respect  three key steps to healthier living:  balance, moderation and exercise.   PR6 General Mills has had marketing guidelines in place for more  than 30 years, and we update them annually.  General Mills Global responsibility   20 One of our most cherished values is We do the right thing, all the time.  We trace this philosophy to a fatal  explosion more than 125 years ago  at a Washburn Crosby Company  flour mill in Minneapolis – a  predecessor to General Mills.  In response, owner Cadwallader  Washburn established a fund to help  the families left behind, financed  an orphanage and invested to  create safer working conditions.  That belief system has been with us  ever since and permeates our culture  – even down to our corporate policies.  One of those policies, for example,  specifies that we should donate safe     food whenever possible to avoid  the destruction of edible food. Not only is it the right thing to  do, but we save money by not  sending waste to the landfill, and  we also gain some tax benefits.  More important is the goodwill we  earn from longtime partners like  Feeding America and our customers.  Our consumers – and increasingly,  retailers – want to do business with  companies that reflect their values. Likewise, employees want to  work for a company that shares  their values. Engaged employees  are productive employees. So our charitable programs – including  employee volunteerism – are organized  around our core food business: n    To provide food to those in need. n    To develop and share food solutions. n    To help families make  nutritious food choices. n    To integrate food with  healthy, active lifestyles. These are examples of how a  values-based culture is at the core  of our long-term business strategy.

Founding support for the Guthrie  Theater, the Minneapolis Institute of  Arts, libraries, and even a state forest  are all part of the legacy that the  Pillsbury family left over the years.  As corporate leaders, the Pillsburys  pioneered ideas, such as corporate  profit-sharing with employees,  which helped ensure the community  maintained a prosperous middle  class.

Mindful that parents care deeply  about their childrens education  and equally mindful of low  redemption rates on General Mills  coupons in northern California,  sales employees Tom Iverson  and Matt DeFano had an idea. Would consumers respond to the  opportunity to raise money for their  schools by buying General Mills  products and clipping the Box  Tops on products? And would  retailers support the program? Nearly two decades later, the answer  is a resounding yes to both. Today, nearly 70,000 kindergarten  to eighth-grade schools are active  participants in what has become the  largest and best-known education  cause-marketing program in the  United States. Box Tops for Education  provides schools with funding for  whatever students need, everything  from playground equipment to  paint, computers to clarinets. Co-founder Iverson retired from  General Mills in March 2012 after a  37-year career, but his legacy – Box  Tops for Education – continues on.  For every lid redeemed in fiscal  2011, we made a donation to breast  cancer programs in the community  where the lid was collected. Since  1998, when Save Lids to Save Lives  began, Yoplait has contributed  more than US$25 million to  promote research and awareness. We donated another US$2 million  to the cause in 2011 through  our companywide Pink Together  campaign, now in its fifth year.

As a food company based in  Minnesota, were committed  to tackling this problem. So in  June 2011, General Mills pledged  US$1 million in financial support  to Hunger-Free Minnesota,  a three-year initiative that  hopes to provide 100 million  more meals every year to  hungry people in the state.  The US$1 million donation  will help expand existing food  support and child nutrition  programs. Founding partners of  Hunger-Free Minnesota include  Feeding America food banks in  Minnesota, Hunger Solutions  Minnesota, the Greater Twin  Cities United Way and several  Minnesota-based companies.  As part of the program launch,  General Mills hosted a Twin  Cities Hunger Forum, where  200 local hunger-relief leaders  gathered to share ideas on how  to improve access to food and  help eligible people get enrolled  in food-support programs.

Project Peanut Butter treated  more than 60,000 malnourished  children in Malawi in 2011. PFS currently is providing help to  new Project Peanut Butter facilities in  Mali and Sierra Leone, where one in  five kids die from malnutrition before  age 5. One project, for example,  was led by volunteer James Blair, a  quality assurance coordinator at our  Berwick plant in the United Kingdom.

Its not just food, but  volunteerism and giving, too. The highlight of international  support in calendar 2011 was the  creation of a new Key Market  Giving Program. Partnering with  United Way Worldwide, the  company is providing significant  financial support – with grants  ranging from US$75,000 to  more than US$150,000 – to  organizations in India, China and  Canada that are fighting hunger  and striving to improve nutrition. In China, for example, support is  helping expand construction of  water cellars in exceptionally dry  areas, providing water to grow and  cook food. In Nashik, India, nearly  2,000 new families will be added  to a hunger and nutrition program.  And in Canada, General Mills is  providing nutrition and physical  activity grants to help address  the long-term implications  of chronic poverty, as well as  providing school breakfasts  and nutrition education.  In fiscal 2011, support from  our International Community  Grants program reached  nearly US$400,000, reflecting  requests from 18 countries –  nearly double the US$220,000  in support in fiscal 2010. Our giving reflects our values  and our mission, says Goldberg  Luger. We are nourishing  lives around the world. That effort includes  volunteerism, too. More than half of General  Mills employees outside of  the United States volunteer  in their communities, and  in the United States, that  number jumps to 83 percent.

Two General Mills  employees lost family members in  the storm, which devastated the town  and killed more than 100 people.  General Mills donated another  US$25,000 to the American Red  Cross to assist tornado victims in  north Minneapolis. In both cities,  we also pitched in with product  donations to feed displaced  people and relief workers.  We supported other disaster  relief efforts around the world in  2011, including the following. In Japan, where we donated  US$650,000 to the Red Cross  International Disaster Relief  fund to help victims of the  earthquake and tsunami, and also  matched employee donations.  In New Zealand, where US$35,000  was given to the New Zealand  Red Cross in the wake of a 6.3  magnitude earthquake.  In the southeastern U.S., where  more than US$600,000 in cash and  food products was donated to the  American Red Cross after tornadoes  moved through eight states.  In Australia and Brazil, where  US$50,000 was donated to each  country through the Red Cross  International Disaster Relief  fund following severe floods.  In Indonesia, where US$5,000  was given to help victims of a  volcanic eruption on Java. The importance of lending a hand to disaster victims hit close to home in 2011 when tornadoes  struck Minneapolis and Joplin, Mo., two communities where General Mills employees live and work. The entire Minnesotan Somali community  is impacted by the humanitarian crisis in  Somalia. It means a lot to the community  when General Mills takes action. As  an employee, it makes me proud. – Abdirizak Abdi, Somalia native and General Mills   senior applications analyst WATCH VIDEO Watch a video about   how a conference room   at our Joplin, Mo., plant was  used to distribute donated  items – from toothbrushes to  clothing – to tornado victims.  Aid to Somalia As a global food company, General Mills was able to help when the   United Nations declared Somalia and the Horn of Africa region to be in a   state of famine (the first such U.N. declaration in 30 years). We contributed   US$100,000 in food relief to the American Refugee Committee, which leveraged an  additional US$200,000 in donations from other Twin Cities companies. Minnesota,  our home base, is also home to the largest Somali population outside Africa.

Its the third garden that General  Mills volunteers have helped to  establish at elementary schools  in the Hamburg area – giving city  kids a chance to get outdoors,  work together, and learn about  nature and how food is grown.  The new Hamburg garden is a  smaller, up-and-coming version  of another giving garden  near our world headquarters in  Minneapolis. The employee- cultivated Minneapolis garden  generated nearly 1,400 pounds  of organic vegetables in 2011,  and was expanded from  1,600 to 2,750 square feet to  accommodate more plants.  The fresh produce grown there  is donated to hunger-relief  organizations in the Twin Cities  area, including Loaves & Fishes  and PRISM Food Shelf, which  give or serve the vegetables  to low-income people. In 2011, more than 200  volunteers worked together to  grow carrots, lettuce, tomatoes,  beans, broccoli, peppers,  cauliflower and other vegetables.  In April 2011, employees from our Central and Eastern European  headquarters in Hamburg, Germany, teamed up with a group of children  to convert a field by the kids school into a thriving garden.  1,400 lbs. Thats the total weight  of the carrots, beans  and other fresh organic  vegetables grown for  hungry people at our  Minneapolis garden in 2011.  Introducing youth to brand careers In the summer of 2011, we hosted a networking event for students and alumni  from the Minneapolis-based nonprofit organization The BrandLab, which  provides young people from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with exposure  to careers in marketing and advertising.

The cornerstone of our long-standing  wellness initiatives are three  similar programs that are tailored  for different employee groups: n    TriHealthalon for sales employees. n    Total You for employees at  corporate headquarters. n    Health Number for  manufacturing employees. Employees in each group are asked to  complete a confidential online health  assessment. In addition, employees body  mass index, blood pressure, blood sugar  and blood levels are measured and tracked.  Employees are also encouraged to  consult with our on-staff team of  doctors, physicians assistants, nurses  and physical therapists concerning  the results of these tests, as well  as any other medical concerns.  Many of our facilities have fitness centers  and wellness counseling programs. In  addition, the company offers a number  of financial incentives for U.S.-based  employees who exercise, dont smoke  and take the health assessment. Our programs are tailored to meet local  needs. In Canada, for example, we provide  a workshop on seasonal affective disorder  for those affected by shortened daylight  during winter in northern latitudes.  In India, we sponsor blood donation  camps that allow employees to get  screened for Thalassemia disease, which  is most common in South Asia, the  Mediterranean and Africa. Thalassemia is  an inherited blood disorder characterized  by a decreased ability of the blood  to carry oxygen throughout the body,  resulting in fatigue and anemia. LA8 Companys energy czar boosts personal output to lose 80 pounds Jon russetts job requires  him to look for ways to save  the company energy. but  in his personal life, he is  constantly looking for ways  to expend more energy. the facilities engineer – who  oversees the companys  global effort to trim energy  costs – lost 80 pounds over  the past few years by moving  more and eating less. He ran 50 miles the week he  turned 50 last year. When  i was in high school, i was so  out of shape i couldnt run a  mile, and now i can run five  miles a day, says russett.   the turning point came  when russett saw his doctor  before moving from our  plant in belvidere, ill., to  Minneapolis in 2006.  i was starting a new job with  the company, moving to a new  city – and my health was not  good. i was overweight and on  medication for high cholesterol  and high blood pressure. even  though i had undergone back  surgery a few years earlier, i still  needed pain medication for my  back. the doctor told me i would  have to do something different  if i wanted to enjoy my life. He  made a very simple suggestion,  which was to eat just half of the  food in front of me and throw the  rest away, and to start exercising.  and thats just what russett  did. When he moved to  Minneapolis, he took advantage  of the company fitness center,  where he worked out on the  treadmill. He increased his  time gradually and eventually  worked up to a 5-mile run.  support from his wife, co-workers  and company have made a  huge difference to russett.  at General Mills, the culture  of health and wellness is  everywhere you turn. theres  the fitness center, the fitness  coaches and wellness groups,  and other incentives. its also  helpful to see your co-workers  exercising. there are plenty of  resources and support available  – you just have to figure out  what works for you, he says.  Just this winter, russett finally  quit wearing his old winter  coat – now many sizes too big.  but he keeps his old photo on  his employee badge, looking  at it from time to time to  remind himself of his former  size – and the effort it took  to lose those 80 pounds.  r Jon Russett conserves energy in his role  overseeing the companys global energy- reduction efforts but expends extra personal  energy to keep his weight in check.

In fiscal 2011,  the spending with these suppliers reached  $552 million, reflecting relationships  with vendors that provide everything  from energy services to ingredients, legal  services to communications support. Highlights of the year include continued  growth, heightened attention to women- owned firms and an initial rollout of  a tier-two program that assesses  suppliers own diversity spending. The program is about relationships.  Its about growth. And its about the  potential for impact that reaches deep  into our business and our communities. Just ask MW Logistics, a Dallas-based  company that has provided transportation  and logistics services to General Mills  for several years. The company not only  has thrived through the relationship, it  also has been able to help kids learn  to read through Operation Uplift, a  program that has provided thousands of  books to Dallas-area school children. Our thinking was, if we have any success  at all, we ought to try to plow back into our  communities some of our time and some  of our resources, to try to help boys and  girls, says Randy Bowman, president and  co-owner of MW Logistics. The best way to  develop a strong relationship with parents  is to demonstrate to working mothers and  fathers that you care about their children. Operation Uplift currently is in the middle of  a five-year, 7,500-book effort. The initiative  was inspired by the Cheerios Spoonfuls of  Stories program that since 2002 has given  away 50 million books inside Cheerios  boxes and donated more than $3.5 million  to First Book, the award-winning nonprofit  organization that provides children from  low-income families the opportunity to  read and own their first new books. The strong relationship between MW  Logistics and General Mills is not unique. This is all about solution development,  says Darren Harmon, director of Supplier  Diversity & Business Development.  We continually strive to build a solid  pipeline that benefits General Mills,  our suppliers and our communities.  For more information on diversity  at General Mills, see page 64.

Employees are encouraged to seek  help when trying to determine the  right course of action, either through  their manager or via the Ethics Line,  which provides for anonymous  reporting. The Ethics Line is available  around the world 24 hours a day,  seven days a week, through a  toll-free phone number or online. At our Ethics in Action event held  in February 2011, Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist James Stewart  provided an external perspective  on the causes of unethical behavior.  He cautioned that friendship and  loyalty often prevent employees  from speaking up when aware of  wrongdoing. Others may justify their  actions by stressing that everyone  is doing it. Wrongdoers also can be  motivated by a desire to advance the  company – and their own reputations.  In his remarks, Chairman and  Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell  urged employees to avoid being  complacent about ethics and fraud  issues. Dont be afraid to ask a  question or raise a concern, he  said. We are proud of our stellar  reputation, but this isnt something  we can take for granted. Weve got to  keep working on it and honoring it. To that end, Powell honored  the companys three 2011  ethics champions:  n    An employee from India who  notified Human Resources  when she mistakenly received  pay while on leave.  n    An employee from the United  Kingdom who refused a  vendors offer of an all-expense- paid ski trip to Austria.  n    An employee from Brazil  who notified the finance  department and stepped up  training when expense report  discrepancies were discovered.  Ethics is a companywide, global  concern at General Mills. Our Code  of Conduct, corporate policies,  online training and Ethics Line  are available in 11 languages. At General Mills, we have high expectations for ethical conduct in every aspect  of our business. That commitment starts with senior leadership.  Fraud expert speaks  at General Mills James Ratley, president and CEO  of the Association of Certified  Fraud Examiners, was at our  headquarters in May 2011 to speak  on Understanding the Mindset of  the Fraudster. Ratley discussed  several recent high-profile cases  of corporate fraud, which costs  organizations an estimated   5 percent of annual revenues. In  2008, General Mills adopted a  more comprehensive fraud policy  that makes being aware of a fraud  and not reporting it a violation.  Our Ethics Line is available to  General Mills employees around  the world 24 hours a day, seven  days a week, through a toll-free  phone number and online.  24/7 In 2011, General Mills was named one of the worlds  most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute.  General Mills Global responsibility   36 We build consumer loyalty, societal trust and shareholder   value by integrating sustainability into our strategies,  our operations and our products. This approach is driven by two  movements that continue to  gain traction in our company:  Continuous Improvement and  Holistic Margin Management. Continuous Improvement (CI)  encourages total employee  ownership of all of our processes –  from plant production lines to our  executive management team – to  eliminate and prevent waste. Holistic Margin Management (HMM)  is a similar effort. It calls on cross- functional teams to understand     the drivers of value for our brands  and to eliminate nonvalue-added  costs throughout the supply chain.  These savings are then reinvested  to further grow our businesses. Our goal is to accrue US$4 billion in  HMM savings between fiscal 2010  and 2020. Weve made substantial  progress toward this goal. Oftentimes, these initiatives result  in environmental benefits as well.  Take PrintSmart, for example,  which began in 2007 to curb the  use of printers and paper at our  headquarters in Minneapolis. By reducing the number of printers –  and setting computer defaults to print  in black instead of color and on both  sides of a sheet of paper – we have:  n   Reduced paper use by   21 million pages per year. n   Saved US$1.1 million per year. This is just one of hundreds of  examples where an efficiency  improvement has resulted in an  environmental benefit, and why  CI and HMM are at the core of  our sustainability program.

Because our goals  are rate-based, theyre impacted  by fluctuations in the amount of  product that we manufacture, as well  as other factors such as changes to  product mix. With our volume down  slightly in fiscal 2011, we made less  progress, percentage-wise, toward  achieving our goals this fiscal year  compared with previous years.  In absolute terms, however,  we improved across all of our  sustainability metrics versus last  year, meaning that we used fewer  resources and generated less waste in  fiscal 2011 than in 2010. Plus, several  of our facilities and divisions made  strong progress toward reducing their  environmental footprint this year.

In total, these energy-saving  opportunities represent about  US$1 million in annual savings  for Wellston, while reducing the  plants impact on the environment.  In addition, the audit process is an  opportunity for people across the  company to learn from each other  about energy savings and how to  achieve them, says Mark Robinson,  an engineer at our Cedar Rapids,  Iowa, plant who helped launch  the program. The plan is for key  personnel at each audited plant to  attend the next plants audit – to  share what theyve learned and keep  the ball rolling as we strive to work  smarter and more sustainably. EN 5, EN 7 As one more step toward reaching our 2015 environmental goals, weve launched an energy audit  program designed to spread sustainability best practices throughout our production facilities.  Steaming hot coffee Our Cereal Partners Worldwide  Innovation Center in Orbe,  Switzerland, a joint venture with  Nestl, generates its backup  steam heat from coffee grounds  — one of the unique sustainability  features that helped it earn  platinum certification (the highest  level possible) under Leadership  in Energy and Environmental  Design (LEED) standards.

Our calculations are based on the  U.S. Environmental Protection  Agencys Climate Leaders  Greenhouse Gas Inventory  Protocol. It should also be noted  that General Mills is a participant  in the Carbon Disclosure Project. Essentially all of the greenhouse  gases produced by the companys  manufacturing plants are  derived from energy usage. We  use natural gas, fuel oil and  propane, as well as electricity  generated by various sources. EN 7, EN 16, EN 18 We continue to work toward our 20 percent greenhouse gas emission rate reduction goal for 2015.  In fiscal 2011, our total greenhouse gas emissions due to energy use in our production facilities  was 0.20 metric tons per metric ton of product (as expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents).  Energy efficiency at Arras Our Hagen-Dazs plant in Arras,  France, has energy efficiency built  into its location: All suppliers  are local, which results in fresher  ingredients but also fuel savings  and a smaller carbon footprint.  Conserving energy is a priority inside  the facility as well. By optimizing its  air conditioning system to improve  temperature control, ventilation and  humidity, for example, Arras saved  578 megawatt hours per year of gas  and 824 megawatt hours per year of  electricity. Switching to LED lighting  in its cold storage area saved another  50 megawatt hours of electricity.

Burning  oat hulls cuts the plants carbon  footprint by 21 percent and saves  about US$390,000 per year, mostly  from reduced natural gas costs.  Our biomass burner addressed two  compelling business needs – saving  money and reducing our footprint  on the environment, says Ken  Powell, General Mills chairman  and chief executive officer. Weve  sharpened our focus on building  sustainability into every step, from  seed to spoon, and this project is  one of the most recent and visible  successes from this journey. Accomplishments such as the  biomass burner inspire and challenge  all General Mills employees to  dream big when developing creative  solutions to make General Mills an  even more sustainable company. In addition to producing steam and  heat for the Fridley plant, leftover oat  hulls are used by a local electricity  provider, Koda Energy, to power  approximately 17,000 homes a year. And the benefits extend beyond  energy. After the oat hulls have  been burned, the resulting  ash is distributed to nearby  farmers who use it as a nutrient  supplement to improve soil. EN 5, EN 7 The use of oat hulls as an energy source for the companys first biomass-powered plant  received the 2011 Consumer Packaged Goods Award for Innovation and Creativity  from the Grocery Manufacturers Association and its Associate Member Council.

Its a seasonal process  that leaves some greenhouses  empty at times. When space is  available, its set aside for the  cultivation and care of young trees.  Planting trees is a natural fit  for our company. Trees absorb  carbon dioxide, which helps  curb global warming. They also  help prevent the erosion of soil,  a precious natural resource that  our business depends on.  It takes time and commitment  to condition seeds, get them to  germinate, transplant them into  pots, and then care for the trees  until theyre large enough to be  planted. Hundreds of employees  and their families have volunteered  over the years to nurture ash, pine,  pirul, mesquite, jacaranda, huisache  and other seedlings to life.  Our employees green thumbs are  just getting started. Their goal is  to plant an additional 1,500 trees  every year over the next decade. The Irapuato teams vision is to  plant enough trees for the facility  to become carbon-neutral. EN 14, EN 18 Over the past 15 years, General Mills employees have transformed the  landscape near our facility in Irapuato, Mexico, by planting thousands of trees  — trees raised from seedlings right in the facilitys own greenhouses.

Reducing our water usage Saving water by greening our red sauce Water is critical to food  manufacturing – it is used as  an ingredient, a coolant, and to  clean and sanitize manufacturing  equipment. We track the usage  of water in each facility to identify  areas of high usage and target  opportunities for water conservation. What they didnt expect was that  the improvements would save an  estimated 1.5 million gallons of water  per year (enough to supply 12 homes  for an entire year) and an additional  1,000 million BTUs of energy to heat  that water (enough energy to heat  about 13 homes for an entire year).  After receiving the jars from our  supplier, the plant washes them  before filling them with red sauce. The changes save about  US$22,000 per year ($12,000  in water savings and about  $10,000 in energy savings). By simplifying the mechanics behind  the jar-washing process, they have  improved the overall efficiency of the  Old El Paso sauce line – at the same  time making the line greener and  more reliable with fewer breakdowns.  In fiscal 2011, our total water usage rate was 2.06 cubic meters per metric ton of production –   an 11 percent reduction in our water usage rate and halfway to our 20 percent reduction goal.

To minimize erosion and improve  water quality, project teams have  worked with area growers to  recover lost wetlands, and construct  storm water ponds and drainage  ditches that filter runoff from  farm fields using native plants.  General Mills funds were used   to help 31 landowners reduce   or develop plans to reduce soil  erosion on their farms. A total   of 12 conservation practices   were installed and another 19 are  planned. The installed practices  have reduced sediment runoff  by 486 tons per year, according  to The Nature Conservancys final  report on the three-year project.  The effectiveness of these  conservation efforts is being shared  with the broader agricultural  community. In addition, General  Mills funds were used to  secure more federal money  that was used for conservation  efforts along the Root River.

According to the Global  Water Policy Project, global  agriculture consumes  92 percent of all fresh  water used annually. Identifying and managing our water risks We worked with WWF – the worlds  largest conservation organization  – in 2010 to map potential water  risks in our supply chain for the  majority of the dairy, sugar, wheat,  and oats used in our products.   This supply chain water risk analysis  – developed by WWF – has helped  General Mills identify potential  physical, regulatory and reputational  water risks associated with sourcing  these commodities. We have applied  this information and developed a  water stewardship strategy that  will help us work toward improving  water efficiency and managing  water risks in both our operations  and throughout our supply chain.   The framework behind the water  risk analysis conducted for General  Mills was leveraged in the creation  of WWFs online Water Risk Filter  that was developed with support  from DEG, the German Development  Bank. We plan to continue to expand  our knowledge of our corporate  water risk by using the Water Risk  Filter to assess and manage water  risk in our global operations. The work we did together is part  of the foundation of the Water  Risk Filter that we hope will be  used by many more companies  to examine their risk with an eye  toward reducing their water footprint  in water stressed regions and  becoming better water stewards,  says Jeff Malcolm, manager of  Supply Chains at WWF, who worked  with General Mills on the project.

Working with recyclers, Mendez  expanded the plan to include  corrugated boxes, and also carton  cores, sacks and other items that  typically just get tossed out.  The plant also added a new recycling  center and a loading dock where its  recycling provider keeps a 48-foot  trailer on site. When a trailer is full,  the recycler removes the ready-to- recycle materials from our facility. Its an arrangement thats enabled  the plant to reduce trash pickups  and trips to the recycler, generate  about US$2,500 more per month  in recycling revenue, and shrink  its landfill output by 80 percent.  One medium-sized trash can now handles all the waste generated by two busy  production lines at our plant in Albuquerque, N.M. – a sign of how far the facility has  progressed in its commitment to recycling and shrinking its environmental footprint.

And  thats exactly what has happened. About US$1.8 million has been raised  (including investments from the North  American Millers Association and the  USDAs Agricultural Research Service) to  support the work of an international team  at 10 U.S. universities, nine international  laboratories and five Agricultural  Research Service (ARS) locations. Using conventional oat-breeding  techniques, for example, the researchers  are exploring ways to boost levels of  soluble fiber, which has been shown to  reduce the risk of heart disease when  eaten with a diet low in saturated fat and  cholesterol. Researchers are also working  to boost levels of healthful vitamin E in oats. Working to create healthier oats Thanks, in part, to a General Mills seed grant, a genetic roadmap of oats has been completed that is already  spurring more research into making this important food crop an even healthier food source. In eastern Idaho in the U.S., General  Mills recently launched a three-year  pilot project with 25 wheat growers to  study the environmental impact of wheat  production, which will include data on  greenhouse gas emissions, irrigation water  use, energy use, soil loss and land use. General Mills is working on the project  through Field to Market, the Keystone  Alliance for Sustainable Agricultures  initiative to improve the agricultural  supply chain. The alliance is made  up of producers, agribusinesses,  food companies and conservation  organizations working together to create  sustainable outcomes for agriculture.   General Mills is collaborating with  the wheat growers to analyze their  farming footprint for the 2010, 2011  and 2012 growing seasons. Ultimately,  the program will allow growers  to share best practices in nutrient  management, pest management and  other farming practices that will lead  to more environmentally sustainable  and economical production of wheat. A similar effort is under way in western  Canada. Were working with grower  groups to study two decades of  sustainability indicators – land use, soil  loss, energy use and climate impact – on  eight different crops, including wheat,  oats, lentils, canola, peas and flax.  The approach is similar to the one  developed by Field to Market in the  U.S., but tailored to fit the climate  and geography of western Canada. Whether you are growing oats in Canada  or harvesting wheat in Idaho, these  projects will help farmers build more  sustainable practices into their operations  with the goal of improving yields with  fewer impacts on the environment, says  Tom Rabaey, a senior scientist with the  General Mills Agricultural Research Center.

General Mills acquired  a manure spreader that our 50 or so  contract growers can use to apply it. It requires a lot of energy to produce  synthetic fertilizer – every pound  of synthetic fertilizer generates  about 3 pounds of greenhouse gas.  The switch is estimated to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions by about  12,000 tons per year, the equivalent  of taking 2,000 cars off the road.  The manure is also cheaper than synthetic  fertilizer, helps retain soil moisture so  the crops require less water and boosts  yield by about 3 percent, on average.  This initiative is a win for us on every  level, says Tom Rabaey, a senior scientist  with the General Mills Agricultural  Research Center. It takes a byproduct  from the poultry industry and uses it to  grow vegetable crops – increasing yields,  saving farmers money, and reducing water  use and greenhouse gas emissions. EN 18   Reducing greenhouse gas emissions with organic fertilizers With guidance from General Mills, more and more farmers from central Mexico are using organic compost   from nearby chicken farms – instead of synthetic fertilizer – to spread on broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and celery. 12,000  tons per year Thats the amount of  greenhouse gases we  estimate our contract  farmers are saving per  year by using organic  fertilizer instead of  energy-intensive  synthetic fertilizer. 1.1 billion gallons per year Thats how much water we estimate is being saved by encouraging  more use of drip irrigation in central Mexico. About 43 percent of  the acreage used by our contract farmers who grow broccoli and  cauliflower now uses drip irrigation, which consumes half the water  of conventional furrow irrigation. That is up from about 32 percent in  fiscal 2009. In 2008, our Agricultural Research Center established a  revolving loan fund that our contract growers can use to buy this more  efficient equipment.

We changed 43 percent of our  retail cereal box volume to this  liner, which weighs 10 percent  less than the previous plastic  liner. The switch, which was  fully implemented in the second  quarter of fiscal 2011, means  were saving about 775,000  pounds of plastic per year.  n   In January 2011, we started using  a lighter weight corrugated fiber   to pack and display our cases  of snacks like Chex Mix, Bugles  and Gardettos in convenience  stores. This lighter corrugated  fiber means the packaging for  each case weighs less by half a  pound – or 13 percent. Its saved  an estimated 1.1 million pounds of  paper-based packaging per year.

General Mills Global responsibility   54 ISSUES Responsible sourcing Responsible corporations around the  world are increasingly making responsible  sourcing a material consideration  when managing their supply chains. General Mills believes in the protection  of human rights. General Mills Supplier  Code of Conduct, for example, prohibits  the use of forced labor and child labor in  the making of its ingredients and products.  We are signatories to the United Nations  Global Compact (UNGC) and are guided  by the International Labour Organizations  (ILO) 1998 Declaration on Fundamental  Principles and Rights at Work. We hold  our suppliers to these same principles. We are committed to reinforcing and  elevating our standards every day. HR 6 Cocoa We care about our ingredients and the  lives of the people who produce them.  Cocoa is one example. General Mills  does not buy cocoa directly from farmers;  rather, we source products such as  chocolate from ingredient manufacturers.  It is our view, however, that a greater   share of the benefit of more socially  and economically sustainable cocoa  production practices should accrue to  the people who produce the crop.  Cocoa is one of the priority commodities  we are addressing in our sustainable  sourcing model. Sustainable methods and  improved production practices could help  raise living standards for cocoa growers. In 2011, we joined the World Cocoa  Foundation (WCF). This 70-member  nonprofit group is working to encourage  socially, economically and environmentally  responsible and sustainable cocoa  farming. It is a multiyear effort that  reflects General Mills core beliefs. But we also believe we may be able to  help cocoa growers by helping to improve  the value chain. Too often, too much  value accrues to cocoa aggregators and  processors, and too little to cocoa growers.  Indirect vertical integration holds promise  for its potential to link the entire ingredient  supply chain to ensure better returns for  growers and producers. Partnering from  village to plate is clearly difficult, but  increasingly possible. This is the model  we are working to advance: generating  better sources, improving sustainability,  and fostering greater economic vitality  for cocoa growing communities.  Vanilla A tropical crop, vanilla is grown in a select  few areas of the world. Unfortunately,  vanilla growers are quite vulnerable  to a number of external factors,  including price volatility, inclement  weather and recurrent crop disease.  General Mills is working to help  vanilla growers by deepening global  understanding of the vanilla plant itself.  Specifically, General Mills is funding  cutting-edge research to map the  vanilla genome. Already under way at  the University of California–Davis, this  research will help lay the foundation  for natural and conventional breeding  improvements to increase disease  resistance or even to enhance flavor.  It is our hope that by better understanding  the vanilla plant, our efforts will help vanilla  farmers generate more income from larger,  more consistent, higher-quality crops. Palm oil General Mills is concerned about the role  of palm oil expansion in the deforestation  of the worlds rainforests and about the  impact of deforestation on biodiversity,  endangered species, greenhouse gas  emissions and indigenous peoples. Responsible sourcing is a critical part of our Nourishing Lives mission and business – and we are gratified that our efforts to operate sustainably  and ethically have been recognized by several third-party groups, such as the Ethisphere Institute, Corporate Responsibility magazine and Forbes. The United Nations  estimates that 5.2 million  hectares of forest are being  lost globally every year. 52 million r A cocoa farmer in West Africa with a cocoa pod.  Its our view that a greater share of cocoa revenue  should accrue to the people who produce the crop.  r Vanilla is produced from vines like this one in  Madagascar, an island just west of the southern tip of  Africa. Were helping fund a program to map the vanilla  genome in the hope that it will help vanilla farmers  generate more income and create an improved crop.       General Mills Global responsibility   55 To help ensure that our purchases are not  in any way associated with deforestation  of rainforests, and to reinforce the  development of certified sustainable palm  oil production practices, General Mills has   committed to striving to source 100 percent   of our palm oil from responsible and  sustainable sources by 2015.  Our Global Sourcing team is advancing  our pledge by identifying and securing  sources of sustainably produced palm  oil in a phased approach. By taking  a leadership position with peers and  suppliers – and by supporting necessary  work on the ground to encourage  sustainable palm oil production – we  hope to help champion the production  of palm oil in an environmentally  and socially responsible way. On these and other topics, we continue  to engage with and learn from a  broad network of external groups  and partners, such as the World  Wildlife Fund, Rainforest Alliance,  and Rainforest Action Network.  External engagement helps broaden our  perspective and deepen our expertise  – and it is a necessary best practice in  advancing global social responsibility. Eggs We care about the humane treatment  of animals – and we acknowledge  the discussion about egg production  and the impact of production  conditions on egg-laying hens.  In Europe, Hagen-Dazs – our largest  international business – is working  with local suppliers to increase the  volume of eggs available from free- range hens. As a result, we now expect  to source 100 percent free-range for  all Hagen-Dazs products in Europe  in 2013, while continuing to support  local sourcing and local suppliers. To encourage the development of  alternative production methods in the U.S.,  General Mills is buying 1 million cage- free eggs for its U.S. portfolio in 2012.  With help from several external  organizations, General Mills has  developed a sustainable sourcing  model for ingredients we purchase  to make our products. the development of this model is a  major step forward in our mission to  conserve and protect the natural resources  that our company depends on, says  steve peterson, sourcing director for  General Mills. We now have a solid  model to guide us for the future. in 2011, we worked to complete  a comprehensive, in-depth  assessment of all the ingredients  and materials we buy worldwide.  they were measured against dozens of  potential risk categories, such as animal  welfare, greenhouse gas emissions, soil  loss, water quality and water use.  our model calls for us to focus first on  ingredients like oats, wheat, vanilla and  palm oil. With the model completed, we  are now developing specific strategies for  sustainably sourcing these ingredients. in addition, in november 2011, we began  asking our top suppliers to complete our  supplier scorecard, which asks for data  on energy use, greenhouse gas emissions,  water use and solid waste generation  that is associated with the ingredients or  material we use to make our products. We recognize that General Mills accounts  for only a portion of the environmental  footprint of our products. a large share  of the environmental impact occurs  upstream of our facilities. With our  supplier scorecard, we will be able to make  a greater impact on the total footprint.     We want to be proactive – not reactive  in how we source our ingredients, says  Jerry lynch, vice president and chief  sustainability officer. our business  relies on these natural resources, so  we need to do everything we can  to protect and conserve them.

General Mills Global responsibility   56 Standards, communication and collaboration The foundation of General Mills  compliance program concerning  responsible sourcing is: n   Our clear commitment to  protecting human rights  in our own workplace. n   Our communication of  our expectations to our  suppliers through our  Supplier Code of Conduct. n   Our expanding program to  assure compliance with our  Supplier Code of Conduct.   Starting with our  own workplaces We have a Code of Conduct  that we communicate to all  employees around the world. The Code reflects our commitment  to, and expectations of, our own  employees. Through our Code we  communicate our commitments: n   To provide a safe and  respectful workplace. n   To comply with labor and  employment laws. n   To provide an ethical workplace  free of corruption. n   To strive to create an environment  of mutual trust and respect. As part of our efforts to meet our  high standards, we include all of  our own plants in our third-party  auditing program. Additionally,  we have multiple systems for  providing feedback so employees  around the world can freely speak  up when they have a concern  about standards not being met.  For example, we provide our  employees with a hotline and  website to report concerns –  anonymously, if they choose  – regarding Code violations. Communicating our  values and expectations General Mills is committed to  protecting human rights in our  workplaces and throughout  our supply chain. Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets  out our expectations of our suppliers  in these areas. Together, our Supplier  Code of Conduct and Workplace  Standards and Ethical Sourcing Policy  set standards for ourselves, as well  as for our suppliers, vendors and  other business partners, regarding  the protection of human rights.  These standards are based in  part on the International Labour  Organizations 1998 Declaration  on Fundamental Principles  and Rights at Work. Guided by  the 1998 Declaration, General  Mills respects the principles of  collective bargaining and freedom  of association, and prohibition  of discrimination, child labor  and forced labor – including that  associated with human trafficking.  HR 5, HR 6, HR 7 r General Mills is committed to protecting human rights  in our workplaces and throughout our supply chain.  We are signatories to the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC) and are guided by the International  Labour Organizations (ILO) 1998 Declaration on  Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.  General Mills Global responsibility   57 Third-party auditing General Mills uses internationally  recognized third-party auditors to  test compliance with our responsible  sourcing standards at our own  plants and with third parties that  produce finished goods for us. We are on pace to complete audits  at each of our in-scope finished  goods suppliers by the end of 2012.  Our team carefully reviews the  results of each audit conducted,  and, where noncompliance  exists, requires remediation. In 2011, we also revised our audit  tool to provide more in-depth data  gathering on business integrity  and anticorruption matters. We will continue our efforts in  this important area and continue  to evaluate the best way forward  that is consistent with our values,  our codes and our commitment  to continuous improvement. Broadening our reach,  elevating the industry We continue to be leaders in AIM- PROGRESS, a forum of consumer  packaged goods companies  assembled to enable and promote  responsible sourcing practices. Through collaboration, on a pre- competitive basis, PROGRESS  members are able to promote  responsible sourcing throughout the  consumer packaged goods supply  chain by sharing best practices,  leveraging training and awareness  opportunities, and participating in  a mutual recognition program.  PROGRESS has a mutual recognition  program that allows members  and their suppliers to leverage  the data collected in audits  conducted by other members.  Through collaboration and mutual  recognition, we increase the  capacity of each participating  members responsible sourcing  program and facilitate commitment  and buy-in from suppliers.  Responsible   sourcing training In 2011, AIM-PROGRESS held  responsible sourcing supplier  awareness and training events that  were attended by approximately  1,700 people from AIM-PROGRESS  member companies and their  suppliers from around the globe. Four in-person sessions were held  in Johannesburg, Beijing, Mexico  City, and Nairobi, Kenya. Three  webinars were held in Europe and  North America. General Mills  hosted the North American webinar  that was attended by more than  300 people from General Mills, its  suppliers and partners, and other  AIM-PROGRESS member companies  and their suppliers and partners. Protecting human rights through our  responsible sourcing program is a critical  part of our Nourishing Lives mission.  General Mills Global responsibility   58 Replacing BPA in food packaging Minimizing waste while protecting food safety Most canned food and drink products  on the market today use BPA in the  can lining or can lid to protect food  from spoiling and prevent metal  food packaging from corroding. Scientific and governmental bodies  worldwide have studied BPA and  have concluded that the weight of  evidence supports its safety.  Despite broad scientific and regulatory  consensus on the safety of BPA, we  know that some consumers would  prefer to see alternatives – particularly  in products intended for small children.  General Mills and companies across the  food industry are working with suppliers  and manufacturers to develop and  test can linings that do not use BPA.  Technical challenges remain, but  progress is being made. For example,  General Mills identified a safe, viable  alternative for our Muir Glen tomatoes  in the United States, and with the fall  2011 tomato harvest, we successfully  transitioned Muir Glen tomato products  to cans that do not use BPA.  The liner we now use has been used in  food products for over 20 years. The  majority of the tomatoes processed  on the U.S. West Coast use this type  of liner and have done so for many  years. Transition has come at a cost,  however, and when viable alternatives  are identified for other applications, we  expect those alternatives to increase  the cost of products. Future transitions,  when possible, will also take time. That said, research continues, and we  remain optimistic that alternative linings  will be identified for other products  in time. As viable alternatives prove  safe and effective for other products,  we expect can suppliers and the food  industry – in response to consumer  interest – to convert to alternatives  that do not incorporate BPA.  Packaging also plays a key role in the  critical issue of reducing food waste.  The Food and Agriculture Organization  of the United Nations (FAO)  estimates that, globally, one-third  of food is wasted every year.  Packaging can help. To cite one example,  according to the U.S. Department  of Agriculture, packaged foods and  vegetables have more than 50 percent less  waste than fresh fruits and vegetables. But packaging also contributes to  landfill waste. Clearly, the challenge  is to maximize the effectiveness of  packaging in reducing food waste, while  minimizing the impact of packaging on  raw material usage and the waste stream. General Mills has long been committed  to environmentally thoughtful package  design and sourcing. We actually began  incorporating recycled content in our  paperboard packaging in the 1930s,  and today, General Mills is one of the  largest users of post-consumer recycled  paper packaging in the United States.  Approximately half of the packaging by  weight that we use in the U.S. is recycled  content, and we continually look for ways  to increase our use of recycled materials.  In 2011, General Mills announced a   new packaging metric to guide and   drive our efforts in this important area.   As part of General Mills broader  commitment to sustainability, we set   a goal of ensuring by 2015 that at least  40 percent of our global product volume  will be sold in packaging that has been  improved since 2010 through changes to  packaging weight, recycled or renewable  content, or truckload efficiencies.  See page 51 to learn more about  the gains weve made in reducing  our packaging footprint. BPA (bisphenol A) has been used for decades to help maintain the safety of many food products.  Packaging plays a critical role in protecting and ensuring the safety of food, as well as  communicating vital nutritional and ingredient information to consumers.   General Mills Global responsibility   59 Supporting global food security The worlds population surpassed 7 billion  in October 2011 – and it is growing. The  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  projects that the global population will swell  to nearly 9 billion by 2040, and the number  of middle class consumers – forecast to  increase by 3 billion by that date – will  increase demand for food exponentially. The world will need at least 50 percent   more food, 45 percent more energy   and 30 percent more water to  meet this growing need.  That is why fighting global hunger – and  sustainably growing and responsibly  managing the global food supply – is  such a priority for General Mills.  We live in a world already stressed by  hunger and volatile food prices. Some  countries saw food riots in 2010; tens of  thousands protested food price increases  in 2011. Food prices and shortages are  even cited, in part, for adding fuel to the  revolutions that toppled governments. The need is clear. We must increase global  food production by 50 to 70 percent,  and we must do so safely – sustaining  our planets land, water and natural  resources for future generations.  Though we have long held that  biotechnology holds promise to alleviate  chronic hunger and prevent disease,  and to enhance sustainability, nutrition  and taste, we believe the success  of this technology will continue to  depend on its ability to achieve broad  consumer acceptance and support.  Ingredients improved through  biotechnology have been used for  15 years. The U.N. World Health  Organization, the FAO, the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration, the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency,  and Health Canada have all found  approved biotech crops are as safe  and acceptable as their conventional  counterparts. Yet, some consumers  remain opposed to biotechnology for  ethical, religious or cultural reasons.  As a consumer-focused company, General  Mills tries to deliver what consumers want  and need. For that reason, products we  produce for Europe do not use genetically  modified ingredients, and we offer our  U.S. consumers leading brands of organic  products as a non-GMO choice.  Within our own businesses, General Mills  is also working to increase yields and  sustainably reduce water use. Through  conventional plant breeding and seed  development, as well as enhanced  production practices, our Green Giant  vegetable business, for example, now  produces twice the sweet corn on the  same amount of land as 35 years ago. Our  strong embrace of sustainable agriculture  practices and production improvements  also enables Green Giant to use less water  and 80 percent fewer pounds of pesticides. General Mills has a positive story to tell as  a company. But clearly more must be done  to address the issue of global food security. Global governments and food producers  must innovate and collaborate to increase  yields on currently producing lands.  We must aid and empower farmers to  steward arable lands and produce in less  productive soils. And we must do all of  this using less water and less expensive  inputs to conserve important resources.  We would urge greater focus on research,  especially on drought and disease  resistance among global crops that are   and will be critical to world food supplies in  decades to come. At the same time, we will  restate our opposition to the use of global  food crops in the production of alternative  fuels, such as ethanol. While we support  the development of alternative, sustainable  sources of energy, we oppose the use of  major food crops as a principal feedstock.  General Mills understands the critical  role of food in the world. No issue  will be more important than the need  to ensure food security for a hungry  world. The time is now. In global  terms, 2040 is only seconds away. Ensuring food security is a critical global need. r Our sustainability plot in Le Sueur, Minn., illustrates how our  conventional plant breeding program has doubled sweet corn  yields. It now requires just half the acreage (far right) to grow the  same amount of corn as it used to take (left) 35 years ago.  General Mills Global responsibility   60 Climate change  We see a clear role for responsible  companies around the world. We  believe every responsible corporate  citizen can and should help mitigate  the risk of climate change by reducing  greenhouse gas emissions. General Mills is addressing this issue  in a number of ways. We reduce our  greenhouse gas emissions through  improved energy efficiency and the use of  diverse energy sources, of course. But we  also consider the environmental aspects of  packaging design and raw material inputs.  Specifically, General Mills is working   to achieve our stated goal of reducing   our greenhouse gas emission rate   by 20 percent by 2015. As of fiscal   2011, we had already cut our greenhouse  gas emission rate by 8 percent   from the baseline of 2005.  Most of our greenhouse gas emissions  come from our manufacturing plants and  from the transportation of ingredients  and finished products. Virtually all of  the greenhouse gases produced in  our manufacturing and distribution  systems are the result of burning  fossil fuels to generate energy.  Our focus on reducing energy  consumption is therefore a  complementary goal to reducing  greenhouse gas emissions. Our  sustainability goal in this area is to reduce  our energy usage rate by 20 percent  by 2015. By fiscal 2011, we successfully  reduced our energy usage rate 6 percent  from our 2005 baseline. In absolute terms,  our manufacturing plants consumed more  than 100 million fewer kilowatt hours in  2011 than in 2005, using the equivalent of  539.3 kilowatt hours of energy per metric  ton of production – nearly one-third of the  way toward our 20 percent reduction goal. Clearly, the challenge of climate  change – and the global need to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions –  will be a focus area of innovation for  responsible companies going forward.  Its already a focus of innovation and  experimentation for General Mills.  For example, General Mills has been  a pioneer in the use of alternative and  renewable energy sources. In Fridley, Minn.,  a biomass unit now burns discarded oat  hulls removed in the milling process to  produce about 90 percent of the steam  needed to heat the plant and make the oat  flour used in Cheerios and other products.  Burning oat hulls has already reduced the  plants carbon footprint by 21 percent,  saving about US$390,000 per year,  mostly from reduced natural gas costs. And were striving to develop solar  and wind power. For example, General  Mills plant in San Adrian, Spain, is  already sourcing 100 percent of its  electricity from renewable sources. In our North American transportation  system, General Mills has set a goal of  reducing the amount of fuel used to ship  each pound of product by 35 percent   by fiscal 2015, from a fiscal 2009  baseline. Achieving this goal would  reduce the greenhouse gas emissions  associated with transporting products by  a corresponding 35 percent. We reduced  fuel use by 15 percent in fiscal 2011, using  this same metric over a 2009 baseline,  largely by becoming more efficient  with transportation planning, shipment  configurations and delivery methods. We recognize that a significant portion  of the environmental footprint of our  products occurs upstream of our  supply chain – primarily in agriculture.  We believe we can also impact those  inputs by sourcing responsibly.  For example, in November 2011, we  began piloting a supplier scorecard that  includes data on energy use, greenhouse  gas emissions, water use and solid  waste generation associated with the  ingredients or packaging materials used  to make and package our products. General Mills has partnered with a  number of academic and industry bodies  to support and advance sustainable  agriculture practices throughout the  food chain. We are a member of the  Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI),  which recently collaborated with the  International Dairy Federation to develop  a common global carbon footprint  approach for dairy. We are also a  leading member of Field to Market and  the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy. Deforestation and forest degradation  are also a source of greenhouse gas  emissions. Deforestation can be the result  of land clearing for agriculture, or tree and  timber harvesting for paper and packaging.  Trees capture carbon dioxide as part  of their natural life cycle. Deforestation  Climate change is a serious issue. The potential effects transcend national boundaries –   with broad implications for agriculture and the worlds food supply. We believe every responsible corporate citizen  can and should help mitigate the risk of climate  change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The General Mills plant in  San Adrian, Spain, sources  100 percent of its electricity  from renewable sources.  General Mills Global responsibility   61 not only removes carbon sinks, but  also releases carbon dioxide – along  with methane – into the atmosphere. General Mills has specific policies in place  to help reduce or stop deforestation. For  example, to help ensure that our palm oil  purchases are not in any way associated  with deforestation of rainforests, and to  reinforce the development of certified  sustainable palm oil production practices,  we are committed to striving to source  100 percent of our palm oil from  responsible and sustainable sources by  2015. This is just one element of our  commitment to responsible sourcing  of palm oil outlined in detail in our  Statement on Sustainable Palm Oil. Our commitment to sustainable sourcing  also extends to beef. We will either be  assured that our beef suppliers are not  linked to deforestation of rainforests, or we  will change our sources of beef supply. We also focus on the reduction of  packaging – along with recyclable  and renewable content – through our  Packaging Sustainability Metric. Less  packaging means fewer greenhouse  gas emissions from extracting and  processing raw materials like virgin  wood and aluminum. Today, General  Mills is one of the largest users of post- consumer recycled packaging in the  United States, and we continue to work  to improve our performance in this area.  Our goal is that by 2015, 40 percent of  our global product volume will be sold  in packaging that has been improved  over the last six years through changes  in packaging weight, recycled content,  renewable content, or configuration  for greater truckload efficiencies. Responsible corporate citizens around the  world are working to minimize the impact  of their operations on global warming.  Like other concerned companies, General  Mills is working to manage and reduce  its greenhouse gas emissions both within  and beyond our supply chain. Youll find  more about what we are doing to reduce  our carbon footprint in our responses  to the Carbon Disclosure Project.

Goals and performance. At General  Mills, we know that year in and year out,  engaged and empowered employees  drive shareholder value and business  performance. Our senior leaders  work to inspire and communicate the  companys culture and commitment to  employees through their actions. We  respect, develop and invest in people.  General Mills is a mission-driven  company, and our mission is Nourishing  Lives. We accomplish our mission by  living our values: Do the right thing,  all the time; innovate in every aspect  of our business; build great brands;  respect, develop and invest in our people;  and strive for consistently superior  performance. Languages and cultures  may vary, but our values dont.  General Mills devotes significant attention  to shaping the culture as performance- driven, where people work hard to achieve  goals and are excited by the challenges of  their jobs. At the same time, we strive to  provide a workplace that is supportive and  does not require employees to lose sight  of family and community commitments. Additionally, we are signatories to  the United Nations Global Compact  (UNGC) and are guided by the  International Labour Organizations  (ILO) 1998 Declaration on Fundamental  Principles and Rights at Work. Employment. The best companies win  talented, committed employees who  grow and develop to achieve their highest  potential, making significant contributions  to the business. This is especially true  – and important – at General Mills,  because we hire people for a career, not  for a specific job. General Mills conducts  an annual Climate Survey of all our U.S.  employees – both salaried and production  employees – so they can provide  confidential feedback about what General  Mills is doing well and what it needs to  improve. Nearly 90 percent of employees  participated in our 2010 Climate Survey.  The results were the strongest yet,  with an 80 percent favorable response  overall, up 3 percent from 2008 and  nearly 10 percent over the past decade.  Additionally, we field a comprehensive  Global Climate Survey every other year.  General Mills is committed to  providing both our union and non- union production workers with the  wages and benefits that recognize their  invaluable contributions to our companys  success and the economic well-being  necessary for raising their families.  Labor-management relations. General  Mills takes its responsibility to our  production workers and their communities  seriously. In the U.S., for example, it is not  uncommon for a General Mills plant to be  one of its communitys economic pillars,  such as our Hannibal, Mo., operation,  which is the largest employer in the area.  We offer competitive pay, retirement  programs, employee assistance programs,  education assistance and encouragement  to give back to our communities. In  addition, we help our employees invest in  their futures with wealth-building benefits.  Occupational health and safety. Our  ultimate workplace health and safety  goal is zero injuries and illnesses. General  Mills has set interim improvement  targets which are the basis for our plant  safety metrics. Historically, the company  has had one of the best records of our  peer food group manufacturers. General Mills has a corporate policy for  workplace health and safety. This policy  directs all operations to implement  management systems, programs and  procedures that will lead the company to  our goal of zero injuries and illnesses. Workplace health and safety is the  responsibility of line management and  each individual employee. All employees  are expected to work safely by following  all rules, procedures and training. Employees are trained in all applicable  health and safety subjects relevant to  their jobs. This is done to ensure that all  employees know how to perform their  jobs correctly and to comply with all local,  regional and country requirements. General Mills has an active auditing  program to monitor our operations to  ensure compliance with all internal and  external expectations. Any deficiencies  identified are tracked until completion. Training and education. We are single- minded when it comes to development  – we plan for it, we invest in it, we  track it and evaluate it. It is essential to  develop production employees, salaried  employees, managers and executives  alike. Were dedicated to always having  a depth of leadership trained and ready  to step up and take new responsibilities  if and when theyre needed. Eighty  percent of our managers come from  within the company. General Mills  consistently receives external recognition  for our performance in this area.  At General Mills, development takes many  forms.
