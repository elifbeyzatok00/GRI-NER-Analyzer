Home and workplace –   - Exit door or window and not locked or   - Safe meeting place to account for every one.    - Exit door or window and not locked or blocked.   - Safe meeting place to account for every one.   - Clearance from combustibles (3 feet from heat)  2. Personnel Safety – Building Alarm and Evacuation procedure  3. Common Type of Fire Extinguishers - How to use them effectively and safely                                                                    - what type of fire?   b. Fire Prevention –   - Smoking and non-smoking areas should be clearly determined in          work areas. The smoking sign should be put up and written clearly.  - Investigate any smell of fire, especially when there is smoke of gas.  - It is better not to use flammable liquid as cleaning liquid.  - Every fire, no matter how small, should be considered as a source fire.  - All fuel tanks should be placed away from source of heat.  - Anti-explosion cover should always be closely fixed in place.  - During the work of filling or transferring liquid fuel, all pipes should be prevented from           leaking.  c. Extinguishing of Fire    - Make preparation considered necessary in order to increase results of drill.    - Drill in the method of using and maintaining fire equipment should be done often.    - All fire equipment should always be checked and ascertain that they are in good        condition and ready for use.    - It is not permitted to experience with fire equipment, except when it is necessary for       use.    - The way to fire equipment should not be obstructed by other equipment or items.    - Fire equipment storage place should be clearly marked an easy to see and access.  d. Fire Control  Fire is a danger caused by uncontrollable fire which may result in loss of time, property,  capital goods and lives. The fire itself happens as the result of three factors which are  Oxygen, Fuel and Heat. In case of fire, the method to control it is by extinguishing the flame  by separating one of the elements mentioned above and fire is automatically extinguished.  An example: a great fire occurs at a leaking oil pipe and if we can find the valve, then by  shutting it the flame will go out, so that fire is prevented. Similarly, if this occurs as a result  of electricity, the flame will go out as soon as the source of electricity is disconnected.  Besides, the flame may also be extinguished by cutting the supply of air for example, by  covering with wet gunny sack, fireproof blanket, etc. Also dry chemical light extinguisher  will be separated the air and fuel.                                                                8 of 11    For normal fire which is not caused by oil or electricity, the flame may be extinguished by  spraying water on burned items to reduce the heat to below burning point.  8. Safety Procedure of Radiation             The responsibility for implementation of the following general procedures rests with  the relevant The Management Team, Managers and Supervisors. Each workplace is  responsible for preparing and enforcing their own procedures and for informing, instructing,  training and supervising staff and workers whose activities are affected by this policy. To  assist the Management maintains radiation safety within their workplace has nominated  Radiation Safety Officers and Local Laser Safety officers.          Staff and workers are required to comply with the workplace procedures and to report  any accidents or incidents and also any safety, health or security concerns. Each individual is  responsible for taking reasonably practicable steps to ensure their own safety and personal  security when working with radiation.             It is a requirement of HSE that employees be given a safe and healthy workplace that is  reasonably free of occupational hazards. However, it is unrealistic to expect accidents not to  happen. Therefore, employers are required to provide medical and first aid personnel and  supplies commensurate with the hazards of the workplace. The details of a workplace  medical and first aid program are dependent on the circumstances of each workplace and  employer.    Responsibility and Procedure  a. Prepare working rules for the safe use and operation of radiation.  b. Ensure that the Regulator is fully informed of radiation usage at the workplace.  c. Ensure that appropriate safety devices, equipment, radiation monitoring and surveying       devices are available regularly tested and in good order.  d. Provide medical examination of radiation workers where necessary.  e. Maintain all records required by the Act and Regulations to be kept by the Registrant.  f. If any person is unnecessarily exposed to radiation, evaluate the radiation dose received by      that person.  g. Notify the Registrant of radiation doses which exceeds the limits or any abnormal or      unplanned radiation exposure.  h. Ensure relevant radiation users have the appropriate licenses or are under the supervision       of a licensed user.  i. All personnel working with radiation must have received appropriate training in relation to        the hazard. Unauthorized use of radiation is not permitted within the workplace.  j. Risk assessment of the radiation work to be carried out is required.    9. General Aviation Safety              General aviation includes all noncommercial flights, such as emergency medical  services, sightseeing, flight training, traffic reporting, aerial surveys, search and rescue, crop  dusting and firefighting. General aviation aircraft range from small private airplanes and  business jets to helicopters, hot-air balloons and gliders.         Commercial airlines are the safest mode of transportation, but general aviation is a                                                                9 of 11    serious safety concern. Fatal crash risk per person-mile of travel for general aviation flights is  comparable to riding motorcycles.         Before booking a flight, a lot of people want to know if the airline they are going to fly  with is a safe one. However it's very difficult to say if an airline is 'safe' or 'unsafe' just by  looking at fatal accident statistics. Thus, a ranking of airlines by for example fatalities per  passenger kilometer flown does not say anything about the safety of the airlines listed. Apart  from the fact that there are, luckily, too few fatal accidents to serve as a basis for reliable  statistics, safety not always depends on the airline itself. Other factors could include the  environment an airline operates in (mountainous terrain or frequent storms) and factors like  airport security in cases of hijackings, bombing attempts etc.  On board the aircraft there are some things you have to remember for safety,    Pay attention to the flight crew safety demonstration/video     Carefully read the safety briefing card     Know where the nearest emergency exit is and know how to open it in case of  emergency (refer to the safety briefing card).     Always keep your seatbelt fastened when in your seat (Clear Air Turbulence can be  unexpected and can cause serious injuries)   C.
