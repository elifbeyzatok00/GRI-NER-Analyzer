The AntenA 3 Group ended 2010 with some extraordi- nary economic results. Two consecutive years of growth  in a negative economic cycle like the one we are currently  in gives credence to the strategic approach established  years before, when uncertainty and confusion set into the  communications sector.  Jos Manuel Lara letter from the president. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 3 letter from the president. antena 3 group index networks webs  The company remains extremely profitable; in fact we are  one of the european companies that have best withstood  the crisis, thanks to a policy of cost containment and  resource maximisation. From a stock market perspective,  we are maintaining our shareholder remuneration policy:  AntenA 3 has been the media communications Company  with the highest dividend (0.45 euros per share) and the  best performance (more than 6%).  We have been developing and cementing the ideas we  laid out in previous years and it is now that we are reaping  the benefits. This year has been decisive for the AntenA3  Group; not only have we confirmed that we are on the  right path, that initiatives like bundled advertising or the  wager on new DTT channels have been booming suc- cesses, but we can also firmly assert that we are now  the most competitive, the best structured and the most  efficient. We have confirmed not only the soundness of our business  model in 2010, but also our winning way of understanding  television. AntenA 3 is, according to the leading surveys,  the Spanish publics favourite channel. Such a loud and  clear message from audiences fills us with satisfaction and  motivates us to continue striving to be the best. neox and novA are completely settled. They have doubled  their audiences and the newest member of the family,  nitro, could not have gotten off to a better start: by hand- ily beating all the newest DTT channels. It is clear that  the wager on these channels was a great one, given that  we were able to see their enormous potential beforehand,  and, in fact, we have paved the way for those who have  decided to join the ranks much later. our Radio Division ended the year with outstanding  results. This is not the first time that both ondA Cero and  europA FM have exceeded their own global business fig- ures while notably increasing their audiences. The net  revenues (88.7 million euros) were 2.7% higher than last  years. A great figure that coincides with the twentieth  anniversary of ondA Cero, a radio station with a distinct  personality and a completely consolidated model. AntenA 3 MultiMediA is one of the main content providers  for all the latest generation distribution channels. We have  completely revamped our website antena3.com in 2010, a  move very much in line with our focus on multi-platform  communication.

Furthermore, we cannot forget the suc- cess of bundled advertising, which is allowing us to man- age advertising space much more efficiently, while giving  advertisers coverage they would have otherwise lost to  fragmentation. We have also experienced some important legislative  reforms thanks to greater sensitivity from the Administra- tion which should be recognized. Among the most sali- ent reforms, due to its positive effect on the audiovisual  industry, is the withdrawal of TVe from the advertising  market. The General law on Audiovisual Communications  was also approved, which has put some order in what was  a confusing regulatory framework. AntenA 3 also works to be the model of a responsible  and sustainable company. The approval of the first Master  Corporate Responsibility plan for 2010-2012 by the Board  of Directors has given solidity and coherence to our com- mitment to sustainability and has turned our group into a  reference in this area.  In line with the targets set out in the Corporate Respon- sibility Master plan, the corporate policies laying out the  fundamental principles guiding the AntenA 3 Groups  responsible conduct in terms of advertising, human  resources, social commitment, corporate responsibility  and environmental aspects were also approved this year. As a Communications Group, I believe we can and should  take advantage of our enormous capacity to reach the  public. of the multiple initiatives carried out, I would like  to highlight the AntenA 3 Groups collaboration in broad- casting the Millenieum objectives and, for the third year  in a row, the efforts made by the Ponle Freno Platform to  reduce car accident fatalities. The AntenA 3 FoundAtion is an efficient instrument in  channelling the Companys commitment to society. A  highlight of 2010 was the success of the first graduating  class of the PRO Project, the school designed to integrate  people with disabilities into the audiovisual labour force.  This was in addition to other already consolidated initia- tives like hospital assistance, broadcasting of values, pro- moting volunteerism and projects that seek to generate  knowledge through theoretical reflection. [  The approval of the Corporate  Responsibility Master Plan has given solidity  and coherence to our commitment to  sustainability.  ] our commitment is and will remain the same: we striving  to build a Major Communications Group that is attentive to  new technologies, sensitive in its content and responsible  in its relationship with society. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 5 letter from the president. antena 3 group index networks webs  2010 was better than 2009, but it has once again  demanded the utmost of our Company. For yet  another we have been forced to develop our busi- ness by overcoming the difficulties posed by the  financial crisis and to be up to par in a business,  audiovisual communication, that is increasingly  more competitive and constantly changing. In the  face of these uncertainties, knowing how to make  the most of opportunities and getting the strategies  right have been vital to producing results above  forecasts and market expectations. The Groups net profit increased 80% with respect  to 2009, to 109.1 million euros. net revenue grew  14.7% and reached 807.7 million euros, while  eBITDA doubled from 2009. These figures have  allowed us to be leaders in dividend yield in the  sector and have made us one of the best publicly  traded companies in shareholder remuneration. message from the ceo. our Television Division has once again been the  most, but not the only, responsible for these  extraordinary results. As a result of the efforts of  a team that has known how to improve itself in  a weak macroeconomic environment, innovate,  and take advantage of and multiply the effects of  two market factors (the withdrawal of advertising  on TVe and market growth), the TV Division has  raised its advertising revenue by 18.3%, doubled  its eBITDA (+109.9%) and increased its market  share by three points to 28%. There are few who  now doubt that open television continues to be  the massive communication media of choice, bar  none, and the most profitable and efficient adver- tising format. Silvio Gonzlez [  Open television continues  to be the massive  communication media of  choice, bar none, and the  most profitable and efficient  advertising format.  ] annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 6 message from the ceo. antena 3 group index networks webs  In 2010, AntenA 3 premiered Pone, an ambitious cam- paign which displayed our main networks most repre- sentative and recognizable values. With this initiative, we  have sent a message to both the market and society that  we can reach audience and profit targets without betray- ing the principles of a television model based on respon- sible entertainment and information aimed at the entire  family, and where not everything goes. From this basic  framework, which is very appreciated by our viewers –who  prefer us over the other commercial networks according to  the latest CIS or GeCA surveys– we construct our line-ups.  products like Hispania or Los Protegidos, in the national  fiction genre; Karlos Arguiano en tu cocina and La Ruleta  de la Suerte, in entertainment; and, of course, the news  program, Antena 3 Noticias, which for ten years has been  the uncontested leader among the private networks.  These are good examples of the television we want to do. Thanks to our family of channels, we are the company that  has best managed audience fragmentation. During the  year of the definitive analogue blackout, neox and novA  have doubled their audiences and nitro, the newest addi- tion to the family, has burst on the television scene with  great success. We wagered on DTT when nobody else did  and now we are reaping the rewards. premium content  broadcasts, debuted or acquired in 2010 like Glee, Museo  Coconut, Modern Family, The Pacific, or Boardwalk Empire  represent the constant renewal in our focus on the young- est channels. The AntenA 3 Group is the result of many efforts and those  undertaken by our Radio Division are undoubtedly praise- worthy: in 2010 it posted an eBITDA of 20.6 million euros.  Coinciding with its twentieth anniversary, ondA Cero is,  for the third year in a row, the station with the highest  increase in commercial radio audiences. While other sta- tions continue searching for their niche, ondA Ceros tra- jectory could be the defined as the stability of success. Atres AdvertisinG is the largest exclusive advertising  company in Spain with 15% of the advertising investment  volume. Following the success of the bundled advertising  launched last year, it has continued to grow more than the  market due to its capacity to give advertisers the advan- tages inherent in each type of media it manages. Its effi- ciency ratio has grown more than 15% versus 2009. [  Thanks to our family of channels, we are the  company that has best managed audience  fragmentation. ] [  Atres Advertising is  the largest exclusive  advertising company in  Spain with 15%.  ] annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 7 message from the ceo. antena 3 group index networks webs  The emergence of new screens, and especially the one  offered by Internet, is changing the way people watch tel- evision, but we, the big networks, continue to have the  most relevant content. This is why some of us understood  a while ago that we should stop being mere television  operators and transform into multi-platform content pro- viders. In line with this strategy, we have revamped our  website, antena3.com in order to continue responding in  the best way to the new challenges in multimedia com- munication. The results have been very positive: in 2010  380 million videos were streamed, which gives us a good  idea of the increasing importance of this type of media. Another 2010 milestone was reached by AntenA 3 FilMs,  which brought in more than half of national ticket sales  and had five of its productions in the top 5 in terms of  box office receipts and audiences. At any rate, this  accomplishment deserves special mention; although we  have never understood why the television networks were  required to invest in films, I would like to state that good  ideas that are managed well can be profitable. The AntenA 3 Groups activity is very much in line with our  Corporate Responsibility policy because the commitment  we have made in this arena is also part of our business  plan. The approval of the Master Corporate Responsibility  plan 2010-2012 shows our ability to effectively incorporate  sustainability in each of the Groups strategic areas. The  AntenA3 FoundAtion, for its part, continues to develop  new projects and to Ponle Freno, our massive road-safety  campaign, we have added in 2010 Vive Conectado and  Hazte Eco, campaigns that go beyond the screen and  radio waves in efforts to become citizens movements and  deepen the Companys bond with its society. Today, the AntenA 3 Group is solid company. In another  very complicated year, each of our Divisions has rein- forced its position and made the most of the conditions  in their respective markets. We closed 2010 convinced  that we are better and stronger, and with the satisfaction  of knowing that we can meet the responsibilities we have  to our shareholders. [  Coinciding with its  twentieth anniversary,  Onda Cero is, for the  third year in a row, the  station with the highest  increase in commercial  radio audiences.  ] [  We can reach audience and profit targets without betraying  the principles of a television model based on responsible  entertainment and information aimed at the entire family, and  where not everything goes.  ] annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 8 message from the ceo. antena 3 group index networks webs  corporateresponsibility.

The weak Spanish economy this year prevented the mar- ket from staging a recovery. The IBeX ended the year  at 9,859.1 points, a decline of 17.4% versus the end of  2009. The AntenA 3 share price declined less than the  market, 10.7%, ending the year at 6.95.  The other european bourses also outperformed the  Ibex 35: The French CAC 40 declined 3.32% (clos- annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 17 the antena 3 group. antena 3 group index networks webs  ing at 3,804.78 points). The German Dax increased its  value: 16.06% (to 6,914.19 points), while the london  FTSe increased 9.0% (5,899.94 points). The eurostoxx  50 index, which is comprised of the top 50 european  companies, declined 5.85%, ending 2010 at 2,792.82  points.  As far as the US market, the main indices posted gains  in 2009. The Dow Jones increased by 11.0%; the S&p  500 by 12.8%; and the nASDAQ registered the highest  gains at 19.2%. This last year was one of consolidation for some econo- mies, while others have remained mired in recession.  Countries like Germany and the United Kingdom have  continued to grow throughout the entire year (Germany  ended the year with GDp growth of 3.6%, the highest  in the last decade). however, other economies, like  the Spanish, Irish or Greek, have not yet shown signs  of recovery.  2010 was a tough year for the Spanish economy.  GDp did not give any signs of recovering: although it  did grow 0.2% in year over year terms in the last two  quarters of the year (in positive territory for the first  time since the third quarter of 2008), the national  Statistics Institute (Ine) confirmed that the Span- ish economy had shrunk by 0.1% during the year  (FUnCAS forecasts it to recover by 0.8% in 2011).  Unemployment was the worst it had been in the  last ten years with more than 4 million unemployed  workers, taking the unemployment rate up to close  to 20% of the active population (according to the  epA). For 2011, FUnCAS forecasts a similar figure. Furthermore, the national Deficit was close to 9.4%  of GDp at the end of 2010 versus 10% in 2009,  and came in higher than 2011 forecasts (6.6%).  Domestic consumption was also weak. households  spending increased 1.2% in 2010 and should return  to 0.9% in 2011 (also according to FUnCAS). 1.7 THE HIGHEST dIvIdENd Within this weak economic context, the AntenA 3 share  price only declined 10.7% in 2010. Market capitalisation  at the end of the year was 1,467.23 million euros. At 31  December 2010, the AntenA 3 share had gained 10.3%  since it started trading in october 2003. In 2010, AntenA 3 was the company that distributed the  highest dividend among the european  media ones (0,45  euros per share, 6% dividend yield). This profitability  places AntenA 3 as one of the quoted companies with  the best shareholders remuneration. All this within an advertising market recovery back- drop: although the entire media market declined 21%  in 2009 (with television down 23%), it recovered in  2010 and climbed 3.9% to reach 5,849.5 million  euros. Television advertising grew a bit more, hitting  2,472 million euros (4.0% growth versus 2009).

The Investor Relations department was very busy in 2010.  It participated in 10 different conferences in different  european cities, 130 one-on-one meetings with inves- tors, and organised 13 road shows, visiting more than  140 investors. At the AntenA 3 offices, more than 100 meetings have  been held, either one on ones or reverse road shows (a  group of investors visits AntenA 3 with a broker): 86 with  investors, 15 with sector analysts and seven with service  providers. The IR department has held more than 200 conference  calls with investors and analysts in order to discuss cur- rent news, markets and financial model revisions.    In total, more than 800 contacts have been made with the  financial community throughout the year. In addition, in order to facilitate quicker access to clearer  information, the website, www.grupoantena3.com has a  specific section where relevant events, financial results  and other news of interest are published.  But this service goes beyond that: investors may contact  management via e-mail, ir@antena3tv.es, while non-insti- tutional shareholders may send their queries to: oficinad- elaccionista@antena3tv.es.   1.10 QUALITY AS A STRATEGY In 2009, the AntenA 3 Group implemented a corporate  quality system, applicable to processes of programme  production and taping, and advertising and programming  broadcasts for all their television channels. The system allows us to systematically and homogenously  measure any incidents in the advertising and programme  taping and broadcast processes, as well as to obtain more  incident information and categorization, which allows us  to conduct continuous analysis of what causes the inci- dents, the origin, (equipment, software or other assets)  and the responsible parties (internal or providers). It also  allows us to define controls and mechanisms for the more  critical and higher risk incidents. The objective is to make  all the areas of AntenA 3 and all external partners partici- pants in the production, taping and broadcast processes  to participate in the Corporate Quality system with the aim  of reducing incidents throughout the product generation  process, from planning to broadcasting.  We are also elaborating indicators to measure the quality  of the processes which are subject to the systems appli- cations. We have established targets to this regard and  action plans to reach them. [  The Investor Relations department has held  more than 200 conference calls with investors  and analysts.  ] annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 19 the antena 3 group. antena 3 group index networks webs  A monitoring procedure for the entire quality system by  all the areas involved has also been established. All the  system monitoring functions, information analysis and tar- get setting have been assumed by the Quality Committee,  which is made up of people from the areas most directly  involved in the production and broadcast processes: Con- tent, Continuity and Broadcasts, Channel Marketing, pro- duction, operations, Advertising (Atres AdvertisinG) and  the Technical Division The design and development of the system, as well as  implementation, has been led by AntenA 3 television,  under the supervision and coordination of the Internal  Audit and process Control Division. Throughout 2010 we have continued to advance in the  development of the Corporate Quality System, implement- ing some improvements: 	 Service providers participating in the process have  been made participants of the Quality System. We  have incorporated them in the system through peri- odic analysis of the incidents considered to be in their  area of responsibility so they can analyse them and  establish action plans in order to improve service. If it  is deemed convenient in some cases, due to the seri- ousness or recurrence of the incidents, we will apply  the economic fines associated to the incidents. 	 new areas of Antena 3 have been incorporated into  the System in order to widen the scope to all the  areas involved.  	 Different action plans related to continuity, broad- casts, production planning, new characteristics of  DTT (16:9, subtitling and others), etc., have been  undertaken in order to analyse the causes of and to  undertake measures to reduce the number of inci- dents; and to continue committing to development  and new technologies projects using objective and  measurable quality parameters in the production and  broadcast processes of our channels. corporateresponsibility. 1.11 RESPONSIBLE PROvIdER  MANAGEMENT The AntenA 3 Group bases its relationships with providers  on constant dialogue, transparency and trust. In order to make them participants in its Corporate  Responsibility policy, in 2008, the company added a Cor- porate Responsibility (CR) clause to their contracts with  production companies and product and service provid- ers, which guarantees that the signatories respect equal  opportunities among their employees; do not discriminate  on the basis of age, sex, religion or the like; and that they  assure the security of their employees.   The clause also urges the successful bidder to undertake  actions to reduce their environmental impact and forces  production companies to consider including content  which supports the Groups CR philosophy in their pro- grams. Worthy of note is that in 2009, 100% of providers  accepted this clause. A new development is that, in line with the targets in the  2010-2012 Corporate Responsibility Master plan and as  per outsourcing process guidelines, all the service com- panies involved in the process have undertaken to respect  and implement the Groups corporate responsibility poli- cies. More information on the CR clause may be found on pages 24  and 26 of the Corporate Responsibility Report 08. The AntenA 3 Group distinguishes between two types of  providers: 	 production and distribution companies which supply  fiction and entertainment content. 	 other goods and services suppliers. [  In 2010, the providers  have signed new  agreements to respect  the Groups Corporate  Responsibility Policy.  ] annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 20 the antena 3 group. antena 3 group index networks webs  PROdUCTION ANd  dISTRIBUTION COMPANIES The production Division is in charge of managing eco- nomic and operating relationships with the production  companies charged with producing content for AntenA3  television.

During 2010, the AntenA 3 purchasing Department has  continued to work on the provider homogenization pro- cess and on designing a specific web page for these  stakeholders. Both projects, initiated in 2008, aim to  strengthen guarantees of neutrality and fairness in the  selection, comparison and awarding process, and in  fomenting dialogue and transparency with providers. We have also continued to require that all our bid winning  providers undertake the necessary activities in their pro- ductive processes to minimize the environmental impact,  boosting energy and commodity savings. All bid award  letters include mention of this productive process require- ment. To this same end, the company continues to opt for green  purchases, when economic and quality requirements  allow it. Among other things, the Group purchases equip- ment designed and manufactured following ecological  criteria, known as Green IT or Green technology, which  means it has been manufactured with recyclable or bio- degradable materials. 1.12 ANTENA 3 TELEvISION  REGULATORY COMPLIANCE  Television communication activities are subject to intense  regulation by public organisms. The approval of the Gen- eral law on Audiovisual Communication (lGCA) in 2010  created the Government Council on Audiovisual Media  (CeMA).  Article 48 of the lGCA establishes that the CeMA may  require providers of audiovisual communications ser- vices to provide the necessary information to confirm the  fulfilment of its obligations. The Ministry of Industry, Tour- ism and Trade, via the State Secretary of Telecommunica- tions and the Information Society (SeTSI), maintains its  competencies and functions in this regard, among which  it supervises, via periodic information requirements, the  fulfilment of some of AntenA 3 televisions obligations as  a TV services provider. Among these requirements are  meeting broadcast quotas for european works, as per arti- cle 5 of the lGCA and the Regulation approved by Royal  Decree 1652/12004 of 9 July, regarding investment for  the pre financing of short and full length films for euro- pean and Spanish television.

Because of  this, with the aim of debating and positively influencing  the development of public policies which impact the sec- tor, the Group participates in various forums and associa- tions defending sector interests.  To this effect, the work the AntenA 3 Group carried out  in 2010 to draw attention to the legal vacuum in the new  General Audiovisual Communications law concerning the  free broadcast of content with a charity, social, or public  service message, stands out. The company, acting within  its commitment to Social Responsibility, has always given  advertising space to nGos and non-profit organizations,  on both its television channels and radio stations, to give  them a platform and to help them with their awareness  campaigns. Since this law was approved, and especially in  the second quarter of 2010, the Group has been obliged  to reject these broadcasts as they are now considered  advertising messages. In order to rectify the situation, the  AntenA 3 Group is working on a modification of the law,  which aims to exclude these types of messages from the  advertising calculation and to once again give them their  own space on television and radio broadcasts. PARTICIPATION IN SECTOR FORUMS The AntenA 3 Group is a member of various audiovisual  sector associations from which it lobbies on behalf of sec- tor interests.  In the television sector, AntenA 3, along with the other  private national networks, is a member of the Union of  Associated Commercial Television networks, Unin de  Televisiones Comerciales Asociadas (UTeCA), from which  it works to support the development of laws and regu- lations relative to the audiovisual sector, the advertising  market and intellectual property. In order to help in the transition  from analogue to digital  television, AntenA 3 actively participated in the IMpUlSA  association, created in 2005 to promote Digital Terres- trial Television (DTT), along with the other national private  operators, TVe, la FoRTA and the network operator Rete- vision. Following the successful transition on 3 April 2010,  IMpUlSA has been dissolved. AntenA 3 television is also a member of the Telecommu- nications and Information Society Advisory Council, Con- sejo Asesor de Telecomunicaciones y para la Sociedad  de la Informacin (CATSI), and participates in the reports  written by its permanent Committee, which are mandatory  in regulatory procedures affecting the sector.   At the international level, AntenA 3 television is a mem- ber of the Association of Commercial Television in europe  (ACT), an association made up of the main private audio- visual groups in europe which seeks to defend their rights  before the competent eU organisms. Within this forum,  in 2010 AntenA 3 television participated in actions rela- tive to the revised application of regulations on public aid,  and in preparation of a future Directive on the collective  management of intellectual property, among other issues. [  In 2010 the Antena 3 Group  has actively worked to exclude  the transmission of message  with a charitable, social or  public service content from the  advertising calculation.  ] Alfredo Prez Rubalcaba, Vice President of the Government, at the uTECA  Annual Conference. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 24 the antena 3 group. antena 3 group index networks webs  In the advertising regulation realm, as a member of  Autocontrol, the AntenA 3 Group actively participates in  order to facilitate compliance with advertising regulations,  beyond legislation. To this effect, it is worth highlighting  the support that AntenA 3 television lends to the Cdigo  de Autorregulacin sobre Contenidos Televisivos e Infan- cia, (Code on the Self Regulation of Television Content and  Children), since its inception.  Finally, ondA Cero is a member of the Spanish Association  of Commercial Radio, Asociacin espaola de Radiodi- fusin Commercial (AeRC), of which it is a member of its  executive board, as well as the Catalan Radio Association,  Asociacin Catalana de Radio (ACR).

Since July 2010, AntenA 3 television has two multiplex medias, thanks to which it  has been able to incorporate a new channel, nitro.  Likewise, due to an AntenA 3 television initiative, a text conforming to a new Royal Decree that will be the future legal framework for High Definition (HD)  television is being worked on. General Audiovisual com- munications law (lGcA) On 1 May, the LGCA will come into force, the elaboration in which AntenA 3 television has been an active participant, and whose main benefit is to unify  existing regulations, bringing more legal security and making the legal regimen for television service providers more flexible.  support to spanish films In 2010, AntenA 3 television invested 30,646,207 euros into the production and acquisition of broadcast rights for Spanish and European works.  Within this context, the main news is that the LGCA has made the so called obligatory investment quota, which requires television operators to earmark  5% of their annual income to the pre-financing of full-length films and movies, more flexible, thereby allowing operators to fulfil this quota with television  production content. Television operators are against this quota, which only exists in the Spanish industry, because according to them, it is not an efficient  way to strengthen the Spanish film sector, given that its the activities of the television companies themselves that have created a robust audiovisual  industry. This quota is being challenged before the High Court, which has asked the Constitutional Courts to decide if it is constitutional or not. the financing of television  channels AntenA 3 television has been a supporter of the Law 8/2009 on Financing of the RTVE Corporation, which prohibits the public company from receiving  revenues from commercial communication broadcasts. The network believes that RTVE should obtain its credibility and strength from its function as a  public service, making television for its citizens and not for its advertisers. This is why AntenA 3 television is working both individually as well as from  uTECA, so that this initiative is extended to the regional public networks.  Likewise, AntenA 3 television is pursuing a rationalisation of public television spending which will lead to efficiency and savings, as well as the estab- lishment of the specific purpose of the public service functions which is suitable for public television and which differentiates them from purely com- mercial television. reforms of the collective  management of intellec- tual property rights The AntenA 3 Group actively seeks legislation reform on those regulations which require more transparency from the companies involved in the collective  management of intellectual property rights, in order to establish objective, equal, and adequate criteria in the application of prices these entities may  charge for the rights they manage.  To this effect, at the beginning of 2010, the National Competition Council manifested its opinion that there was a need to establish a regulatory frame- work in order to put an end to the constant abuses of management companies. This document is in addition to the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court in  2009 and to the Congressional Culture Commission, which has voiced its support for timely reform on Intellectual Property Laws. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 25 the antena 3 group. antena 3 group index networks webs  In December 2010, AntenA 3 launched the new positioning cam- paign through a great musical production presenting the new claim  of the channel Pone, (Antena 3, Turns you on), which defines  a way of making and understanding television. Pone means to  inject emotion into the viewer, to put on a line-up diverse in con- tent and quality, nothing monothematic, to put on television that  respects and is responsible to audiences, advertisers and its  brands, at which not everything goes. To take content where,  when and how viewers want it. And to inject into its activities  its commitment to society through projects like Ponle Freno  or Vive Conectado. The inherent AntenA 3 values are already recognised by  its public. In fact, two independent institutes, the GeCA  Image Index and the Barometer for the Centre for Soci- ological Studies (CIS), agree that AntenA 3 is the net- work with the best image and the most preferred among  Spaniards.

And all of this happened during the analogue blackout,  which brought with it new channels and increasing com- petition. As a consequence, all the generalist channels  (AntenA3, Telecinco, la1, la 2, Cuatro, laSexta and the  Regional channels) have experienced another decline in  their screen quotas, to the point that in 2010 they only had  70% of the screens, 8.3 points less than the year before. 2.1 THE FAMILY OF CHANNELS: A  YEAR OF HITS The family	of	channels ended the year with an average  audience share of 15.8%, and that figure rises to 16.9%  in the commercial target For its part, AntenA 3, with an 11.7% screen quota in  2010, is still the third choice among viewers and absolute  leader among younger audiences, registering an average  of 13.7% in the segment this year, half a point from Tel- ecinco and 3.7 points with respect to TVe-1.  2.2 NEOX ANd dOUBLE THEIR  AUdIENCE SHARE.

It is also broadcast in micro  spaces throughout all the AntenA 3 programming; neox,  novA, ondA Cero and europA FM.  lastly, neox, the AntenA 3 Group channel, has become  the mouthpiece of environmentalism with the launch of  Hazte Eco, the Corporate Social Responsibility campaign  (RCS) aimed at protecting and defending the environ- ment, in collaboration with Greenpeace. every two weeks  neox broadcasts news programs on environmental issues. 2.9 IN SYNC WITH vIEWER TASTES Aiming to learn and satisfy audience likes and dislikes,  key in guaranteeing the companys competitiveness, the  AntenA 3 Group is always conducting research on the dif- ferent formats and content it launches. To this end, the AntenA 3 tv Marketing department con- ducts qualitative research before, during and after a  shows premiere, which allows the department to define  new program projects and television line-ups. This  research seeks to discover the opinion of the audience, as  well as their assessment and suggestions; they therefore  sample across the spectrum of the population, including  different ages and social profiles, and they have an impact  on all content (series, programs, events...). AntenA 3 relies on specialised external agencies to carry  out this work, and these agencies contribute further with  their knowledge and experience. These opinion stud- ies allow AntenA 3 to become more familiar with viewer  tastes, preferences and requirements. Furthermore, in order to assess the content and the initia- tives carried out during the year, the company conducted  a Study	of	the	Antena	3	Image, while it carried out specific  annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 34 the most popular television. antena 3 group index networks webs  research to get to know the new public trends. To this effect, the  most ambitious has been the Televidente 2.0 study, a reference  report on audiovisual consumption in the digital space.  Meanwhile, there are other indicators which permit us to meas- ure our image and viewer satisfaction, like the previously men- tioned ndice de Imagen GeCA, GeCA Image Index which  puts AntenA 3 as the Spanish publics most esteemed chan- nel, with an average mark of 6.63. In other respects, in order to have extensive knowledge of  the daily audience figures, the AntenA 3 Group receives data  from Kantar Media, whose conclusions are analysed and  studied when designing the line-ups and programs. THE MOST HIGHLY RATEd CHANNEL Another barometer of its image and viewer satisfac- tion with the television network and its hosts is the  GeCA Image Report. In line with results from its most  recent study, AntenA 3 is, for the third year in a row, the  most highly rated network. It is perceived as the most  entertaining television station and has the most highly  assessed hosts, actors and actresses. Furthermore, its  national series are the second most highly rated and it  is considered the second most innovative network. As  far as news, AntenA 3 television is a leader among pri- vate channels in both news quality and news anchors  assessment. It is also the most highly rated in maga- zines, films and self-promotion, while it holds the sec- ond position in game shows.  According to this same study, Matas	Prats was, for  the sixth year in a row, the most highly rated host  on Spanish television (8.10) and with Karlos	Arguiano  (7.59) remains in the top 10. The 10 most highly rated  AntenA 3 personalities are split between fiction and pro- gram faces. In addition to the ones mentioned above we  have: Amparo	Bar (7.28), Jorge	Fernndez (7.09), Luis	 Merlo (6.96), Anabel	 Alonso (6.93), Hugo	 Silva (6.92),  Jaime	Cantizano (6.87), Susanna	Griso (6.74) and Gonzalo	 de	Castro (6.50). As far as programs, the GeCA index highlights El Peliculn  as the film show with the best overall rating. The Simpsons  received its lowest rating in five years, but remains highly  ranked, and El Diario improved its position from the previ- ous year. 2.10 CHILd PROTECTION Child protection is one of the key actions lines in the Antena 3  Groups Corporate Responsibility strategy. In addition to focus- ing the Foundations activity towards childrens causes,  the Group makes a concerted effort to offer programming  that is in line with the likes and needs of the youngest  viewers, strictly monitoring in the classification and broad- cast of content and communications during the childrens  hours, respecting current legislation in this regard.  CHILdRENS PROGRAMMING For the third consecutive year, and as evidence of the  companys wager on this audience segment, the AntenA3  family	of	channels broadcasts the most hours of  chil- drens programming in the Spanish audiovisual sector with  a total of 1689 hours (AntenA 3 television + neox). on another note, AntenA 3 Group adheres to the Cdigo  de Autorregulacin sobre Contenidos Televisivos e Infan- cia (Code of Self-regulation of Childrens Television Con- tent) since 2005 and is part of the Self-regulation Com- mittee and Mixed Monitoring Committee, the organisms  which are charged with ensuring its correct application.  annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 35 the most popular television. antena 3 group index networks webs  By virtue of this code and Royal Decree 410/2002, of 3 May, the  Group classifies the television programs it broadcasts in func- tion of the suitability of its content for children, adolescents and  adults.  Furthermore, the company strictly follows the requirements of  the new General law on Audiovisual Communications (ley Gen- eral de la Comunicacin Audiovisual) (lGCA) approved in 2010  which, among other things, has extended the child protection  regulations from the Television Without Borders law and the  Code of Self-regulation of Childrens Television Content to all  audiovisual communications services. As required by this law, the AntenA 3 Group undertakes digi- tal codification of its audiovisual contents in order to allow for  parental controls.

The Law also allows citizens to request the  competent authorities to act when audiovisual content is not in compliance with current ordinances or  the self-regulation codes. As far as advertising, the lGCA establishes that the  competent audiovisual authority will encourage the  televised audiovisual communications service pro- viders to uphold the codes of conduct in relation to  inappropriate commercial audiovisual communica- tion which is either broadcast alongside or included  in childrens programming. To this effect, AntenA 3 television already assumed  in 2009 the commitment to collaborate, along  with other television associations like FoRTA and  UTeCA, in the application of the Cdigo de Autor- regulacin de la publicidad de Alimentos dirigida a  menores (pAoS) Code on Self regulation in Food  and Beverage Advertising aimed at minors, signed  in 2005 and developed in collaboration with the  Ministry of health and the Federation on Food and  Beverage Industries (FIAB).

In addition, it  has a series of requirements for its elaboration and broad- cast, such as resolution and complaint mechanisms and  preceding, individual or collective self regulation instru- ments; or the communication of the code to the audio- visual authority and to the Consumer and User Council. MINORS ON ITS PREMISES  The AntenA 3 Groups internal security regulations pro- hibit, overall, the access of minors to its premises. Those  minors, who sometimes participate in a program or are  members of the audience, should be accompanied at all  times by production company personnel responsible for  the minors. In these cases, the presence of minors is lim- ited to the period between 10:00 and 20:00, and requires  the minors written parental or legal guardian authoriza- tion. When participation by a minor is specified in a series  or program, the AntenA 3 Group adopts the necessary  measures to coordinate compatibility between the minors  studies and work activities.

To this effect, neox is once again the private  channel with the most hours of closed caption- ing in its line-up, with a total of 3,619 hours  in 2010 (50% of total broadcast hours). For its  part, AntenA 3 television has broadcast 2,313  hours (32%), with novA broadcasting 1,264  (25%). It is worth highlighting that the AntenA 3 Group  has increased its television offer in the fourth  quarter of 2010 with the nitro channel, which  from its launch has closed captioned 31% of its  line-up. By examining these figures, the AntenA 3 Group  firmly complies with the General Audiovisual law,  which came into force 1 May 2010, and which  requires television networks to broadcast at least  25% of programming hours with closed captioning. Full length films capture the most hours of closed  captioning (36.7%), followed by series (23.5%)  and game shows (11.7%).

During 2010, AntenA 3 television has continued to  advance in live closed captioning. For the second year,  the Christmas message from His Majesty the King was  closed captioned live, as was the special program Cam- panadas 2011. Furthermore, the company has continued  with the free closed captioning of different advertising  spots. In December, the first descriptive audio program  for the blind was broadcast, on the Groups four channels.  Also in 2010 and on the four channels, the first news pro- gram in sign language for the deaf was broadcast.  lastly, it is worth highlighting that sales of closed caption- ing in 2010 has translated into 25,000 in savings, 9% of  total real closed captioning costs, which has not affected  compliance with the targets set out by the General Audio- visual law.  2.12 TELEvISION WITH SOCIAL  CONTENT  Conscious of the enormous influence that television has  on public opinion, and in line with our commitment to Cor- porate Responsibility, the AntenA 3 Group tries to broad- cast television content that responds to the societal ails  of its audience and that reflects the diverse realities of  society.   For this reason, AntenA 3 television, neox and novA all  include in their programming plural spaces with social  content, paying special attention to topics like child pro- tection, spousal abuse, education, immigration or the  environment, among others.  Some of these spaces are made up of programs like   A Fondo, Maneras de vivir and other documentaries. oth- ers are inserted transversally in daily programming and  live like Espejo Pblico, the magazine 3D or the news. A FONdO The program A Fondo broadcasts informative reports cen- tred on current events, which are mostly topics of social  interest. a FonDo toPicS in 2010 Con deudas y en la  calle The problem of many businessmen who put their houses  up as collateral in exchange for loans to pay off debt  and now expect to have their homes seized as they have  not been able to make the payments on those loans  because their clients have not paid them either.

Also, for the second year in a row, the Servicios Informa- tivos of AntenA 3 television have carried out their cam- paign against spousal abuse Ella cuenta conmigo, ella  cuenta contigo. Throughout ten consecutive years, the  three editions of Antena 3 Noticias and the program  Espejo Pblico have dedicated space on their program- ming to raise awareness of the need to combat this blight  on society. The problem was exposed from different  points of view: from the courts on domestic violence to  the influence the abuse has on the children of the victims. on another note, AntenA 3 television has made a splash  on different spaces in its programming for the multime- dia campaign Vive Conectado,  within the 3.0 strategy of  the Group, and aimed at Porque sin ti no es lo mismo,  fomenting the use of new technologies by all segments  of society. The Groups television network has also ceded  space to the Ponle Freno campaign, which encourages  safer driving.  Finally, it is worth highlighting neoxs wager on environ- mental content which it has reinforced since June 2010  with the launch of the campaign Hazte Eco, in collabora- tion with the nGo Greenpeace, and virtue by which it  broadcasts informative pieces that encourage viewers to  respect and support the protection of the environment.  annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 39 the most popular television. antena 3 group index networks webs  In 2010, ondA Cero celebrated its twentieth  anniversary in the best way possible: with  the best audience figures of the last several  years, and the consolidation of its second  place ranking in Spanish radio. This was a  year in which ondA Cero registered the great- est growth of any private radio station, with  66,000 new listeners, surpassing la Cope,  which had 800,000 listeners and holds third  place.  europA FM also had an excellent year in 2010,  with 282,000 new listeners. According to eGMs  December data, in the last quarter of the year,  the radio station added 173,000 new listeners.  This reinforced its position as one of the top four  music radio stations in Spain, with 1,455,000 lis- teners, 400,000 more than Kiss FM. 3.1 BEST FIGURES IN SIX YEARS The two main radio offerings of AntenA 3 Group (to  which can be added another ten stations that play ondA  MelodA), achieved excellent results. They improved their  global audience figures and were able to reinforce their  positioning in the Spanish radio world, with solid and  attractive content for listeners.  ondA Ceros audience data supports the if it isnt broken,  dont fix it philosophy. The stations programming closed  2010 with the best audience figures in the last six years,  and the best performance registered in eGMs third wave  in December of the last nine seasons.  every year, the radio station reinforces its teams and  selected content.

In the last season, for  example, the following commentators and talk show hosts  were added to the team: Joaqun	Leguina, Luis	Antonio	 de	Villena and Miguel	ngel	Rodrguez, for Herrera en la  Onda; and Javier	Sard, Luis	Racionero, Luca	Etxebarra	 and Rosa	Mara	Calaf, for Julia en la Onda. new stations such as es-Radio and the signing of major  personalities by the competition did not diminish the  stations influence or audience figures. ondA Cero has  remained faithful to its commitment to excellent news  programming and intelligent entertainment. our audience  increasingly identifies with the sound of our radio station,  from the moment they wake up in the morning, with Her- rera en la Onda, until they go to bed, with El primer toque.  This clearly identifiable style is also evident in Julia en la  Onda, La Brjula, Te doy mi palabra, Radioestadio, and  Gente Viajera, on weekends. ondA Cero, closed 2010 with 2,323,000 listeners, and is  for the third year running the commercial radio station  which registered the largest increase in audience num- bers. The 66,000 new listeners that were added this year  sets a notable milestone in the stations growth. The slo- gan you deserve this radio station has become a touch- stone for all the professionals who work at ondA Cero. ondA Ceros audience figures also imply an increase in  market share, which at December 2010 stood at 19.0%,  while in 2009 it stood at 18.3% and in 2008, it was under  16.0%. In barely two years, our generalist radio station  increased its market share by three points.  Another piece of data to bear in mind – and which has  been recurrent over the years – is ondA Ceros leader- ship position in profitability per listener. The station, led  by Javier Gonzlez Ferrari is the radio station with the best  profitability per listener figure in the market. 3.2 EUROPA FM, UNSTOPPABLE  Meanwhile, europA FM achieved fourth place in the rank- ings of music stations, increasing its lead over its nearest  competitor, Kiss FM. europA FM In 2010, it won 282,000  new listeners, on top of the 208,000 added in 2009.  With a total audience of 1,455,000 listeners, this is also  the music station which grew the most in eGMs third  wave of the year: 173,000 new listeners. This increase  was due in part to the contribution of the strong perfor- mance of the new morning show programme Levntate  y Crdenas. The debut of Javier	Crdenas in a morning  slot at europA FM was able to win 113,000 new listeners,  bringing the total for this slot to 594,000 listeners. The secret of europA FMs success has been its ability to  adapt to market demands and to the musical tastes of  the Spanish people. The music, aimed at a diverse audi- ence, is complemented by participatory interludes and  programmes that combine humor and information. 3.3 HERRERA EN LA ONdA,  UNdISPUTEd LEAdER  The increase in ondA Ceros audience figures is not due  to a single programme, but to gradual increases across all  the different programming areas. however, the most note- worthy jump in audience numbers in the last two seasons  was that registered by the Herrera en la Onda programme,  directed and presented by Carlos	Herrera.

The programme, directed  and presented by Julia	Otero, remains in second place,  but is closing the gap with the first-placed programme,  and has a lead of over 200,000 listeners on the third  place contender.

LA BRJULA HAS ANOTHER  SUCCESSFUL YEAR In terms of news programmes, we would highlight their  contribution to the overall growth of the station. La Brjula,  with Carlos	 Alsina, and Noticias Medioda, with Elena	 Gijn, are the best examples of this positive trend. La  Brjula added 68,0000 new listeners between December  2009 and December 2010, obtaining the quite respect- able figure of 511,000 listeners, while Noticias Medioda  reinforced its position as the second ranked news pro- gramme in its time slot. It added 50,000 new listeners  and has a total audience of 266,000 listeners, its best  all-time figure.  If we add up all the listeners of the different news pro- grammes, we reach the conclusion that over one million  people stay informed through ondA Cero. They also keep  on top of the news through the weekend news shows,  directed by Juan	Diego	Guerrero.

The reshuffling of the professionals bore fruit, and had  positive effects on ondA Ceros top sports programmes. Al  Primer Toque, with ngel	Rodrguez, won the last estudio  General de Medios of 2010, with 93,000 listeners, bring- ing its total number of listeners to 350,000.  Something similar happened with the two editions of   Radioestadio, the long format weekend sports programme  presented by Javier	Ares and Javier	Ruiz	Taboada. In 2010,  its Saturday edition had an audience of 583,000 people,  while in its Sunday edition, it added 31,000 listeners and  approached a total of 700,000 listeners, the best figure of  the last five years. Furthermore, the sports news profes- sionals on ondA Cero covered the big events of 2010 bet- ter than anyone else, especially the Football World Cup,  for which the programme sent an important team of spe- cial correspondents to South Africa. 3.7 ENTERTAINMENT TAKES CENTRE  STAGE ON THE WEEKENd  Weekends, with programming that is more focussed on  theme-oriented shows, remain a top priority. Isabel	Gemio,  with her magazine Te doy mi palabra, offers an interesting  venue exploring citizens concerns, showing a clear com- mitment to a more intimate format, full of feelings and  emotions. The microphones of this programme are open  to listener participation and the analysis of the concerns  and worries of the Spanish people. Gente Viajera celebrated its twentieth anniversary on the  air, doing what its director and host, Esther	Eiros does  best: travelling and telling stories in a warm manner that  is appealing to listeners.  3.8 UNIPREX Tv, NEW CHALLENGES  FOR NEW TELEvISION  uniprex tv is the subsidiary company of uniprex-ondA  Cero, which, under the ver-t brand, exploits local televi- sion licenses in different cities in Spain, and also manages  audio visual content for AntenA 3 Group operators and  other associated television stations and supports.  ver-t, without renouncing its standing as a leading low  cost production company, has set new objectives related  to content creation. In close collaboration with Atres  AdvertisinG, ver-t is focusing on the design and produc- tion of non-traditional advertising spaces, and also pro- duced programmes over the course of the year such as  Mam, t no mires: Gua de Estudiantes por el Mundo,  whose second phase was programmed on AntenA 3 and  neox, or La frmula de la Felicidad, a new programme. Under the framework of this direct and permanent col- laboration with other companies and business areas of  AntenA 3 Group, ver-t has continued with its turn-key  production of content specifically designed for multime- dia (online interviews and happenings) as well is in other  formats in the new Businesses area (Astroshow, El futuro  en tus manos, Mgustas...). Similarly, in 2010 uniprex tv has continued to produce  the weekly programme Ver Cine for extremadura Tele- visin (the extremadura autonomous regions television  station). In regard to the local DDT business in 2010, ver-t regu- lar broadcasts in Seville have been added to the up-and- running frequencies in Madrid and Valencia. on all these  channels, in-house production plays an important role,  as well as fiction and entertainment formats with a high  emphasis on family programming. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 44 onda cero: 20 years in tune. antena 3 group index networks webs  corporateresponsibility. 3.9 PUBLIC SERvICE  In 2010,  AntenA 3 Group put its radio programming at  the service of society, including in its commercial broad- casting, content that reinforced the companys com- mitment to corporate responsibility. over the course of  2010, both ondA Cero and europA FM supported three  major campaigns with social content, Ponle Freno, Vive  Conectado and Hazte Eco, spreading messages promot- ing road safety protecting the environment and educa- tional programmes on the advantages of technology.  Furthermore, it dedicated part of its programming to  social and environmental causes, both through con- tent and advertising. In 2010, the station aired, free- of-charge, 5,391 social welfare ads, whose value would  have totalled 4.5 million euros. TOGETHER WITH ANTENA 3 FOUNdATION The programming of ondA Cero supported the work of  the AntenA 3 FoundAtion, serving as additional support  to the different initiatives carried out by the foundation in  2010. In this regard, it broadcast information relating to:  the Road Safety Workshop, organised in Micrpolix; and  the inauguration of the Multisensorial Hall, for mentally  disabled children, which was also backed by the entity.  AntenA 3 Group radio stations also collaborated in publi- cising the AntenA 3 FoundAtion campaign La Magia est  en ti. other highlights include the creation of the University  for parents, the inauguration of which was attended by the  philosopher Jos	Antonio	Marina. ondA Cero also provided  support, through its content and advertising slots, the visit  of Doctor Larry	Rosen, promoted by AntenA3 FoundAtion  and the official Association of psychologists, with the aim  of providing an in-depth overview of the impact of new  technologies and their application to education.   Similarly, both ondA Cero and europA FM collaborated with  the FoundAtion on three major initiatives: the campaign  Un Nombre, Una Vida, jointly developed with Fundacin  Agua de Coco ; the Dialogue and Action Congress of the  Bertelsmann Foundation; and the report on study hab- its prepared by AntenA 3 FoundAtion together with the  Defensor del Menor de la Comunidad de Madrid. Furthermore, on numerous occasions they have commu- nicated the aims of the FoundAtion, of its TV channel for  hospitalised children and of the PRO project. OTHER MESSAGES The groups radio stations have also shown their sup- port for other initiatives, which fall outside the scope of  AntenA3 FoundAtion.

AntenA 3 Group  collaborated with this initiative in an exclusive and altruis- tic manner, carrying out the most ambitious campaign by  a media company in the history of Spain in favour of the  Millenium Development objectives.  We would also highlight the broadcasting of reporting on  haiti, as well as messages of solidarity following the dev- astating earthquake. The programme Te doy mi palabra,  directed by Isabel	Gemio, travelled to this country in May,  in order to provide a first-hand account of the situation.  The trip had a major impact on all of AntenA 3 Groups  media outlets. other social projects that have had an impact on ondA  Cero were: 	 The eTRASA initiative to modify vehicles so that they  can be used by disabled drivers, raising awareness  among companies about the importance of making a  commitment to these types of modifications.  	 The campaign of onGs to raise awareness about the  importance of checking the box in tax forms in order  to donate to social causes. 	 Furthermore, they have provided publicity for social  projects of different onGs, such as Asociacin Mas- natur, Fundacin Caballo Amigo and the Fundacin  Agua de Coco. lastly, ondA Ceros ongoing efforts to denounce gender  violence through its various shows and news programmes  should also be highlighted. In november, for the second  consecutive year ondA Cero took part in the campaign  prepared by the Servicios Informativos (news services) of  AntenA 3 televisin She counts on me, she counts on you  to raise awareness about the need to combat this social  problem. jAn Feb MAr Apr MAy jun jul AuG sep oct nov dec bROADCAST OVER ONDA CERO AND LOCAL bROADCASTERS  OF MILENIuM TARGETS, WITH INTERVIEWS AND REPORTS. bROADCAST  OF ANTENA 3  FOuNDATIONS  CHILDREN  ROAD SAFETY  WORKSHOPS bROADCAST OF  ETRASA PROJECT  ON ADAPTING  VEHICLES TO  MEET NEEDS OF  PEOPLE WITH  DISAbILITIES SuPPORT FOR  CONCERTS OF  CHILDRENS CHOIR  MALAGASY GOSPEL  ORGANIzED bY THE   COCONuT WATER  FOuNDATION INFORMATION ON  DIALOG AND ACTION  CONGRESS, AND  PubLICATION OF THE  REPORT ON SPANISH  STuDENTS STuDY  HAbITS SuPPORT FOR 5TH  INTERNATIONAL SHORT- STORY AWARDS, WRITTEN  bY PEOPLE WITH MENTAL  DISAbILITIES AND HELD bY  THE ANADE FOuNDATION ONDA CERO  AND LOCAL  bROADCASTERS  COLLAbORATE  WITH ANTENA 3  FOuNDATIONS LA  MAGIA EST EN TI  PROJECT RADIO  ANNOuNCEMENTS  AbOuT THE  IMPORTANCE OF   MARKING x ON  SOCIAL PROJECTS  bOx OF INCOME TAx  STATEMENT SuPOPRT FOR  CORPROATE  SOLIDARITY DAY bROADCAST OF  CHILDRENS RIGHTS  CAMPAIGN uN  NOMbRE, uNA VIDA. hiGhliGhts FroM sociAl welFAre-oriented proGrAMMinG broAdcAst in 2010: 2015: A better world  for Joana campaign  to raise awareness  of the Millenium  Development Goals. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 46 onda cero: 20 years in tune. antena 3 group index networks webs  last year, the 3.0 project was launched which was a cut- ting edge initiative whose success and soundness quickly  became apparent. In June 2010, when the 3.0 campaign  was barely one year old, AntenA 3 undertook a complete  revamping of its website, in order to implement a new  vision of its web presence entailing technological innova- tion, a multiplatform concept, new content and the inte- gration of social networks.   The new antena3.com has a completely overhauled image,  new functionalities and a practically limitless capacity for  growth. It represents a qualitative and quantitative leap  which has incorporated the latest technological innova- tions, especially those related to video and its viewing  through the state-of-the-art system Modo Saln with hD  and 3D capacity, formats which were tested in broadcasts  of the El Internado and Los Protegidos. The name Modo Saln clearly expresses the change in the  attitude of users who consume long format audiovisual  content at television-level quality. This corner of the web  was created specifically to allow for these advanced fea- tures, combined with easy-to-use navigation and retain- ing all the advantages of the catch-up modality via the  antena3.com: communication grows. [  antena3.com  ended the year with  over 8 million unique  users, and over 90  million page views  ] annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 47 antena3.com: communication grows. antena 3 group index networks webs  internet. That is to say, viewers can now see their favourite  content when and how they want to, before or after its  broadcast on television.  The socialisation of content and the creation of communi- ties of fans is another notable aspect of antena3.com. To  this end, Zona 3 was created, an area for registered users  where they can share and recommend their preferred  content on the main social networks. This bet on the internet in 2010 resulted in massive growth  in traffic and audience figures. Specifically, antena3.com,  following its strategic agreement with habbo (the largest  virtual community for youth in the world) ended the year  with over 8 million unique users and over 90 million page  views, vs. 3.5 million unique users and 61 million page  views in 2008. In terms of videos downloaded, one of  AntenA 3s strong points on the internet, in 2010 this figure  surpassed 380 million, a spectacular performance which  doubles the figure registered in 2009 (213% growth).  4.1 THE MULTIPLATFORM SPIRIT:  FULL STEAM AHEAd  antena3.com has taken the multiplatform concept to its  most evolved state, thanks to its excellent capacity to  adapt different content to cutting edge platforms. Inter- net users now have the opportunity to use any format,  whether created by a channel or of their own making,  through the windows offered by televisions connected to  the internet (latest generation Samsung, phillips, lG and  Sony), the video game consoles (play Station and Wii),  [  antena3.com has taken the  multiplatform model to new  heights, thanks to its notable  capacity to adapt content to  cutting-edge supports.  ] Ral Fernndez in a video-encounter.

To develop this multiplatform concept, AntenA 3 has cre- ated a web of alliances that includes, among other com- panies, Samsung, nokia, nintendo, Sony, Vodafone and  Microsoft. 4.2 FOCUS ON IN-HOUSE CONTENT:  vIdEO-ENCOUNTERS, BLOGS,  GAMES ANd PREMIERES antena3.com was a pioneer in using the internet as a distri- bution venue for its television content (complete episodes  of series and programmes, live broadcasts, etc.), but it  also has its own identity, and for that reason in 2010, it  has focused more on the creation and distribution of spe- cific content, with original formats and in-house produc- tion carried out with an internet mentality.  As a result, video-encounters have consolidated them- selves as a format in which actors, presenters, singers  and writers can communicate directly with internet users,  taking advantage of the most advanced tools from social  networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Windows live).  During 2010 over 100 of these video-encounters have  been held, in addition to retransmissions of events (pre- screenings of films, press conferences, etc.). on several  occasions the audience figures for this content format  reached over 35,000 users.  A very significant number of channels communicators  participate in the growing number of our different brands  blogs and videoblogs. These communicators are from the  entertainment world (Sandra	Davi, Mara	Patio, Miguel	 Temprano), as well as from the news (Jos	ngel	Abad,  Gonzalo	del	Prado, Manu	Snchez, etc.), and their appear- ances have been further reinforced by initiatives such as  Mnica	Carrillos Detrs de las Cmaras; and the collective  blog of our newscasters, Notas de Redaccin. The exclu- sive antena3.com blogs have been especially important in  recent months, with brands that have already started to  establish their own special place on the internet, such as  Karina Sacarina (society news), Sadofashionista (fashion)  and Parrilleros (television). programmes exclusively designed for being broadcast  on the internet have also been made, such as Lets FoQ  and El Pasadizo, in which fans of Fsica o Qumica and El  Internado and the main actors of the series talk about the  upcoming season and the important issues of the plots.  Furthermore, pre-screenings of the main series on the  internet a few days before their broadcast on television,  El barco. Specific content for being broadcast on the internet.

The response was spectacular, and even before the first  episode the following among internet users was massive.  This is a videogame designed to be played with an online,  multi-user strategy, where the user can participate in the  adventures of Hispania and create their own persona, his- pano or Romano, and build their own civilisation. This ini- tiative was a resounding success, and ended the year with  close to 150,000 registered users. 4.3 NEW CHANNELS, FILM,  GLAMOUR ANd vIdEOGAMES Another of antena3.coms growth areas is the production  and packaging of a new, theme-oriented family of chan- nels on the internet (vertical portals). This strategy was initiated with Celebrities, which was  launched at the same time as the new portal and which  is intended to be a meeting point between the news and  entertainment components of AntenA 3. This is a web- site that features famous personalities from all over the  world, with news, rankings, and exclusive content filled  with glamour, and characterised by its elegant treatment  of the most titillating society news.  This trend continued after the summer with seestrena.com,  a channel that is focused on the film world: latest news,  interviews, and coverage of the most important festivals in  the world, seestrena.com features all the trailers of the mov- ies being premiered, interviews with top movie stars and  personalities, and exclusive digital video-encounters. The last to arrive was deFCon plAy, a channel dedicated to  breaking news in the world of video games; and objetivo  tv, an online zone about the television market and televi- sion reviews.  Through these independent channels, antena3.com has  boosted its online presence with initiatives of Corpo- raste Social Responsibility, such as Ponle Freno, Vive  Conectado and Hazte Eco, as well as group companies,  like AntenA3 FilMs. 4.4 ANTENA 3 INTERNET SERIES  ALSO A HIT The online broadcast of fiction series holds a special place  in our in-house production exclusively for internet. We  would highlight projects such as Desalmados and Hare  and the broadcasting in the last quarter of the year of  Diarios de la Webcam. [  The video game based on the  Hispania series won over 150,000  registered users in 2010.  ] El juego de  Hispania, was  a resounding  success on the  internet.

The  series had an excellent reception in its first season on the  internet, which resulted in it being broadcast on Television  where it aired on neox. Furthermore, it featured cameos of  actors from the stations other series such as Luis	Fernn- dez (Los Protegidos) and Ernesto	Sevilla (Museo Coconut). 4.5 THE BIG YEAR OF SOCIAL  NETWORKS Another of the characteristics of the internet market in  2010 was the consolidation of social networks and their  every-day use by the entire range of internet users.  AntenA 3 has taken part in this trend, and on many occa- sions has spearheaded the use of social networks in tel- evision. While in 2009 Facebook and Windows live were  stalwart and superb allies of AntenA 3 in this area, this year  these alliances were further strengthened by the addition  of other social networks such as Tuenti and Twitter.  Furthermore, AntenA 3 webs were integrated with social  networks so that visitors who wished to comment on news,  interviews and reports have been able to do so as users  of Facebook and Messenger and export their actions to  AntenA 3 webs.  4.6 MOBILE TELEPHONY: BETTER  SERvICES ANd APPLICATIONS During 2010, the telephony area has centred its efforts  on increasing the range of applications and services for  smartphones and cutting-edge telephones. once the  website content is consolidated through the agree- ments that AntenA 3 has with the main Spanish operators  (Movistar, Vodafone and orange), the aim is to reach new  users: those that use their telephone terminal as extension  of their computer. To achieve this, the first step is to ensure the correct  adaption of the new antena3.com portal for all the mobile  terminals, as well as the first tablets that were rolled out  over the course of the year (mainly the ipad and Samsung   Galaxy). AntenA 3 has become the trailblazer in telephony for sev- eral reasons: it was the first company to launch nielsen  ratings on its mobile platforms; it has developed an appli- cation for the Samsung Bada handsets, programmed pre- screenings of series on mobiles, and launched advertising  on mobile handsets, as well as the AntenA 3 FilMs appli- cations for phones. As a result of all these initiatives, there is a total of 2.5  million accesses to antena3.com via mobile platforms, as  well as over 12 million videos served by connected TV  platforms. 4.7 ONdA CERO, GREATER  INTERACTIvITY ANd CLOSENESS TO  vIEWERS During 2010, the portal en internet de ondA Ceros inter- net portal has continued increasing the participation in  both the channels own programmes and of its users and  listeners. To this end, it has created new sections that  make advances in this regard, such as daily or weekly  surveys that are carried out in the main news and sports  programmes, or the incorporation of contests, such as the  programmes La Parroquia del Monaguillo, Radioestadio or  La Rosa de los vientos.  This project of linking the radio team to its webpage, has  crystallised through special news coverage on blogs of  events such as the earthquake in haiti and the situation in  Afghanistan. other special content should also be under- scored, such as the microsite dedicated to the 2010 World  Cup, and especially the microsite created to celebrate the  twentieth anniversary of ondA Cero which gave an over- view of all the channels seasons, presenting all the docu- ments, images and audio tracks that were the high points  of each year.  [  The success of the online series  Diario de la Webcams led to its  transmission on television.  ] [  In 2010, the number of  users of Onda Cero web  increased by over 40%.  ] annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 51 antena3.com: communication grows. antena 3 group index networks webs  At the same time, and in line with its philosophy of con- tinual improvement, it has rolled out a new live internet  radio player that allows for the optimisation of advertising  while improving the quality of the stations national signal.  The result of all this work was an increase in regis- tered users. While in 2009 the maximum monthly fig- ure reached 500,000 unique users, in 2010 this figure  reached 700,000, representing growth of 40%. In terms  of page visits, this growth was almost 30% after surpass- ing 11 million in november. Furthermore, according to  the nielson data audited by oJD, users were tuned in  to ondacero.es for an average number of minutes that  was greater than that of the rest of the radios and online  media. In December 2010, this average period surpassed  48 minutes.  In terms of the internet portal europA FM, the synergies  between the broadcaster and the webpage have increase.  This has allowed for greater diffusion and participation  in all the actions carried out by both outlets: from the  contests that are held every week on programmes and  websites, to major events that form part of the stations  programming.  In addition to the contests, the web allows europA FM con- tinuous contact with its listeners through its forums and  blogs, in addition to the continuous digital encounters  not only with the broadcasters stars, but also with lead- ing lights in the national and international music among  which we would highlight Miguel	Bos, Edurne, La	Unin,  Macaco, Dani	Martn, Juanes, Jason	Derlo, Ana	Torroja  and Merche. The audience of europafm.com also continued to climb: in  2010 this figure surpassed 500,000 unique users, rep- resenting a 42% increase on the best monthly figure the  previous year, while the number of page views hit an all- time record figure, with 10.5 million, 10% more than in  2009.  corporateresponsibility. 4.8 dIALOGUE WITH vIEWERS Supported by the possibilities offered new technologies,  in 2010 AntenA 3 Group was able to strengthen ties with  its audience. The company reinforced dialogue with televi- sion viewers and radio listeners through its online and tel- ephone-based communication channels, with the aim of  involving them in the Groups editorial policies, promoting  participation and strengthening the links between them  and the companys different communications media.  Among the initiatives that have strengthened the connec- tion with viewers in 2010, was the organisation of video- encounters with actors, presenters and other important  players in the current media scene. AntenA 3 was a pio- neer in this area in Spain and the only one to regularly  hold periodic digital encounters, four events a week, in  which the invited person not only receives questions from  web users via Facebook, but allowed users to follow the  events in real-time online.  Video-encounters have consolidated themselves as a format in which actors,  presenters, singers and writers can communicate directly with internet users. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 52 antena3.com: communication grows. antena 3 group index networks webs  It has also been a trailblazer in live transmission of the  premieres of series in movie theatres. This type of event  allows the spectator to learn more about the actors and  the internet user to access it from anywhere and see the  red carpet and photocall events. The audience for the  transmission of these pre-screenings have, on occasion,  surpassed 20,000 connected internet users.  Similarly, AntenA 3 Group has increased its interactivity  with the audience by airing the opinions expressed on  social networks in the actual content of its programmes.  AntenA 3 and ondA Cero transmit the public comments  live, and thereby transforms them into an integrated part  of the actual programme.  our television station set another milestone in 2010, by  having its own room in habbo, the largest virtual world for  adolescents on the planet, with 158 registered users, and  over 16 million unique users a month in the 31 countries  in which it is present.  Furthermore antena3.com underwent a complete over- haul, putting it on the cutting edge of TV channel web- sites in Spain, to offer a new way of viewing and making  television. MORE ACCESSIBLE With the launch of its new website in 2010, AntenA 3 has  made accessing and surfing the site much easier. Fur- thermore, it has already adapted to the specific protocol  for webpages established in the WCAG regulations 1.0-,  making content distribution more clear and simple, and  improving the web-based viewing experience.   In addition, the Groups web page has increased the  space it dedicates to Corporate Social Responsibility, with  the creation of two new subsections: Nuestro enfoque (our  approach) and Polticas (policies). The first encompasses  the companies businesses full-spectrum commitment to  corporate responsibility, while the second provides the  companys environmental, human resources and health  and labour safety policies, as well as detailing its commit- ment to responsible advertising, corporate responsibility  and social welfare. In regard to content, the new website has strengthened  AntenA 3 televisins leadership position in national fic- tion offerings via the internet, since all the series aired  by the channel can also be seen in their entirety in this  medium. This complementary and additional service has  enjoyed an excellent reception from the general public,  and enhanced its standing even more in the first quarter  of 2010, by offering audiences the opportunity to see pre- mium premieres of series episodes via a micropayment  system. In addition, all the content on the AntenA 3 televisin  website has applications through which web users can  enter their own comments. Furthermore, to ensure greater  professionalism and diligent monitoring, the company  contracted the services of an external company to regu- late and filter the comment flow, while deploying statis- tical tools to allow for improved optics in this business.  The selection of this external company was carried out in  Making of Antena 3 series. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 53 antena3.com: communication grows. antena 3 group index networks webs  line with the criteria of corporate responsibility, since the  professionals of the contracted company were disabled  people. The web page also allowed users to share videos and  photographs, a process for which AntenA 3 has sufficient  protection measures in place, to prevent the uploading  of illegal content or content which could have deleterious  effects on web users.  PROTAGONISTS ON SOCIAL NETWORKS AntenA 3s presence on the main online social networks is  clear evidence of its constant and fluid dialogue with audi- ences. Through these channels, audiences can submit  suggestions, complaints, opinions and also obtain informa- tion directly and instantaneously. AntenA 3 is the television  channel that has the largest number of followers on Face- book – over 250,000 followers of the channels official pro- file, in addition to the profiles of series and programmes,  which reaches 1.5 million followers total.  Furthermore, it is one of the channels that generates the  most activity on Twitter, with close to 20,000 follower at  present, and it also has a major presence on Tuenti through  its more youth-oriented series, such as Fsica o Qumica,  with 93,000 fans. AntenA 3 has been a pioneer in integrating social network  applications into its websites, in line with its position as the  leader in cutting-edge technology since it became the first  channel in Spain to launch its own youtube channel (the  second channel in europe to do so, after the BBC). All the channels writers have made a commitment to play  a dynamic and reciprocal relationship with viewers, fully  engaging in this information exchange. To this end, the  position of Community Manager was created in 2010, in  order to give this communication greater consistency and  continuity. TELEPHONE CHANNELS AntenA 3 Group provides a telephone service to users  so that they can access certain products and participate  in programmes and contests. This service is integrated  seamlessly into content, with no cuts or interruptions. The  most successful systems are SMS messages, multimedia  messages (SMS/MMS premium) or telephone numbers  with the prefix 905, 806 and 807. As a result of these short numbers, assigned by the Tel- ecommunications Market Commission (CMT) allows view- ers the opportunity to participate in its shows and contests  via their telephone (to vote, submit opinions, go on virtual  visits to sets), as well as to buy certain products ringtones,  games, etc), or to sign up for AntenA 3 subscription ser- vices, which the channel started offering in 2010. Telephones that have the prefixes 905, 806 and 807  activated allow viewers to participate in the channels  programmes. The services provided via telephones with  the 803 and 806 prefixes, which are associated with  programmes provided by third-parties are monitored on  a daily basis to ensure their proper functioning. To this  end, a daily report is prepared and sent to the providers  of these services so that they may correct any possible  anomalies that have been found.  In 2010 and through the Resolution of 2 July, Code of  Conduct for premium rate message service providers was  modified, in order to guarantee more transparency for  this type of service. We would underscore that AntenA3  televisin already applied several of the new measures  formalised in this agreement, such as providing more  detailed information on the sales price for subscription  services. Furthermore, since the company started providing this  type of service, it has provided more information to users  on all platforms, including a detailed account of the nature  and price of the service.

This leadership  position is due to its capacity to offer advertisers the  unique advantages of each one of the  AntenA 3 Group  supports as well as the rest of the media outlets that it  includes in its commercial offering.

In fact, this  was the driver for all the conventional media.  5.1 ANTENA 3 INNOvATES TO ACHIEvE  GREATER EFFICIENCY  AntenA 3 was able to close 2010 with strong market share,  turnover and price positioning. Its emphasis on coverage and  commercial efforts allowed it to grow at a far greater rate  than the market average. Another clear indicator of its robust  health was the improvement in its efficiency ratio, which grew  over 15% with respect to 2009.  Although there is no doubt that the reduction of advertis- ing space and the disappearance of certain formats due to  the new legal framework has helped strengthen television, a  steadfast dedication to the spirit of innovation was needed to  ensure that the channels advertising stood out and differen- tiated itself from competitors. once again, integrating adver- tising solutions into programming proved to be an efficient  formula. In this regard, Atres AdvertisinG has created new  ideas that go beyond explicit commercial communication,  such as branded content and product placement. In this  manner, the integration of advertising into the channels  actual content provide additional added value to advertis- ers, by linking their products or services with an idea, a  concept or actual content.  Atres AdvertisinG remained faithful to its diversification  strategy and its restless spirit, and is always open to new  opportunities. At the beginning of the year it started  commercialising the veo7 advertising space. In  addition it added nitro to the AntenA 3 family	of	 channels, which has improved its coverage results  and ratings, thanks to the full-spectrum advertising  coverage (pauta unica) strategy. THE dISNEY CHANNEL BOOSTS  CHILd-ORIENTEd PROGRAMMING The AntenA 3 tv and neox programming, together with  that of the Disney Channel, have placed Atres Adver- tisinG as the advertising exclusivist with the highest  amount of child- and family-oriented. Since the Disney  Channel started its open broadcasting on the 1st of July  2008, its influence has been increasing gradually among  this audience. 5.2 ONdA CERO MAINTAINS ITS  GROWTH TRENd For yet another year, radio has done justice to its most val- ued attribute: the stability and security of a mature media  that feels more youthful than ever.  In 2010, ondA Cero and europA FM were able to capital- ize the historical audience record of the group, all due  to a successful stability in the programming and to the  constant innovation in the special formats. Currently it is  the radio group with the highest prescriber involvement  and greatest trend towards integration of the brand into  content.

The announcers trust ondA Cero and europA FM more and  more as their advertising medium, in such a way that both  have increased their commercial budget, by 3% and 10%  respectively. 5.3 AdN, THE dAILY NEWSPAPER  FOR THE URBAN PUBLIC Despite the decreased circulation that free newspapers  have undergone in the last waves of the eGM, Adn still has  an excellent capacity to connect with the urban public.  Adn, commercialized by Atres AdvertisinG, ranks fifth  among general information newspapers with 1,261,000  readers. It is, in addition, the only free newspaper that  maintains its commercial position thanks to the young  readers (individuals between 14 and 44 years of age,  from middle and upper classes, from an urban habitat,  with University degrees and living in big cities). Beyond  numbers, Adn is the perfect medium to complement the  multimedia campaign. In addition Atres AdvertisinG keeps betting on extra con- tent in the press. A clear example is the supplement that  was edited to support the Spanish football team during  the 2010 world cup.

During this year MoviereCord remained the top  exclusivist in film on the national level, working with  10% more advertisers than its immediate competi- tor. 5.5 ATRES AdvERTISING, THE  LEAdER IN INTERNET  This is the media that has grown the most in the  last decade. Despite already being third in Spain  in investment volume, its upside seems limitless  boundaries; in 2011 it posted the best performance  of all the media types.  In 2010 AntenA 3 launched its new web page,  which allowed Atres AdvertisinG to boost its inven- tory, and was thereby able to offer its advertisers  online video, a product that is in high demand. Atres AdvertisinG reinforced its online position thanks to  the incorporation of the social network habbo in its com- mercial offer. With habbo, one of the biggest social net- works on the internet, Atres AdvertisinG has broadened  its offer in entertainment products on the Web, making it  the most complete multimedia exclusivist on the market.  During this year, Atres AdvertisinG has grown nearly 70%  on the internet in relation to 2009 thanks to the trust of  293 advertisers who chose it as the perfect medium to  advertise their brands.  5.6 ANTENA 3 EvENTS:  INTERACTION WITH THE BRANd  AntenA 3 events maintains its commitment to communi- cation through experience, creating memorable moments  for brands to reach their target audience through first- person interaction in the most effective manner possible.  Using imagination to highlight and create an attractive  space, and a precision organization are the two main keys  to turn a simple event into an extraordinary one. This is  what the company has been doing and what, for another  year, has allowed it to maintain its benchmark status in  promotional marketing.

Both surpassed the success of the previous edition, with  1,200 participants in the first case and 10,000 in the sec- ond. This initiative was awarded with the Medal of Merit  of Road Safety for its effort at the service of safety behind  the wheel.  Another of the companys sports events was the Padel  Woman Tour 2010. AntenA 3 events, in collaboration with  Mediasponsorship – a company specializing in sports  marketing -, was the agency in charge of giving shape to  this sports circuit that took place in six cities and in which  competition and learning were combined.  Finally, under the name of La llamada del Gol Telefnica,  AntenA 3 events organized a contest that allowed the sup- porters of several first division teams to experience foot- ball in person with their team. After competing through  ondA Cero to see who the best narrators of a goal were,  the three finalists enjoyed an extraordinary day in the  company of their team.  PROMOTION ANd ORGANIZATION  OF CONGRESSES In 2010 AntenA 3 events had the opportunity to organize  two of the great events related to the use of new technolo- gies. It was an important effort in support of the ambi- tious campaigns carried by the Administration and the  State organism Red.es to promote the use of the elec- tronic ID or the definitive instauration of digital television  in our country. For the first case AntenA 3 events created a large network  of dynamic media consoles that were placed in 150 police  stations of the 52 Spanish provinces. This action allowed  over half a million people to be informed about the advan- tages and the use of the electronic ID.  In the second case, AntenA 3 events participated in dif- ferent initiatives that Red.es initiated to adapt the comple- tion of the transit plan to DTT and its definitive rollout in  April 2010.  lastly, AntenA 3 events was the agency in charge of  organizing the FICoD 2010, the most important interna- tional forum on digital content, which takes place in Spain.  promoted by Red.es and the Ministry of Industry, Tourism  and Commerce, it gathered more than 15,000 profession- als in the digital market in a unique event in which many  international experts participated.  THE GLAMOUR OF THE REd CARPET In 2010, AntenA 3 events unrolled the red carpet on sev- eral occasions for celebrities and their big premieres. This  is a new business line with great potential over the next  few years.  Que se Mueran los Feos, Lope, 3 Metros Bajo el Cielo or  Los Ojos de Julia have been some of the feature length  films in which the company has participated as the organ- izing agency for their premiere screenings in which major  distribution companies such as Warner Universal and Fox  have participated.  Furthermore, AntenA 3 events continued holding pre- screenings in movie theatres of the new seasons of the  successful series of AntenA 3, like Fsica o Qumica or El  Internado, giving the fans the opportunity to see their idols  up close and have an exciting and unique experience.

The  action had different spaces available where the partic- ipants could improve their knowledge of driving safety,  both in theory and in practice. PROMOTIONAL MARKETING Knowing the benefits of different products through experi- ence is one of the most sought after advertising actions  nowadays. Shell or Braun, are two of our clients that have  bet on innovative communication methods that create an  environment in which the public learns and interacts with  the brand.  LICENCES In 2010 the station continued to use SMS to communicate  with audiences, and through this media, carried out dif- ferent interactive initiatives with spectators, such as the  integration of their opinions into programme content, the  development of contests and votes related to issues of  the day.  It has also consolidated its grid with the interactive pro- gramme formats it launched in 2009: Astroshow and the  self-help format El futuro en tus Manos, has played along- side Adivina Quien Gana esta Noche, a game show that  the station has been playing uninterruptedly since 2006.  In the licenses section, AntenA 3 launched the TV movies  Princesa de boli and Raphael on DVD, but has also car- ried out special initiatives, such as the broadcasting the El  Internado for the launch of the last season.  In addition, thanks to channels audience profile, it has  launched complete products onto the market under  brands such as Fsica o Qumica, and the gameshow La  Ruleta de la Suerte which spawned the bestselling board- game in 2010.  AntenA 3 continues to launch books and publications  based on the Groups brands.

Conscious of the scale of this influence,  Atres AdvertisinG complies with the legislation governing  its business: Regulation 25/1994, and the General Regu- lation on Advertising, while also taking steps to guarantee  responsible advertising beyond the scope of the regulation  itself.  In 2010, to formalise and incorporate the general principles  covering the companys advertising practices, AntenA3  Group defined its Responsible Advertising policy, com- mitting the company to applying the principles of honesty,  veracity, child protection, excellence and social responsibil- ity, amongst others, to their advertising management.

Atres AdvertisinG, aware of the social responsibility inherent in its business, has always underpinned the sale of advertising with ethi- cal principles based on a management style that is committed to responsible advertising practices. These principles, mainly inspired by  current legislation governing advertising, go beyond mere legal compliance and are firmly committed to responsible advertising in rela- tion to viewers and the agents that work in the sector: announcers, advertising agencies and media buying agencies. Firstly, Atres AdvertisinG is committed to ensuring that its advertising content clearly adheres to basic values such as truthfulness,  honesty and a total respect for human rights.  On the other hand, it is directly involved in achieving the objectives of advertising agencies and announcers, by offering them a renewed  multimedia sales offer that meets their needs. Furthermore, everyday Atres AdvertisinG strives to offer increasingly innovative services,  through improved advertising management processes and procedures. Atres AdvertisinGs work philosophy is established by its self-regulating advertising code, in order to lay out an ethical framework that  underpins responsible and truthful communication and responsible commercial management that aims to service customers. Advertising self-regulation AntenA 3 tv is a member of Autocontrol (Association for Self Regulation in Commercial Communication); through which it aims to main- tain rigour and ethics commercial communication and protect viewers from dubious practices; at the same time Antena 3 TV undertakes  to comply with the Advertising Code of Conduct, based on the International Chamber of Commerce Code of Advertising.  Furthermore, Antena 3 TV voluntarily complies with several sector self-regulating codes such as PAOS (self-regulating code of advertis- ing aimed at minors), FEbE (self-regulating code of the Spanish Spirits and beverage Federation), self-regulating code of Spanish beer  –Makers, the Wine Code of Ethics, SMS Self-Regulation Code, banking and Financial Services Advertising Regulation and Control or  Environmental Impact Self-Regulation Code.  In order to meet national and international advertising law, and comply with the self-regulation codes to which ATRES ADVERTISING  adheres, it voluntarily follows the following principles:    To meet current legislation nationally and internationally on advertising and sales information the companys product placement  practices meet requirements laid down in the General Regulation 7/2010 of 31 March on Audiovisual Communication.    To accept the responsibility that broadcasted advertising abides by the principles of the self-regulating codes the company voluntarily  adheres to, following rigorous in-house procedures to monitor this. Atres AdvertisinG commits itself to devoting the necessary resources, both human and technological, to attempt to minimise risks  associated with non-compliance and thus:     Ensures that allegations made by advertisers in their campaigns are honest and genuine, thus obeying the law and the relevant code  of professional ethics.

Particular attention is paid to the non-incitement of  violence, discrimination in any of its manifestations, and incitement to behaviour which offends human dignity.    At the same time, the company firmly rejects advertising campaigns which fail to respect human rights, and is particularly vigilant  regarding those which attack the dignity of women, minors, or any minority group which requires special attention.    Special care is taken to ensure that advertising products in content directed at children is suitable for this public; for this reason the  slots where programming is directed at this group are marketed separately.  responsible sales management and quality of service    At Atres we are committed to working for a quality sales offering, the ultimate goal of which is the positive development of our clients  brands. To achieve this we put all our efforts into being attentive to their needs and offering them novel products and formats to  ensure maximum advertising success.    We encourage a relationship with advertisers, agencies, and head offices which is based on the principles of honesty and transparency.   We try to adapt to changes in the market, renewing our sales offering every quarter and publishing it following the criteria and sched- ules agreed mutually with the Spanish Advertisers Association.    Our sales offering on our webpage is transparent, accessible and easy to use for all who wish to. Moreover, we have other communica- tion channels available, such as news bulletins in electronic format, or the client portal with interesting information on the sector.    Atres AdvertisinG has a vocation to quality of service and one of its main aims is to achieve better advertising management. With  this aim in view, the company constantly develops techniques which result in more effective, efficient and environmentally-friendly  processes. In this direction we work constantly with the other players in the market to incorporate procedures in our relationships with  them which introduce the use of new technologies and enable us to offer an excellent, innovative service, at the same time as being  more ecological. commitment to society At Atres we work to achieve responsible advertising which brings value and goes beyond conventional sales communication. For this  reason:    We are firmly committed to always having an active portfolio of products which offer clients the opportunity to be involved with pro- jects with a social focus.    As far as possible, we commit ourselves to providing free advertising space to NGOs and foundations, provided they meet the require- ments in force for non-profit organisations. Following these principles, Atres AdvertisinG is involved in a large number of voluntary  initiatives which ensure responsible advertising, with the aim of complying with national  and international legislation on advertising. In 2010 the company manifested its support for the regulations governing service provi- sion for services subject to additional charges related to text messages (SMS and premium  MMS), regulation and control of advertising services, banking products and the self-regu- lation code on environmental arguments in sales communications. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 61 atres advertising. commercial strength. antena 3 group index networks webs  In addition, as member of Autocontrol, in all sales com- munications the company complies with the Advertising  Code of Conduct. In addition, observance of other sector- based self-regulation codes, such as the Spanish Associa- tion of entertainment Software Distributors and publishers  (ADeSe); the Spanish Federation of Food and Drinks Indus- tries (FeBe); and the Spanish Brewers Association. Finally,  since 2009 AntenA 3 television has accepted the content  of the pAoS Code (Self-regulation code on Food Advertis- ing aimed at minors, prevention of obesity, and health). CHILd PROTECTION, TRANSPARENCY  ANd SUSTAINABILITY Atres AdvertisinGs investment in responsible advertising  entails a series of actions which reinforce the companys  commitment in this area. Thus, with the aim of guaran- teeing the quality of advertising, the slots for extra protec- tion have been extended beyond what is stipulated (from  8.00 to 11.00 instead of 8.00 to 9.00) in order to avoid  certain advertisers taking slots with a high level of child  consumption. Moreover, strict filters have been put in place to monitor  advertising content by the broadcasting department. In  this direction, to guarantee ethical and legal correctness  in sales communications, Autocontrol is requested to ana- lyse advertising campaign before circulation, and to pro- vide a positive appraisal, a positive copy, of all the creative  content directed at children and, from november 2010,  also advertising for films, videogames, and banking as an  additional measure. over the course of the year 45 copies  (the communication group processed the highest number  of applications) and 38 legal enquiries were requested. In addition a daily analysis is run on advertising take-up  and this is sent voluntarily to the Ministry of Industry for an  incident resolution report. Moreover, to lead the changes  involved in adapting to the european Directive on advertis- ing, the subject has been tackled with 14 media centres  and 12 advertisers and a consultative document has been  drafted for all of them. on sustainability, in 2010 we continued to work on reduc- ing paper use, boosting shopping on-line through the cli- ent portal. Specifically, a key media centre, Magna Global,  has joined us to reinforce the companys commitment in  this direction. To strengthen the relationship with advertis- ers Atres AdvertisinG e-bulletins have been improved to  include videos, and an on-line tool has been provided for  advertisers so that they can supervise their creative con- tent. This has meant a major saving in tapes. MANAGEMENT OF vIOLATIONS Advertising broadcasting is subject to strict laws which  AntenA 3 Group abides by to the letter. To ensure this cor- rect use of sales communications and minimise the num- ber of violations, Atres AdvertisinG has a professional on  its staff whose job it is to provide daily, weekly and monthly  reports which corroborate that the information released by  the company which measures audience ratings, Sofres,  coincides with the companys internal information, making  complaints to this company whenever errors are detected.  The company also maintains constant contact with the  authorities, Autocontrol and other advertising bodies, with  the aim of strictly complying with legislation. In 2010 thirteen sanctions corresponding to fifty-four vio- lations were resolved. of the sanctions received, four cor- responded to sales communications by SMS text message  and the rest to sales communications on television. 2008 2009 2010 No. of sanctions 5  4  13 No. of violations 45 15  54 Total fine () 1,302,932* 493,781 1,006,184 (*) the discrepancy of 61,500 between the sum allocated in other years reports arises from the  reversal of two SETSI sanctions through two High Court rulings, which declared null and void two  2008 penalty rulings to the sum of 61,500. Also in March 2010 the High Court partially overturned a  2007 ruling, reducing the total penalty by 66,000. Note 1: Includes all the incidents which have occurred, both disciplinary penalties and complaints to  Autocontrol, regardless of their nature and amount. Note 2: private television operators with national coverage are in constant contact with the  authorities, which have the power to monitor their business. A strict comparison between historical  data on non-compliance is not possible, since criteria on the flexibility or rigor applied by Public  Administration has not been exactly the same, nor have the methods and technical control  procedures applied by this monitoring body. The penalty rulings over television advertising broadcasts  refer to violation of the regulation applicable to television  operators on maximum daily or hourly television adver- tising time, and to restrictions over the way of including  advertising on the programming grid. The majority of the  violations at the start of the year arose from the introduc- tion of the system entailing synchronised advertising roll- outs, consisting of simultaneously broadcasting the same  advertising spot on different television channels, so these  are problems which have already been resolved. Similarly,  the new General law 7/2010, on Audiovisual Communica- tion has, to a great extent, done away with the restrictions  on the number of advertising spots, and on advertising  during sport events, while respecting the limit on minutes  per hour. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 62 atres advertising. commercial strength. antena 3 group index networks webs  AdvERTISING COMBINEd WITH  SOLIdARITY ANd INNOvATION In 2010 Atres AdvertisinG continued its commitment  to communication events and advertising campaigns  which foster the advertisers link with society-focussed  events and corporate values and which, at the same time,  encourage solidarity-based and sustainable behaviour in  the audience. Advertisers in very diverse sectors have participated  actively in the campaigns for social action run by AntenA3  Group, Ponle Freno and Vive Contectado. For its part, Atres  AdvertisinG has linked up actively with the Beca Rober- tus with Fanta, a project of the brands to boost creativity  amongst young people. Also a campaign along with the  company Central lechera Asturiana has been concluded  to sponsor the first chapter of Spanish fiction recorded in  3D from the series Protegidos, to boost this technology.  lastly, to give a voice to information campaigns and  awareness raising for foundations and non-profit associa- tions, six advertising campaigns for different nGos were  launched in AntenA 3 Group at no cost whatsoever, includ- ing the Foundation Vicente Ferrer with its campaign to  sponsor Tu Cadena Solidaria, and plan espaa, directed  at raising funds for the earthquake in haiti in February. ACCESSIBILITY, SUSTAINABILITY  ANd dIALOGUE: CHALLENGES  FOR THE COMING YEARS  With the aim of positioning AntenA 3 Group as the lead- ing company within the audiovisual sector, in line with  the objectives set out in its Corporate Responsibility plan,  Atres AdvertisinG has set itself the goal of continuing to  work in areas such as children, transparency, accessibility  and dialogue, with a view to reinforcing its commitment to  responsible advertising. Amongst the events planned for the coming years, the  company aims to continue leading advertisers adaptation  to the new legislation governing the audiovisual sector,  offering a consulting service to clients who request it, and  proactively when relevant changes arise. Similarly, with  the aim of reinforcing AntenA 3 Groups link with its adver- tisers, we plan to launch an initiative for the fight against  child obesity, as well as jointly participating in corporate  events, such as Ponle Freno, Vive Conectado or Hazte Eco.  In addition, to support the commitment to the children in  the AntenA 3 FoundAtion, an agreement is being finalised  to bring 3D technology to children in hospital, in collabo- ration with the milk producer, Central lechera Asturiana. The reinforcement of accessible advertising is another of  the priority objectives in the near future. For this purpose  Atres AdvertisinG will provide subtitling for advertise- ments, as well as offering the option to sponsor subtitled  programmes.  Similarly, within the sphere of sustainability, the company  continues to foster the use of new technologies to replace  paper, in line with AntenA 3 Groups environmental policy.  on this theme, for 2011 we plan to bring in Grupo havas,  which is to introduce on-line shopping on radio. Work is  also in the pipeline to digitize advertisements to avoid the  use of tapes. lastly, with the aim of listening and responding to AntenA3  Groups advertisers needs, we will be launching a satis- faction survey to try to identify strong points and areas  for improvement, which will enable us to design a plan of  action on the basis of the studys conclusions.

This policy, set out on the web page  www.grupoantena3.com, itemises the fundamental principles which govern the companys responsible conduct. PrinciPlES oF tHE antEna 3 GroUP corPoratE rESPonSiBilitY PolicY strict compliance with legislation and integrity   We comply with the legislation in force applicable to us in the economic, social and environmental sphere.   We act with integrity and are putting in place the mechanisms needed to prevent the company and its employees from being involved in incidents of corruption, bribery or fraud. transparency    Transparency is an indispensable asset in our business and also for the professionals who comprise our company. This principle is particularly relevant in areas linked directly or indirectly to news services, as well as the  departments which deal with stakeholders.   As a broadcaster, we are transparent and impartial when providing our information, which is verified and accurate.   All our corporate information is reliable, guaranteeing this through correct compilation and verification.   The principle of balance governs our communications; for this reason we report to our stakeholders on our successes but also our failures. supervision   The Board of Directors of Antena 3 Group is the body responsible for approving our Corporate Responsibility strategy.    We have a Corporate Responsibility committee which drives and supervises the implementation of our Corporate Responsibility policy, keeping the Board of Directors and the management up to date on its progress. commitment to responsibility for content     As a media company which exercises a powerful influence over opinions, values and conduct in society, we ensure the quality of the content we broadcast, endeavouring to reflect in it the diversity of society, and supporting  the dissemination of content on the themes of sustainability which concern society.    We ensure the independence of our content, and that it is in line with the values which guide the work of the company, as well as the principles laid down in the Code on Self- regulation of Content and children. protecting and fostering human rights    As a media company we promote freedom of expression, pluralism and non-discrimination in our content, and support the protection of human rights, as recognised in the Universal Declaration on Human rights and the dif- ferent national and international conventions and declarations on this theme.   We place particular emphasis on the protection of the rights of minors who participate in our content through mechanisms directed at guaranteeing and respecting this.    We are particularly involved in the fight against gender violence participating in developing public policies   We provide our knowledge on the audiovisual sector to public bodies and regulators, with the aim of designing public policies which contribute to improving the competitive environment and creating value in the society we  operate in.   We participate in sector-based forums which aim to promote policies fostering progress in the audiovisual sector. integrating the principles of our corporate responsibility strategy within the supply chain    We maintain a free-flowing and transparent dialogue with our suppliers, with the aim of optimising supplies and company recruitment.   Our processes of assignation are based on the principles of equity and transparency.   We include the criteria of sustainability in procurement of goods and services, provided that the demands of economics and quality permit this.   We involve the companys suppliers in the Antena 3 Group Corporate Responsibility policies by getting them to sign commitments to abide by them. setting up channels for active, open dialogue with our stakeholders    We consider interaction and dialogue with our stakeholders to be a key element for progress in our Corporate Responsibility strategy. For this purpose we place effective channels of communication at the disposal of our  stakeholders, which make us aware of and respond to their demands and expectations, taking on board the ones which contribute to the companys competitiveness and profitability.  respect for the environment    In spite of the fact that Antena 3 Groups business does not have any major environmental repercussions, we run our operations to reduce their impact on the environment and boost energy efficiency and the efficient use of  resources, as stipulated in the companys policy on the environment. rigorous compliance with the standards of corporate government    Our corporate government practices are based on the principles of transparency, independence and observance of current legislation.    The Appointments and Salaries Committee is responsible for overseeing compliance with the Policy of Corporate government and in-house regulations on conduct.

At the first meeting, held  on 29 April, the Master plan was presented and respon- sibilities assigned regarding compliance with the plans  objectives and lines of action. The second meeting took  place on 13 December and centred on the presenta- tion of the new corporate policies (Corporate Responsi- bility, Social Commitment, human Resources, Respon- sible Advertising and the environment) drafted under  the supervision of the areas involved and the Corporate  Responsibility executives in AntenA 3 Group.  The Committee on Corporate Responsibility was set up at  the end of 2009 with the aim of strengthening the cross- sectional nature and importance of Corporate Responsi- bility in AntenA 3 Group. It is comprised of representa- tives of the companys main areas of business (human  Resources, environment, the AntenA 3 FoundAtion and  Corporate Responsibility, Television Content, Marketing  and Audiences, Radio Content, Advertising and Adver- tisers, Auditing, Relations with Investors, Suppliers, and  news Content) and its main mission is to inform the man- agement and the Board of Directors of AntenA 3 Group  on key steps taken on Corporate Responsibility. Its tasks  include the following:  	 Supervising consolidation of the companys policy on  Corporate Responsibility, supporting its dissemination  in each of the management areas. 	 Giving impetus to and supervising the events outlined  in the Master plan, and keeping the authorities and  company management informed on its progress. 	 observing compliance with outside commitments  taken on by AntenA 3 Group in the field of Corporate  Responsibility. 	 Supporting Communication managers on identifi- cation, dialogue and cooperation with the different  stakeholders. 	 Collaborating in drafting the Report on Corporate  Responsibility. 6.1.4 OPEN TO dIALOGUE WITH  STAKEHOLdERS AntenA 3 Group considers dialogue to be a key element  in achieving the confidence of its stakeholders and of  society at large. Consequently, it has formalised a large  number of different channels to respond to the expecta- tions and opinions of these groups. Similarly, the Group is  involved in different sector-based forums and initiatives of  civil society which provide an interchange of experiences  and knowledge. In 2010 the company continued to use the channels  of communication set up for its different stakeholders:  advertisers, audience, society, employees, competitors,  regulatory bodies, regulators, suppliers and shareholders,  detailed in the Reports on Corporate Responsibility for  2008 and 2009. Amongst these are the Platform, Ponle  Freno www.ponlefreno.com and the AntenA 3 FoundAtion  webpage www.fundationantena3.es. Signature of the agreement between Antena 3 and the Foro de Reputacin  Corporativa. The Master plan on Corporate Responsibility also includes  lines of action directed at improving the channels for dia- logue with its interest groups. Some of the most relevant  are the reinforcement of the content in the section on  Corporate Responsibility (RC) on the AntenA 3 Group  webpage, and the inclusion of information relating to CR  events in communications with the financial world. over the course of 2010, AntenA 3 Group collaborated  for six months, through its own television channels and  ondA Ceros, in publicising the Millennium Development  objectives. This campaign, promoted by the Corporate  Reputation Forum and entitled 2015: a better world for  Joana, aims to achieve greater awareness in all social part- ners, to reach the Millennium Development objectives,  the deadline of which expires in 2015. AntenA 3 Group  collaborated with this initiative on an exclusive and altru- annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 67 corporate responsibility in antena 3 group: strategic view. antena 3 group index networks webs  istic basis, running the biggest ever social awareness  campaign in Spain by a media company in favour of  the Millennium Development objectives.  AntenA 3 Group moved further forwards in its focus  towards dialogue with its stakeholders in 2010, evolv- ing from a reactive approach to a more proactive one  where it is looking to create new ideas to contribute to  the company. In this direction a workshop was run at  the San Sebastin de los Reyes offices on Co-cre- ation in collaboration with the Spanish Democratic  Union of pensioners and Retirees, and drawing up  the First Decalogue on Road Safety, produced by  and on behalf of the elderly. More information on this Decalogue can be found in the  chapter on road safety in this report. 6.1.5 ACTIvE COMMITMENT TO  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AntenA 3 Group participates actively in different national  and international initiatives on Corporate Responsibility,  sharing knowledge and experiences in both the audio- visual sector and other spheres.  over the course of 2009 and 2010 the company collabo- rated actively in drafting the first Media Sector Supple- ment, driven by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), as  a supplement to its guide on producing G3 annual sus- tainability reports. The result of a joint project with other  key companies in the media world, such as the BBC,  Bertelsmann, Vivendi, the Guardian, Grupo Clarin or the  Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a document was  drafted which will standardise the content of companies  Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Reports in the  media sector, thus facilitating comparison between them.  In 2010 AntenA 3 Group also renewed its membership of  the Spanish network of the World pact and its support for  the ten underlying principles relating to respect for human  rights and rights at work, the environment, and the fight  against bribery and corruption. Through this membership  the company commits itself to applying these principles  to all its activities.  lastly, we should also mention AntenA 3 Groups pres- ence for the third year running in the selective FTSe- 4Good Ibex, which includes the companies which have  gone furthest in Corporate Responsibility, consolidating  its commitment to a model of responsible management  which creates value for its stakeholders.

Similarly, we shall provide regulations and proce- dures for our employees and collaborators, stipulating guidelines for continuing  accident prevention.

In 2009 AntenA 3 Group adapted its business model to  guarantee its financial profitability and sustainability, in view  of the current context of economic crisis and changes in  the audiovisual sector. over the course of 2010 the com- pany has continued with this adaptation, in order to achieve  a more flexible structure and reduce a number of fixed  costs to bring gains in competitiveness. This has led to the  implementation of a Restructuring plan which has involved  outsourcing part of the workforce.

Initially  designed to be implemented in AntenA 3 television, the aim of  this initiative, in addition to complying with the legislation in force  and the stipulations of the VII Collective Agreement of AntenA 3  tv, was to gain an in depth knowledge about the company and  define the objectives and initiatives necessary to optimise the  Groups efforts in this regard.  In short, the equality plan seeks to be a key factor in improv- ing the work environment, increasing productivity and helping  attract and retain talent, as well as reinforcing the internal and  external image of the company.

Accident insurance for staff on business trips, in accordance with the collective agreement.  	 Training/educational assistance. In the event that the employee leaves the company before working there for  two years, completed training courses will be paid by him or her. 	 Company cafeteria. 	 public transport.  Therefore in 2009, an agreement was reached with external companies who offered their services to AntenA3  Group employees at a reduced price. Among these offers, we would highlight those related to public and private  health clubs, gymnasiums, and ophthalmological clinics.

The initial salary is defined as the entry salary that must be offered an employee for a full-time and in the lowest category. The minimum salary is one that by law a worker must receive as compensation for his work. The remuneration for AntenA 3 Group employees is composed of a base salary and a complementary component for rea- sons of seniority, overtime, night shifts or other extraordinary payments, as well as food and travel allowances. The base salary is the portion of remuneration which corresponds to the worker in function of his or her professional cat- egory, for a full days work, independent of any objective or subjective circumstance related to their position or person.

This policy establishes the  annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 76 corporate responsibility in antena 3 group: strategic view. antena 3 group index networks webs  IMPROvEMENT IN ACCIdENT  RATES ANd ABSENTEEISM  AntenA 3 Group accident and absenteeism rates improved  notably in 2010 with respect to other years. The number  of accidents fell and the duration of the sick leave as a  result of these accidents also decreased. This was due, in  large part to increased awareness on the part of employ- ees about the importance of risk prevention, as a result  of the Groups efforts to improve the safety and health of  its employees. In regard to medical services offered by the Group, about  4,000 consultations and over 350 medical check-ups were  carried out, as well as 150 evaluations of labour risks. RAISING AWARENESS ANd TRAINING  To promote the prevention of risks and the health and  safety of employees, different awareness raising and train- ing initiatives were rolled out.  In 2010 the company placed a strong focus on prevent- ing traffic accidents during commutes and working hours.  Among the other educational initiatives we would highlight  the inclusion on the corporate internet of two educational  tools: 	 Por tu salud is a section that places an emphasis on  preventative measures to ensure good health, and  practical advice and information on physical well- being for workers and their families.  	 Buzn de id+as. Since the end of 2010, Group employ- ees have access to an Intranet section that provides  suggestions and ideas about safety and health. To this end it launched a programme to improve the  ergonomics of the workplace, under the framework of  the Action plan set forth in the Groups Master plan  for Corporate responsibility, which identified and ana- lysed the areas in which the ergonomic component  of certain activities related to the radio and television  production could prove to be deficient and in need of  improvement. Most recent studies on the matter agree on the need  to carry out continual improvement to the material,  environmental, ergonomic and psychological/social  conditions related to the following activities of Group  employees: administration and management tasks,  monitor and screen use, manual handling of loads,  postures and physical exertion. It also detected the  need to provide preferential treatment to workers who  are especially sensitive, such as those who have some  type of disability, or handicap, as well as pregnant  women.  In response to these needs, in 2010, an evaluation  was carried out of positions in which screens or moni- tors are regularly used, and a brief document was  drafted to serve as a guide for determining the mate- rial specifications for office furniture.  In terms of safety and health, we would mention that  the training initiatives related to risk prevention for high  altitude work and load carrying have been delegated  to the external companies tasked with carrying out  these activities, although information about risk pre- vention continues to be disseminated. acciDEnt  ratES at   antEna 3  GroUP 2008 2009 2010 at  WorK com- mUtE at  WorK com- mUtE at  WorK com- mUtE Number of acci- dents resulting  in sick leave 33 10 27 10 13 6 Number of  accidents not  resulting in sick  leave 72 8 50 5 35 6 Number of job- related deaths 0 0 0 0 0 0 antEna 3 GroUP acciDEnt anD aBSEntEE- iSm ratES  2008 2009 2010 Frequency of accidents 11,74 8,99 3,6 Seriousness of accidents 1,91 1,26 0,35 Absenteeism due to common illness (%) 2,37 1,52 1,25 Work absenteeism (%) 3,54 2,48 2,21 antEna 3 GroUPS mEDical SErvicES 2008 2009 2010 Cases attended 5,609 4,264 3,879 Emergency cases 29 30 26 Dressings 322 363 279 blood testing and other 492 422 364 Injections 36 40 31 Medical check-ups 492 422 364 Vaccinations 20 15 10 Evaluation of job-related risks 144 110 99 antEna 3 GroUP tEcHnical PrEvEntion 2008 2009 2010 Evaluation of workplace risks  177 165 156 Preventative planning 78 67 74 Safety, hygiene, Ergonomic reports 79 61 26 Other prevention and health initiatives 190 248 254 annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 77 corporate responsibility in antena 3 group: strategic view. antena 3 group index networks webs  commitment  to society.

PROTECTION OF CHILdRENS RIGHTS In 2010, coinciding with Universal Childrens Day, the  FoundAtion launched the A Name, A Life campaign, which  reflects the AntenA 3 FoundAtions endeavour to defend  and promote childrens rights. This initiative was under- taken to raise awareness about the right of children to  have an identity, something not all kids enjoy. Thanks to  this campaign, we managed to register 60,000 children in  Madagascar who lacked fundamental rights such as edu- cation or healthcare given that they were not registered  and did not have a birth certificate.  This initiative was carried out in collaboration with the  Coconut Water Foundation, an organization with much  experience in handling birth certificates in Madagascar.

The observatory also tries  to determine the status of corporate volunteer programs  through periodical surveys. The observatory also tries to  promote these services, by providing advice to companies  that do not have these types of policies or activities.  In 2010, the observatory held its 1st Debate on Corporate  Volunteer Services, in which over 30 companies partici- pated. Furthermore, it presented its 2nd study on corpo- rate Volunteer programs in Spain, which takes a look at  this form of collaboration over the last year.

In 2010, the Foun- dAtion held its 2nd Family Volunteers Day at which 45  volunteers participated, in collaboration with the Caballo  Foundation, an organization that uses horses as a means  of therapy to help children and young people with dis- abilities. 6.3.6 PRO PROJECT: OPENING THE  AUdIOvISUAL LABOUR MARKET TO  PEOPLE WITH dISABILITIES In 2009, the AntenA 3 FoundAtion started the PRO Pro- ject, an initiative that seeks to integrate disabled persons  into the labour market, as often this segment of society  has to overcome social rejection, the lack of training or dif- ficulties adapting to the work environment. The Pro Project  also helps companies in the audiovisual sector comply  with regulations governing the integration of disabled per- sons, given the difficulties these companies have finding  people with the right to work in the audiovisual industry.  The PRO Projects activities are aimed at training disabled  persons for the audiovisual sector and implementing pre- labour workshops that help this collective learn the basic  aspects of finding employment and participating in com- pany training programs. In January 2010, the first course  on TV production Assistants was given, in which 15 stu- dents with different disabilities participated. In 2011, new  courses will be given to teach disabled students about  TV and Radio planning and Supervision, and specializa- tion in multimedia contents.  The PRO Project enjoys the support of the Universidad  Carlos III and the Royal Disabled Foundation and the  collaboration of some of the main training and employ- Collaboration with barretstown Foundation  through the Antena 3 Foundation Great Small  Vacations program.

To achieve this goal, the Foundation benefits  from the opinions and commitment of prestigious special- ists and other professionals in charge of the professional  training and development of young people.  Towards this end, the AntenA 3 FoundAtion has set up  the FAn 3 librAry, a group of publications that tackle sub- jects that affect the training and personal development of  children and adolescence in a constructive and positive  way. en 2010 the first of these publications was released  with the title Searching for educational success: Realities  and Solutions, a document that provides new data and  proposals from experts on how to reduce dropout rates. In 2010, the AntenA 3 FoundAtion signed new agreements  with entities such as the Bertelsmann Foundation. Thanks  to this partnership, the Young Scriptwriters Day was held,  which was set up to encourage young people to work in  the audiovisual communication field. This event was held  at the School for Information Sciences at the Universi- dad Complutense de Madrid and was rounded out with a  workshop on the movie production process.  likewise, the AntenA 3 FoundAtion, in collaboration with  the psychologists Association of Madrid, sponsored the  international conference The Challenge of Change in Edu- cation. Learning in the iGeneration, led by Dr.	Larry	Rosen,  an international expert on the subject.

In its third year, Ponle Freno has continued to use preven- tion as the best way of preventing accidents and helping  reduce the number of traffic-related fatalities on the roads  by increasing its activities. This project has also continued  the initiatives started in previous years, while focusing on  three groups: senior citizens, cyclists and children.  antena 3 group meeting the road safety challenge. oUr FocUS The Antena 3 Group, as a media group, has a great deal of power in terms of trans- mitting messages to much of Spain, including drivers. Therefore, in 2008 the Group  undertook the Ponle Freno initiative, in order to raise awareness about road safety  amongst its audience. This initiative has become well known over the last few years for  the actions it has taken, its achievements and the support given by many social agents,  experts and well-known personalities, all of whom share the Ponle Freno challenge:  help save lives.    SEnior citiZEnS: nEW FocUS in  2010 This group, which includes people over 64, represents 10% of all drivers, but also  more than 25% of traffic-related fatalities.  For yet another year, all of the AntenA 3 Groups media  has supported Ponle Freno by reserving content and/ or advertising space while acting as the initiatives main  spokesperson. Both AntenA 3 television and ondA  Cero have periodically set time aside for Ponle Freno  in their programming, while inserting radio announce- ments, spots or messages within its news programs and  corporate responsibility in  antena 3 group: strategic view. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 86 corporate responsibility in antena 3 group: strategic view. antena 3 group index networks webs  shows. At ondA Cero, for example, Ponle Freno has short  slot times on road safety advice. Ponle Freno also has its own website www.ponlefreno.com  on which it provides updated information on its various  projects. Thanks to campaigns like Ponle Freno and the collective  effort of citizens and authorities, there was a significant  drop in traffic accidents in 2010. In fact, in 2010 there were  1,546 deadly accidents in Spain, which resulted in 1,728  deaths, 8.5% and 8.9% less than in 2009, respectively. 6.4.2 CLOSE TO CITIZENS Apart from using the AntenA 3 Groups various media,  Ponle Freno also undertakes activities on the street in  order to be closer to citizens, thereby making its campaign  more visible and effective.  Among other actions, in 2010 Ponle Freno started to take  advantage of social networks; the arranged their second  popular race; carried out specific campaigns related to  operaciones Salida (massive exodus of vehicles from major  cities during summer holidays); and it has held an on-going  dialogue with the government agencies on road safety.

This campaign  invites social networks with the most users worldwide to  join the Ponle Freno platform and demand better safety on  the roads. Facebook users can put the campaigns logo  in their profile picture, as well as suggest that their friends  participate in the initiative. Ponle Freno has more than 100,000 followers on Face- book who it provides updates on the latest initiatives. For  the AntenA 3 Group, the social networks are going to pay  a vital role in reducing traffic accidents given its ability to  allow users to share information. 2Nd ANNUAL PONLE FRENO RACE In 2010 the second Ponle Freno Race was held. This event  was held on november 28th in Madrid and october 17th  in Murcia, in which 10,000 and 1,200 runners partici- pated, respectively.  Road safety was the protagonist at both races, which  enjoyed the participation of well-known AntenA 3 Group  personalities. The money collected went entirely to the  AntenA 3 FoundAtion, which will use these funds to  improve road safety.

In 2010, the Ponle Freno campaign launched the Looking  for Danger Signs project, by which citizens file complaints  about traffic signs that are in bad shape, fallen, not visible  or those that are confusing. The ultimate goal is to ask  the pertinent agency to improve the traffic signs in Spain.  Ponle Freno has already made significant progress through  similar initiatives, such as the putting traffic signs at dan- gerous spots on the roads; using funds obtained from traf- fic fines to carry out road safety initiatives; or approving  plan Vive to promote the replacement of school buses that  are over 10 years old. PONLE FRENO FOR SENIOR CITIZENS Along with motorcyclists and workers, in 2010 the Ponle  Freno campaign has focus on senior citizens, given that  this is one of the most vulnerable groups, both as pedes- trians and drivers.  Although it is true that older drivers have more experi- ence, it is also certain that older drivers driving abilities  diminish with age (sight, hearing or greater consumption  of medications that should not be taken when driving).  Therefore, the Ponle Freno campaign has focused on rais- ing awareness in Spain and amongst drivers about the  need to evaluate the deterioration in driving skills over  time. Within this context, Ponle Freno and the Democratic  pensioners Union have drawn up the first road safety  dos and donts for senior citizens. This project seeks to  encourage society to design, as far as possible, vehicles,  roads and traffic signs that are adapted to the needs of  older drivers so that they can continue to drive as long as  possible.  DrivinG DoS anD DontS 1. use your vehicle during the day, avoiding dawn and dusk. 2. Choose comfortable routes, using motorways while avoiding secondary roads or streets that are in bad shape. 3. Avoid long drives, or at least take frequent breaks. 4. If you are going to drive, eat small meals and do not drink alcohol. 5. Always bear in mind the possible effect that drugs can have on your ability to drive. 6. before taking a trip, make sure the seats are properly positioned to ensure a comfortable driving posture. 7. As far as possible, try to travel with someone.  8. Maintain your vehicle in optimum condition and obtain all mandatory revisions while ensuring all the safety related features are functioning properly, particularly the tires and lights.  9. Periodically have your sight and hearing checked, and if necessary, always wear your glasses (or hearing aid) when driving.  10. When walking, always cross where indicated and make sure that the vehicles stop before crossing, even at traffic lights and crosswalks.  ENJOY YOUR TRIP, A NEW PONLE FRENO  CAMPAIGN Coinciding with the summer vacations Operacin Salida,  Ponle Freno launched a new television, radio and Internet  campaign called Enjoy your trip. With this message, the  campaign seeks to encourage drivers to enjoy their trip  as the best way of starting their vacations. The campaign  was advertised on AntenA 3, neox, novA, ondA Cero and  europA FM. Viewers were able to participate by sending  photos, geographic and gastronomic recommendations to  Ponle Freno. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 88 corporate responsibility in antena 3 group: strategic view. antena 3 group index networks webs  PONLE FRENO S JOURNALISTIC  INvESTIGATION  Ponle Freno has wanted to enhance its activities by fil- ing news reports on the medical centres that issue health  certificates necessary to renew driver licenses. The report  sought to verify that all the centres had the personnel and  material required by law, and also check to see if these  centres were complying with the laws governing medical  certificates. The field work, which included the use of hid- den cameras on some occasions, involved 25 centres in  Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Valencia and Bilbao.  The conclusions, which were published in the first Techni- cal Report written by Ponle Freno, shows serious failures  to comply with the pertinent laws and in each case at least  one serious error was made in management, which would  prevent granting a medical certificate or, at least, it would  imply limitations that should be duly noted in a document.  Ponle Freno sent this Technical Report to the Congres- sional Road Safety Commission so that measures can be  taken to correct the infractions found in the investigation. HITTING THE STREETS BEFORE  EASTER HOLIdAY  Days before the easter holiday, Ponle Freno launched an  awareness campaign on television and radio under the  slogan This Easter, we want just one number: 0 fatalities. The campaign was carried out at various traffic lights  in Madrid and Barcelona, where the lords of ponle  Freno, mimes do short performances at strategic loca- tions related to driving advice focused on three aspects:  speed, using cell phones and safety belts. This initiative  also entailed handing out 18,000 Ponle Freno stickers.  SPANISH TOUR dE FRANCE CHAMPIONS,  SUPPORTING PONLE FRENO In 2010 Alberto	Contador, Carlos	Sastre, scar	Pereiro,  Miguel	 Indurin, Pedro	 Delgado and Federico	 Martn	 Bahamontes, Spanish Tour de France winners, became  Ponle Freno ambassadors, as they acted in six announce- ments broadcast on AntenA 3, neox and novA for this  campaign. The messages, which were aimed at both  cyclists and drivers alike, dealt with tail-gaiting, cyclists  riding side-by-side, using a helmet, wearing the proper  clothes, children cyclists and being patient with cyclists  going uphill. antEna 3 GroUP rEnEWS commitmEnt to tHE EUroPEan roaD SaFEtY cHartEr For the second year in a row, the Antena 3 Group has renewed its commitment to the European Road Safety Charter.

PONLE FRENO JUNIOR Ponle Frenos initiatives aimed at children, the driver of  tomorrow, seek to raise awareness amongst this segment  of society about the importance of prevention and training  in improving road safety. All of Ponle Freno Juniors activi- ties are channelled through the AntenA 3 FoundAtion.   In 2010, they carried out the following activities: 	 Reflector	workshop,	get	noticed. The objective of this  workshop, held in Micropolix, was to inform partici- pants of wearing reflectors and bright clothing so  they can be seen in the dark. Madrid and Getafe held  another two workshops on this subject. In total, more  than 12,000 children participated in these events.  	 Activities	with	simulators. The AntenA 3 FoundAtion car  and motorcycle simulators, with the support of spe- cialized monitors, are used to give tainting courses to  children and young people. In 2010 several courses  were given in Cabezn de la Sal, lorca and legans.  	 Ponle	Freno	Road	Safety	Contest. The AntenA 3 Foun- dAtion held, with students in Murcia, the first Ponle  Freno Road Safety Contest. This initiative, in collabo- ration with the Mapfre Foundation and the Murcia  public Works Agency, invited all the regions educa- tional centres to send in advice on road safety either  through a video or radio announcement. The contest  had a threefold objective: raise awareness amongst  young people, enjoy teamwork and introduce them  to new technologies. The contest consisted of two  categories: Best road safety message for television  and Best road safety message for radio. 2,400 chil- dren and 35 educational centres participated in this  initiative, and 96 videos and 12 radio announcements  were submitted.

This commitment also includes out own practices in terms of advertising, as  related to broadcasting standards related to environment.    AntenA 3 takes into consideration all national and international environmental  initiatives that may arise in this regard, and will add these to our own standard  practices as related to broadcasting environmental subjects. energy efficiency and climate change    We undertake to use the most modern and efficient technologies in the design  of installations and activities in order to reduce our energy consumption and the  emission of greenhouse gases.    We will use the companys electronic systems to avoid unnecessary transportation  thereby savings energy resources (fuel etc), which will in turn reduce the associ- ated emissions. efficient use of resources    We commit to using the procedures necessary to optimize the consumption of  resources within the organization.    We undertake to take advantage of the most used resources in our business until  the end of its useful life (toner, cell phones, electronic or computer equipment,  etc), while making it a priority to acquire the materials that make it easier for use  to meet this objective. Generation of waste and toxic substances     We will use all these means at our disposal to avoid contaminating our surround- ings.     Minimize the generation of waste by reusing means and materials, while making  the resources necessary available to our employees.    Promote recycling by installing containers and compactors at our work centres in  order to facilitate the proper separation of and treatment of recyclable materials.  In the event this cannot be done on the premises, the group will facilitate the  separation of waste and its subsequent treatment by authorized companies.   spreading the word    We undertake to inform our associated groups, and particularly our employees  about our environmental protection policy, raising their awareness about recycling  and energy savings.    We will make sure that all the companys goods and service providers know and  comply with our environmental protection policy, especially when carrying out  activities around our work centres.     Inform the public of our environmental protection policy, while trying to involve  and raise the awareness of each citizen as to the important role they play in  meeting this challenge.    We seek to contribute, in line with our corporate responsibility policy, to environ- mentally stable development by broadcasting this commitment over its various  media in order to raise the publics awareness of the importance of protecting the  environment.  The operating Management Committee is responsible for  ensuring the Group complies with the environmental pro- tection policy. Its actions are focused on promoting the  efficient use of resources, implementing the most efficient  technologies and raising awareness through the AntenA3  Groups various media.  At the same time, the AntenA 3 Group continues to  develop its environmental prevention and action strategy,  which includes initiatives that go beyond regulatory com- pliance, in line with its Corporate Responsibility plan.

Comply with regulations in force. Train employees and raise their environmental awareness. Improve the air quality of facilities by cleaning and replacing filters, using non- contaminating materials in construction, measure emissions and redistribute the aid  diffusers to optimize the air quality inside the facilities.

In 2010 173 units of technical audio, video and lighting  equipment was reused.  The AntenA 3 Groups activities have a low environmental  impact and do not consume a great deal of resources,  which means that the risk implied by changes in environ- mental protection regulations or commodity costs, among  other possibilities, is low.  We should point out that in 2010 the AntenA 3 Group was  not sanctioned for failing to comply with environmental  protection regulations.  As part of the Master plan approved in 2009, the  AntenA3 Group has revised the frequency with which all  the companys environmental indicators are analyzed and  collected. Although each indicator has its own particu- lar characteristics- some can only be monitored annually,  such as electrical installations, for example- other indi- cators can be tracked more frequently: monthly in the  case of paper, toner, electricity and gas consumption,  etc.; every two months in the case of water; or every four  months for fluorescent bulbs. once the data has been  compiled, they are centrally consolidated, in other words,  those coming from the companys headquarters in San  Sebastin de los Reyes. The consolidation of the other  data, although it was considered initially, was rejected  given that the opportunity cost did not justify the data,  given that the headquarters data accounts for around  90% of the Group total.

EFFICIENT USE OF MATERIALS In 2010, the company has remained committed to its  environmental principles, and has continued to focus on  reducing its consumption of office materials and improv- ing its energy efficiency by using higher-performing equip- ment.  We should point out the lower consumption of white  paper and toner due to the campaigns to raise awareness  amongst employees. nevertheless, construction work car- ried out on the news set has led to a significant increase  in the use of dropped ceilings and technical floors, despite  attempts to reuse materials whenever possible.  antEna 3 GroUP matErialS  conSUmPtion 2008 2009 2010 White paper (units)  7,250,000 7,165,000 6,595,000 Toner and printing cartridges (units)  925 901 886 White envelopes (units)  29,750 29,550 29,500 Fluorescent lights (units)  1,018 1,580 1,673 Drop ceilings (m2)  603 395.52 1,495.41 Raised flooring (m2)  497 300.78 1,826.83 Partitions (m2)  57.63 18.75 161.94 Shelves (m)  900 415 0 WASTE MANAGEMENT The AntenA 3 Group uses a Waste Management System  whose main objective is to reduce the use of raw mate- rials, reuse materials and classify and reuse the waste  produced, by delegating its treatment to authorized  external agents who guarantee said waste will be cor- rectly sorted and treated.  As regards 2010, we should point out the Sharp  reduction in the number of batteries thrown out due  to cutting-edge equipment being used by the com- pany; the acquisition of this equipment was made  a considerably higher cost than in previous years.  likewise, we highlight the solid urban waste genera- tion data, which fell 3.3% and the 7.1% increase  in paper, cardboard and waste collected and recy- cled.

Diesel oil consumption  increased by nearly 23%, due to increased production and the average drop in winter temperature compared to previous  years, which has led to greater use of heating.  As regards energy sources, the data provided by Iberdrola, the Groups electricity provider, indicates that 65% of our  energy consumption comes from renewable sources. antEna 3 GroUP EnErGY conSUmPtion 2008 2009 2010 Gas (m3) 13,441 13,064 12,442 Diesel oil (litres) 563,991 423,861 520,878 Electricity (Kwh) 19,584,752 19,534,953 19,716,406 inDi- rEct  EnErGY % 2008 % 2009 % 2010 non- rEnEW- aBlE rEnEW- aBlE non- rEnEW- aBlE rEnEW- aBlE non- rEnEW- aBlE rEnEW- aBlE 0% 100% 10% 90% 35% 65% ENvIRONMENTAL INITIATIvES  ANd CHALLENGES In 2010, the Group has undertaken various initiatives  to improve energy efficiency and the efficient use of  resources, such as the following: 	 Implementation of leD lighting to replace the existing  halogen bulbs in 17% of the Groups facilities. More  than 90% of the lighting consisted of low consump- tion with electronic ballast, which is more efficient.  however, the leD lighting is more efficient and long- lasting than low-consumption lighting. 	 The preventive maintenance period for boilers was  extended, which improve its performance and  reduces the emissions and incidents. 	 The refrigerating gas in the air conditions was  replaced with environmentally-friendly in 25% of the  Groups facilities.  	 Solid urban waste was reduced 2% and recycled  paper and cardboard also rose 2%.  [  65% of the energy  consumed in 2010  comes from renewable  sources.  ] annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 94 corporate responsibility in antena 3 group: strategic view. antena 3 group index networks webs  	 Two compact container systems (one for solid urban  waste and another for cardboard) which reduces the  number of trips to the dump, which lowers fuel con- sumption and improves cleanliness given that these  are sealed containers. 	 Replacement of communications equipment that  use disposable batteries for equipment that uses  rechargeable batteries.  	 A study was conducted to change the lighting used  on the AntenA 3 television news set, which has  led to the design of a new system based on low- consumption leD and fluorescent projectors, without  affecting the quality of the image. The installation of  the new lighting system will save 23,500 KWh per  year.  	 The Group launched environmental directives aimed  at raising employee awareness about more sustain- able work habits.  	 Restricted use of colour photocopiers and mapping.  The AntenA 3 Groups environmental challenges for 2011  are:  	 Continue to use environmentally friendly gas in the  companys air-conditioning systems.  	 Continued installation of leD lighting instead of halo- gen. 	 Begin to install automated lighting in corporate build- ings, specifically, adjustable lighting in offices, which  will improve work conditions and favour the efficient  consumption of resources. 	 Start process to implement eco-control equipment  in pCs, screens and technical equipment, program- ming the turn-off and start times and ordering the  protocols for closing files and programs, thereby  reducing energy consumption and increasing equip- ment efficiency. 	 Continue with policy of using railway transportation  instead of air.  	 Reduce the amount of waste sent to the dump by at  least 1%, and increase the amount of paper and card- board that is recycled by 1%. 	 Replace incandescent lighting on news sets with low- consumption projectors.  	 For 2011, the Group wants to conduct a study on the  possibility of installing a small solar-thermal plant in  order to save heating fuel ElEctricitY SavinG initiativES Control room temperature in summer and winter (2C).

Inform personnel about importance of unplugging electronic and lighting  equipment.  Carry out initiatives underway in 2010.  WATER CONSUMPTION ANd WASTE The water the AntenA 3 Group consumes comes  exclusively from the Isabel II Channel. After using  water, it is drained into the public sewer system,  where it is treated and purified with the rest of the  public water. however, in order to ensure the maxi- mum control and compliance, a company author- ized by the Ministry of Industry monitors and ana- lyzes the water the company send to the sewer,  which ensures that said water is not toxic.  Although apparently, water consumption increased  compared to 2009, we should point out that the  water bill for 2010 included a total of 406 days,  while 2009s bill was for 345. Taking into account  this circumstance, our water consumption held flat  compared to previous years.  The AntenA 3 Groups environmental policy entails  continuously setting up initiatives to control and  reduce water consumption. Amongst other ideas,  we highlight the following:  	 Replacement of obsolete equipment that entail  excessively high water consumption.  	 Improve and extend preventive maintenance  protocol. 	 Get employees involved in reducing water consump- tion through awareness campaigns.  The objective for the next few years is to rigorously control  our water consumption, even though this is largely contin- gent upon summer weather conditions, as large amounts  of water are used to water the green spaces. 6.5.3 STOPPING CLIMATE CHANGE The initiatives aimed at improving energy efficiency have  an impact on reducing greenhouse gases. Apart from  these actions, the AntenA 3 Group makes an effort to stop  climate change, which can be seen our 2010 consump- tion levels. The Group made a significant reduction in its greenhouse  gases in 2010, which can be explained, apart from the  aforementioned consumption reduction measures, by  lowering the number of hours of use and/or a change in  the average rate of emission, which are the two factors  used to obtain emissions data. This data is compiled by  the national Regulatory Inspection and Control Regula- tions Board (oCA) ATISAe.  As regards the emission of substances that destroy the  ozone layer, none of the AntenA 3 Groups facilities has  emitted any these substances as no breakdowns or inci- dents occurred in the air-conditioning equipment, which  are those that contain Freon 22 (ozone-destroying gas) in  its closed circuits.  In this regard, regulations demand the complete replace- ment of Freon 22 gas by 2015; however, the company  has proceeded to replace 18 air conditioners and four  coolers that contain this gas, within the framework of the  companys environmental policy.  As regards the emissions noX, SoX and Co, these have  declined compared to previous years, and are extremely  wAter consuMption AntenA 3 Group (M3) 2008 2009 2010 50,770 49,371 52,499 AntenA 3 Group Gei eMissions (in tons oF co2) 2008 2009 2010 4,379.73 4,316.32 2,095.06 annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 96 corporate responsibility in antena 3 group: strategic view. antena 3 group index networks webs  low.

The companys offices are located on urban  land (industrial park) and complies with urban planning in  force. likewise, its location does not have any impact on  currently protected species.  In any case, in order to assess the risks that the Groups  activities may have on biodiversity, The operating Man- agement Committee continues to carry out the following  tasks: 	 Management and control of compliance with environ- mental regulations. 	 periodical inspections by internal and authorized  external agents. 	 Waste management control. 	 Management of waste by authorized external agents.  Given the urban nature of the Groups facilities and the  companys activities, in 2010 none of its land has been  restored or recovered. however, we should mention that  the companys main headquarters in San Sebastin de los  Reyes (Madrid) has a green surface of around 9,000 m2,  for which it uses the most modern technologies to reduce  its water consumption. initiativES aimED rEDUcinG travEl  Foment the use of on-line connection systems with private e-mail , which increased 28% compared to the previous year.

In  this regard, we highlight Hazte Eco, an initiative promoted  by the neox channel, which aims to make the environment  the cornerstone of its Corporate Responsibility action  plan, by raising awareness about the need to respect the  environment. This first action was to sign a partnership  with Greenpeace to set up a new news program dedicated  to environmental content, which was broadcast between  September and December 2010. Furthermore, a specific webpage was set up with envi- ronmental news, reports and advice, which includes a  section where audiences can actively participate in the  campaign by sending messages or complaints about envi- ronmental crimes.  Internally, within the companys Corporate Responsibility  Director plan, it has drawn up a sustainable environmental  dos and donts that is expected to be handed to employ- ees in 2011. We should point out that all the employees  have access to a space on the Groups intranet where they  can express their ideas and concerns about protecting the  environment. 6.5.6 ENvIRONMENTAL EXPENSES  ANd INvESTMENTS The investments and expenses related to protecting the  environment allow the AntenA 3 Group to show its com- mitment in this area. In 2010, the company has spent  a total of 105,300 euros on environmental investments,  which have been aimed at gradually improving the facili- ties, preventive maintenance and regulatory compliance.  Specifically, the following actions were taken:  	 Improve the insulation and water-proofing of various  Group facilities (Texas warehouse, Set 7 and Set 1).  	 Replace air-conditioning equipment with machines  that use environmental-friendly gas. 	 Renew the heat exchanger in the boiler room of the  main headquarters. 	 purchase of conference call equipment. 	 Installation of solar control film.  	 Replacement of aluminium carpentry with climalit. environMentAl investMent At AntenA 3   (in thousAnds oF euros) 2008 2009 2010 93,27 80,53 105,30 lastly, in 2010 the environmental expenses totalled  39,200 euros, and were mainly used to:  	 Maintain the boilers.

When following good practices in terms of corporate govern- ance, AntenA 3 televisin uses the Recommendations	of	the	Uni- fied	Code	of	corporate	Governance as a reference.  In accordance with the principle of complying or explaining, the  company annually prepares its Corporate Governance report, in  which it details the partial or total compliance, or failure to com- ply with these recommendations, while justifying the reasons. In this regard, we should point out that in June 2010 the Spanish  securities market regulator (CnMV) published the conclusions  of the Task Force on the Internal Control of Financial Reporting.  corporate governance. AntenA 3 Group is working with a prestigious consulting com- pany that is advising the company on an action plan to imple- ment the measures necessary to adjust its Internal Control on  Financial Reporting to the model established by the CnMV.  Furthermore, since 2003 AntenA 3 televisin has an Internal  Code	of	Conduct	related	to	securities	markets, which concerns the  obligations and procedures that employees must follow, given  that they have access to information that is relevant to the com- panys stock performance. This regulation governs, among other  matters, actions related to handling confidential and relevant  information, the companys treasury stock scheme and conflicts  of interest. This can be consulted on the Spanish Securities Mar- ket Commissions website (CnMV) and the AntenA 3 Groups  website, and has been recognized and accepted by all of the  companys employees who must comply with these rules. The  Internal Audit Board, or, failing that, the Financial Department, is  responsible for supervising compliance with the responsibilities  and procedures established in the Code of Conduct.  AntenA 3 televisin has a Regulatory	Compliance	Committee,  which is comprised as follows: the Secretary of the Board of  Directors (who chairs this Committee), the CFo, the head of  legal Services, the head of human Resources and the head of  Internal Auditing. likewise, it has a Regulatory	Compliance	Unit,  annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 99 corporate governance. antena 3 group index networks webs  which answers to the Secretary of the Board, whose main  functions are to ensure that securities market codes of  conduct are followed and guarantee the veracity and thor- oughness of the company information sent to the CnMV  and the markets. Furthermore, the company has a specific computer sys- tem designed to apply and track this regulation, which is  called SRC	(System	to	apply	the	Internal	Code	of	conduct	 in	matters	related	to	securities	markets), which enables the  flow of information between the people affected and the  pertinent bodies so that compliance can be monitored,  which makes it easier to track data flows and save histori- cal data.  COMMITTEd TO TRANSPARENCY Since 2003, the AntenA 3 Group has a corporate website  (www.grupoantena3.com) that provides, under Sharehold- ers and Investors, all the relevant information published  on the CnMV website along with other documents that  the company believes are important for shareholders and  investors. This is the companys response to the rewritten  text of the Joint-stock Company law (lSC in Spanish acro- nym) which, since September 2010, forces listed com- panies to comply with information requirements by any  technical, computer, data communication means, without  detriment to shareholders rights to request information  in writing; listed companies must also have a website to  ensure the right of shareholders to have access to relevant  information as required by securities market law. Article 582.2 of the lSC also forces companies to enable  an online forum on websites for General Shareholders  Meetings so that shareholders can publish the propos- als they wish to submit as a complement to the agenda  announced; vote on said proposals; promote initiatives to  reach a sufficient percentage to exercise a minority right;  and make offers or requests for voluntary representation.  Along the same lines, AntenA 3 televisin, as a member  of the Spanish Broadcaster Association, has helped draw  up a series of rules for the aforementioned online forums.  For its next GSM, the AntenA 3 Group plans to enable this  new tool. Finally, in 2010 the Group has published, through filings  submitted to the CnMV, the pertinent information, such  as financial information, scheduled shareholder meetings  and GSM agreements, Board of Directors agreements,  presentations for analysts and investors, etc. 7.2 CORPORATE GOvERNANCE  MOdEL FOR ANTENA 3 dE  TELEvISIN S.A. boArds coMMittees boArd oF directors GenerAl shAreholders MeetinG MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE CEO CHAIRMAN MISSION VISION GSM RuLES bY-LAWS bOARDS REGuLATION INSTITuTIONAL PRINCIPLES GENERAL SHAREHOLdERS MEETING The General Shareholders Meeting is the highest repre- sentative body as related to share capital in Antena 3 Tel- evision S.A.

The scope of the report on the activities of the AntenA  3 Group (AntenA 3 televisin, ondA Cero, europA FM,  AntenA 3 FilMs, Atres AdvertisinG, AntenA 3 FoundA- tion) have been clearly defined, with priority given to  information that is considered material, including all the  significant events that took place in 2010, without omit- ting information that may be relevant for the Companys  stakeholders.  In the event that there are modifications to the scope and  coverage of the information, these must be indicated. The  environmental indicators mentioned in this report only  refer to the AntenA 3 Groups main headquarters in San  Sebastin de los Reyes given that 90% of its activity is  conducted there. PRINCIPLES FOR dEFINING QUALITY  OF 2009 ANNUAL REPORT The principles required by GRI were also taken into  account when defining the quality of information: Balance The report should reflect positive and negative aspects  of the organizations performance to enable a reasoned  assessment of overall performance. The report should include both favourable and unfavoura- ble results, with the aim of providing an unbiased account  and allowing the stakeholders to carry out a reasonable  assessment of the Companys performance. comparability Issues and information should be selected, compiled,  and reported consistently. Reported information should be  presented in a manner that enables stakeholders to ana- lyze changes in the organizations performance over time,  and could support analysis relative to other organizations. To the degree possible, information must be organised in  such a way that the stakeholders can assess the changes  undergone in AntenA 3 Group with respect to previous  years. accuracy The reported information should be sufficiently accu- rate and detailed for stakeholders to assess the reporting  organizations performance. The Report contains numerous tables, charts and graphs,  with the aim of making it easier to understand. The infor- mation herein is intended to be clear and precise to allow  for an assessment of AntenA 3 Groups performance. Fur- thermore, to the extent possible, it seeks to avoid using  technical terms whose meaning may not be known to  stakeholders.  reliability Information and processes used in the preparation of a  report should be gathered, recorded, compiled, analysed,  and disclosed in a way that could be subject to examina- tion and that establishes the quality and materiality of the  information. The reliability of the data contained in this report was  checked by AenoR, the firm which carried out the verifi- cation of the 2008 Corporate Responsibility Report. timeliness Reporting occurs on a regular schedule and informa- tion is available in time for stakeholders to make informed  decisions. AntenA 3 Group is committed to reporting annually on its  performance in the sphere of Corporate Responsibility.

RISK CONTROL ANd MANAGEMENT AntenA 3 risk management model is tool used to support the Companys manage- ment team when taking decisions in an uncertain environment. This model consists  of eight interrelated components, which assesses the risk levels assigned to each  process and strategic target.

Internal code of conduct for securities markets. 	 procedures related to purchase of products and ser- vices. 	 procedures related to negotiating and selling advertis- ing. 	 Corporate IT systems: sales management system,  purchasing management system and contract pro- posal management system. The Groups risk management systems and internal con- trols work adequately and nothing occurred in 2009 that  could have compromised the companys or the employ- ees integrity. INTERNAL COdE OF CONdUCT As a publicly-quoted company, AntenA 3 televisin  has Internal Code of Conduct related to securities mar- kets, which concerns the obligations and procedures that  employees must follow, given that they have access to  information that is relevant to the companys stock perfor- mance. Specifically, these rules govern: 	 Actions related to handling confidential and relevant  information. 	 The companys treasury stock. 	 Conflicts of interests; meaning any situation that  could involve (regarding some action related to the  securities market), an employees personal interests,  affected by the Internal Code of Conduct, that clash  with the companys, thereby compromising their  impartiality. The companys Internal Code of Conduct is available on  the CnMVs website and the Groups website and has  been read and accepted by all the relevant employees.  The AntenA 3 Group also has an IT system linked to the  application of this Code called SRC (System for enforc- ing the Internal Code of Conduct regarding the securities  markets), which is available in the Intranet (a3net). The  system allows for a smooth flow of information between  the affected parties and the pertinent ad hoc bodies that  supervise compliance. This application guarantees con- fidentiality and is only available to those included in the  application of the Code.  From an organisational point of view, the Internal Audit  Board, or, failing that, the Financial Department, is respon- sible for supervising compliance with the responsibilities  and procedures established in the Code of Conduct.  GUARANTEEd QUALITY FOR THE AUdIENCE  The AntenA 3 Groups control over its programming and  advertising goes beyond selecting and supervising the  contents it broadcasts. The use of new technologies to  inform and entertain widens the scope of the Groups  responsibility vis  vis its audiences, which forces it to  implement mechanisms and procedures to prevent any  negative impact on the users. Audiovisual communications services are regulated by the  Audiovisual Communications law (lGCA), and which are  understood to be those whose editorial responsibility is  that of a service provider that offers programs or con- tents via Internet in order to inform, entertain or educate  RISKS RELATED TO OPERATION AND  PROCESSES OPERATING RISKS TECHNOLOGICAL RISKS INTEGRITY RISKS FINANCIAL RISKS MANAGEMENT RISKS INFORMATION RISKS IN DECISION- MAKING OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL STRATEGIC RISKS RELATED TO STRATEGY RISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE type oF risk RISKS RELATED TO INTERNAL  PROCESSES annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 107 annex. antena 3 group index networks webs  the public in general, as well as broadcast commercial  content. This most noteworthy aspect of this law is that  which extends the application of many regulations, which  up to now were exclusively applied to public television,  to all commercial audiovisual communications and radio,  regardless of the technology used and whether or not they  are linear services.  Therefore, the AntenA 3 Group verifies the compliance of  the pertinent laws, both in terms of content and advertis- ing, whether or not they are applicable to all operators, or  as related to the self-regulating code of best professional  practices signed by the Group. EXHAUSTIvE CONTENT CONTROL The AntenA 3 Group controls its content  by supervising  the entire product creation process: from the selection or  creation of content (verifying information, while ensuring  that it complies with ratings in terms of age, making it  accessible to disabled users, etc.), setting up a program- ming schedule (respecting protected time slots, time lim- its and advertising breaks, rules during election periods,  etc.) up to its broadcast (verifying that all audiovisual and  acoustic regulations are followed on TV broadcast, inform- ing viewers about programming in due time, etc). The Group has established the internal processes nec- essary to allow the agents involved in this control to ver- ify that all content complies with pertinent regulation.  likewise, the company has been providing additional  instruments to guarantee that the Group complies with  regulations, amongst which its compliance with the Self- Regulation of Childrens Content stands out.  As regards the Groups website, all of the users con- tributions are previously monitored. In this regard, the  AntenA3 Group has a mechanism by which it can imme- diately eliminate opinions and messages that contravene  the self-imposed regulations and, or those that could put  users safety or health at risk.  Finally, the AntenA 3 Group allows its users to easily report  any irregularities immediately via the following webpage:  webmaster@Antena3.es, through which users can report  errors or abuses, while the company can also control the  content of its broadcast. PERSONAL dATA PROTECTION After the Spanish personal Data protection law went into  effect in 1999, the AntenA 3 Group incorporated com- puter tools and other methods that enable it to effectively  comply with said law, thereby guaranteeing the protection  of the personal data managed by the Group, especially  the most confidential data, such as the information held  by the companys human resources department. All the  initiatives directly related to this subject are closely studied  by the Computer Safety and legal Departments, which  ensure they meet current regulations.  The AntenA 3 Group uses a computer model that guaran- tees that the activities carried out by the company or any  of its subsidiaries meet current law governing personal  data protection. This model includes all the Groups exter- nal providers: security, companies that produce shows,  technology operators, medical services, etc.  The Security Committee, comprised of representatives of  Systems, legal Services, human Resources and Inter- nal Audit, is in charge of the AntenA 3 Groups computer  security. Its main functions are coordinating and moni- toring the Groups objectives in order to comply with the  security measures required by The Security Measures  law 15/1999, the personal Data protection law, and the  law in general. other functions include supervising the  application of general regulations and internal procedures,  in collaboration with the human Resources department,  aimed at pertinent personnel, in order to incorporate  security measures into daily work activity.  likewise, in order to guarantee that all the companys legal  obligations are met in terms of personal data protection,  some of the Groups companies will be audited annually,  which will also enable the company to continuously track  its computer safety model. In 2010, apart from the audits  conducted–all of which showed satisfactory results-, sev- eral files have been adapted to carry out new services or  projects undertaken as securely as possible in terms of  data protection, in particular AntenA 3 FoundAtions soli- darity campaigns and projects. annual and corporate responsibility report 2010 _ 108 annex. antena 3 group index networks webs  ANNEX 4.
