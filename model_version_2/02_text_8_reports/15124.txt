The group has always prioritized innovation and a long-term  approach, and is currently diversifying its businesses and geographical locations. Its vegetables,  grown over an area of more than 95,000 hectares, are sold in 80 countries in all forms,  under all types of brands, through all distribution channels and using all available technologies:  canned, frozen, pasteurized, dried, fresh/ready-to-use.  The groups key strategic aims encompass sustainability, independence, and the individual  development of the women and men who work to fulfill Bonduelles goal of making vegetables  the future of food. 31  million  euros 81  million  euros 1, 726  million  euros in net income in current operating income in revenue Providing the best  of vegetables 01 Annual report 2010-2011  365 days/year                                                     The subtropical climate of the high  plateaus of central Brazil means that  vegetables can be grown all year round.  BRAZIL / October 20, 2010 â€“ Inauguration of the Bonduelle Groups  rst Brazilian plant,  located at Cristalina in the state of Gois. 02 Annual report 2010-2011  Governador Marconi Perillo, Governor of the state of Gois Brazil Our group  International  scope The Bonduelle plant in Cristalina, Brazil, is a perfect example  of a win-win agreement, based on trust. Cristalina is located in an area  with strong agricultural potential and the capacity to meet the rapidly  growing demand in the region. As Governor of the state of Gois,  I am delighted to welcome Bonduelle, an internationally-recognized  brand with a history spanning 150 years. I am convinced that Bonduelle  will become an important creator of jobs and a major source of wealth  for our state.                                 Our group Message from the  Executive Management The 2010-2011 financial year was a particularly busy year for the Bonduelle Group  on all fronts. After posting substantial sales growth (+10.7%), and net income in line  with forecasts (albeit at a lower level versus the previous year), it has re-established  sound foundations for 2011-2012. Margin pressures  in 2010-2011 In spring 2010, there was a signifi- cant oversupply of canned and fro- zen  vegetables worldwide, and it  became necessary to make deep  cuts to prices and production plans  in order to reduce stock levels. Unfortunately, after this action was  taken, high temperatures in north- ern France and Russia and floods in Hungary had a cata- strophic effect on harvests.  As a consequence of the poor 2010 harvests, the groups  production facilities were underused, leading to a sharp  rise in production costs, and in certain cases, insufficient  produce led to shortages in spring 2011, while contracted  selling prices were falling! The combination of these two factors therefore squeezed  margins, reducing profitability in 2010-2011. However,  this unfortunate series of events has led to improve- ments for 2011-2012. Investments and restructuring Faced with the need to improve the groups long-term  competitiveness and secure its future, the decision was  made to close two plants, even though this meant posting  considerable non-recurring items in 2010-2011 (11.7 mil- lion euros). The first plant concerned was the Westmeerbeek facility in  Belgium. This plant had not reached critical size and would  require significant investment, par- ticularly as regards waste water treat- ment. Moreover, the production  carried out there could be relocated to  the groups French facilities without  the need for additional investment. The second case concerned south- west France, where it was possible  for the production of three plants  to be carried out at two facilities  instead, but with no job losses. The  closure of the Saint-Sever plant will lead to substantial  savings in general and administrative expenses in 2011- 2012. All the staff have been transferred to the Bordres  plant, which is 19 km from Saint-Sever. As for investments, this year saw the inauguration of  three major facilities:  the construction of the Cristalina plant in Brazil was  completed in September 2010.  Its first year of opera- tions has confirmed that the plant can carry out produc- tion on a non-seasonal basis. This represents a new  business model with advantages in terms of capital  employed, and which will enable the group to capture  the heart of the large Brazilian market going forward;  the start-up of operations at the new plant in San Paolo  dArgon (Italy) took place in spring 2011, following a fire  in 2008. This ultra-modern plant is currently Europes  biggest facility producing fresh-cut salads;  the construction of a large-scale fully-automated cold  room in Estres (France) for frozen vegetable storage  Daniel Vielfaure,  Chief Executive Officer Christophe Bonduelle,  Chairman 04 Annual report 2010-2011  and order preparation was completed. This investment  should lead to considerable maintenance savings from  2011-2012. Bonduelle enters  the mushroom business Following the acquisition of France Champignon in April  2010, the group has expanded its range of activities to  include the mushroom business. 2010-2011 was therefore a year of integration for the  mushroom business, which, with its 1,300 employees  and sales of 170 million euros, represents growth of  almost 8% for the group. The integration naturally involved a lot of changes, nota- bly the closure of the Beaufort en Valle plant, the sig- nificant restructuring of the Bagneux (Saumur) head  office (relocation of administration and sales to the  groups networks), and the implementation of a major  overhaul of agricultural production (50% integrated)  following the development of a mechanized mushroom  picking process, which promises to be highly effective.  All these changes, which were unavoidably painful in  terms of job losses, but essential to securing the com- petitiveness of the mushroom activity, were carried out  with a focus on transparency and fairness. Joint venture with Ardo in Spain Spain has probably been the European country most  severely affected by the economic crisis since 2008. Con- sumption, particularly of Spanish brands, has fallen, and  manufacturers have embarked on a price war in order  to preserve their sales volumes. This situation has led to unsustainable reductions in sell- ing prices. As a result, the Bonduelle Group sold its Frudesa and Salto  brands to Findus, thereby removing a source of recurrent  losses, and transferred its Benimodo plant to the agro- industrial joint venture (50/50) entered into with Ardo,  which has contributed its logistics center in Marcilla. This venture, established in Spain in June 2011 by  Europes two leading producers of frozen vegetables, has  a supply contract with Findus as well as access to the  European sales networks of the Ardo and Bonduelle  groups. The future of these sites, which have been  returned to competitiveness through the implementa- tion of production plans that make effective use of their  capacity, should now be secure. Exchange rates While the depreciation of the euro against a large number  of currencies contributed 2.4% to growth in consolidated  results in euros, the considerable appreciation of the  Canadian dollar against the US dollar is likely to have the  most significant impact on the groups competi tiveness. Around one-third of North American revenue is gener- ated in the USA from products made in Canadian plants. However, the group has been able to offset these unfavora- ble one-off effects with savings on production and structural  costs, thereby preserving profitability in North America.  These improvements should benefit the group consider- ably if exchange rates return to a more normal level. Lastly, the prudent exchange rate hedging policy adopted  by the group led to an improvement in net finance  income of 2.7 million euros. Outlook The Bonduelle Group has improved its position after a  very difficult year in 2010-2011.  Throughout its history, it has never prioritized short- term profit over its long-term vision by delaying costly  but necessary decisions or major agro-industrial or R&D  investment (the success of the new steamed ranges of  canned and frozen vegetables demonstrates the validity  of this policy). Similarly, the group has not compromised its sustainable  development strategy, especially as the investments  involved   should be profitable in the long term. The group is therefore confident that 2011-2012 will   represent a return to normal, with a significant improve- ment in profitability. The Bonduelle Group  has improved  its position after  a very dif cult year  in 2010-2011.  05 Annual report 2010-2011  The vegetable specialist GROUP DEPARTMENTS  Finance  Human Resources  Corporate Communication and Marketing  Information Systems                  PRODUCTION SITES EUROPEAN AREA (1) Plant closed in 2010-2011 (2) In association with the France Champignon co-operative.

It  awarded a first round of grants following its Appeal for  Proposals, an international program that funds community  projects, all of which are aimed at promoting healthy eating  habits in the target populations. Completion of three major  projects reflecting our  sustainable development policy This year, the Bonduelle Group opened two new plants  representing the crystallization of all its technological and  environmental know-how. The groups first Brazilian plant,  located in Cristalina, will operate year-round, producing  50,000 metric tons of canned peas and sweet corn.  This facility, which complies with strict environmental  criteria, has a wood-fuelled boiler system.  In Italy, the new plant at San Paolo dArgon was designed  in accordance with the principles of the Usine Sobre  (Frugal factory) project, prioritizing optimal transportation  flows and energy efficiency. It is the largest bagged  green salad plant in Europe, with a production capacity  of 20,000 metric tons. In addition, the Estres site in France now has a large-scale  cold room for automated storage of frozen products.  This facility represents both a reduction in the movement  of products to other storage sites and lower energy  consumption compared with a conventional cold room,  with a total of 500 tons equivalent CO2 saved every year. Usine Sobre (Frugal factory) This project was set up to estimate the ideal level of energy  consumption for the various production processes.  This means finding the minimum energy requirement  by reviewing all the processes involved in the production  and storage of vegetables, and the related energy needs.  The project looks at energy quality as well as quantity.  Three sites are participating in the test study:  Vaulx-Vraucourt (Pas de Calais) for canned products,  St Mihiel (Meuse) for fresh-cut products, and Bordres  (Landes) for canned and frozen products. Appointment On January 1, 2011,  Daniel Vielfaure, a Canadian  national, took up his new post  as Chief Executive Officer  of the Bonduelle Group. He had  previously been Deputy Chief  Executive Officer, since  August 2009. The Cristalina plant,  the groups first  production site in Brazil. The new plant  at San Paolo dArgon,  in Italy. 16 Annual report 2010-2011  Successful  integration The 2010-2011  financial year saw  the successful integration of the mushroom  business into the group. The support functions  were integrated into the group and the sale of  mushrooms is now carried out by its networks  in the various countries. The products  previously sold under the Royal Champignon  and Abra brands are now available under  the Bonduelle brand. La Tourte (Maine-et-Loire), in France.  This site uses mechanical  cutting processes. On the fresh counter Bonduelle Frais International has  launched a new Bio range of organic  bagged salads onto the French market  with corn salad and oak leaf lettuce  currently available. They are produced  using organic farming methods  and packaged in oxo-biodegradable  plastic bags.  Bonduelle Traiteur International  also has two new products: the Box (hot)  and Cup (cold) ranges, which represent  the equivalent of a complete  and balanced vegetable-based meal. In frozen foods, Bonduelle North America  has expanded its Select range sold under  the Arctic Gardens brand, with nine new  products including extra-fine green  beans. This new product, which is very  popular on the American continent, has  been produced locally by Bonduelle  since 2008-2009, and opens up a new  market segment for the brand. Innovations add flavors!  After the successful launch of the Vapeur range  of canned vegetables in France, production is  being expanded and developed across Europe.  Steam-cooking retains more of the texture and  flavor of vegetables than other methods.  Since September 2010, 15 products have been  sold under the Bonduelle  Vapeur brand in France.  In the Benelux countries,  new canned products have been  launched under the Pure brand  already used for a frozen range. In Italy the  packaging for Bonduelle brand  canned vegetables has been completely  overhauled with the launch of an additive- free range of vegetables cooked using  steaming technology. The vegetable medleys  are now packaged in rectangular cans,  and the ratatouille  comes in a specially-designed  container enabling it to be  reheated in a microwave oven.

In addition, Bonduelle sold  its Frudesa and Salto brands to Findus. Through  this partnership, and thanks to the synergies generated,  Bonduelle and Ardo aim to create a competitive producer  of frozen vegetables. 17 Annual report 2010-2011  Net income in millions of euros 08/09 09/10 10/11 31 27 58 Revenue in millions of euros 08/09 09/10 10/11 1,726 1,524 1,560 Capital expenditure in millions of euros 08/09 09/10 10/11 81 63 90 Debt-to-equity  ratio (gearing) in % 08/09 09/10 10/11 102 135 116 Current operating income in millions of euros 08/09 09/10 10/11 81 102 104 Free cash flow* in millions of euros 08/09 09/10 10/11 61 - 36 51 Key group figures * Free cash flow is the amount of cash flow generated from operations, less the change in working capital and cash flow used in investments.

We are now operating at national level,  supporting a large number of producers that have demonstrated  their reliability both in terms of quality and volumes. Our partnership  with the group has enabled us to considerably improve the planning  of the investments required for our activity.  Bonduelle has also  given a fresh boost to agriculture by promoting the development  of new plant varieties and focusing on the  ght against elements  that are harmful to plantations, helping to reduce pesticide use.                                                                                                                                         Corporate strategy  and policies Sustainability, independence, and the individual development of our employees:  the Bonduelle Group bases its strategy on these three key objectives. Bonduelles  shareholding structure has a large family dimension that provides the group with stability  and continuity as it pursues its corporate mission: placing vegetables at the heart  of our diets while fostering growth and sustainable development. Food safety The quality and safety of Bonduelle products, which  are recognized all over the world, are subject to con- tinuous monitoring and rigorous controls. To ensure  that it provides consumers with the best of vegeta- bles, in 2010-2011 the group invested in optical   sorters and laser detectors, and carried out a large  number of quality audits of its suppliers. Moreover,  the E. coli crisis â€“ which did not affect the groups  products â€“ enabled the effectiveness of its control  procedures to be verified, particularly thanks to the  full traceability of supplies and deliveries. Respect for the environment Cutting energy and water consumption, and green- house gas emissions: reducing the environmental  footprint of the groups activities has long been a top  priority. This is achieved, for example, through the  design of leading-edge production facilities (Cris- talina, San Paolo dArgon) that minimize the use of  resources and protect the natural environments.  Furthermore, the group is participating in the Fru- gal Factory research program, which is aimed at  making the next generation of plants even more  energy efficient, while improving performance in  terms of product quality and carbon emissions. Fo R Long-term priority Never sacrifice the future for short-term gain. This  philosophy has made a family-owned company,  established in 1853, the global leader in ready-to-use  vegetables. In order to achieve sustainable develop- ment, the group strives to diversify its businesses  and geographical locations, while pursuing a  dynamic capital expenditure policy to ensure that  it keeps up with the latest technologies. To this end,  despite the difficult economic environment, the  capital investment made by the group in 2010-2011  (81 million euros) led to two ultra-efficient plants  coming on stream: Cristalina in Brazil and San Paolo  dArgon in Italy. Growth The groups proactive sales and marketing opera- tions, coupled with its acquisition and partnership  strategy â€“ as reflected in the joint venture agreement  signed in June 2011 by Bonduelle and Ardo, Europes  leading producer of frozen foods â€“ play their part in  delivering steady and sustainable growth (10.7% in  2010-2011).  Lo G Strategy and sustainable development 24 Annual report 2010-2011  Agro-industrial commitment Conscious that the land is a precious resource, Bonduelle  encourages the best farming practices by limiting use  of inputs and fostering the natural biological activity of  the soil. The group helps farmers to carry out predictive  tests to prevent diseases and encourages the deployment  of observation networks to detect the arrival of pests.  This initiative forms part of the biological monitoring  system established by the Ministry of Agriculture and  supported by the group. International expansion Bonduelle is always on the look-out for new growth  horizons, and continues to expand internationally.  This strategy also increases risk diversification and  enables the group to meet the specific product  requirements of the regions in which it operates. As  part of this strategy, in 2010-2011 Bonduelle launched  production at the Cristalina plant in Brazil. Personal development The success of the groups strategy depends on the  commitment of all its employees. To achieve this on  a day-to-day basis, Bonduelle places great impor- tance on communications within the group, offers  multiple training opportunities, conducts annual  reviews, and promotes job mobility to give all its  employees the means to further their professional  and personal development. A In P Profitability The groups long-term growth strategy seeks to  increase profitability through rigorous manage- ment, productivity improvements, diversification of  industrial and commercial risks, and the develop- ment of innovative activities and products with high  value added. Despite a slight drop in profitability  compared with the previous year â€“ due to the lower  prices applied in relation to market oversupply and  poor harvests caused by adverse weather conditions  â€“ the groups profitability was at the high end of its  forecast range in 2010-2011. Brand strategy Bonduelle, Cassegrain, Arctic Gardens: the group  has a portfolio of brands that are recognized all over  the world, and sells vegetables in all forms, under  all types of brands, through all distribution channels,  and using all available technologies. This marketing  approach was strengthened in 2010-2011 with the  European launch of canned mushrooms under the  Bonduelle brand. In addition to selling vegetables  under its own brands, the group supplies large   retailers with private label products.  Innovation Innovation â€“ whether it concerns products or tech- nologies â€“ is at the heart of the strategy adopted by  the group, and is essential for it to differentiate itself  from competitors and anticipate changes in   consumption trends. For example, in 2010-2011,  Bonduelle continued to roll out its Vapeur range of  steamed products in Europe, adapted this cooking  method for certain frozen products, developed new  packaging (Cup and Box ranges) to meet demand  for snacking products, and launched a range of  organic salads in biodegradable bags. P B In 25 Annual report 2010-2011    Laurence Depezay, Nutrition Manager The fourth Conference of the Louis Bonduelle Founda- tion, organized on May 10, 2011 brought together more  than 180 participants â€“ including associations, health  professionals, and institutions â€“ to discuss an important  subject: Human nutrition: yesterday, today, and tomor- row. The sixth Louis Bonduelle Research Prize was also  awarded at this annual event. Two winners were pre- sented with a check for 10,000 euros: Ling Chun Kong,  from the Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, in Paris,  and Florent Vieux, from Universit dAix-Marseille. In  addition, the second ECOG (European Childhood Obe- sity Group) â€“ Louis Bonduelle Research Prize, which is  given to a public health research project or initiative  tackling childhood obesity, was awarded in November  2010 to Dr Pascale Isnard, representing the team from  the Robert Debr Hospital in Paris, for its project: The   psychopathological evaluation of adolescents suffering  from obesity. Strategy and sustainable development Nutrition, a key aspect  of the groups strategy Rich in minerals, vitamins, and fiber, vegetables play a part in protecting us  from developing cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, ...Fully aware of these public  health issues, Bonduelle has made nutrition a key aspect of its strategy by focusing  on the benefits and pleasure we get from eating high quality vegetables that are  grown with care and preserved in a healthy way. This commitment is transmitted  by the Louis Bonduelle Foundation... Daniel Vielfaure awards  the Louis Bonduelle Prize 2011  to Florent VIEUX (Universit  dAix-Marseille) and Ling CHUN  KONG (Centre de Recherche  des Cordeliers, Paris). 26 Annual report 2010-2011  Launch of the Foundation in Canada Lastly, another major event of the year was the launch  of the Louis Bonduelle Foundation in Canada on January  25, 2011. To mark the occasion, the Foundation paid out  more than 40,000 Canadian dollars in grants to around  ten organizations to support their initiatives promoting  the consumption of vegetables. Supporting research Also with a view to increasing nutritional knowledge,  Bonduelle took part in the Euro-Mediterranean Sympo- sium on Fruit and Vegetable Processing. Organized by  INRA (French National Institute for Agronomic  Research) and the Universit dAvignon et des Pays du  Vaucluse, this symposium provided an opportunity for  Bonduelle to present various scientific posters and talk  about its research, especially on the bioavailability of  nutrients in vegetables and the effects of vegetable  extracts on health. Mistral Gagnant project 2011 also saw the launch of the Mistral Gagnant pro- ject, consisting of the updating of databases on vegetable  nutrition sold by the group, to include the latest changes  in EU regulations. Combined with analysis of the  research projects conducted by Bonduelle over the last  ten years, this should contribute to optimizing the nutri- tional qualities of Bonduelle products, and informing  the wider public of these qualities through a dedicated  marketing campaign. Promoting  the consumption  of vegetables in Europe We all know that it is advisable to eat at least five  portions of fruit and vegetables every day. The  problem is not, therefore, that consumers lack  information: we need to look at why people are not  eating more fruit and vegetables. This is the subject  of the study published by the Louis Bonduelle  Foundation, which covers the determining factors  and obstacles relating to fruit and vegetable  consumption, the different measures introduced  in European countries, and the initiatives  that need to be launched to improve  long-term eating habits. ea e F co www.bonduelle.com www.fondation-louisbonduelle.org 27 Annual report 2010-2011    Jean-Bernard Bonduelle, Director of External Relations and Sustainable Development The Bonduelle Group has embarked on the path to   sustainable development with conviction. A number of  initiatives undertaken in this area have enabled us to  deliver significant results over the last five years: a reduc- tion in water consumption of almost 15%, and in energy   consumption of 11%. However, this years results, with  increases in water and energy consumption of 5.2% and  3.6% respectively, attributable to a long and difficult   harvest season, will lead to us redoubling our efforts.  The initiatives put in place to ensure the well-being and  safety of our employees have halved the accident rate over  the last five years, and this years level was broadly in line  with the previous year. These results will encourage us to  step up our efforts and consult more extensively with  stakeholders and experts so that we can make our com- mitment even stronger. Greater involvement with stakeholders Making vegetables the future of food means making the  benefits and pleasure we get from eating high quality  vegetables available to everyone, all year round: this is,  today more than ever, a major challenge for our group,  which helps boost health through food, and therefore  contributes to the general interest. Our mission also  involves growing vegetables with care, keeping up with  developments in farming practices, preserving vegetables  in a natural way, and ensuring the quality of our products.  This provides a guarantee of confidence and longevity,  essential elements in sustainable development. The commitment of our men and women Since we believe that the individual development of our  men and women , who strive on a daily basis to make  the group a major player in our sector, is absolutely key,  our mission also requires us to ensure that we offer them  better working conditions and meaningful opportunities  for personal and professional development. The land, our precious resource Lastly, the land that we work on is a precious resource.  Our respect for the land has led us to undergo a historical  transition from an agro-industrial model exploiting  ecosystems in a conventional manner, towards a model  of managing ecosystems in a sustainable way. Ground- breaking initiatives such as the Usine Sobre (Frugal  factory) project (Usine Sobre) and the pilot program  for integrated production* launched in Picardie (France)  in 2009, are crucial to our commitment to progress that  places sustainable development firmly at the heart of  our group. Strategy and sustainable development Bonduelle and  sustainable development The Bonduelle Groups sustainable development strategy  has a new impetus that is fully in line with its corporate mission:  Making vegetables the future of food. * Agricultural production techniques based on agronomic practices (soil management,  crop rotation, genetics, intermediate crops, etc.) with the aim of reducing the use  of inputs and the impact of farming on the environment. 28 Annual report 2010-2011  Bonduelle has also been  a member of the UN Global  Compact since 2003.  This United Nations  agreement requires  signatories to apply ten basic  principles relating to human  rights, the fight against  corruption, and labor and  environmental standards. Bonduelle is an active  supporter of the World  Forum for a Responsible  Economy, a symposium  initiated in 2007  to encourage widespread  promotion of sustainable  development issues. The initiatives undertaken by the Bonduelle Group  to promote sustainable development may be classified  into five major areas of concern: PEOPLE Accident rate at work:  Target: 20 Result:  22.60 on a like-for-like basis  24.39 in total Annual review Target: 100 % Result:    80.23% of annual reviews carried out In-house magazine Bonduelle Actus distributed at 70% of sites Diversity policy  Percentage of disabled people employed at sites in France: 6.2% Code of Ethics currently being drafted   Progress towards a long-term goal of zero accidents,  with a 15% reduction in the accident rate this year   Carry out 100% of annual reviews, improve  employability   Launch a workplace program on gender equality   Continue the action plan supporting disabled people   Complete and distribute the Code of Ethics AGRICULTURE Signing of the sourcing charter Target: 100 % Result:    91% (59% of farmers have been assessed) Optimization of spraying techniques and establishment of metrics  Result: Increased use of optimum dosage techniques, metrics in test  phase Integrated production* Result: Initial training at pilot farms   Draft the 4th sourcing charter in consultation  with stakeholders    Reduce pesticide use by 20% over 3 years   Measure the environmental impact of agricultural  practices, introduce metrics   Continue research into integrated production* NATURAL RESOURCES Reduce energy consumption by 5% Result (like-for-like basis):    11% reduction over 5 years (keeping production volumes constant)  Increase of 3.6% compared with 2009-2010 Reduce water consumption by 3% Result (like-for-like basis):   Result: 15% reduction over 5 years (keeping production volumes constant)  Increase of 5.2% compared with 2009-2010 Usine Sobre (Frugal factory project) Result: Launch of the Usine Sobre (Frugal factory) project  at 3 plants producing canned, frozen, and fresh products and adoption  of the projects principles for the construction of the new fresh products  facility a San Paolo dArgon, Italy Eco-design charter Result: awareness of eco-design raised through the launch of the Vapeur  range (Europe) and the relaunch of the Agita & Gusta range (Italy)   Conduct a fresh review of the groups environmental  impact    Reduce energy consumption in plants by 5% per year   Reduce water consumption in plants by 3% per year   Recover >75% of ordinary industrial waste   Develop alternative energy projects  (biomass, biogas, etc.)   Initiate an eco-design charter QUALITY AND NUTRITION  Launch the sourcing charter for 100% of suppliers Result: Signature rate: 21% Visa Sant project Result: The Visa Sant project is being rolled out internationally   Extend the sourcing charter to 100% of suppliers   Formalize the groups quality policy   Continue the Visa Sant project TRANSPORTATION   Reduce CO2 by 5% in the canned product business Result: 6.83% reduction in CO2 (1,732 metric tons) Extend the implementation of metrics to all product segments Result: Roll out of metrics upstream and downstream  for the transportation of canned and fresh products Alternatives to road transportation  Result: Use of mixed rail-road routes Upstream-downstream transportation Result: Generation of transportation synergies between sites  for deliveries to large retail chains   Reduce CO2 by 3% per metric ton transported   Extend the implementation of transportation metrics  to all subsidiaries and countries   Increase use of mixed rail-road systems   Optimize upstream-downstream logistics   Share downstream transportation with other sites TARGETS/RESULTS 2010-2011  OUTLOOK 2011-2012 29 Annual report 2010-2011  Our human  resources policy The individual development of the men and women  who strive on a daily basis to make the group the global  leader in ready-to-use vegetables is extremely important.  Bonduelle therefore implements a broad range of initiatives  to offer its 9,650 employees (full-time equivalent) optimum  working conditions and meaningful opportunities  for personal and professional development. Following the initiatives that began the previous year, in  2010-2011 Bonduelle continued to carry out annual reviews  with its employees, covering all subsidiaries and geographi- cal locations. The reviews have two aims: to ascertain  employees needs and identify possible avenues for career  advancement. Annual reviews were carried out with 80.23%  of the groups employees (2012 target: 100%), including  staff working in the mushroom business. Another key  development over the past year was the strengthening of  communications within the group, with the launch of an  in-house magazine, including a page of group news and a  page dedicated to the activities of each entity. The maga- zine is currently available at 70% of Bonduelles sites  throughout the world. In Canada, this initiative was accom- panied by the installation of TV screens in plant cafeterias,  which show information relating to safety, work, sustain- able development projects, etc. Bonduelle has also been giving group employees the oppor- tunity to share in the companys success for nearly 25 years,  by subscribing to the group savings plan. Employees who  make voluntary contributions benefit from an employers  contribution in France, of 50% for the first 200 euros and  Two examples of the in-house magazine  (Bonduelle Actus)  for the plants in Krasnodar in Russia and Santarm in Portugal.

This   voluntary contribution by the company enables employees  to build savings under favorable conditions at the same  time as being shareholders of the company. Spotlight on diversity In order to promote diversity, we first need to know what  the current situation is at the group. This is why, in 2010- 2011, Bonduelle began the Diversity in the group survey,  to enable it to adopt an appropriate plan, while taking  into account the specific cultural and legal environment  in each country. In a similar vein, Bonduelle lodged a  training project from its European employee representa- tives committee with the European Commission. This  project, validated by the authorities in Brussels, brings  together employer and employee organizations. Its aim  is to provide training for members on their rights and  responsibilities, to help them read and implement Euro- pean directives more effectively, and to improve the way  in which the project operates. Bonduelle is also increasing the number of disabled    Awareness raising sessions, special training  programs for all employees, regular information  campaigns: in Canada, the Strathroy plant  (Ontario) has worked on all fronts to promote  the health and safety of its 135 employees  (235 during peak periods). Efforts are also made  to continuously improve working conditions,  analyze the causes of any accidents, and adopt  corrective measures. Focus Strathroy plant:  three years of operations  with zero lost time accidents  people that it employs through various initiatives in  France and in other countries. Skills and career opportunities Diversity, but also the development of skills and career  opportunities: following on from the annual reviews,  Bonduelle has organized a skills review. The group has  also, via the Institut de Formation Pierre et Benot   Bonduelle, strengthened the Bonduelle Executive   Program. These are two good ways to anticipate the  future managerial organization of the group and to   identify key employees, thereby capitalizing on existing  talent as the group develops.

It prevents the waste of raw  materials (seeds, fertilizers, water, etc.) while preserving  the richness of the soil, and ensuring high quality harvests  to the benefit of consumers and the group. Bonduelle is a  strong believer in this approach and supports producers  with a variety of agronomy initiatives, such as predictive  soil testing. Through tests carried out on different areas  of the land, this method enables any diseases that could  endanger seedlings to be detected early and reduces the  risks of crop failure. The effectiveness of this method has  led the group to use it more widely, on pea and bean  plantations. Sustainable  agricultural production Predictive testing, observation networks, biological monitoring  all of these have been increased since 2009 thanks to the support of field  supervisors and producer organizations. Because the land is a precious  resource, the Bonduelle Group encourages the best farming practices  by limiting the use of pesticides and fostering the natural biological activity  of the soil.

When these insects are caught in the traps,  it indicates a risk of damage and enables  the crop to be protected.   Gry Capelle, Agronomy Development Manager BCI Nord-Picardie 32 Annual report 2010-2011  Simplified farming techniques In parallel with these preventive measures, for many  years Bonduelle has been raising the awareness of   farmers with regard to better management of crop pro- tection products, emphasizing the use of more efficient  spraying techniques which are just as effective as they  are targeted. In addition, a joint initiative is in place with  seed growers to select more resistant varieties, using  traditional cross-breeding methods. Lastly, the group  monitors developments in farming techniques in coun- tries including France, Brazil, Canada, Poland, and Spain,  particularly as regards simplified techniques based,  where applicable, on biological soil activity rather than  systematic agriculture. This is a more ecological  approach that reduces fuel consumption and is synony- mous with a smaller carbon footprint, and is therefore  fully consistent with the Bonduelle Groups commitment  to sustainable development. Early detection is the best approach The implementation of observation networks on all culti- vated land is another concrete example of the groups   commitment to farming practices that are more respectful  of the environment. The purpose of these networks is to  warn before the arrival of pests on crops. To support the  networks, Bonduelle and the producer organizations run  training sessions for field supervisors and producers, and  provide the latter with specific technical recommenda- tions, depending on the risks detected. This initiative has  a similar rationale to the biological monitoring system  established by the Ministry of Agriculture, which has been  run by industry professionals since 2010. Focus Bonduelle  supports le bulletin  de sant du vgtal  (Culture health bulletin) Faithful to its aim of supporting change  in the agriculture sector, Bonduelle invests alongside  the producer organizations in crop monitoring through  le bulletin de sant du vgtal (Culture health bulletin).  This process, which was previously carried out by the  regional departments of the Ministry of Agriculture,  has been transferred, under the general review  of public policy (RGPP) to sector professionals,  who regularly publish a bulletin on the state  of health of fields and warn  of any threats to crops.

At the  same time, water consumption was reduced by 15% (for  a constant level of tonnage per activity). Moreover, total  emissions of 92,000 TEQ CO2 have been reduced over  the last four years thanks to the improvement in energy  performance made by plants compared with 2006-2007.  However, despite the groups ongoing efforts to improve,  with a target for reducing the amount of energy  consumed  by plants of 5% per year (-3% for water) until 2012 (taking  data for 2005-2006 as a base), its environmental perfor- mance in 2010-2011 was impacted by a number of factors:  the specific characteristics of the new mushroom busi- ness, longer production programs for other vegetables  (deseasonalization), and above all, poor harvests (mainly  due to floods in Eastern Europe), which led to production  equipment being underused. As a result, energy con- sumption rose to 960 kWh per metric ton of manufac- tured product (TMP), from 874 kWh/TMP in 2009-2010.  Water consumption, meanwhile, rose to 14.3 m3/TMP,  from 13.2 m3/TMP in 2009-2010. The plants of the  Champiloire subsidiary (mushrooms), as well as the new  facilities at Cristalina (Brazil) and San Paolo dArgon  (Italy), are included in Bonduelles energy policy and   targets for 2011-2012. Usine Sobre (Frugal factory):  the next generation of plants To further enhance its energy performance, Bonduelle  entered into a partnership with the Ecole des Mines de  Paris and gained the support of ADEME (Environment  and Energy Management Agency) to begin the Frugal   Factory project in 2009, which is aimed at ascertaining the  minimum amount of energy needed for its vegetable- processing operations. By June 2011, the project had led  to the identification of energy optimization measures and  research programs. The groups endeavors in respect of  developing the next generation of plants is also illustrated  by the energy-efficient design of the San Paolo dArgon  plant in Italy (operational since February 2011), which has  achieved its target of halving energy consumption com- Preservation  of natural resources The action undertaken by Bonduelle at all its subsidiaries has led,  in just a few years, to a significant reduction in energy and water consumption,  and in the emission of greenhouse gases from its plants and packaging.  These efforts continued in 2010-2011. The integration of the mushroom activity  and poor harvests have, however, impacted on the groups environmental  performance.   Ccile Lovichi, Environment Manager 34 Annual report 2010-2011  pared with the initial design. Similarly, the construction  of an ultra-modern cold room at Estres-Mons was   completed in 2010-2011. This new facility will use half the  energy of a conventional one. Furthermore, to take full  advantage of this facility, a negative cold production  training module has been tested with the operators of this  site and will be extended to the entire group.  Supporting alternative energies and  investing in waste water treatment  In addition to reducing its energy consumption,   Bonduelle is producing alternative energies such as  biogas* from the methanation of industrial effluent  (a fifth digester was built at the Nagykors site in   Hungary in 2010), and from a methanation project based  on corn by-products, along the lines of the system used  by  Seacliff Energy at the Tecumseh plant in Leamington,  Ontario, since February 2011. Another key element in  the groups policy is the improvement of waste water  treatment. In conjunction with the various stakeholders,  Bonduelle carried out two major projects in this area in  2010-2011: the upgrade of an agricultural fertilizer  Focus Bonduelle participates  in environmental  information project To provide consumers with reliable environmental information  and combat unfounded allegations, Bonduelle is participating  in a project on environmental impact measurement led  by the Ministry of Ecology. The project involves the development  of standard calculation methods appropriate to such information,  which firms will need to use in order to comply with the French  Grenelle law on the environment. As part of the project, the group  measured the environmental impact of a family-size can of extra-small  peas (850 ml). The greenhouse gas emissions per 100 grams  of net drained weight were measured at 94 grams C02 equivalent  over the entire life cycle of the product. Water consumption  for the same product was measured at 0.9 liters  per 100 grams net drained weight based only  on the water used to wash the peas and fill the can,  due to the lack of data and an established  methodology.

Greener packaging The group has also made efforts to reduce the environ- mental impact of packaging. For example, it has a pro- gram in place to reduce the thickness of cans. As part of  this project, Bonduelle North America saved 1,200 metric  tons of metal between 2007 and 2011. In frozen foods,  Bonduelle has launched a project to analyze complex  films and packaging with the aim of reducing their car- bon footprint, while ensuring that the highest quality of  finished products is maintained. Lastly, the groups R&D  teams are evaluating the advantages of organic materials  made using plants for primary and secondary packaging,  while ensuring that these elements do not compromise  the amount of land needed to grow food for human  consumption.  -35% reduction in water  consumption achieved  by Bonduelle Frais International.

Herv Chenault, Supply Chain Director, Bonduelle Conserve International Metrics Following its launch in 2008, the CO2 emissions measure- ment program has been extended to all intersite flows  (plants and logistics centers of Bonduelle Conserve Inter- national) and customer deliveries, in all the European  countries in which the group operates. These measurements, calculated using the method  devised by ADEME (Environment and Energy Manage- ment Agency) and validated by an independent firm (Bio  Intelligence Service), have highlighted the progress made,  mainly thanks to the development of rail-road transporta- tion routes: 40,409 metric tons of goods (equivalent to  6.9% of intersite movements of canned vegetables in  Europe) were transported using these routes in 2010-2011,  versus 30,579 metric tons the previous year, generating  savings of 1,732 TEQ CO2.  The Bonduelle Group is continuing the roll-out of the  calculation tool to its other subsidiaries, with a view to  identifying the most effective solutions for optimizing the  transportation of goods. Sharing resources The group has also begun to share resources with other  firms, enabling it to reduce the number of trucks on the  road. Feasibility studies conducted in 2010-2011 with  Cereal Partners (a producer of breakfast cereals) should  lead to the first joint customer deliveries in the last quar- ter of 2011. This initiative may also be extended to other  partners. 44 metric tons in France Lastly, following the authorization (made official in  France at the start of 2011) given to loads of 44 metric  tons (against 40 metric tons previously), Bonduelle has  worked with two of its main transportation suppliers to  increase the loads of almost all of its intersite flows in  France accordingly, taking more than 230 trucks off the  road, which would have travelled a distance of around  17,000 km. In addition, the significant investments made  in storage (ambient temperature and cold rooms) should  generate major transportation savings in 2011-2012 (San- tarm, Strathroy, Ingersoll, Estres, Labenne, Bkscaba).         Opportunities    for improvement   2009/2012    Extend the implementation of metrics  to all product segments (canned, frozen,  fresh, prepared).    Reduce CO2 emissions. We have been working for a number of years now  with Bonduelle, which pays a lot of attention to saving energy  and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Over and above  any economic criteria, the group favors the best environmental  solutions for its deliveries and intersite flows. Our entire fleet  therefore meets the Euro 5 standard, the strictest emissions  standard that has been introduced. Our drivers receive training  in eco-driving and we regularly analyze their fuel consumption  so that we can continue to make progress in this area.  These initiatives, inspired by a common vision, contribute  to strengthening our partnership. A recent example of this  was the launch of 44 metric ton-loads, which has led to a reduction  of more than 15% in road transportation.   Damien Guewy, Director of Transports Duminil, Vaulx-Vraucourt (France) 37 Annual report 2010-2011    Laurence Depezay, Nutrition Manager          Jrme Lefbvre, Director of Quality The effectiveness of the groups quality control system  was demonstrated during the E. coli crisis that affected  certain vegetables last spring.  As soon as the alarm was raised, Bonduelle mobilized all  the means at its disposal to ensure that its products  â€“ especially cucumbers â€“ posed no risk to health,  mainly thanks to the full traceabi lity of its supplies and  deliveries.  This unpreceden ted situation, which did not concern  any group products, illustrated the groups ability to  manage a crisis in terms of both its investigation of the  potential causes and communications with its customers  and suppliers. Providing healthy,  high quality vegetables The Bonduelle Groups quality policy is fundamental to ensuring  customer satisfaction worldwide, and is applied to all stages of cultivation  and processing. This key commitment is reflected in a continuous  improvement approach adopted internally and by our suppliers.

Visa Sant project In addition, during the past year, Bonduelle launched a  comprehensive review of its product ranges aimed at  optimizing nutritional quality. This review was carried  out as part of the Visa Sant project. One of the objectives  of this project is to reduce the salt content of recipes by  5-25%. Significant investment As part of its commitment to sustainable development  and farming practices that are more respectful to the  environment, the group has begun a program of reducing  pesticide use, and at the same time, embarked on a   significant investment in laser or magnetic optical   sorters that can detect the presence of any foreign bodies  during processing. The purchase of this high-tech   equipment will further enhance the quality of finished  products and has led to a considerable drop (-5%) in  complaints related to the presence of undesirable  elements. More extensive audits The goal of continuously improving quality has also led  to the application of a standard to suppliers, which was  established in 2009. In 2010-2011 more than 200 quality  audits were carried out, with evaluations of performance  in terms of the quality of goods delivered as well as   delivery times and reactivity. This initiative has been  supplemented by an online quality questionnaire for the  In the words of Bonduelle has made a voluntary commitment to improve  its quality policy.

Raw vegetables  account for around half the market, followed by canned,  frozen, and fresh ready-to-use vegetables. Consumers in  this market, which is more mature than the market in  Europe, are increasingly opting for products that are  quick and easy to eat, such as processed vegetables. As a proportion of the total food market, vegetables rep- resent 10.6% by value in North America, compared with  5.5% in Europe (2). Expectations vary according  to distribution channel Vegetables are distributed via two different channels:  retail in which vegetables are sold directly to   consumers in stores. In this market, fresh vegetables are  most popular, but the market share of canned, frozen,  and fresh ready-to-use vegetables in Europe is increas- ing, and stood at 24% in 2010, up from 22% in 2009 (3).  the food service, sector is a professional market, in  which vegetables are usually bought in bulk. Ready-to- eat vegetables, which are perfectly suited to the   constraints of the food service sector, guarantee consist- ent quality, ease of preparation, and competitive operat- ing costs. Ready-to-eat vegetables account for a larger  proportion of this market than is the case for the retail  sector: 45% in Europe, and 65% in North America (4). Focus  on Brazil With a population of almost 192 million, Brazil  is a growing economy in which the quality of life  is improving day by day. From 2005 to 2008, the middle  classes grew from 34% of the population to 53%, and the  proportion represented by the most disadvantaged groups fell  from 51% to 25%. In 2010, incomes rose by 5%, while unemployment  has fallen by more than one percentage point each year since 2002,  with the exception of 2009. Consumption habits have become more  sophisticated, and ready-to-use products are ideally placed to meet  the new requirements of the local population. For example, 84.1% of  Brazilian households buy canned vegetables, and the countrys annual  consumption of 400,000 metric tons equates to an average purchase  per household of 2.7 kg per year. Consumption is highest in the  state of So Paulo and in the south of the country. It mostly  comprises sweet corn and peas, which represent  60.4% and 27.7% respectively of the canned vegetable  market in Brazil.

Vegetables are the height of convenience In todays consumer society, people work long hours,  and with numerous leisure pursuits available to them,  they are always looking to save time. The popularity of  ready-to-eat foods has therefore increased. A vast  choice of canned food, and fresh and frozen ready meals  is now on offer. Products such as processed vegetables,  which marry speed and quality, are the ideal solution for  a healthy, natural, and balanced diet. Control of the pro- duction process and product origin ensures the best  quality. The fall in prices thanks to mass production  methods has made processed vegetables affordable to  all sections of society. Increase in market share of ready-to-use  vegetables In Europe, raw vegetables account for a large proportion  of the market. However, the market share of raw vegeta- bles is falling year-on-year, and the share of canned, fro- zen, and fresh ready-to-use vegetables is increasing. The  market share of raw vegetables fell from 75.6% in 2009  to 73.3% in 2010 in Western Europe, and from 91.2% in  2009 to 88.4% in 2010 in Central and Eastern Europe (1). 43 Annual report 2010-2011  Bonduelle Conserve  International  The innovation strategy pursued by Bonduelle Conserve  International, combined with numerous promotional campaigns,  has enabled this subsidiary to strengthen its position in terms of both  own brands and private label brands. This excellent performance was  also evident on the frozen food market, with a sharp rise in sales. After recording steady falls of around 1% per year over  the last three years, the canning market in Western  Europe posted modest growth of 0.4% in 2010-2011,  though sales of hard discount and private label prod- ucts were flat.  This indicates the continued appeal of canned foods to  consumers, as they are tasty, healthy, and cheap, with the  recent decline in sales being mainly due to consumers  reacting to the economic crisis by preferring to use up  their stocks rather than add to them. The return to growth  in 2010-2011  benefited Bonduelle Conserve International  (BCI), both with regard to the Bonduelle brand and the   Cassegrain premium range of products.  The increase in sales was particularly notable in  France and Italy, and more moderate in Germany.  Our mission Philippe Carreau,  Chief Executive Officer, Bonduelle Conserve International 44 Annual report 2010-2011  In France, the innovation strategy for  Cassegrain has led to the launch of new original  recipes such as Haricots Coco (haricot beans  cooked in a tomato and herb sauce). Innovative  products are being sold under the Cassegrain  brand in the pulses segment, following the  successful launch of cooked lentils and haricot  beans. Cassegrain Haricot Coco is a completely  new product to the canned vegetable segment.  It is made using a small, melt-in-the mouth  variety of haricot bean, in a fresh-tasting sauce  containing tomato, bay leaf, and sage.  These beans have a delicate taste, similar  to hazelnuts or chestnuts. Focus New Cassegrain  products In Spain, however, where the economy remains  in difficulty, sales fell slightly. Expansion of the Vapeur range In 2010-2011, the Vapeur range of steamed  products  continued to be expanded: potatoes, peas, sliced   carrots, lentils, chick peas, zucchini, endives, green  beans and peas/carrots. Following the success in  France of steamed products, which are firmer and  have more flavor, over the last year Bonduelle   Conserve International began to roll out the Vapeur  range in the Netherlands and Italy, before launching  it in Spain and the other European countries in which  BCI operates. In addition, following the acquisition  of the mushroom business, in April 2010, the sale of  mushrooms under the Bonduelle brand (previ- ously sold under the Royal Champignon brand)  began in France, and then in the Benelux  countries, Hungary, Spain, the Baltic states,  Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, and Poland, with an  increased profile in stores thanks to the launch of  certain high quality and differentiated products.  Lastly, Bonduelle Conserve International has main- tained its levels of promotional activity, enabling it to  reduce the price difference between its own brands  and private label brands.

It is now sold in cans (Vapeur range  single-variety vegetables), rectangular  cans (cooked mixed vegetables),  and in microwaveable plastic bowls  (ratatouille). These different forms  of packaging have been very  well-received by Italian consumers  and will be at the center of a major  marketing campaign in the third  quarter of 2011. the last year. At the end of 2010 it  held large stocks of finished prod- ucts, as did its competitors, which  intensified price competition.  Following on from this period,  adverse weather conditions (heat- waves, floods, etc.) affected harvests,  which impacted on production costs.  Against this turbulent backdrop,  the operational efficiency of BCIs  teams and the companys supply chain  delivered a modest increase in sales  volumes over the year as a whole. Pure performance The frozen vegetable segment also produced  satisfactory results, mainly thanks to the  French market holding up well, the popular- ity of the Pure range in the Netherlands,  and the updating of the range, comple- mented by more attractive packaging, in  Central Europe. The launch of pre-cooked  vegetables (single varieties) â€“ making  preparation even easier for consumers  â€“ should also boost performance.

Bonduelle Traiteur  International  While 2009-2010 saw a significant return to growth,  2010-2011 was a more difficult year for the French market  for prepared foods, both for private label and group brands.  Despite fierce price competition, Bonduelle Traiteur International  maintained its position on the market and continued its strategy  of differentiation through innovation. Growth in the prepared food market slowed to around  3% in value terms in 2010-2011, from 4.5% the year  before. Producers had surplus capacity, which led to a  fall in prices for private label products, and weighed on  growth in value terms and therefore profitability. As a  result, the market entered a period of restructuring, as  seen by the merger of two big players Martinet and  Belle-Henriette (the former acquiring the latter). New opportunities: eating on-the-go The situation for private label brands also affected  national brands, with extensive promotional campaigns  being implemented by the major players. However,   Bonduelle Traiteur International showed its resilience  in this fiercely competitive environment, maintaining  its leading position by investing, in particular, in the  development of new snacking products. Already present  in this segment with the Solo 180g range and a wide  variety of salads in the Bols Fracheur range, in spring  2011, Bonduelle Traiteur International launched its new  Cup range of prepared salads featuring original recipes  and innovative packaging.   The four healthy and delicious recipes, which can be  eaten anytime and anywhere, offer bright prospects in  a fast-growing segment: +21.2% by volume and +19.3%  by value.

Growth continued in Italy (+5%)  and Germany, but the E. coli crisis of spring 2011   dampened growth in the latter country to 11%, from the  20% previously expected.  Although the French market was flat, Bonduelle  increased its sales by 7%. This performance was   attributable to a significant rise in both volumes and  market share, further consolidating the Bonduelle brand  as number two in the sector. A 4% rise in Italian sales in  2010-2011 was also a satisfactory result for Bonduelle  Frais International, which maintained its leading   position on this market, despite a slight drop in market  share, owing to the difficult environment for food  Bonduelle  Frais International In 2010-2011, fresh-cut product sales were up for the second year  in a row in Italy and Germany, while the French market was flat.

Finally, with growth of 13%  in Germany, this subsidiary considerably strengthened  its leading position, partly due to the E. coli crisis, which  highlighted the reassurance conveyed by the brand. Prioritizing sustainable  development In addition to these good performances, another key  event of the past year was the inauguration, in May 2011,  of the new Italian plant at San Paolo dArgon, near   Bergamo. The previous plant was destroyed by a fire in  2008, and the new facility was constructed on the same  site. This new high-tech plant was designed in  accordance  with the principles of sustainable development, with a  focus on optimal transportation flows and energy effi- ciency. It has a production capacity of 20,000 metric  tons of finished products per year, and is the biggest  bagged salad facility in Europe. Tighter control of supplies In the Murcia region of Spain, Bonduelle Frais Interna- tional, via BF Agricola, grows more than 140 hectares of  mature salad plants and young leaves. Alongside the  companys long-standing and close partnerships with  producer organizations in each country in which it   operates, the main aim of stepping up the integrated  production of salads has been to strengthen quality   control and increase the security of supplies in winter. San  Paolo dArgon:  a model plant This new ultra-efficient plant, located  in Italys most populous region, will enable  the group to strengthen its position as market  leader, as regards both the Bonduelle brand  and private label brands. Supplies for this site  will come from the OASI producers  organization, which has been a Bonduelle  partner for many years. Its expertise  will enable the group to offer retail  and food service customers  high quality products  and services. www.bonduelle.com 49 Annual report 2010-2011  After the economic turbulence of the second quarter of  2010, the European food service sector experienced a  recovery in the first six months of 2011.

Gelagri: complementary business  model pays off The good performance of Bonduelle Food Service also  illustrates the effectiveness of the Gelagri joint venture,  which has enabled it to mitigate the effects of the crisis,  with BFS operating via its own brands, while Gelagri  specializes in private label brands. The complementary  nature of the two companies also extends into farming,  providing a more varied pool of resources. The Gelagri  joint venture, established in 2009, was followed in June  2011 by the signing of an agreement between Bonduelle  and Ardo, leading to the creation of Ultra Congelados  de la Ribera in Spain. Dedicated storage facility Optical sorters, infra red, X-rays: 2010 was a year of  huge capital investment, enabling BFS to deliver   products that meet the highest quality standards. In  addition, in May 2011, BFS began using a new cold room  with a 25,000-pallet capacity. Located in Estres, this  dedicated storage facility optimizes logistics (frozen  foods used to be stored at several different sites) and  reduces the need for goods to travel by road. Lastly, it  has been designed in accordance with high quality   environmental standards, and represents another step  along the path to sustainable development. Focus Bonduelle and Ardo  create a joint venture in Spain Ardo, Europes leading producer of frozen foods,  and Bonduelle, the second-ranking company  in the segment, formalized a production joint  venture in June 2011, under the name Ultra  Congelados de la Ribera. The aim of the joint venture  is to supply the Spanish and Portuguese markets,  especially the Findus brand, for which an exclusive  production agreement has been signed. At the same  time, Bonduelle sold its Frudesa and Salto brands  to Findus, which now manages sales of these brands  in addition to its own brand. Thanks to the synergies  generated, Bonduelle and Ardo have created  a competitive producer of frozen vegetables  while being part of the consolidation of a sector  that is undergoing rapid change. www.bonduelle.com 51 Annual report 2010-2011  The similar values and reciprocal contribution of skills  between the teams, as well as the merger of the sales and  marketing structures, which began in March 2010,   represented one of the highlights of the past year. In  addition, 2010-2011 saw the European launch (Belgium,  Spain, Hungary, the Baltic states, Scandinavia and   Portugal) of a range of canned mushrooms under the  Bonduelle brand. In France and Poland there was a  change of brand too, as this range used to be sold, respec- tively, under the names Royal Champignon and Abra.  Lastly, in Germany, where Bonduelle has been present  in this segment since 2009, a new product â€“ sliced mush- rooms â€“ was launched in 2010-2011. Champiloire  (mushrooms)  2010-2011 was a very busy year for Bonduelles eighth subsidiary,  with the integration of its teams into the group and the European launch  of the sale of its canned mushrooms under the Bonduelle brand.

The range has been  expanded in France with the addition of mushrooms to  the Bonduelle Vapeur list of products. Consumers will  now be able to enjoy the taste of freshly-cooked  mushrooms.  For private labels, sales coverage has been strengthened  by the integration within the group, particularly with  regard to Scandinavia and Germany.  On the fresh counters, the launch of a range of packaged  mushrooms that are harvested mechanically has increased  competitiveness with Polish products, while the French  origin of the products continues to be promoted. Investment program A major investment program has been put in place to roll  out mechanical cutting systems to all of the  Bonduelle  Groups mushroom growing houses and implement the  changes needed at processing plants as a result. The  Dou-la-Fontaine plant has been upgraded with the  introduction of short wash cycles and automated produc- tion lines.

Highly promising performance  from the Cristalina plant 2010-2011 was also notable for the progress made on two  major projects carried out by Bonduelle Development  â€“ the group company dedicated to international activi- ties outside the EU or North America. Firstly, in Ukraine,  Bonduelle Development began cultivating the land of  the Kolkhoze (former collective farms) in Cherkassy  (acquired in spring 2010). Secondly, a major develop- ment project, the Cristalina plant in Brazil â€“ a model for  sustainable development â€“ began operating in Septem- ber 2010. The first harvests of peas and corn met BDVs  expectations in both agricultural and industrial terms,  with very promising yields and productivity rates.   Products from the plant went on sale in Brazil at the end  of 2010, and in Argentina in June 2011 (the latter country  is another avenue for growth being developed by BDV  in Latin America). www.bonduelle.com 57 Annual report 2010-2011  USA / August 2010 â€“ 165 million  US dollar bond issued at attractive  conditions in a private bond  placement.

The Bonduelle Group improves its debt ratio every year.  By increasing the proportion of its long-term debt, it has secured  the  nancing of its operations and obtained suf cient funding  to pursue its acquisition policy. 58 Annual report 2010-2011  Financial report Focusing  on the long term Bonduelle is synonymous with integrity, innovation and continuous  research of the highest quality. These values are re ected in the products  sold by the group as well as in its relations with customers, employees  and producers.
