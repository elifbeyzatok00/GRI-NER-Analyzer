Sustainability Report 2010 69    70 Sustainability Report 2010 | Appendix | KOSPO Overview  Shinincheon Combined Cycle Power Site (674-13 Gyeongseo-dong, Seo-gu, Incheon Metropolitan City)   Fue l :  LNG    Installed Capacity : 1,800 MW (G/T 150  8 units, S/T 150  4 units) Shinincheon Combined Cycle Power Site is located near the Incheon International Airport, the hub of Southeast Asian region. The Shinincheon Site takes significant part in the supply of electricity in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do. The Shinincheon Site together with Busan Site, has the largest installed capacity as a single combined cycle power plant in Korea. Its advanced automation system ensures excellent frequency adjustment, contributing to the stable operation of the grid system. Andong Combined Cycle Power Plant (Goejeong-ri, Pungsan-eup, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do)  Andong Combined Cycle Power Plant is under preparation for construction which will begin in Nov. 2011 and end in Dec 2013. A total of KRW 330 billion will be invested for the 400 MW LNG combined cycle power plant in the northern part of North Geyongsang province. When completed, it is expected that a stable supply of electricity to the region will be possible, which will contribute to the balanced development of the nation as well as the vitalization of local economy.   Namjeju Thermal Power Plant (610 Hwasun-ri, Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province) Fuel : Heavy oil    Installed Capacity : 240 MW (Steam Turbine 100 MW2 units, Internal Combustion 10 MW4 units) Namjeju Thermal Power Plant is located in the southernmost part of the Korean Peninsula, meeting more than half the demand of Jeju Island. The Namjeju plant was Korea's first pilot plant for localization. The plant has steam, gas, combined and wind power generation units in operation. The plant is an eco-friendly power plant equipped with pollutant prevention facilities perfectly fit for the environment of Jeju Island as a special district for tourism. Under the command of Namjeju plant, Hanlim Combined  Cycle and Hangyeong Wind Power, which is the nation's first commercial wind power generator, and Seongsan Wind Power are operating in Jeju Island.  Hanlim Combined Cycle (620 Dongmyeong-ri, Hanlim-eup, Jeju-si, Jeju Special-Governing Province) Fuel : Kerosine  Installed Capacity : 105 MW (G/T 352 units, S/T 351 unit)    Hangyeong Wind Power (Yongsu-ri, Hangyeong-myeon, Jeju-si, Jeju Special-Governing Province)     Installed Capacity : 21 MW (3 MW 5 units, 1.5 MW 4 units)  Seongsan Wind Power (Susan-ri, Seongsan-eup, Seogwipo-si, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province)  Installed Capacity : 20 MW (2 MW  10 units)  Yeongwol Combined Cycle Power Plant (702 Jeongyang-ri, Yeongwol-eup, Yeongwol-gun, Gangwon-do Fuel : LNG    Installed Capacity : 84 8MW (GT 1833 units, ST 2991 unit) Yeongwol Combined Cycle Power Plant is Korea's first anthracite-fired power plant with the history of 36-year operation.
