The registered results include higher job  satisfaction and reduced sickness absence. nkt cables Highlights 2011-2012 nkt cables joins the  UN Global Compact In 2009 NKT became signatory to the  UN Global Compact, and from the outset,  nkt cables has fully supported this  initiative. In December 2011, nkt cables  became a participant itself, to underline the commitment to  the UN Global Compact. This CSR Report fulfils the obligation  to provide Communication on Progress (COP) for the period  1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012. Accidents reduced A new Health & Safety (H&S) policy was  introduced in the autumn of 2011. The  policys focus areas are: H&S is now a top  management priority; it is a regular topic  at all meetings, and is integrated in  incentive programmes. The H&S policy  now involves an increased use of safety  walks, communication campaigns, visible  action plans and training programmes as  well as a greater degree of employee  involvement. These efforts are bearing first fruits as the  accident frequency dropped by 25% on average over the  last 12 months (July 2011 - June 2012). Heating Concerted efforts, including the replacement of several old  and inefficient boilers, the move from old buildings to new  premises in Cologne, Germany, and the concentration of  production in a smaller area at Czech sites resulted in an  average 34% reduction of emission of greenhouse gasses due  to space heating in the last 12 months (July 2011 - June 2012)  compared to full year 2008.  Water An investigation on water consumption at all plants revealed  several technical defects and leaks. The subsequent repairs and  other improvements at several sites resulted in a 26% reduction  (average) of water consumption in the last 12 months (July  2011 - June 2012) compared to full year 2010. 25% nkt cables plant in Cologne, Germany nkt cables group  |  CSR Report 2011-12    4/8 Corporate Social Responsibility has been a recognised priority of  nkt cables for many years. For example we have 55 years of  experience with cable recycling and we were among the first in the  industry to offer environmentally friendly cable products. NKT joined the UN Global Compact in 2009, and nkt cables  autonomously in 2011. Being a participant of the UN Global  Compact has contributed significantly to raising awareness of the  importance of Corporate Social Responsibility within nkt cables.  The 10 UN Global Compact principles provide us with a  framework when taking decisions, dealing with our customers  and suppliers all the way to the day-to-day operations at the plant  floor. Under the banner of our commitment to the UN Global  Compact we have invested in the development of our employees,  our products and the environment. We have trained employees  on a variety of subjects such as respect for legal, ethical and HSE  standards. We have focused on providing employees a safer  working environment. We have developed and are offering our  customers alternative cable constructions without materials of  environmental concern such as phthalates or PVC. We have  developed slim line products with less use of limited resources.  We have further improved internal reporting requirements and  have developed an extensive data collection on CSR parameters  as a basis for measuring our progress as well as identifying further  improvement potential. We have implemented projects for  reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and energy and water  consumption. Finally, we have made respect for CSR standards  part of the way we conduct our business in all the markets we  operate in.  Our efforts have generated progress in many fields and we are  committed to do more where we can. We continue to be strongly  convinced that living up to our CSR principles will make nkt  cables a better supplier to our customers, a better customer to  our suppliers, a better neighbour in our communities and, last but  not least, a better place to work for our employees.    nkt cables believes that strict adherence to CSR principles helps to create a sustainable and  profitable future for our activities Marc vant Noordende CEO nkt cables group Under the banner of our  commitment to the UN Global  Compact we have invested in the  development of our employees, our  products and the environment nkt cables group  |  CSR Report 2011-12    5/8 For nkt cables as a global company represented in more than 20  countries and with suppliers and customers from all over the world  consideration of human and labour rights is a natural part of our  daily business. Once a year we ask the local management  teams in nkt cables to draft and sign a Statement of  Representation of adherence to the UN Global  Compact  principles  to  ensure  that  the  fundamental  principles  in  NKTs  ethical  guidelines are known and followed throughout  the organisation. Last year we started to  promote the same principles in our supplier  base. We have continued our survey with more  and new suppliers regarding their position  towards the UN Global Compact. During this  reporting period the purchase volume with  suppliers that commit to the ten principles has  increased by 6 percentage points to 86%. Our employees are our key asset and we firmly believe that  education and training of employees positively influence the  companys results. We have continued our focus on communication  skills and have provided English classes, and we have launched a  special training programme for start of our customer service centre.  Additionally, we have finalised the development programme  RECUN (see page 3), where focus of the last modules has been on  using the learned methods in our day-to-day business. Development  opportunities are provided throughout the organisation,  regardless of gender, race, age or religion. In March 2012 we conducted a worldwide  employee survey to further identify our key  assets needs. Based on the results a number of  focus areas will be identified in the next  reporting period. A new Health & Safety policy was signed by the  Top Management Team 25 October 2011. The  vision is People leave work as healthy as they  arrived before. The ambition is to achieve best in class  level in 5 years, that is an accident frequency of below 5 per  1 million working hours in 2016, compared to 22 last year. Read  more about the policy on page 3. Also, an extensive Root Cause Analysis tool will be taken into use  as from mid-2012 in order to find the cause of each work accident. Goals &  aCtioNs Human and labour rights Deadline Status 30.06.12 Procurement Based on results of the previously conducted survey a further improvement of suppliers commitment to  the UN Global Compact will be targeted by also approaching smaller suppliers to do the same. 30.06.12 New goal: Request for commitment to UN Global Compact principles shall become standard procedure in  qualification process for new raw material suppliers. 30.06.13 Work injuries Improve safety performance towards best-in-class industry standards. Best in class is defined as frequency less than 5  accidents per 1 million working hours (frequency reduced by 25% the last 12 months). 30.06.16 Employee education Improve employees competences and capabilities, thereby improving the company competitiveness. The RECUN project has been initiated and completed in the Danish operations. 01.03.12  Measurement of employee satisfaction by conducting a global people survey and developing action  plans based upon the findings. 31.12.12 ongoing Improve communication skills by launching a training project for Customer Service Centre Staff. 30.06.12 Health management New goal: Focus on Health Management, where all Units are requested to address the subject in the action plans  following the employee survey, if necessary supported by group initiatives and a monitoring system.  30.06.13     Not accomplished                Partly accomplished or behind schedule            Accomplished or on track Human and labour rights  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) E r g o n o m i c   c a b l e  t r o ll e y ( ) nkt cables group  |  CSR Report 2011-12    Traditional industrial pollution such as black smoke,  heavy noise and poisonous waste water is not an  issue in modern cable production. Our discharge  of substances of environmental concern to air and  water is negligible, except for greenhouse gas  carbon dioxide due to space heating, mainly from  natural gas-fuelled boilers. An overall evaluation of our  activities has identified consumption of energy and water as  well as use of non-renewable raw materials, including some of  environmental concern, as the areas with the greatest potential for  environmental improvement. In the light of these facts we have  identified as most important topics for environmental improvement: 	 Saving energy and water (see cases on page 3) 	 Optimising material utilisation 	 Substituting substances of environmental concern Action plans on these topics will benefit the environment as well as  improve the competitiveness of nkt cables. Production scrap is an inevitable follower with industrial activities.  Since 2008 the material utilisation efficiency has increased from  95.2% to 95.8%. This means a reduction of more than 2,000 tonnes  CO2 in our total carbon footprint (cradle to cable). Over the years, nkt cables has made a great effort to substitute  substances of environmental concern. For example we were the  first to provide lead-free PVC cables in the 1990s, ten years later  we substituted the PVC softener DEHP with other phthalates of  minor health concern and we marketed halogen and PVC-free  alternatives for installation cables.  Moreover, we have successfully extended our business involvement  in the fields of renewable energy by assisting our customers in  conserving natural resources and reducing CO2 emissions. Our  submarine cables are instrumental in realising the benefits of  offshore wind farms, and our supply of monitoring solutions and  technologies contributes to significant reductions of transmission  and distribution losses. Goals &  aCtioNs Environment Deadline Status 30.06.12 CO2 emissions CO2 emission from heating reduced to less than 80% of 2008 level.  31.12.13  Derived goal: As 34% reduction has been achieved already, the goal is tightened up to be less than  60% before end 2013. 31.12.13 Reduce total CO2 emission from heating and production by 4-5% compared to 2008 level corrected  for climate and insourcing (5.1% reached in the present reporting period). 31.12.13 Optimise the energy consumption on machinery. Ongoing measurements followed by analysis of data  will lead to definition of specific goals. 31.12.13 Material utilisation efficiency Material utilisation is to be increased by 0.2% per year from 95.2% in 2008 to reach 96% in 2012 (1st half 2012: 95.8%). 31.12.12 New goal: Increase utilisation 0.1% per year. 31.12.13 - and ongoing Water  Water saving of 35% per tonne cable produced compared to 2010 (last 12 months: 26% savings). 31.12.13   Not accomplished                Partly accomplished or behind schedule            Accomplished or on track ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) Environment Scope 2 15% Scope 1 3% Scope 3 82% 375,000 tonnes Co2 total emission (cradle to cable) 80% of nkt cables carbon footprint is  at our suppliers of raw materials Scope1: Direct combustion of fossil energy sources Scope2: Procured energy in the form of electricity  and heat Scope 3: Production of raw materials, transportation  of goods, and business flights 6/8 nkt cables group  |  CSR Report 2011-12    nkt cables engages in transparent business relations with partners  who should respect the UN Global Compact principles. We are  committed to taking responsible corrective action wherever and  whenever we detect deviations from these principles.  nkt cables management has established rules and guidelines based  on these principles and encourages our employees to view them as  non-negotiable.  Once a year, local management teams must draft and sign a  Statement of Representation to ensure knowledge and adherence  to the set of rules. Additionally, as part of an awareness campaign  the management has given presentations emphasising compliance  with laws and regulations. A whistleblower system has been rolled out in nkt cables. During  the reporting year the internal company newsletter was used to  encourage the use of this facility. The system is designed to let any  individual employee anonymously raise significant concerns so that  wrongdoings or irregularities that may arise can be stopped, thus  protecting the companies in the NKT Group and its stakeholders.  Management support for this system sends a clear signal to  everybody that we will act in the event of wrongdoings or  irregularities. Although not an anti-corruption case, it should be mentioned that  in July 2011 nkt cables and NKT Holding received a Statement of  Objections from the European Commission in connection with the  Commissions investigation of the submarine and underground high  voltage cable markets in the period 1998-2008. nkt cables and NKT  Holding examined the documentation from the European  Commission and submitted their response by the deadline in early  November 2011. Subsequently, the European Commission  produced additional documents, and nkt cables and NKT Holding  launched a review. The findings of this review were submitted on 16  March 2012. nkt cables and NKT Holding gave an oral presentation  of NKTs viewpoints at a hearing held by the European Commission  in June 2012. The European Commission is expected to reach a  decision on this issue within the next few years. Goals &  aCtioNs Anti-Corruption Deadline Status 30.06.12 Anti-Corruption Explicit communication is to be established and understood by all employees and business partners.
