These forecasts and  statements include potential risk and uncertainty, and  the reader should be aware that the actual results of  business activities may di er from these predictions. Forecasts and forward-looking statements 2  The recent Great East Japan Earthquake has in icted  unimaginable damage. Many people su ered enormous  destruction, including Casio customers and suppliers.  Along with our heartfelt condolences to these victims, I  would like to express our hopes for a speedy recovery. I  would also like to take this opportunity to express  gratitude for all the heartfelt support that the people of  Japan have received from around the world.  Some Casio sites were also a ected by the disaster,  but through the cooperation of all employees, we were  able to rapidly restore business operations. Although  there has been some impact on the business, we are  taking various measures to minimize it.  Casio will continue to help with reconstruction by pro- viding various forms of support, always based on the  needs of people in the disaster-struck region and cre- ative ideas about how to provide assistance. Great East Japan Earthquake Casio was founded with the invention of the worlds  rst  compact, fully electric calculator in 1957.  At that time, Japanese businesses mainly used for- eign-made, electric-powered mechanical calculators.  Casios breakthrough calculator however, was smaller  and quieter while o ering more rapid calculation. Since  it provided much better performance in many areas, it  immediately penetrated the calculator market. Developing a completely novel product that has never  existed beforelike that calculatoris exactly how we  provide new value to the world. Over the more than 50  years that followed, Casio has developed more world-  rsts and a whole range of other original products,  including personal calculators, digital watches, electron- ic musical instruments, electronic dictionaries, and digi- tal cameras. We have consistently kept providing new  value to the world.  As we help to make peoples lives more convenient  and comfortable, and the world recognizes the value of  what we do, whole new markets and cultural develop- ments emerge. This is how we are realizing our corpo- rate creed, Creativity and Contribution. It is simply in  Casios DNA to make something from nothingto go  from 0 to 1. Casio began focusing on environmental issues early on,  and we have been working to reduce the environmental  impact of our products. We strive to o er products with  high performance that are consistently compact, light- weight, slim, and energy e  cient.  Going beyond product development, our environmen- tal initiatives include action plans for the management of  business sites with, for instance, medium and long-term  greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and activi- ties for the protection of biodiversity.  Providing new value to the world Building a more sustainable world Message from the President We are always aiming to provide new value and be a company essential to society. 3  By exchanging opinions with stakeholders, Casio is also  working to help solve social problems in various  elds  relating to our business management.   In the area of school education in particular, we con- tinue to hold meetings with teachers in Japan and  around the world. We strive to research their teaching  methods, and use their feedback for product  development.  In our product development, Casio continues to work  on making daily life more convenient for people world- wide. This includes market-specific development of  products such as a calculator with Indian digit  grouping.  Meanwhile, in order to ensure that future generations  will inherit an even better world, Casio is continuing to  fund pioneering and creative research by young re- searchers through the Casio Science Promotion Foun- dation. In addition to the target areas of electronics and  mechanical engineering, the funded  elds include natu- ral sciences relating to health and energy conservation,  as well as the cultural sciences. In this way, Casio is con- tributing broadly to the future of science and  technology.  Casio is also continuing to educate the next genera- tion based on unique programs o ered for children who  will be the opinion leaders and citizens of tomorrow.  To build a more sustainable world, Casio is striving to  realize its corporate creed, Creativity and Contribution.  While continuing to provide the world with new value, we  are helping to solve relevant environmental and social  issues using an approach that is integrated with our  business activities. Our balanced initiatives are based on  the triple bottom line of economic, environmental, and  social performance. Casio products are produced with the cooperation of  not just our group companies, but many component  makers and consignment manufacturers around the  world. As a company with global operations, Casio re- spects international standards relating to human rights,  labor, environment and anti-corruption. By ful lling our  corporate social responsibilities, Casio is promoting the  ongoing development of the international community.   As part of these e orts, Casio joined the UN Global  Compact in December 2010.  In the near future, the principles of the Global Compact  will be incorporated explicitly into various aspects of our  corporate management, and we will disclose progress  updates at the appropriate times.  This report highlights the main initiatives taken by  Casio in  scal 2011. I encourage all of our stakeholders  to review the information provided here. I look forward  to your feedback, which will be used to improve our fu- ture initiatives. Your continuing support is greatly  appreciated. Kazuo Kashio President & CEO Participating in the Global Compact 4  Making innovative products and contributing to social progressthese were the aspirations of Casios  founders, and they are summed up in the corporate creed, Creativity and Contribution. Casio has carefully  passed down this corporate creed to all of its employees today. By following the creed and practicing the  Charter of Creativity for Casio and Casio Common Commitment, Casio is ful lling its social responsibilities in  all of its corporate activities. The world today is faced with complex economic, envi- ronmental and social problems of a very serious nature.  Humanity as a whole needs to consider what a desirable  society is, and then  nd ways to resolve these problems.  If economic activities are to be maintained on this planet  with limited resources, every member of society must  try to help achieve sustainability. Accordingly, Casios   Working to build a more sustainable world aim is to contribute to society through the resolution of  social and environmental issues related directly and indi- rectly to business management, while continuing to  provide new value to society, based on its corporate  creed of Creativity and Contribution. Casio will steadily  pursue speci c initiatives while always thinking originally  about the best ways to solve each issue.

At Casio Thailand, where 90% of em- ployees are locally hired, the company has a human resources policy that emphasizes the needs of Thai employees. The  company is engaged in a wide range of activities that contribute to and deepen relationships with the local community. Creation of a facility to support breastfeeding mothers About 90% of Casio Thailand employees are women, and  each month three to  ve of them have babies. According  to Thai law, female employees are allowed three months  maternity leave after giving birth. When they returned to  work, however, they were not able to pump and store  breast milk during the work day, in order to provide the  infant at home with an adequate milk supply.  Therefore, Casio Thailand created an onsite room where  mothers can pump and  store breast milk. In addi- tion to providing refriger- ator space for hygienic  milk storage and special  storage packages, there  is air conditioning and air  purification equipment.  Consequently, the room  has clean air, preventing  Employee welfare program any viruses and bacteria from getting  into the milk during storage.  A special instructor is also available  to provide guidance to women during  and after pregnancy on how to pump  the breast milk and store it safely. A  course is also provided to teach preg- nant employees about health and nutri- tion management. In this way, the com- pany is enabling more employees to  balance their work and family lives. Casio Thailands Global Management Root- ed in Local Community I use the facility in order to have a break  and pump a supply of milk to take home.  Since the room is very hygienic, I feel con-  dent about taking the milk home to my  child. It really helps to relieve breast pain.  I feel the company is truly caring for the  health of employees and our families. Employee feedback Natthida Longkrue Human resources development and employee welfare programs Breast milk support room Womens social advancement in Thailand is progressing. Because of this, Casio Thailand is putting particular ef- fort into childcare support. The company has various programs such as training and seminars to help employees  develop together with the company and build their careers. Aiming for management rooted in local communities,  Casio Thailand emphasizes human resources develop- ment, employee welfare programs and support for the  local community. In order to realize these goals, the  company has established human resources deployment  guidelines and CSR activity policies, and is undertaking  various activities accordingly.   Human resources development and employee  welfare programs Based on its human resources deployment guidelines,  Casio Thailand is improving employee welfare programs  and providing career development training. Since 90%  of its employees are women, the company is creating  workplaces that enable sta  to balance work and family  responsibilities, including setting up a special facility to  support breastfeeding mothers.  The company also supports human resources devel- opment by o ering training programs based on various  roles and pro ciency levels.   Supporting the local community Casio Thailand places importance on  improving quality of life in the local  community, while contributing to eco- nomic and social development that  makes local residents self reliant.  Using this CSR activity policy, the  company has established guidelines  and is carrying out various initiatives.  Based on a positive evaluation of  the activities and results under this  policy, Casio Thailand has received an award from the  Thai Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare as an out- standing company in the area of labor relations and  employee welfare. The company has received this  award for  ve consecutive years.  The company received high marks in all  ve evalua- tion areas for the award: (1) codi cation of human re- sources and labor union policies; (2) wage and salary  systems; (3) hotline establishment; (4) employee welfare  programs; and (5) CSR activities.

The temple  looks after over 200 poor children and orphans, so they  received food and supplies as well.  In the Buddhist country of Thailand, it is considered very  commendable to make an o ering to the monks, who are  a symbol of goodness. Since the monks pray for the hap- piness and prosperity of those that make o erings, the  donors are also grateful for this kind of chance.  Consequently, Casio Thailand employees are pleased by  such company donation opportunities. While engaging in  charitable activities, the company is also supporting local  culture, and giving employees a lot of peace of mind. Casio Thailand is supporting the job search e orts of stu- dents by inviting them to company presentations and fac- tory tours, thereby providing them with opportunities to  learn about the companys activities. Due to the impact of  a long-running internal dispute in Thailand, there have been  very few opportunities for students to receive training at  private companies. By providing them with these opportu- nities, Casio is helping to develop the next generation of  citizens in Thailand. These e orts have been recognized by  From mid-October to mid-November 2010, there was  widespread  ooding in Thailand, resulting in major dam- age. Fortunately, Casio Thailand did not su er any dam- age, but some homes of employees were  ooded, and  there was damage in the surrounding communities.  Along with donating corporate relief funds, the company  also encouraged employees to donate cash or supplies for   ood victims. The total funds along with relief supplies,  such as food and candles, were sent to the governor of the  Career development and training programs Casio Thailand has training programs to support the ca- reer development of employees. The programs are open  to all employees from general sta  to managers, and in- clude on-the-job  training, lectures and  seminars.

Casio  Thailand employees also  participated in the distribu- tion of relief aid, and they  delivered relief supplies di- rectly to disaster victims.  Employees can gain spe- cialized knowledge for  their jobs or learn about  legal compliance at semi- nars and lectures given by  outside experts or employ- ees with the necessary  quali cations and experi- ence. In  scal 2011, an of-  cial from the Ministry of  Labor was invited to come  and give a seminar entitled  The Latest Safety Laws and Taking Action for Legal  Compliance. It was attended by safety committee manag- ers and in-house safety instructors. Lecture Training for factory employees With the aim of supporting local communities, Casio is promoting various activities for social contribution and  community outreach. The company also provides job hunting support to students and hosts factory tours, in or- der to contribute towards the revitalization of society through employment.

Casio would also like to take this opportunity to express gratitude for all the heartfelt support that the  people of Japan have received from around the world.   Below is a report on the e ects sustained by Casio and its response to the earthquake disaster (as of July  31, 2011). Although some of Casios business sites were damaged, fortunately employees and their families were not harmed, and  the group was able to recover quickly. Nevertheless, operations at production sites have slowed slightly as a result of  delays in the procurement of parts due to the damage sustained by certain suppliers.  In response, Casio has decentralized suppliers, started manufacturing parts in-house, and taken other measures to  get operations back up to speed as soon as possible. The Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent power interruptions have had no impact on the quality of Casio  products. The radioactive contamination from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station has had no im- pact on Casios production facilities in Yamagata and Yamanashi prefectures. The radiation levels in both prefectures  were surveyed by Japans Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the readings were below  levels harmful to the human body. Casio products are also regularly checked for radiation at production and logistics  sites, and their safety has been con rmed. As a support measure for people in areas stricken by the Great East Japan Earthquake, Casio o ered to repair Casio  brand consumer products at half the usual price for products damaged in municipalities where the Disaster Relief Act  was applied. This o er was made available until September 30, 2011. Casio donated a total of 55 million yen in relief funds to Japan Platform in order to help the victims and assist in the  recovery e ort. The company also matched the donations of its employees with an equal or greater amount. Casio  Group employees worldwide donated a total of about 10.57 million yen, which was matched by Casio Computer Co.,  Ltd., with an additional 22 million yen, for a total of 32.57 million yen. This money was donated to the Japanese Red  Cross Society, local governments in the disaster-a ected areas (through the Japanese Association of Metal, Machinery,  and Manufacturing workers), and Japan Platform.  Casio is also making ongoing donations to the Ashinaga Donation Fund for Children Orphaned by the Great East  Japan Earthquake and Tsunami operated by Ashinaga, a non-pro t organization, in order to support children who lost  their parents in the disaster. In  scal 2012, Casio donated 5 million yen and will continue to donate 2 million yen per  year over 10 years for a total amount of 25 million yen.  All told, donations of aid money from the Casio Group will total 102 million yen.  Additionally, Casio is providing ongoing non-monetary support, including the donation of clocks for temporary hous- ing, digital cameras with hybrid GPS for disaster response headquarters in prefectures and municipalities a ected by  the disaster, and calculators for schools that lost teaching materials.  Casio is committed to continuing to provide as much support as it can to meet the needs of people in the disaster- a ected areas. Since the earthquake disaster, Casio has undertaken a number of energy-saving measures such as turning o  some  lights in o  ces and billboards, changing air conditioning temperatures, stopping some elevators, and expanding the  length of the summertime cool-biz campaign (which encourages people to dress more casually to save on air- conditioning).  In response to the power usage restrictions issued in the summer of 2011 based on Article 27 of Japans Electricity  Business Act, Casio is working to strengthen the above energy-saving measures and making other aggressive e orts  to comply with the restrictions, including moving days o  from Saturday to Wednesday.  In July, Casio established a system to monitor electricity use at principal sites during working hours via an internal  portal, which will help raise the awareness of employees at each business site to remember to save electricity by letting  them see how much energy is being used in real time.

Casio focuses on daily improvement in order to provide customers with reliabil- ity and peace of mind, and to meet customer demands with speed and integrity. In order to deliver products and services that o er reli- ability and peace of mind to customers, Casio is con- stantly working on improvements to pursue the best  solution for customers.

Toward this end, Casio Quality includes  everything from the quality of individual products, to  environmental protection and recycling. The role of  quality assurance is to deliver quality that satis es cus- tomers in every possible way.  Quality assurance at Casio In order to carefully maintain and improve Casio Quality,  the company has created the quality assurance system  shown in the diagram below. Chaired by the Executive  Vice President, the Promotion Committee for Group- wide Quality Enhancement meets twice a year. It pursues   Quality assurance system activities such as making quality data accessible and  easy to understand, and sharing quality information,  while passing resolutions on quality policy and mea- sures.

In order to create a common group-wide awareness of  Quality First being the foundation all operations, strong  leadership is essential from top management and those  responsible for quality. The Promotion Committee for  Group-wide Quality Enhancement implements training to  ensure employees understand and are widely aware of  regulations and standards relating to quality and safety,  and to learn technology expertise. This includes holding  presentations for the improvement of quality manage- ment skills.  Moreover, Casio is striving to raise the level of quality  initiatives and improve the quality skills of employees,  including the holding of in-house seminars given by out- side instructors.  Casios production plants carry out plan-do-check-act  (PDCA) cycles using the ISO 9001 Quality Management  System. In order to deliver reliability and peace of mind  to customers that use Casio products, Casio employees  focus on daily improvement.

In order to improve customer satisfaction (CS), in  scal  2009, Casio began strengthening its initiatives for the  three main CS activities listed below. The company is  working to incorporate the voice of the customer more  than ever before in the creation of even better  products. After-sales CS:  Responding to customer requests and  inquiries with service that is fast, accu- rate, and polite Functional CS:  Striving to create value and product  functionality that leads to customer  satisfaction Quality CS:  Working to strengthen product quality to  assure customer satisfaction  Raising Customer Satisfaction Customer feedback is essential information for product  improvement, and Casio regularly conducts customer  satisfaction surveys.

With regard to after- sales CS activities, in  scal 2011 Casio established its  own survey method, recognizing the importance of con- tinually ascertaining customer satisfaction levels.  Casio is also working hard to ensure that customer  feedback is always delivered to the relevant depart- ments, and that uni ed improvement measures are tak- en by those departments. The company is also working  to ensure continual enhancement of product functions  (functional CS), through daily e orts such as research  into various industry-leading technologies.  Casio gathers and analyzes the details of customer  inquiries regarding product quality, and strives to rapidly  detect and respond to any problems. comments received by the Customer Support Center,  Casio is striving to develop even better products and  improve the level of customer satisfaction. Casio works to develop products using human-centered  design (HCD) in conformity with ISO 13407 processes,  with the objective of improving product ease of use as  part of the products overall quality. In the HCD process,  Casio seeks optimal ease of use by determining impor- tant issues from customer feedback and observation of  product use in real-world situations. Through repeated  evaluation and verification, Casio works to develop  highly desirable products.  In  scal 2011, Casio made its multi-function chrono- graph watches even easier to use. During the develop- ment of the OCW-T1000, issues with the complicated  operations necessary for function setting were identi-  ed in the HCD process, and a new electronic crown was  developed that enables more intuitive operation.

Nine  teachers passionate about mathe- matics education were invited from  the US, Germany, France, Australia,  and Norway. The meeting has been  held regularly since 2007, in order  to obtain product feedback from  teachers living in di erent parts of  the world, and contribute to the de- velopment of mathematics educa- tion in classrooms.  The main theme of this years  meeting was the perfection of the  color graphing scienti c calculator,  planned for worldwide launch in  2011. There was a lively exchange  of opinions based on the needs of  actual classrooms. These opinions  were immediately examined by the  product development team, and the   nal product was improved to en- able a deeper understanding of the  relationship between mathematics  and events in daily life. Improvements  included the color coding of corre- sponding data on graphs, which was  hard to follow on previous graphing  models, and the layering of graphs  on top of real-life images.

Every year, Casio holds brie ngs on its Pro- curement Policies in Southern China and Thailand.  In the past, these brie ngs simply involved Casio ex- plaining its business policies to suppliers and asking  them to undertake initiatives. Starting in  scal 2010  however, Casio is using these brie ngs as an opportu- nity for interaction, for instance, by having a selected  supplier present its own exemplary CSR initiatives.  Through joint e orts with suppliers, Casio is aiming for  continued improvement in the level of CSR  performance.  More recently, Casio asked suppliers whose sites it  had audited for CSR performance to present examples  of their e orts to improve CSR activities. It is proving  highly e ective to share case studies and know-how  when addressing CSR issues.  Disseminating supplier guidelines In  scal 2008, Casio started conducting a questionnaire  survey* of principal suppliers in Japan on CSR perfor- mance in order to con rm the status of CSR procure- ment. In  scal 2010, the survey was expanded to include  suppliers in China and Thailand. Additionally, starting in   scal 2010, Casio has been evaluating suppliers in Ja- pan based on a  ve-point scoring system for all 340  items in the Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook  published by the Japan Electronics and Information  Technology Industries Association (JEITA), in an e ort to  gain a better grasp of and visualize the situation.  In  scal 2011, Casio again conducted a questionnaire  survey of suppliers in and outside Japan. The results  were sent back to all suppliers, along with information  on Casios approach and goals for CSR procurement, to  help support suppliers improvement e orts.  After the questionnaire survey was conducted, imple- mentation audits of major suppliers in China (three com- panies) and Thailand (two companies) were carried out  with local sta  members of the CSR promotion project  launched at overseas sites. During these audits, opin- ions were exchanged with suppliers managers and com- mitments received from them to make new develop- ments, including improvement e orts in the next  scal  year, by deepening their understanding of CSR  performance.

Casio respects the human rights of every individual, and strives to continually expand the creation of employ- ment opportunities for people, regardless of their gender or any disabilities they may have. The Casio Group Code of Conduct mandates that the  Casio Group complies with all laws, respects all funda- mental human rights, will not engage in any form of dis- crimination, and will not use or permit any form of child  or forced labor. The Code of Conduct also stipulates that  Casio will respect the diversity of individuals and their  unique personalities, will not engage in any acts that ig- nore individuality, including discrimination based on gen- der, creed, religion, ethnicity, social status, physical dis- ability, or any other discriminator, and will not permit acts  of violence, sexual harassment, or power harassment.

Career Challenge: Advanced This program preferentially places employees who have  been in their current career position for a rather long  time and hope to challenge themselves to pursue work  environments and careers that require new skills, for the  objective of self-improvement and making further con- tributions to the company, in their desired divisions, if  their desires meet the needs of the new department.  Group-wide Job Posting System This system seeks to satisfy both the companys busi- ness needs and employees career paths, and is a pro- gram for priority placement of suitable people, based on  selection of candidates for jobs which the company of- fers. It is operated jointly with other Casio group  companies.   New Employee Training, Follow-up Training, Career  Development Training Training for young employees becomes a place for  learning the basics of being a Casio employee, and of- fers opportunities for employees to consider their own  career paths, with training for new entrants as well as  one-year and three-year employees.

Techno Power This is a technology exhibition held annually for the ob- jective of stimulating engineers, and of sharing and ac- cumulating technology, serving as a place for recogniz- ing technology superiority, patentability, completeness,  and other in-house advanced technology.  Advanced Technology Seminars These are in-house seminars mainly targeting engineers,  using case studies of innovators at other companies  who were able to develop revolutionary new manufac- turing methods and create new businesses, for the ob- jective of understanding advanced technology trends  and of fostering a development mindset and the will to  take on challenges.  Intrapreneurship Program Casio established its Intrapreneurship Program in April  2010 to foster the desire to take on challenges and ex- pand opportunities for new business development. The  program allows individual employees to make their own  business proposals to top management. Those employ- ees whose proposals are approved as management  themes become the project leaders, and then work to  realize the goals they proposed. Additionally, career interviews are conducted with those  who desire one and support provided as appropriate  when employees consider their career direction.

In order to ensure proper work schedules, all em- ployees that work 80 hours or more of overtime in a  month must be interviewed by an industrial physician. The  physician then checks the employees health condition,   Initiative to prevent working long hours Casio goes beyond employee health management. It  also seeks, by taking active measures to promote better  health, to improve employee motivation and raise  productivity.  Employees receive regular health checks that are  more thorough than legally mandated, in order to main- tain and enhance their health and to help prevent life- style-related diseases. An increased number of indus- trial physicians have been stationed at principal Casio  sites, and careful health management activities are be- ing carried out, including o ering health guidance to  employees after their regular health checks.  In the e ort to prevent lifestyle-related illnesses, Casio  is promoting initiatives that focus on exercise and  healthy eating. From September to November every  year, Casio holds a Walking Campaign at its sites across  Japan: 2,809 people participated in  scal 2011.

Aiming to help create a healthy, generous society, Casio  is earnestly engaged in a variety of social contribution  initiatives. Casio takes good corporate citizenship liter- ally, so its process for determining the most useful  things to do is guided by communication with various  stakeholders. The  ve priority themes of Casios social  contribution initiatives are outlined in the  gure below.  Leveraging its unique know-how and management re- sources as well as the wide range of knowledge and ex- perience possessed by its employees, Casio ful lls its  social responsibilities in its own innovative way.  Going forward, Casio will continue to provide assistance  to people su ering in the aftermath of the Great East Ja- pan Earthquake. Casio also plans to make sure that its  social contribution initiatives target global challenges.  Philosophy on Social Contribution Factory tours, classes in the company, and school visits In 2004, Kofu Casio started the Factory Tours for  10,000 People educational program with the aim of giv- ing children awareness through factory tours that can  help link family connectedness, the power of science,  and the realization of dreams with the power to live.  In 2007, Casio started an original educational program  for elementary school students including school visits  and classes o ered at the Hachioji R&D Center.  The school visit program is roughly divided into three  parts. The  rst part covers the importance of life through  connectedness, creativity, and emotional growth. In the  second part the students take apart and then reassem- ble a calculator to learn about environmentally friendly  product technology. In the  nal segment, the instructor  explains the importance of protecting the global environ- ment with speci c examples. The program is designed to  help the children think for themselves, to understand the  importance of empathy, kindness, goodwill, and a smile,  and to foster generosity of spirit by raising awareness.  The classes o ered at the Hachioji R&D Center are  focused more on environmental initiatives. Touring the  facilities at the Hachioji R&D Center, one of the most  advanced environmentally friendly business sites in the  Casio Group, gives children an experience intended to  promote their awareness and understanding of the  need to protect the global environment.  Raising up the next generation People are very interested in  the Factory Tours for 10,000  People program, which en- ables visitors to observe and  experience things for them- selves.  The Hachioji R&D Center reg- ularly holds classes for Casio  employees and their family  members. The school visit program is of- fered for students from kin- dergarten through university.  Casios social contribution priorities Education of the next generation Community service Culture and arts Casios social contribution priorities Study and research Environmental conservation 26 Responsibilities to Stakeholders Environmental Initiatives Philosophy and Management   The school visit program is o ered for students from  kindergarten through university and has been spreading  around the country. In  scal 2011, these learning op- portunities were provided to a total of 1,932 students at  45 schools.  In fiscal 2011, Casio started offering cooperative  classes with several universities a  liated with NGOs/ NPOs. These classes give college students a chance to  interact directly with the public and are also used to give  students hoping to become educators someday some  experience with teaching.  After these activities, the students have held their own  summits to discuss issues such as life, peace, human  rights, poverty, and the environment, and multiple elemen- tary schools have rolled out interesting social initiatives.  One elementary school became the  rst to exhibit at  Children have unlimited possibilities and high  aspirations. They have a great deal of power  to change the world of adults. Children will  eventually become the leaders of society. We  should help them to build a more sustainable  world by giving them early sentiments on  life, which is the starting point of living. That  is why we place value on the Class on Life.  Children who have had contact with senti- ments on life and fostered awareness and  aspirations engage on their own with peace,  human rights, poverty or environmental initia- tives. Efforts to foster children who can  change society for the better by thinking and  acting for themselves are important as a cor- porate social responsibility. From here on, we  will work even harder on this, as a core part of  our CSR initiatives. I was recently transferred to Nagatadai Ele- mentary School. Thinking that I would really  like the children here to experience the class  o ered by Mr. Hiroshi Wakao of Casio Com- puter Co., Ltd., I asked him to conduct a  school visit.  For a long time children in the individual  support class at Nagatadai Elementary School  have grown plants outside the building to cre- ate green curtains that keep the building cool  in summer, recycled vegetable peels and rain  water, and undertaken other sustainable prac- tices. I really wanted to exhibit these e orts at  the Eco-Products exhibition.  I hoped that the exhibition would boost the  childrens self-con dence by letting people  know about their initiatives. When we con ne  our thinking to just within the school, our ef- forts tend to get stuck in a dead end, and so  I asked Mr. Wakao for broad-ranging advice.  Mr. Wakaos continued involvement has  helped to broaden and deepen the childrens  learning. Seeing how he interacts in earnest  with the children and keeps talking to them,  the teaching sta  too has obtained new in- sights and strengthened its dedication to ed- ucation. This has also led to forward-thinking  e orts within Kanagawa Prefecture, such as  our membership in the UNESCO Associated  Schools. I am very grateful.

In   scal 2011, two elementary schools exhibited.  What is more, Nagatadai Elementary School in Yoko- hama, Kanagawa Prefecture, which became involved  through Casios school visit program, declared its desire  to become a UNESCO Associated School in order to  engage actively in Education for Sustainable Develop- ment (ESD). In  scal 2011, the school was the  rst ele- mentary school in Kanagawa Prefecture to obtain certi-  cation from UNESCO.  Taking the ESD initiatives recommended by Japans  Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and  Technology seriously, Casio will continue expanding  these initiatives in collaboration with educational institu- tions in the future. 3.11I think that this great disaster  has become a major turning point not  just for individuals, but also for corpo- rations and NGOs/NPOs. It has  changed their values and altered the  course of disaster support.  Through the cooperation of Mr.  Wakao of Casio Computer Co., Ltd.,  my NGO, People for the Advancement  of Cambodian Education, has had op- portunities to give lectures at elemen- tary schools and at the Japan Interna- tional Cooperation Agency (JICA).  Children have the power to change  the world of adults. Being able to  communicate these words from Mr.  Wakao together with the things that  we have gained from our actions on  the ground in Cambodia to as many  children in Japan as possible has been  a very valuable experience for us.  Corporations and NPOsalthough  their standpoints are di erent, I think  that having been able to work on a  public awareness campaign together  became a trigger for the further ex- pansion of our initiatives. I believe that  this overlaps exactly the spectacle of  the Japanese people, of NGOs/NPOs,  and of corporations groping for what  that each could do and then taking  action in response to the disaster.  I am determined to give my best in  all our endeavors from here on, not  just public awareness campaigns. Message from an NPO Noriko Takahashi People for the Advancement of Cambodian  Education 27 Responsibilities to Stakeholders Environmental Initiatives Philosophy and Management  Support for the Casio Science Promotion Foundation Casio is contributing to the development of science and  technology by supporting the Casio Science Promotion  Foundation. About the Foundation The Casio Science Promotion Foundation was estab- lished in 1982 by the four Kashio brothers and the for- mer chairman, Shigeru Kashio.  The Foundation provides research grants with the  principle objective of fostering pioneering and creative  research in the early stages by young researchers who  are persevering with challenging research on limited  funding. This is based on the philosophy that advanced  R&D should be promoted in various  elds, in order to  ful ll the Foundations mission of helping Japan contrib- ute to the world as a nation of advanced technology. Grants in  scal 2011 In addition to its 21 basic categories in 5  elds, in  scal   Academic Research 2011 the Foundation established 3 special topics con- sidered to be important based on recent social trends:  miniaturization and energy-saving technology; electronic  devices for the maintenance and improvement of health;  and human intellectual progress in an IT society.  After a rigorous selection process, 44.00 million (34  grants) was awarded in the natural sciences, and 6.75  million (5 grants) was awarded in the cultural sciences.  Over the last 28 years, the Foundation has provided a  total of about 1,332 million in 1,053 grants. The Casio Science Promotion Foundation donated  10 million yen to three universities in the Tohoku  region that were severely damaged in the earth- quake disaster in order to support the earliest pos- sible recovery of university research. Recipients: Tohoku University: 5 million yen Tohoku Gakuin University:  2 million yen Fukushima University:  3 million yen Relief for the Great East Japan Earthquake Thank you very much for the research grant from  the Casio Science Promotion Foundation. I am  grateful to the selection committee and everyone  involved. My research is concerned with energy-re- lated materials. Since the energy  eld is a pressing  issue, there is a tendency merely to improve on ex- isting research and to neglect basic research. In  this context, Casio was bold enough to understand  the value of my extreme- ly challenging proposal,  which could be seen as a  privilege of academics. I  will work at developing  an innovative energy  device so that it can help  in the restoration of  Japan. I ask for your  continued guidance and  encouragement in the  future.

Environmental Management Policy On behalf of everyone at Casio, I would like to take this  opportunity to express our heartfelt condolences to the  victims of the recent Great East Japan Earthquake and  their families. We o er our sincere hopes for a speedy  recovery and reconstruction.  The earthquake also resulted in a series of  res, nuclear  meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at  several reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power  Station operated by the Tokyo Electric Power Company,  and this continuing challenge has yet to be fully resolved.  As a result, on June 1, 2011, the Japanese govern- ment issued power usage restrictions for large power  customers (power contracts of 500 kW or more) of the  Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Tohoku Electric  Power Company, based on Article 27 of the Electricity  Business Act. Energy saving measures are also required  for small electrical users and households.  Given this situation, Casio is striving to reduce its  energy usage in Japan by adopting creative ideas from  employees. Emergency energy-saving measures are  being carried out in various areas in order to ensure a  reliable foundation for our business. Casio sites required  to restrict power usage based on Article 27 of the Elec- tricity Business Act are taking the necessary measures  to comply with it.    The international COP16 conference on climate  change was held in Cancun, Mexico in late November  and early December 2010, and the Copenhagen Accord  from COP15 was formally adopted. However, regarding  the extension of the Kyoto Protocol to which Japan,  Russia, and Canada are opposed, continued discussion is  still needed while respecting the position of developing  countries.  As for developments in the protection of biodiversity,  COP10 was held in Nagoya in October 2010. The con- ference adopted the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which  outline 20 targets including long-term targets to be  achieved by 2050 in order to build human societies that  live in harmony with nature, as well as short-term targets  Casios goal is to help build a more sustainable world while contributing to the  creation of new markets and cultural phenomenon by developing compact,  lightweight, slim, and energy-e  cient products. to be achieved by 2020 in order to stop the loss of bio- diversity. The Nagoya Protocol was also adopted, which  sets out methods for the acquisition and handling of  genetic resources and the distribution of their bene ts.  Speci c initiatives are now needed for the protection  of biodiversity.  Since  scal 2010, we have been promoting environ- mental management with the objective of building a low- carbon society. Given the recent environmental trends,  however, starting in  scal 2012 we intend to add the  protection of biodiversity as an additional objective of  our environmental management. Casio will take steps to  achieve both these objectives.  In order to improve resource productivity, Casio is  contributing to both the  ght against climate change  and the protection of biodiversity by leveraging its  expertise in creating products that are compact, light- weight, slim and energy efficient, thereby saving re- sources (parts/materials, and plant-derived materials).

Accordingly, Casio has adopted the following  Environmental Management Policy. reduction e ects of Casios eco-products such as data  projectors, electronic dictionaries and other products  that promote paperless lifestyles.  In addition to the CO2 emissions reduction achieved  by the e orts of the Casio group, the target CO2 emis- sions reduction also includes reductions due to the  availability of cleaner energy such as electricity, and due  to carbon reduction in the entire social infrastructure  (see diagram). ever, with the establishment of its recent medium- and  long-term targets, Casio has now set worldwide targets  for reductions in the total volume of CO2 emissions,  which is a change from previous targets for reduction  per unit of production.  The base year for Casios medium- and long-term tar- gets is  scal 2006, decided based on changes in Casios  business structure, as well as the scope and accuracy of  data acquisition.

Casios current target products for this paperless ini- tiative are data projectors and electronic dictionaries.  Casio calculates the amount of CO2 emitted during the  manufacture and use of these products, as well as the  amount of CO2 absorbed by the trees not harvested to  make the paper saved by these products. When these  two amounts are equal, the products are considered  carbon neutral.  Medium- and long-term targets In order to achieve its medium- and long-term targets  for  scal 2021 and 2051, Casio will steadily promote the  following three points relating to initiatives for green- house gas reduction, taken from the  ve points of the  Casio Environmental Declaration.   1. CO2 reduction and absorption     In order to contribute to the realization of a low- carbon society, Casio will work to create products  that reduce CO2 and systems that absorb CO2  more than ever before.  Measures for achieving medium- and long-term targets Casio is studying the potential of the following initiatives  to achieve the medium-term target for 2020. It will also  strive to assess as quickly as possible their potential to  help meet the 2050 target.  1   Response to social environment changes after the Great  East Japan Earthquake     Responding to energy issues     Introducing renewable energy sources  2.

Over 700 companies and  organizations set up booths to display their environmen- tally friendly products and services. The show attracted  more than 180,000 visitors, the largest attendance to  date. Casio has exhibited each year since the show be- gan, and in 2010 the Casio exhibit was based on the  theme, The Harmony of Technology and Ecology. Di- vided into two zones, the exhibit presented Casio Green  Star products and various other environmental initiatives  taken by the Casio Group to build a more sustainable  world. The Blue Zone featured the results of Casios  initiatives to address climate change, and the Green  Zone highlighted Casios e orts to protect ecosystems,  which are part of its biodiversity preservation initiative.  On the main stage of the exhibit, Casios environmen- tal initiatives were described in a narrated video.   Exhibiting at Eco-Products 2010 Throughout the exhibit space, various displays with  eye-catching copy pointed out all the environmentally  friendly components in various Casio products. And of  course, the ever-popular calculator assembly classes  attracted many children, teens, and young adults.  As the Eco-Products trade show continues to grow in  coming years, Casio will continue to be there to inform  the public about its environmental activities and intro- duce its new environmental concepts and strategies.

Currently, about  30 companies have raised approximately 100 billion yen  from such loans and bonds.  Under this program, the Japan Research Institute  interviews the heads of environmental management  departments at applicant companies concerning the  details of their responses to a survey conducted by the  institute. After making a comprehensive assessment  based on this, SMBC then assigns environmental ratings  to the companies and preferential interest rates are  made available to those with high ratings.  In 2010, Casio applied to participate in this private  placement bond program. Based on the assessment re- sults, the companys environmental corporate manage- ment was deemed to be outstanding, and Casio was  given the highest rating, AAA. The process also helped  Casio to identify issues with its environmental communi- cation, and made it clear that more speci c work needs  to be done to reduce CO2 emissions at sites outside  Japan, performance of waste reduction measures needs   Casio obtains AAA rating for its environmental activities from the SMBC private placement bond program to be improved, and more attention needs to be given to  biodiversity preservation. This feedback will be used to  make improvements to enable Casio to achieve an even  higher level of environmental management. *  A private placement bond (Shibosai bond) is a bond sold directly to a  few investors.

The perfor- mance  gures using comparisons with the base year are average values for  the initial year ( scal 2009) through the third year ( scal 2011).   The target for production sites in Japan was a 35% reduction in CO2  emissions per unit of actual production compared to  scal 1991. In  scal  2011, the sites CO2 emissions were approximately 41% lower than in  scal  1991, which also represented a roughly 12% decrease from the previous   scal year. The main reason for this decline from the previous year was the  transfer of the TFT-LCD and cellular phone businesses, and their removal  from the consolidation scope of the Casio Group.   The target for o  ce sites in Japan was a 9% reduction in the total  amount of CO2 emissions compared to  scal 1991. In  scal 2011, emis- sions were about 26% lower than in  scal 1991, meeting the target again  this year. This was also an approximately 11% reduction from the previous   scal year.   Fiscal 2013 is the target year for all sites outside Japan. The target for  production sites outside Japan was a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions per  unit of production compared to  scal 2005. Fiscal 2011 emissions for  these sites were about 12% lower than in  scal 2005, an approximately  22% reduction from the previous year.   The target for o  ce sites outside Japan was a 3% reduction in the total  amount of CO2 emissions compared to  scal 2005. In  scal 2011, emis- sions were approximately 47% higher than in  scal 2005, which also repre- sented an approximately 2% increase over the previous  scal year.   Casio will continue to strive to improve the energy e  ciency of its pro- duction equipment and to streamline production processes at all of its  production sites in and outside Japan. Casio will also work to reduce CO2  emissions by implementing energy-saving measures for its lighting and  heating/cooling equipment at o  ces in and outside Japan. Casio has set a target of reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases other  than CO2 to less than year 2000 levels by 2010.*    The  scal 2011 results for SF6 emissions were approximately 59% lower  than in 2000, and this represented an approximately 74% reduction com- pared to the previous year. In April 2010, the TFT-LCD business (Kochi  Casio and the electronic component division of the Hachioji R&D Center)  was transferred, and removed from the consolidation scope of the Casio  Group. This was the main reason for the emissions reduction.   In the future, Casio will put e ort into reducing greenhouse gases in- cluding those contained in dust blowers, spot freezing and sprays used  mainly at service sites. 1991 22,693 0.312 2007 79,472 0.209 79,365 0.205 0.181 47,143 53,688 0.240 2008 2009 2010 (FY) Emissions per unit of actual production: tons-CO2/million 0.35 0.30 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0 100,000 75,000 50,000 25,000 0 CO2 emissions: tons- CO2 2011 20,014 0.134 CO2 emissions Emissions per unit of  actual production  CO2 emissions (production sites in Japan) *  Trends in CO2 emissions from energy sources (electrical power, fuel, etc.)  used at production sites in Japan.

The target for production sites in Japan was a 25% reduction in water  resource input per unit of actual production compared to  scal 2001. In   scal 2011, water input per unit of actual production was about 42% lower  than in  scal 2001, which also represented a reduction of about 49% from  the previous  scal year. Total water resource input was down by about 21%  from the previous year. This was due to the transfer of the TFT-LCD and  cellular phone businesses, and their removal from the consolidation scope  of the Casio Group.   The target for production sites outside Japan was a 15% reduction in  water resource input per unit of production compared to  scal 2005. In   scal 2011, the  gure was 15% higher than in  scal 2005, representing an  approximately 40% increase compared to the previous year. This increase  was due to the rise in TFT production output at the Casio Computer (Hong  Kong) Ltd. Casio will continue to strive to reduce water usage. Casio evaluates its waste reduction (waste and valuables) using  scal 2013  as the target year.   The target for reducing waste produced from sites in Japan was a 50%  reduction in waste per unit of actual production compared to  scal 2001. In   scal 2011, waste was reduced by about 43% compared to  scal 2001,  which also represented an approximately 30% reduction from the previous  year. Although the amount of waste produced compared to the previous   scal year fell by about 15%, this was due to the transfer of the TFT-LCD and  cellular phone businesses, and their removal from the consolidation scope of  the Casio Group.    The target for reducing waste from production sites outside Japan was a  30% reduction per unit of production compared to  scal 2005. In  scal  2011, emissions were reduced by about 31% compared to  scal 2004, for  an approximately 22% reduction from the previous year. Further waste  reduction measures for production sites outside Japan are being considered. The reduction target for the usage of o  ce paper at sites in Japan, set in  scal  2010, was a 10% reduction compared to  scal 2008 by  scal 2013, per unit of  sales. The result for  scal 2011 was about 33% higher than in  scal 2008. This  increase was due to a drop in sales, as the total volume of o  ce paper used  fell from 115 tons in 2007 to 75.5 tons in 2010. Along with the increased  promotion of green IT, Casio will reinforce its e orts to reduce paper usage. Reducing PRTR substances The target for reduction of emissions of substances speci ed by Japans  PRTR Act was a 40% reduction per unit of actual production compared to   scal 2004, by  scal 2013. In  scal 2011, Casio met the target for another  consecutive year, with approximately 71% lower emissions than in  scal  2004, which was a reduction of 36% over the previous year. Casio will con- tinue striving to further reduce the use of these chemicals.  Reducing VOCs Fiscal 2011 is the target  scal year for reducing atmospheric emissions of  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from production sites in Japan. The  target was a reduction of 30% compared to  scal 2001. In  scal 2011,  Casios emissions of VOCs were about 55% lower than in  scal 2001,  achieving the target. This also represented a reduction of approximately  34% from the previous  scal year. Casio will continue to pursue VOC re- placements. Reducing NOx, SOx and Dust Casios atmospheric emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides  (SOx) and dust in the peak year of  scal 2006 were 138 tons, 37 tons, and  2 tons, respectively. Emissions in  scal 2011 were 1.9 tons, 1.1 tons, and  0.2 tons, respectively. These dramatic reductions are attributed to the  transfer of the TFT-LCD and cellular phone businesses, and their removal  from the consolidation scope of the Casio Group.   By adjusting settings and practicing indoor temperature management,  Casio also intends to reduce emissions of atmospheric pollution generated  by air conditioning equipment such as hot and chilled water generators). 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 0 0.025 0.020 0.015 0.010 0.005 0 Per unit of actual production: tons-CO2/million Per unit of actual production Generation of waste General waste, etc: [ Volume of Landll disposal Valuable Wastes] 2001 2006 2007 2008 2010 2009 (FY) 1,089 74 29 20 31 0.024 0.018 0.017 0.016 6,414 6,312 4,138 1,679 1,920 1,397 6,614 6,695 4,735 4,392 2,741 25 1,378 2,439 0.020 3,818 2011 7 2,032 0.014 0.014 Generation of waste, and volume  of landll disposal: tons 0.014 753 1,279   Generation of waste, volume of land ll disposal, and waste  per unit of actual production (all sites in Japan)  Waste 0.0105 804 152 0.0093 994 168 0.0110 1,364 311 0.0124 1,238 340 0.0106 951 90 2,000 1,750 1,500 1,250 1,000 750 500 250 0 0.020 0.015 0.010 0.005 0 Per unit of production: tons-CO2/million Per unit of actual production Generation of waste Volume of Landll disposal 2006 0.0120 839 164 2005 2007 2008 2010 0.0083 791 42.4 2011 2009 (FY) Generation of waste, and volume  of landll disposal: tons  Generation of waste, volume of land ll disposal, and waste  per unit of production (production sites outside Japan) 2005 274 318 368 54 46 48 45 384 312 284 2006 2007 2008 2009 (FY) 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 0.0050 0.0040 0.0030 0.0020 0.0010 0 Water resources, and recycled Industrial water: thousand m3 2010 2011 Per unit of actual productions: thousand m3/million Water resources 0.0039 0.0040 0.0034 0.0031 0.0031 0.0032 99 428 0.0045 Recycled industrial water Per unit of actual production   Usage of water resources and recycled industrial water, and  usage per unit of production (production sites outside Japan)  Water resources 2001 2,073 2006 2,851 2,827 1,937 1,876 2,801 208 209 106 125 185 2007 2008 2009 (FY) 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 0 0.012 0.010 0.008 0.006 0.004 0.002 0 Water resources, and recycled Industrial water: thousand m3 2010 Per unit of actual productions: thousand m3/million Water resources 0.0077 0.0075 0.0074 0.0072 0.0065 0.0096 758 48 2011 Recycled industrial water Per unit of actual production 0.0051   Usage of water resources and recycled industrial water, and  input per unit of actual production (Japan production sites) 2008 115 0.00035 98 0.00037 0.00041 91 2009 2010 2011 (FY) Per unit of sales: tons/million 0.00060 0.00045 0.00030 0.00015 0 400 300 200 100 0 Oce paper usage: tons 0.00047 76 Oce paper usage Per unit of sales  Of ce paper usage (all sites in Japan)  Paper 317 211 244 47 52 43 142 32 177 39 2001 2007 2008 2009 (FY) 500 400 300 200 100 0 2010 104 21 2011 VOC usage VOC emissions to the atmosphere VOC usage and emissions to the atmosphere: tpns  VOC usage and emissions to atmosphere (Japan production sites)  VOCs, NOx, SOx, and dust 158 39 2004 2007 2008 2009 (FY) Per unit of actual production: tons/million 0.00014 0.00012 0.00010 0.00008 0.00006 0.00004 0.00002 0 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 2010 182 256 18 16 177 12 110 10 Usage Releases Per  unit of actual production 0.00004 0.00004 0.00005 2011 19 5 0.00003 0.00005 0.00011 PRTR substance usage and releases: tons   PRTR substance usage, releases, and releases per unit of  actual production (Japan production sites)  PRTR 77 22 2 18 5 1 16 5 0.3 11.1 3.90.4 2007 2008 2009 (FY) 100 80 60 40 20 0 Unit: tons 2010 3.21.20.7 2011 NOx emissions SOx emissions Dust emissions  Nox, SOx and dust emissions to atmosphere 45 Responsibilities to Stakeholders Environmental Initiatives Philosophy and Management  Environmental Accounting This section shows a breakdown of the costs for environmental conservation activities and the bene ts of  environmental conservation. Casios capital investments in environmental conserva- tion, including the introduction of equipment to prevent  water pollution, and energy-saving equipment, were val- ued at 137 million in  scal 2011.  The expenses of Casios environmental conservation  activities, including recycling of products, parts and sup- plies such as toner cartridges, as well as the costs of  maintenance of energy-saving and wastewater process- ing facilities, along with costs for processing and reduc- ing waste, were 1,745 million.  That investment resulted in 1,498 million in business  pro ts including a real bene t of 1,304 million from  strengthening recycling activities and a cost savings of  194 million through energy-saving activities and the   Overview of  scal 2011 performance reduction of resources used in product packaging. The   scal years total economic bene ts were 1,854 million.  This includes the reduction of CO2 emissions from busi- ness activities, and the reduction of power consumption  during product use by customers. It also includes esti- mated economic bene t such as the environmental im- pact reduction achieved by paperless products includ- ing electronic dictionaries and data projectors.  Although the environmental expenses and economic  bene ts were lower than in the previous  scal year due  to the transfer of the TFT-LCD and cellular phone busi- nesses and their removal from the scope of consolida- tion, the environmental pro tability rate improved and  economic bene ts exceeded environmental expenses.  Environmental conservation costs (April 2010 - March 2011)  Economic bene ts of environmental conservation (April 2010 - March 2011) *  The estimated bene t is calculated as the CO2 reduction amount from business activities plus the reduction from power savings during product use by  customers. It also includes the environmental bene t of paperless products such as electronic dictionaries and data projectors, as well as cost reductions  achieved by a modal shift from air to sea transport, and the resource saving bene t from water recycling.    The calculation method for power savings during product use by customers was revised. It is now calculated as the electricity saving e ect when comparing  a product sold in this  scal year to one sold in the previous  scal year.

The company is implementing management cycles to improve performance in these areas. A CSR Committee headed by the director responsible  for CSR has been established under the board of direc- tors. The committee is the central body for implementa- tion of CSR.  Operations conducted by the CSR Committee are  based on the use of management cycles. A stakeholder  meeting is held at the beginning of the  scal year, after  which the annual initiative themes are established and/ or updated. The departments mainly responsible for  each theme establish goals for their themes and set an- nual plans to achieve the goals before implementing the  necessary programs. At the end of the  scal year, the  departments review and evaluate their own results, in  addition to an objective evaluation by the Internal Audit  Department. Based on this, issues are then re-de ned  and used to establish the themes and plans for the next   scal year.  In  scal 2011, Casio worked on 11 themes, including  those continued from the previous year. There were  eight relating to CSR, and three relating to compliance  risk. The details are shown below. Fiscal 2011 Themes Themes relating to employees: 4 Themes relating to brand value: 1 Themes relating to social contribution: 1 Themes relating to BCM: 1 Themes relating to supply chain: 1 Themes relating to compliance risk: 3  Targets were achieved for  ve of these themes in  s- cal 2011. The remaining six themes were carried over   CSR Committee and continued as  scal 2012 themes.  To choose the  scal 2012 themes, in addition to those  continued from the previous  scal year, four working  groups discussed theme proposals from the CSR-relat- ed departments, after the stakeholder meeting outlined  below. When looking at proposals, they considered the  CSR contribution level, return on investment, and simi- larity to other proposals. The proposals were then  ranked within categories, before a balanced set of new  themes was selected for  scal 2012. Since the establishment of its CSR Operations Section  in 2004, Casio has been implementing CSR activities  while expanding the themes to be undertaken and the  scope of their impact. In the initial stage, there was an  emphasis on protecting corporate value.

This was followed by a Q&A session,  which also deepened the understanding of the CSR  Committee members.  In the CSR Committee meeting at the start of  scal  2012, Hideto Kawakita was invited in again. He and the  committee members discussed how to re ect the arrival  of ISO 26000 and the consequences of the Great East  Japan Earthquake in the setting of  scal 2012 initiative  themes.  After the meeting, each CSR-related department   Stakeholder Meeting selected new theme proposals that Casio ought to  pursue in  scal 2012, submitted them to the Secretariat.  The proposals were then divided up and discussed by  the working groups mentioned above.

Corporate Governance To increase corporate value, Casio always strives to improve management integrity and transparency. True  to this commitment, Casio works to ensure that management decision-making is quick and that all operations  are executed properly and e  ciently. Casio constantly strives to improve corporate  governance.  The board of directors is tasked with making prompt,  reasonable management decisions. Board meetings are  attended by directors and corporate auditors, who dis- cuss and make decisions on important business issues.  Furthermore, in order to clarify the management re- sponsibility of directors and to ensure a prompt re- sponse to changes in the business environment, the  term of o  ce of directors was changed from two years  to one, as of June 2007.  At the regular General Meeting of Shareholders in  June 2011, a new external director and a new external  auditor were appointed, with the intention of further  strengthening the management supervisory function.  In accordance with audit policies approved by the  board of corporate auditors, the corporate auditors (all  external auditors) attend board of directors' meetings,  meetings of the corporate o  cers, and other important  meetings. In addition, they perform careful audits by  gathering information and receiving reports from direc- tors and others, and by reviewing resolution documents  relating to important decisions. The external director  and external auditors are independent o  cers regis- tered with the Tokyo Stock Exchange in compliance with  regulations. In addition, Casio has full-time sta  that  provide support for corporate auditors.  Corporate governance framework  Accounting auditors perform external audits  according to generally accepted Japanese auditing  standards, and they also provide recommendations for  operational improvement. The Internal Audit Department  carries out audits to ensure that all Casio Group  operations are being carried out in conformity with laws  and regulations as well as internal standards.  Corporate Governance Framework 49 Responsibilities to Stakeholders Environmental Initiatives Philosophy and Management  Based on its corporate creed of "Creativity and Contri- bution," Casio has established basic policies to ensure  the accuracy and reliability of its  nancial reporting. It  has also set up an Internal Control Committee com- posed of members of the Accounting Department, In- formation System Department, CSR Operations Section,  and Internal Audit Department, in order to secure an ef- fective system of internal controls.  Fiscal 2011 marked the third year since the  introduction of the internal control reporting system  based on Japans Financial Instruments and Exchange  Act (J-SOX). Casio seeks to improve the financial  strength of the entire group and enhance management  culture ahead of the introduction of the International  Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). As part of those  initiatives, the company also promoted the strengthening  of internal controls.  System of internal controls  Here are the main initiatives.   Reviewed the uni ed group accounting rules based on  actual conditions, and revised them to establish the  Casio Global Criteria for journal entry.   Managed issues identi ed through daily organizational  management as main J-SOX risks, and set Operation  Improvement Rules for the entire group.   Established Standard Operation Flows that should be  regularly used across the entire group for main  business processes, with the aim of ensuring that the  Operation Improvement Rules are being followed.  By regularly checking and improving operation condi- tions based on these standards and rules, Casio intends  to raise the level of operation processing group-wide.  For  scal 2012 and later, Casio will continue to pursue  activities that enhance the level of internal control, while  further improving  nancial strength for the entire group  and improving the management culture. Compliance and Risk Management Casio is pursuing total compliance through integrated management of three foundations of employee con- duct: the Casio Group Code of Conduct, risk management, and the Whistleblower Hotline. The Casio Group Code of Conduct represents a pledge  of ethical behavior by Casio executives and employees  to those in and outside the company. They use the code  to make speci c decisions in their daily work and per- sonal lives.  With the globalization of Casio, the code has been  translated from Japanese to English, and is also  translated into the languages of other countries where   Casio Group Code of Conduct Based on its Basic Risk Management Policies, Casio has  built a system to manage risks e  ciently. In  scal 2008,  Risk Management Committee was established to take  measures with an emphasis on managing compliance  risk.  In the committees  rst year,  scal 2008, it identi ed  70 laws relating to Casios businesses, and listed mea- sures being taken to comply with each law. Regarding  laws where Casio had de ciencies relating to manage- ment cycle operation and manual preparation, the com- mittee analyzed the importance of each risk based on  the occurrence possibility and its impact on company  management. Measures were then prepared to deal  rst   Risk management Casio operates when needed.  With the revision of the code in 2008, Casio began  conducting yearly compliance training for all group  employees in Japan, in order to promote even better  awareness. The company also conducts biannual  compliance questionnaires together with the training,  and is promoting improvement by identifying problem  points and making them known. with the risks of higher importance.  In  scal 2008, there were 19 law types where the com- panys compliance was de cient and the risks were of  high importance. By the end of  scal 2011, speci ed  measures had been put in place to deal with all of these  laws.  As a result, Casio has changed its risk management  method, and the Risk Management Committee Secre- tariat is regularly monitoring the risks identi ed by the  Committee. The company has moved towards a system  that checks for de ciencies in the status of manage- ment cycle implementation. 50 Responsibilities to Stakeholders Environmental Initiatives Philosophy and Management  In order to respond to emergencies with the resources  of the company organization, Casio has created a Crisis  Management Manual for securing the safety of all em- ployees, directors, and their families, preserving corpo- rate assets, and maintaining business activities.  Sequential updates of the manual keep pace with  changes in the business environment, and the company  is taking practical initiatives at the same time. Speci cally,  the following measures have already been undertaken:   Regular evacuation drills and general lifesaving class- es for employees   Development and in-house distribution of disaster  prevention support tools as well as disaster  stockpiling   Construction of a system to ensure absolutely no con-  Responding to emergencies tact with organized criminal elements   Disaster prevention drill with the local community and  provision of an open area for a temporary evacuation  site  However, with the Great East Japan Earthquake that  struck in March 2011, circumstances were encountered  that exceeded previous expectations. Learning from  this, the Crisis Management Manual required substantial  revision. Visits were made to the sales sites in the disas- ter zone and interviews conducted. By verifying emer- gency response activities at the headquarters and local  sites from the victims perspective, Casio was able to  identify various points for improvement. These points  have been carefully re ected in the revised Crisis Man- agement Manual to make it even more e ective. Casio is aware of its important social responsibility to  maintain the security of information that it collects from  customers and other stakeholders in relation to its  business activities. Casio strives to maintain the highest  level of information security. With the full implementation  of Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information  in 2005, Casio launched the Protection of Personal  Information Project and publicized the Privacy Policy on  its web site. Furthermore, as part of Casio's drive to  strengthen its system for safe and proper handling of  personal information, Casio Computer Co., Ltd., worked  to qualify for the Privacy Mark* certi cation and received  it in December 2005.  Since obtaining certi cation, Casio has been properly  carrying out the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle to  maintain its personal information protection  management system. This includes the establishment of  annual plans, having all employees undergo training and  make a pledge, regular checking of personal information,  access management on information systems, consignee  supervision, and internal audits. Accordingly, Casio has  been able to renew and maintain its certi cation.  In fiscal 2011, Casio worked to further raise the  awareness of employees by conducting an information  accident prevention campaign and putting up posters in  the company. The aim is to reduce the risk of an  information security accident occurring at the individual  employee level, such as data theft or loss o  premises,  or mistakenly sending a con dential email to the wrong  recipient.  In November 2007, Casios Information System  Department received information security management  system certi cation (ISO 27001). The aim of applying   Information security for certification was to evaluate fulfillment of  responsibility by the information system department,  which has specialized skills and takes care of information  assets for the entire company. Since then, Casio has  further improved information security and its  e ectiveness, and continues to implement PDCA cycles  for risk reduction activities. A certi cation renewal audit  is held every three years. With the audit conducted in  January 2011, the compatibility and e ectiveness of  Casios information security management system was  again evaluated. *  Privacy Mark: A program where the Japan  I n f o r m a t i o n  P r o c e s s i n g  D e v e l o p m e n t  Corporation, a public-service foundation,  evaluates the adequacy of corporate protective  measures related to the handling of personal  data.

The hotline has  been functioning with neutrality and fairness across all  of its internal and external contact points.  Operating on a basis of impartiality, the hotline follows  up on all whistleblower reports and consultations, and  takes resolute measures against any improper behavior  discovered. E ort is put into preventing issues before  they grow into real problems. In  scal 2010, the hotline's  intranet site was improved, and hotline awareness was  raised within the company.  There were nine whistleblower reports in  scal 2011.  In each case, the callers were interviewed, and based on  the content of their reports, investigations were made,  and correction measures implemented to resolve the   Whistleblower Hotline Export control, or export control security, aims to main- tain international peace and security. It involves regula- tions on the export of goods and technology that could  be diverted for the development of weapons of mass  destruction or other weaponry. The regulations are de- signed to prevent such goods and technology from  reaching countries and regions of concern or terrorist  organizations.  In 1987, the Export Control Security Program of Casio  Computer Co., Ltd. (a compliance program) was estab- lished in order to make sure proper measures are taken  to ensure the security of exports. The program has  since been continually updated along with changes in  the Japanese Export Control Regulation.  Casio has appointed employees responsible for ex-  Export control Casio continues to hold compliance seminars given by  employee instructors at the sales o  ces of Casio Com- puter Co., Ltd., in Japan. In order to promote proper  transactions as well as fair, transparent and free compe- tition, it is essential for sales employees to have a proper  understanding of Japan's Act on Prohibition of Private  Monopolization and Maintenance of Fair Trade and Act  against Unjusti able Premiums and Misleading Repre- sentations. In  scal 2011, ten seminars were given at  sales o  ces, while three were held at the sales manage- ment department in the headquarters.

With the aim of making the hotline well known within  the company, a Whistleblower Hotline website was es- tablished. In  scal 2011, the website content was further  improved, and Casio is working to increase awareness  among employees. port control in relevant departments as part of an inter- nal system to ensure observance of the program.  As the Exporter Compliance Standards took e ect in  April 2010, Casio has been striving to maintain and man- age its system by conducting voluntary annual audits  while ensuring through legal compliance, in response to  the revision of applicable laws and regulations. E orts  include the strengthening of training activities at group  companies in Japan.  Casio has also established a management system for  complying not only with Japanese export laws but also  with US Export Administration Regulations. The compa- ny is working to improve global export management, in- cluding the implementation of export management  training at group companies outside Japan. employees received the training, expanding their under- standing of fair transactions.  As a tool for promoting proper and fair competition  and transactions, Casio distributed Sales Compliance  Cards to its sales employees in Japan so that they could  always have it with them. The cards contain information  such as an ethics and compliance test for making di  cult  decisions and contacts for advice or to make a whistle- blower report. This led to an increase in the number of  employee consultations on potential issues in advance.

Satisfactory International (KKSI) to  conduct verification of Casios environmental performance data of the financial year of 2010 (1 April  2010 – 31 March 2011) for inclusion in the Casio Sustainability Report 2011(Report).  The aim of this verification is to consider the accuracy of environmental performance data detailed  in the Report and to provide a verification opinion based on objective evidence.     Scope  The scope of the verification work covers the activities including 1)Inputs: Energy(Electricity and  fuels), Water resources, SF6, GHGs other than SF6, VOC, PRTR substance, rainwater use and  waste water use. 2)Outputs: GHGs (CO2, SF6, Other GHGs, Air Pollutants (NOx, SOx, Dust), VOC  emissions, Waste water, BOD, PRTR substance, waste generated, Landfill Disposal, Recycle waste,  3) CO2 emissions from Logistics and Sales, 4) CO2 emissions from products use.  The total of 50 business sites are covered, which comprises of 6 production sites and 20 offices in  Japan and 4 production sites and 20 offices overseas.     Methodology  KKSI has conducted its verification activities by document reviews, five site visits, enquiries to  person in charge and verification of the documents to determine the following.    The reliability and adequacy of data collection and aggregation systems and related processes.    The relevance of the scope of data selected for inclusion in the report.    The reliability of measured and collected data and accuracy of aggregated data.    The validity of conclusions drawn from and reported against aggregated data.    Verification Opinion    There is no material error found in the reported data.    All errors in reported data identified during the verification process have been duly corrected.    The data measurement, collection and aggregation systems are credible and appropriately  operated.  55  Independent Opinion Independent Opinion on the Sustainability Report 2011 The opinion presented here was written based on the content of this report (website version) and interviews  with Casio personnel responsible for environmental, procurement, human resources, and CSR initiatives.  The report makes it reasonably clear that Casios CSR initiatives have begun to use the plan-do-check-act  (PDCA) management cycle with a focus on reducing the companys environmental impact.   I commend the company for including e orts to build a  low carbon society and protect biodiversity as themes in  its medium- to long-term environmental policy. As Casio  works toward these goals, I have high expectations for the  progress of its initiatives across the entire product life- cycle. In addition to the companys efforts within the  group and across its supply chain, I look forward to seeing  how the company helps its customers to make the most  eco-friendly use of its products, including improving recy- cling rates at the end of the product cycle. I also expect  the company to disclose information on its progress.   Regarding the CSR initiatives for suppliers, it is admi- rable that Casio is ascertaining, visualizing, and shar- ing data about suppliers. For instance, feedback was   Commendable efforts by Casio   Regarding the environmental impact reduction data in  this report, it is commendable that details are provided  on the principal sites in and outside Japan including  group companies. My hope, however, would be that Ca- sio will continue to increase the level of accuracy of  group reporting, not only for environmental data, but  also for personnel and procurement initiatives and data.  Points for improvement   Regarding e orts to make Casio a better place to work,  the company deserves congratulations for achieving  3.96% in the percentage of employees who make use of  leave and reduced working hours programs for childcare  and nursing care. Now Casio needs to more proactively  create opportunities for users of these programs to share  their awareness of issues and how they overcame them.   Regarding the improvement and utilization of human re- sources diversity throughout the group, Casio should be  commended for giving consideration to di erent cultures  and the environment at production sites and other sites.  Now it is essential for the group to further globalize its busi- ness development. Casio should take a ten-year perspec- tive, and plan a global personnel portfolio that goes beyond  division and company boundaries. Along with the appoint- ment of a global personnel o  cer to oversee and promote  personnel hiring, training, and interaction, the group should  build a human resources database for getting a compre- hensive grasp of its personnel, including the national sta   in each country. In these and other ways, Casio needs to  establish strategies and systems that can make the most of  its diverse workforce as a truly global company.  Points for improvement while commending progress to date sent to 169 suppliers in China and Thailand based on  the results of questionnaires on the reduction of envi- ronmental impact, initiatives to protect the human  rights of workers, and other matters, plus onsite inves- tigations of some companies. Casio also evaluates sup- pliers in Japan based on a  ve-point scoring system for  all 340 items in the Supply-Chain CSR Deployment  Guidebook, published by the Japan Electronics and In- formation Technology Industries Association (JEITA).  Going forward, I hope that the company will further  raise the visibility of its suppliers initiatives and issues  by providing specific examples, while continuing to  build a system of dialogue for sharing case studies,  rewarding outstanding suppliers, and resolving issues.   Regarding the hiring of employees with disabilities, Casio  deserves applause for exceeding the legally mandated  employment rate within the consolidated group in Japan  and for starting a follow-up program that makes it easier  for persons with disabilities to keep working within the  group and ensures cooperation between employment  sites and the personnel department. Now the company  should work at building community based on the di erent  types of disabilities and occupations, and continue making  Casio an easy place for persons with disabilities to work.   Regarding the CSR initiatives for the entire group, Casio  should be commended for the fact that many divisions  started proposing initiatives following the reorganization  of its CSR Committee in at the end of  scal 2010 to allow  each division to independently look into and pursue is- sues of concern to society. In the future, Casio will need  to further promote bottom-up approaches like these.   On a related matter, Casio should be praised for continuing  to feature articles about CSR in its internal newsletter. I hope  that the newsletter will continue to cover particularly impor- tant CSR issues and initiatives from diverse sites within the  group, in and outside Japan, as well as from suppliers. International Institute for Human, Organization and the Earth (IIHOE) Hideto Kawakita  Chief Executive O  cer Pro le of IIHOE: International Institute for  Human, Organization and the Earth (IIHOE)  is a nonpro t organization (NPO) that has  been supporting NPO management and  CSR capacity building since 1994. http://blog.canpan.info/iihoe (in Japanese) 56  Responses to the Independent Opinion on the 2010 Report Independent Opinion Regarding the CSR initiatives for the entire group (pag- es 32-33), Casio should be commended for reorganizing  its CSR Committee in March 2010, in order to allow  each division to independently look into and pursue is- sues of concern to society. In the future, Casio will need  to promote and establish bottom-up approaches to  make the most of this new framework. Casios Response In keeping with the reconsideration of the operation of  the CSR Committee in  scal 2011, Casio decided to  operate the committee as follows from  scal 2012: 1)  In order to con rm societys expectations of Casio,  the committee held a stakeholder meeting in April  and extracted themes that Casio should address. 2)  These themes were broadly grouped into four cate- gories. Working groups made up of members from  relevant divisions were established for each theme.  The working groups delved into the speci c issues  that should be addressed in  scal 2012 and set a  priority order. 3)  Based on the conclusions of these working groups,  each division responsible envisioned how resolving  these issues would change their operations, devised  annual action plans, and committed to carrying out  the plans in a concrete manner.  Through the establishment of the above system, Ca- sio is promoting a bottom-up approach to resolving  issues.  Independent Opinion On a related matter, Casio should be praised for con- tinuing to feature articles about CSR in its internal news- letter. I hope that the newsletter will continue to cover  particularly important CSR issues and initiatives from  diverse sites within the group. Casios Response In  scal 2011, Casio continued to introduce CSR initia- tives undertaken by group companies in and outside  Japan using an internal website in addition to articles in  the internal newsletter. A total of 73 articles on CSR  were published, taking up issues such as the creation of  comfortable work environments at production sites, co- operation in community development events, site tours  and other educational support, and relief e orts for ar- eas stricken by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Independent Opinion It is also admirable that Casio cut paper usage by 39%  compared to the previous year by reducing the size and  number of pages for user manuals for products such as  electronic dictionaries and other measures. Now the  company should make an even greater contribution by   Points for improvement while commending progress to date introducing universal design fonts and other such  steps. Casios Response Casio began using universal design fonts, mainly for the  new models of multifunction watches such as OCEAN- US, EDIFICE, and PROTREK, making increased clarity the  highest goal.  This e ort resulted in the user manual for the OCEAN- US winning an award for excellence in the 1st category  of booklet operational manuals in the Japan Manual  Contest 2011.  The number of pages increased with additional prod- uct functions, but from here on the company will strive  to reduce the number of pages through measures such  as improving the heading organization and wording.  These e orts will then be expanded to other products. Independent Opinion Regarding the environmental impact reduction data in  this report, it is commendable that details are provided  on the principal sites in and outside Japan including  group companies. My hope would be that Casio will con- tinue to increase the level of accuracy of group report- ing, not only for environmental data, but also for person- nel and procurement initiatives and data. Casios Response In the 2011 report, Casio worked hard to disclose data  on group company initiatives, to the extent currently  possible, in the area of social activities in addition to in- cluding a special feature on the initiatives of Casio (Thai- land) Co., Ltd., which is one of the groups principal  production sites.  The company will continue striving to improve the  level of its reporting. Independent Opinion Regarding the employment of persons with disabilities  (page 68), Casio deserves congratulations for maintain- ing the legally mandated employment rate, which had  been an issue for many years. Now however, the com- pany must work with the parties concerned to make it  easier for persons with disabilities to keep working  within the Casio group. Casios Response In  scal 2011, the entire group in Japan reached Japans  legally mandated employment rate for persons with dis- abilities. Going forward, the group will continue with  proactive hiring of all persons, regardless of level of abil- ity, who are ready for a challenge and have the will to  work and demonstrate creativity.  57  Independent Opinion Casio must take steps to promote reuse of the rare met- als used in high-performance products such as digital  cameras and electronic dictionaries, for which recycling  systems have not yet been established. Measures could  include further studies with other companies in the same  industry and recovery of rare metals in used products.  This, in turn, could be linked to sales promotion, and to  development of products that use recycled metals. Casios Response In recent years, study groups looking into the recycling  of rare metals contained in cellular phones, digital cam- eras, and other used small electronic devices have been  launched, mainly by Japans Ministry of Economy, Trade  and Industry and Ministry of the Environment. These  groups are studying the issue, including facilitating re- covery demonstration pilots by local governments.  The Mobile Recycling Network operated jointly by cel- lular phone network carriers is already recovering and  recycling cellular phones. Digital cameras are collected  and disposed of as general waste by local governments  and there are also secondhand markets. Accordingly,  the industrial associations concerned are jointly estab- lishing study sessions on the recycling of used small  electronic devices and looking into how to handle this  issue.  Furthermore, the Ministry of the Environment is put- ting together the outline of a new recycling program,  creating a system with intermediate processors and re-  ning companies centered on municipalities, and mov- ing ahead with plans to extract metals such as gold, sil- ver, copper, zinc, and palladium. Also, a bill on other rare  metals is anticipated to be submitted into a regular ses- sion of the Japanese Diet in 2012. Casio will therefore  closely monitor these developments and consider how  to respond.  (Main products: Cellular phones, digital cameras, elec- tronic dictionaries, calculators, and AC adapters)  Points for improvement Independent Opinion The improvement and utilization of human resources  diversity throughout the group is essential for the com- pany to further globalize its business development. Ca- sio should take a ten-year perspective, and plan a global  personnel portfolio that goes beyond division and com- pany boundaries. Along with the appointment of a global  personnel o  cer to promote this goal through various  channels including personnel hiring, training, and inter- action, the company needs to establish recruitment and  training systems that can make the most of a diverse  workforce as a truly global company. Casios Response In  scal 2011, the company began needs-analysis and  other preparatory studies regarding the development  and implementation of a human resources management  system be tting a global company. First, the company  identi ed the issues and needs not only of the personnel  department, but also the relevant departments and each  of the Casio sites in and outside Japan. Based on these  e orts, Casio then began implementing speci c mea- sures for the building of a global human resources man- agement system. Going forward, the company will con- tinue to strengthen these e orts. 58  About Casio Computer Co., Ltd.
