Performance Creation: Our Performance Appendix   It is my great pleasure and honor to meet our dear stakeholders who never fail to show their deep interest in and strong support for us through the KSA Sustainability Report 2010. Our first sustainability report was issued in 2009 in order to ensure stronger communication with stakeholders and help meet our sustainability management goals as an organization.  KSA joined the UN Global Compact (UNGC), the UN-level international initiative on social responsibility, in November 11, 2010 and has been supporting the ten UNGC principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Our sustainability reports intend to disclose our progress relevant to the UNGC and to solicit invaluable feedback from our stakeholders to make more effective contributions in the economic, social and environmental aspects, using it as the bedrock of KSAs sustainability management.  While having face-to-face meetings with and listening to wide-ranging stakeholders in preparing this report, their warm-hearted support and rather sometimes criticisms enabled us to look for KSAs future ways to go and also reaffirmed their high expectations on us.  In order to ensure KSAs sustainable development in the longer term, this KSA Sustainability Report 2011 illustrates the following commitments that reflect our 2nd-phase mid-term management strategic tasks and issues where stakeholders show a high level of interest.  First, we are to stay committed to our role as a private sector leader in standards. To ensure this end, we will fully incorporate opinions of relevant businesses in setting standard policies and build readiness for emerging trends of international standards such as social responsibility and green industry. We will also take the lead in R&D of standards in such new growth areas as convergence technology and software.  Second, we will update the Korean Industrial Standards (KS) Certification system, the nations representative voluntary certification,to promptly accommodate changing technology and environments, making further contributions to industrial development. We will also make sure that the KS system is internationally recognized through the establishment of the KS Certification web system and continual development of new service areas.  Third, we will work hard to deliver customized education and knowledge services that meet diversified customer needs as a professional industrial training service provider and to develop training programs that take into account such social issues as climate change, eco-friendliness and social-friendliness.  Fourth, we are committed to more sophisticated operation of the Service Quality Index, Well-Being Consumer Index, LOHAS Certification, and In-door Air Quality Certification that were developed by KSA to enhance the quality of life for the general public and to establishment of new indices and certifications whose needs are increasing in Korea.  CEOs Message  KSA has been a faithful partner for the industrial development of Korea over the last five decades.  We will remain silent but dedicated in our journey to create future values for customers and stakeholders in industrial settings and to fulfill our social responsibility for a happier society in the upcoming five decades.  Fifth, we are dedicated to sharing and increasing mutual benefits based on the knowledge asset that we have at KSA, taking one step closer to addressing the knowledge gap in our society.  Additionally, this report illustrates KSAs actions and commitments in the upcoming years in each of those issues that our stakeholders view as material. While we are fully committed to organizing our structure to ensure prompt response to external changes to meet stakeholders requirements and expectations, we are also working hard to create a system to nurture professional talents and enable them to make the best of themselves.  Our goal is to grow together with our dear stakeholders while reaching targets one by one that were outlined in our sustainability reports.  Celebrating the 50th anniversary of establishment in 2012, KSA has been an active provider of knowledge services in wide-ranging fields of standards, product quality, training and certification for the nations industrial development over the last five decades. We will remain silent but dedicated in our journey to create future values for customers and stakeholders in industrial settings and to fulfill our social responsibility for a happier society in the upcoming five decades. As we are fully dedicated to building a sustainability human society, we will greatly appreciate your continued interest and support in the future.  Thank you.

Today, we reaffirm our commitment to reciprocate the affection our customers showed us with outstanding accomplishments.  Established in 1962, KSA has been a strong partner for companies, providing diverse knowledge services in the fields of standards, quality, certification and training for the nations industrial development. As we celebrate our 50th anniversary in 2012, we are ready to take off for another 50 years to come.  Past 50 Years at KSA  Born as a representative private sector institute in standards and quality management pursuant to the Industrial Standardization Act in 1962, KSA has been changing its roles according to changing needs of the nation and laying the basis for the Koreas industrial development. KSAs initial endeavors include promotion of quality control engineers, management of the Korean National Quality Awards and other training and reward programs to disseminate standards and quality management. After the 90s, KSA widened the scope of its business into KS and ISO certification.   KSA restructured its business portfolio once again since 2000 to embrace changes in society and its wide-ranging deliverables in HR training, social responsibility, increased service competitiveness, green growth business and e-learning have positioned KSA as a comprehensive knowledge service provider in Korea.  Upcoming 50 Years at KSA KSA has a clear mission of supporting success of Korean companies and in so doing, enhancing Koreas industrial competitiveness. While KSAs top priority has been establishing itself as a specialized standards and quality institute and comprehensive knowledge service provider over the last 50 years, KSA is determined to become a rich repository of diverse knowledge that will enable KSA to accommodate constantly-changing latest trends in the upcoming 50 years.  Our goal is to make KSA the very first name that comes into the mind of any businessmen who seeks future values and all KSA employees are determined to reach this goal with best-in-class expertise in their respective fields.  Celebration of KSAs 50th Anniversary KSA plans to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2012 with compilation of its 50-year history, creation of the KSA Cyber PR Center and a commemorative ceremony. These events will allow us to appreciate once again the deep affection our customers have showed us, look back the achievements and milestones we made over the last five decades and reaffirm our commitment to shared vision of KSA.

Media Analysis We analyzed 6,350 articles over the last 3 years between January 1, 2008 and July 30, 2011 and identified relevant issues to be reported in order to understand how media addressed major issues of KSAs sustainability management. Peer Analysis We studied standards organizations in Korea and abroad and 4 global knowledge service providers by ISO 26000 issue to determine relevant issues.  ISO 26000 (CSR) Compliance Assessment We used the CSR compliance assessment indicators jointly developed by the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy and KSA to evaluate our compliance level and identify relevant issues.  Trend-Impact Survey We surveyed KSA employees of critical issues of sustainability management in Trend, Impact and R&C dimensions to identify issues that impact KSA or are impacted by KSA and internal capacity issues by value chain segment.  Recognition of Social Responsibility STEP 01 KSA identified material issues to be included in this report through stakeholder engagement in accordance with ISO 26000.  Reporting Process We applied stakeholder identification and engagement principles proposed by ISO 26000 in determining issues to be reported in order to identify stakeholders and conducted interviews and surveys to understand material issues.  Stakeholder Identification We followed ISO 26000 criteria in identifying stakeholders and further classified them into 3 different groups: first, they impact our performance, second, they are impacted by our performance and third, they have legal/financial/operational responsibilities. Economic, social and environmental impacts were considered in this process and our material stakeholder groups include employees, customers, government, partners and the BOD. Stakeholder Engagement To ensure stakeholder views are reflected, we carried out the 1st-phase survey of employees regarding the selection of material issues and in-depth interviews of stakeholders who represent respective stakeholder groups to hear what they expect of KSA. This was followed by the 2nd- phase survey of internal/external stakeholders to finalize issues to be reported.

I do appreciate that KS maintain their reputation as strict standards and if they become more open to these changes and increase their utility by doing so, this will further complete KS.  KSA conducted face-to-face in-depth interviews with major stakeholder groups to solicit their input. We chose material stakeholders in the areas of training, certification, promotion and standards and carried out 12 interviews in total for 10 days from the end of August to hear their thoughts on KSAs current status.  Acceleration of technology development and improved utility of KS certification Jung, Man-Seok, CEO of Hyundae Fan KSA is always a favorite option to me as a training officer because it delivers the right balance between theoretical education and hands-on experiences. I hope that KSA would be able to provide more in-depth knowledge services that companies need Growing needs of customized and in-depth knowledge Hong, Keun-Hwan, Team Leader at Hankook Tire KSAs traditional strengths have been quality and industrial standards. Its business scope, however, needs to extend to include such future-oriented sectors as health & safety, social responsibility and climate change. To this end, KSA should foster professionals through various training programs. Climate change adaptation In-house human resources development and training at KSA Yang, Dong-Kuk, Partner of KSA There always are new issues coming such as climate change. KSA would be better positioned to serve as a knowledge provider by responding to these emerging trends.

Organization- wide efforts should be aligned to enhance the value of KSA as a brand. This, in turn, will give a further boost to its business, certification and awards. Growing competition in certification and awards Yoon, Hyun-Woong, Department Head at KEPCO KPS KSA is a specialized knowledge service provider. Its top priority should be on obtaining expertise and qualifications befitting its status. It is highly encouraging that KSA is working hard to hire talented people recently. It needs to utilize these competent human resources to establish more proactive business operation systems. Intensifying efforts to hire talented people Kim, Hong, Section Head at the Korean Agency for Technology & Standards (KATS) For KSA to enhance its standing as a professional private sector standards institute, it should become more strategic in planning and implementing standards above all.  KSA needs to search for new promising areas and develop standards before needs do arise and also create a virtuous cycle of standards. Participation in public policy-making Growing needs of society of standards Kim, Yong-Wan, Officer at the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy KSAs quality training is really helping us a lot at our work sites. If time allows, I would love to take diverse KSA courses and meet prominent experts in many different fields. Diversifying customer needs Jung, Seo-Yong, General Manager at Hyundae Fan We should always be ready to embrace change even though this turns out to be bad for us in the end. This practice of accommodating change will enable all KSA people to take the initiatives in change and innovation. Growing competition including oversaturated training segment Diversifying customer needs Lee, Kye-Hyung, Vice President of Dankook University KS certification needs to extend its scope according to changing environment and also should be upgraded to a level where it serves as the center of the integration of voluntary certifications.

Proud Company:  Sustainability Management   Proud Company  Formulation of Mid-term Management Strategy At KSA, our mid-term management strategy spans 3 years to achieve sustainability management in long-term perspectives rather than focusing on short-term business performance. As the 1st-phase mid-term management strategy set up in 2008 was completed in 2010, the 2nd-phase strategy (2011~2013) was formulated to reflect changing environment and reset the basic course of organizational operation.  While the vision of World-class Knowledge Service Institute remains unchanged, mid-term management strategy was re-defined with focus on mid-term management goals. Under the finalized framework for sustainability management, the 3 strategic goals of customer-centered management, performance-driven management and talent-oriented management were set and 12 implementation tasks in respective strategic goals were identified to fulfill the vision. These implementation tasks are illustrated in this report as our commitments and we are determined to put our best efforts to work on them in order to attain the aforementioned management goals for the next 3 years.  16 KSA Sustainability Report 2011  KSA takes long-term perspectives in setting management strategy and is fully committed to reaching management goals through management innovation and R&D.

Sustained business innovation and human resources development brought about solid and balanced growth not just on the outside but also on the inside. This led to the astonishing achievement of continued surpluses for 9 consecutive years since 2002.  KSAs credit rating has remained stable at AA0 since it was upgraded from AA- in 2008 to this level in 2009, which demonstrates stability of our portfolio structure and efficiency of business operations. Each and every KSA employee is to work even harder to ensure stability and performance in the conduct of business.  Business Innovation R&D KSA has applied innovation in delivering business results including more efficient internal processes, cost-saving activities and R&D on new business areas.  Building an Optimized Business Environment Our ERP system, introduced in 2002, was optimized in accordance with revenue growth and business portfolio adjustment each year in order to build a business environment where overall management information is monitored in real time. Improved speed in business process and decision-making as well as consistent and transparent accounting data help us promote efficiency of business operations. We are to further optimize our ERP system through continuous upgrades.  Organization-wide Cost Reduction Initiatives Our TOP activities in 2009 aimed to reduce cost on an organization-wide level. A total of 79 TOP tasks that year generated KRW 1.3 Billion in cost savings and those tasks with proven benefitshelped us maximize cost reduction through more extensive roll out across the organization. We plan to achieve sustained cost savings through continued implementation of TOP tasks.  R&D Our R&D investments more than doubled from KRW 450 Million in 2009 to KRW 1.145 Billion in 2010 to fully commit ourselves to securing new engines of growth for the future. This helped us create new business areas that include EAM business that was developed with 2 years of effort, the Indoor Air Quality Certification and a new drive behind the undergraduate training market.  We plan to increase our R&D investments and expand the development of new contents and also to introduce a new innovation program that encourages every employee to take 1 R&D task per person in order to lay the basis for sustainable development of KSA.

Building the Basis for Ethics Management Establishing and Abiding by Ethical Standards KSA declared its commitment to ethics management in 2005 to respond to rising needs of society for tightened discipline and a culture of integrity among public officials. Since then, KSA has created its own Ethics Charter, Code of Ethics and Integrity Behavior Rules and strove for fullcompliance. In particular, our CEOs firm commitment to ethics management led to the inclusion of creative ethics management as strategic goal in the 1st-phase mid-term management strategy (2008~2010) and this formed the basis for ethics management at KSA.  Pledge of Business Integrity  To ensure compliance with ethical standards, fairness of business conduct, and sound and transparent management, KSA CEO and all the other employees signed and abide by the pledge of business integrity.  Intensifying Efforts for Ethics Management Integration of Anti-corruption and Ethical Standards into Business Operation Our efforts to integrate ethical standards throughout KSA include Ethics Management in Your Daily Life: 70 Questions and 70 Answers published and distributed, the Clean Reporting Center to address voluntary reports of bribes and gifts, the organization-wide clean card system fully established, bilateral pledge of integrity signed when concluding a contract of service regarding purchasing, construction or promotional events worth over KRW 20 Million. As a result, there have been no corruption cases occurring over the last 7 years.

For example, products directly manufactured by SMEs can be purchased through optional contract, not competitive bidding, and transactions with SMEs over KRW 50 Million can be settled in cash.  Promotion of Fair Competition To promote fair competition in the upcoming years, we plan to include clauses to prevent unfair practices in our purchasing regulations.

The program defines 5 different activity domains of core job experts according to KSA business areas and these experts are classified into 3 levels based on their experiences and qualifications.  Core job experts develop their own expertise through such expert activities as lecture, examination, teaching plan development, business planning and course development in their respective business areas and in so doing, they contribute to performance of KSA. KSA provides career development and training support to these experts on an organizational level to encourage them to build on their expertise continuously. KSA intends to fully establish this program by nurturing top-performing employees into core job experts and utilize them as the key driver of promotion of respective business areas and performance creation.  Best Human Resources Developer Certificate With the management philosophy of talent-oriented management, KSA has been working in various ways to help employees build their competency. The e-HRD system, introduced in 2007, ensures that KSA runs competency-driven Human Resources Development (HRD) programs and identifies major HRD tasks every year, which will form the foundation of KSAs human resources development strategy, contributing to organizational performance and individual employees competency development.  KSAs endeavors and accomplishments regarding human resources development were recognized by the Korean government with the Best Human Resources Developer certificate in 2010. As an organization overseeing the Korean Industrial Standards certification, KSA is committed to continuous improvements to establish another successful model in industrial standard in human resources development.  Mandatory Learning Hours Program  KSAs mandatory learning hours program aims to encourage employees to learn on their own and to boost job competency. The achievements are reflected in individual performance evaluation and team-level management evaluation. Fair Assessment and Compensation To ensure fair assessment and compensation, KSA conducts both management evaluation and performance evaluation together every year. Management evaluation is to review the unit-level attainment of management goals and efficiency in so doing and the result is utilized as criteria for bonus pay and performance assessment. Besides, the evaluation outcome is considered in determining division managers annual salary level to ensure management accountability in respective divisions. On top of this, performance evaluation is to assess achievement and competency on an individual level and its results serve as key data to decide individual employees salary scale increases, promotions and competency development.  KSA will fine-tune its assessment and compensation system and operate it more rigorously to make sure all KSA employees are evaluated and compensated fairly for what they achieved, and thus motivated to do better.

KSA is committed to enhancing public benefits of standards, reliability of training, effectiveness of certification and credibility of reward programs in order to produce outcomes in its major business areas of standards, quality, certification and training. Part 1 _ Conventional Business(Contents)  34 KSA Sustainability Report 2011  To raise the publics awareness of standardization and encourage industrys participation in standardization process, KSA conducts varied R&D and training activities on standardization and publishes and disseminates standards to facilitate their use.  R&D of Standards KSA develops the Korean governments standards policy, disseminates the Korean Industrial Standards and overseas standards, participates in international standardization process and supports de facto international standards. KSA is to take on the role of a private sector supporter for standardization R&D to enhance standards leadership.  Establishment of the 3rd National Basic Standards Plan (2011~2015) KSA took part in the standards policy-making process led by the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS) to meet emerging needs for a next-phase national basic standards plan. Under the vision to Build a Greater Korea through the establishment of fully-developed national standards system, subcommittees were set up in respective areas to complete the 3rd national basic standards plan. Our future goal is to continue our policy cooperation with relevant organizations to facilitate the implementation of this plan.  National Standards Coordinator To ensure that outcomes of governments R&D efforts are successfully translated into industrial applications and to support domestic technology to advance into the global market, the national standards coordinator program was planned and relevant policies were created. KSA is determined to fully establish this program, ensure stronger alignments between standards and government R&D and promote the industrialization of technology developed through these R&D efforts. Support for Standardization in Korea and Abroad De Facto International Standards De facto standards today have market dominance with global reach due to globalization and development of information and communication technology, take the same level of effect as established international standards of ISO, IEC and ITU, and influence Korean businesses tremendously. This prompted KSA to take action to cope with these de facto standards.  Life Standard Initiative  KSAs life standard initiative is to gather ideas from the general public on those issues where lack of standards leads to inconveniences in daily life or standardization could reduce waste of valuable social resources and to develop standards to address these challenges.  International Cooperation on Standards KSA cooperates with its overseas counterparts both bilaterally and multilaterally regarding standards and is an active member of international standard-setting organizations. In so doing, KSA is contributing to the enhancement of economic and social universality. Standard-setter Leadership Proud Contents Life Standard Initiative (www.lifestandard.or.kr)  Promotion of Standards Experts in the Private Sector With the increasingly unified and globalized world economy and the emerging knowledge-based society where knowledge and information is the key to value creation, standards are playing such a significant role today more than any other time. With this change comes growing demand of nations and businesses for standards experts. KSA is fully aware of the importance of standardization and promotion of standards experts and working on various relevant projects.  Standards Training for College Students KSA opened standards courses at 48 universities in 2009 and at 43 universities in 2010 for students who will serve as standards experts in the upcoming years. In addition, we are working on a step-by-step standardization training curriculum covering from basic standardization courses to advanced courses on international standardization competency development to encourage industry workforce to become more active in standardization initiatives. We are to develop standardization training programs customized for the needs of respective industries to nurture professional standards experts.  Growing Publics Awareness of Standardization KSA trains elementary school students, teenagers and general consumers on the importance of standards in their daily life to build consensus on the convenience and necessity of standards. Standardization training was offered to 10 elementary schools in 2010 and 300 junior high and high school students competed in the Youth Standards Olympiad held by KSA which provided them with an opportunity to experience themselves the importance of standards. KSA also hosts seminars to encourage consumers to become interested in standardization to ensure its Life Standard Initiative is aligned with daily consumer activities.  Dissemination of Standards The Korean Industrial Standards (KS), since its inception in 1962, have defined the way products are manufactured and tested in all industrial sectors in Korea and also have been used as guidelines to help businesses grow their competitiveness. The KS covered 23,622 items as of December 2010 and have 317 standards in the services sector to match the KS Certification for Services introduced in 2008. To make the KS more useful and help support exporting businesses in Korea, KSA made sure that 14,157 standards under the KS are compatible with international standards of ISO and IEC and thus can be utilized more effectively.  Publication and Dissemination of the KS KSA publishes standards developed or revised by KATS under the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy and disseminates them through wide-ranging channels covering handbooks, web services and DVDs to help customers utilize them in a prompt and convenient manner. We built a database of reference standards associated with KS certification items in 2010 to enable online search and use and offer more convenient services to certified companies. English translation services are also available since October 2010 to respond to expanding overseas trade and growing needs of KS documents in English.  Collection and Dissemination of Overseas Standards KSA collects and disseminates international, national and organizational standards through memorandum of understanding signed with major overseas standards organizations. For example, SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) standards of the U.S. are available in print- on-demand format since January 2009 and DIN (German Institute for Standardization) standards are also available in PDF format since April 2010 due to KSAs endeavors. We plan to conclude more MOUs in the upcoming years to promptly disseminate varied overseas standards into Korea. Conventional Business 35  36 KSA Sustainability Report 2011  KSA believes that its top priority as an industrial and standards training organization should be to enhance educational practicality with sector-specific customized training and is working hard to provide programs that deliver both increased competency and satisfaction to customers.  Quality Innovation  In 2010, the Korean government worked to build capacity of life-long learning organizations and to nurture human resources that meet changing industry needs. With increasing demand of the general public for life-long education and specialty training, both governments and businesses spend more on vocational training every year and the focus of education is shifting from mass education to personalized education that values diverse and customized in-depth knowledge.  According to customer feedback we gathered through various channels, there are increasing customer needs for customized quality training specialized by industry sector and job position. To respond to such changing environments, quality management training courses customized for such specific sectors as mixer trucks, automobiles and services were developed by KSA in 2010 and are up and running today. KSAs continued R&D efforts on training programs would help develop quality training courses segmented and specialized by industry sector to meet the needs of industry.  Management Innovation KSA conducts comprehensive diagnosis of general management status of private companies and public institutes, identifies major issues and offers solutions in the areas of manufacturing, facility, quality, cost, system, HR and organizational structure to support decision-making and phased-in implementation measures for organizational growth.  As Koreas top 6 Sigma training body, KSA introduces and disseminates management innovation strategy and techniques, shares experiences and success stories of innovation experts and businesses in order to encourage Korean companies to adopt and spread 6 Sigma initiatives effectively and contribute to the enhanced industrial competitiveness.  Production Innovation To support manufacturing companies to maximize profits through increased global competitiveness, KSA offers open and company-specific customized training programs covering on-site improvement, production management, cost, purchasing and materials and logistics.  In 2010, 110 open training sessions were completed by 1,503 participants, which is up 48% from 2009. Company-specific customized training also grew by 26% during the same period. KSAs future goal is to introduce TRIZ-related international certification training and expand XPS(Excellent Production System) training programs to serve as a leader in creative innovation of the nations manufacturing industry.  Educational Practicality Proud Contents Global Innovation Conference Plague of appreciation from the Minister of Defense in recognition of KSAs contributions to enhanced efficiency of defense management  Conventional Business 37 TPM EAM To cope with increasing needs for training and diagnostic services associated with aging industrial and infrastructure facilities in Korea, KSA provides these services with an emphasis on TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) which refers to maintenance and innovation activities across an organization  from on-site workers to managers. In particular, KSA offers standardized international certification training on ISO 18436 machinery diagnostics techniques and national equipment maintenance engineer and technician certification training.  Management HR Training Human capital is a core factor that determines a companys competitive edge in the age of knowledge-based creative management. In responding to changing HR trends, KSA built an integrated performance improvement program to present a high-performance HRD (Human Resources Development) model that is aligned with organizational vision and strategy and to foster globally-minded forward-looking talents, contributing to the sustainable development of nation, society and business (Triple-Win).  CEO Training Due to rapid changes in business environments, executive-level training needs are on the rise. In addition to traditional management theories, CEOs today are becoming more aware of managerial theories that reflect current trends such as sustainable management and environmental management. Moreover, they are gaining interest in humanities management, which concern inter-disciplinary convergence between or among two or more subjects.In order to cater to CEOs diversifying needs, KSA provides CEO training programs as illustrated as the following table. Long-distance Postal Training KSAs long-distance postal training is centered around reading and encourages trainees to take the initiative in learning. It supports employees in building job competency and making self- improvement and contributes to creating a corporate culture of reading management.  Not only books available in the retail market but also books written by KSAs in-house experts using their professional capacity are utilized as valuable learning sources for 300 long-distance postal training courses and this clearly demonstrates KSAs commitment to providing customized knowledge that caters to the needs of customer companies. These endeavors help KSA establish a training model that best fits the age of life-long learning.  Life-long Learning To fulfill its social responsibility as a public knowledge service provider, KSA is committed to becoming a designated life-long education facility by expanding the scope of its training services from industry training to life-long training for local community people and other stakeholders. We are determined to build on this foundation to identify and provide diverse training programs and knowledge information to help meet stakeholder needs.

Finding New Instructors  New instructors are recruited year-round through recommendation, application, and open recruitment. KSA applies rigorous recruitment criterion to build a pool of instructors with theoretical background and hands-on experiences in industrial training. Also, KSA monitors various forums, seminars, CEO training, and media to add professional expertise to its instructor pool.  Expert Instructor Competency Enhancement To help expert instructors enhance their competency, KSA provides them with feedback from trainees after training sessions and holds partner best practice events as a venue for instructors to share each others know-how and build a network of connections, offering them an opportunity to enhance competency as an instructor and promote self- improvement. Besides, we encourage them to create groups among themselves and work on a group level in company coaching programs to help them benchmark each other and also to learn about latest trends through varied conferences, forums and training.  Training Venue and Trainee Safety Measures To ensure a comfortable and safe learning environment for customers attending KSA courses, KSA created and distributed manuals illustrating detailed action procedures, general steps to be taken and preventive activities for all KSA employees to make prompt response to unexpected emergency. Compliance with these manuals will enable us to prevent disasters and emergencies and protect the safety of our customers.  KSA Gasan Digital Center Actions to be taken to respond to emergency that could take place at KSA Gasan Digital Center are systematically illustrated and they include fire response procedures, response procedures for emergency patients, response procedures to address thefts and breakdown of center facilities, evacuation measures in case of earthquake and emergency contact numbers. In addition, we created a standard format for accident reporting for appropriate post management to prevent similar events in the future and ensure optimized response when they do occur.  KSA HRD Center KSA HRD Center is a big facility capable of accommodating more than 400 people and this means that a lack of appropriate response may lead to a large- scale disaster in case of emergency. This is why KSA set up emergency management manuals and the centers own fire-fighting unit to maintain its efficient and safe operation on a daily basis. These manuals outline emergency response procedures, first aid care for emergency patients and emergency contact numbers to build comprehensive readiness for emergency. Each room of the HRD Center dormitory building has an emergency exit route plan to enable rapid evacuation of trainees in case of emergency. Most of all, the center is fully committed to preventive measures including fire-fighting plans and in-house fire checklists to prevent emergency in the first place. 38 KSA Sustainability Report 2011   KS Certification On top of the KS Certification for Services introduced in May 2007, KSA established new certification schemes regarding such green business areas as LED lighting and eco-friendly furniture.

KSA strives to maintain public credibility and reasonable management of these awards and reward programs that have sustained with long history and traditions over the last 50 years.  National Quality Management Convention KSA hosts the National Quality Management Convention which serves as the awarding ceremony of the Korea National Quality Awards under the auspice of the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy. The convention recognizes quality circles, quality leaders, quality contributors and top-performing businesses who are dedicated to quality innovation initiatives in order to encourage the spirit of diligence, challenge and creativity of factory workers and to identify best practices. Between 1975 and 2010, 1,611 quality management contributors, 443 top quality management companies, 3,923 quality circles, and 1,276 quality masters were honored at the convention and the National Quality Management Convention is establishing itself as the most prestigious government awards that appreciate the efforts of factory workers, employees and companies in the Korean industry.  Enhancement of Credible Reward Programs  As one of the longest-lasting government awards programs for the industry, the Korea National Quality Awards needs to enhance its prestige through fair and trustworthy judgments and transparent operations for its sustainable development. To ensure this end, KSA works hard to improve the operation of the program by incorporating needs of participating companies, apply stricter standards in selecting judges and continue to upgrade judgment criteria. A survey was conducted of 25 listed companies among the awardees between 2005 and 2009 to see how much their stock prices rose for a one-year period before and after the prize-winning, which showed an astonishing result of 7% higher than the KOSPI increase rate. This clearly demonstrates the importance of quality management initiatives that are multi-faceted and systemized to value customers, shareholders and employees, differentiated from short-sighted management practices that are too much immersed in short-term financial performance.

The competition offers an opportunity for companies to share and benchmark best practices to lay the stronger foundation for quality innovation. To respond to changing customer needs associated with corporate management strategy and social trends, KSA newly created and expanded the CoP and safety quality segments of the competition and also introduced web- based judgment systems to ensure objectivity and transparency of the evaluation process.  The National Quality Circle Competition is attended by qualified quality circles that are screened through in-house competitions and regional preliminary competitions and serves as a venue for festival where 53,000 quality circles and 580,000 quality experts are united as one every year.  World Standards Day  Celebration of the World Standards Day constitutes one of the most widely-known standards promotional events. The worlds top 3 standards organizations of  ISO, IEC and ITU designated every October 14 as the World Standards Day and publish commemorative messages, distribute promotional posters to member countries and host national-level commemorative events on this day every year.  Korea joined this move in 2000 and has been celebrating the day every year since then with wide-ranging programs.  Korean Standard Service Quality Index (KS-SQI) The Korean Standard Service Quality Index (KS-SQI) was a product of the joint efforts between KSA and Seoul National University Institute of Management, developed to promote corporate growth and publics happiness through increased level of service quality. Touted as Koreas representative service quality measurement model, the KS-SQIs excellence was demonstrated by numerous relevant academic organizations in Korea such as the Korea Marketing Association and the Korea Service Management Society.  To ensure reliability of the index, officials from surveyed companies are invited to a meeting every year to solicit and reflect their feedback on general survey characteristics covering survey design and survey questionnaire.  KSA started to study major 4 countries in Asia and 7 industry segments to help support Korean companies who are to go global in 2010 and plans to expand the scope of such research efforts. In addition, KSA is working with its overseas counterparts to export the KS-SQI as an internationally-accepted model. In 2010, 71 industry segments, 287 companies and 80,900 people were surveyed and the outcome was published.

Facilitation of these new growth business areas will help KSA lay the basis for sustainable growth.  Part 2 _ New Growth Business(Competence)  46 KSA Sustainability Report 2011  KSA is fully dedicated to promoting sustainability management (social responsibility management) of Korean companies to help the nation seek sustainable development and companies improve their corporate value.  Even before the financial crisis that started in the U.S. in 2008 is fully overcome, accumulating U.S. government budget deficits are coming to the surface and worries of another financial crisis coming with Greece of Europe as a trigger are alerting the whole world to another possible economic disaster once again. According to many economic and business experts, it was companys reckless pursuit of short-term business results that brought about the financial crisis originated in the U.S.. Additionally, the U.S. and European countries suffering from budget deficits today indicate that the government can no longer serve as a guardian of social safety. With more and more companies seeking long-term values in business management and governments commitment to reduced budget deficits, sustainability management and social responsibility management are emerging as top priority. KSA is proactively working in various ways to support companies to boost their competitiveness to cope with these changing environments.  ISO 26000 National Secretary  ISO issued ISO 26000, the international standard on social responsibility, in November 1 , 2011 after years of development that started in 2002. With support from the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS) under the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy, KSA played a leading role in creating ISO 26000. KSAs ISO 26000 social expert training courses are up and running since 2010 and KSA developed and disseminated the ISO 26000 compliance self- assessment indicators. In 2011, KSA worked to develop the KS version of ISO 26000 and a web-based social responsibility reporting system to support companies in building readiness for ISO 26000.  Stronger Cooperation with Overseas Counterparts Since the conclusion of the first memorandum of understanding for mutual cooperation with GRI in July 2007, KSA became a GRI-certified training partner in October 2008 for the first time in Asia (4th in the world). Working together with GRI, KSA has been hosting the Korean Readers Choice Awards (KRCA) as part of the Korea Sustainability Conference every year since November 2008. The KRCA recognizes outstanding sustainability reports based on assessments made by wide-ranging stakeholders in Korea in the manufacturing, services, public and first publication sectors. Establishing its status as Koreas most prestigious sustainability report awards, the KRCA is encouraging sustainability reporting in the nation to put more focus on stakeholder engagement. Besides, KSA signed an agreement with AccountAbility which sets de facto standards on sustainability report assurance in July 2010 and officially became an AA1000- licensed assurance provider, which enhanced KSAs public credibility in the sustainability assurance area. KSA plans to strengthen cooperation with overseas peers working in the field of sustainability management to deliver world-class services to Korean companies.  Sustainability Management Business Proud Competence KRCA logo  New Growth Business 47 Korean Sustainability Index KSA developed a model that enables stakeholders to evaluate themselves the sustainability of companies as a catalyst to disseminate and expand appropriate concepts of sustainability and social responsibility and has been publishing the Korean Sustainability Index since 2009 and awarding No. 1 companies by industry sector.  In particular, KSIs assessment indicators were further improved and completed in accordance with ISO 26000 issues with the contributions made by professor Kwon Jung at the KDI School of Public Policy and Management in 2010. The revised KSI ensures that companies are able to proactively deal with ISO 26000 that emphasizes that companies should be aware of corporate social responsibility in meeting their respective social responsibility and that they should engage stakeholders in identifying and addressing material issues.  When a company is highly rated by the KSI, this means that it earned good reputation from stakeholders regarding its social responsibility as presented by ISO 26000 and that it secured sustainable competitive edge in the longer term. (Korean Sustainability Index website: www.ksi.or.kr) Sustainability Management Forum and  Sustainability Management Conference KSA has been operating the Sustainability Management Forum since 2009, attended by diverse experts working in the field of sustainability management in Korea. The forum serves as a venue to discuss wide-ranging issues in Korea and abroad regarding sustainability management and its outcomes are aligned with policies adopted by the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy.  In addition, KSA hosts the Sustainability Management Conference twice a year where experts at home and abroad are invited to participate. Details associated with the conference are all uploaded on the website (www.smforum.or.kr) to ensure relevant information is widely shared.  As a co-host of the Sustainability Management Awards held by the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy since 2009, KSA is fully committed to recognizing companies with best practices on sustainability management and promoting top-performers.  Expansion of Sustainability Reporting Services  KSA offers services and research deliverables associated with sustainability management to meet company needs on report publication, assurance and strategy-setting. KSAs role is to provide a practice model that enables sustainability management that fully complies with the intrinsic principles of sustainability and encourage them to make sustained improvements. Besides, KSA works hard to deliver more customer values through high-quality and efficient services.  KSA successfully completed the contract to publish the sustainability management report of the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy between the end of 2010 and the first half of 2011.  KSI logo Korean Sustainability Conference  48 KSA Sustainability Report 2011  With the growing importance of climate change and reduction of GHG emissions, KSA is working in diverse ways to help companies take the initiative in cutting GHG emissions.  Enhanced Eco-friendly Training Programs Korea declared its firm commitment to addressing climate change with a new national vision of low carbon green growth in 2008 and carbon emissions trading markets are growing exponentially worldwide. This gave rise to growing needs for training courses on reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and new eco-friendly technology among Korean companies.  Energy Saving Training Programs To meet the needs of Korean companies that are highly interested in securing cutting-edge technology associated with energy saving, KSA has been offering the training program titled finding and addressing energy saving tasks since 2009. This program produced 30 energy- saving experts who are working hard to enhance energy efficiency in their respective workplace. To disseminate latest technology and trends of renewable energy which is often synonymous with energy saving, KSA has been sending more than 30 trainees to Japan to learn the nations renewable energy industry to nurture them as leaders of the eco-friendly industry.  CEO Environmental Management Program   KSA has run Green CEO for Sustainability program since 2007 to improve corporate competitiveness on environmental management and to enhance sustainable growth on cleaner production. One hundred and thirteen CEOs have studied environmental management issues until 2011 to contribute to create new business models. Green Technology Standardization Strategy After the Korean government declared its new national vision of green growth in August 2008, KSA started working with the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS) under the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy to set up the green technology standardization strategy to respond to this new paradigm.  Four implementation strategies and 7 tasks were chosen to reach the goal of laying the basis for green growth through the establishment of green technology standards framework and these detailed plans and relevant policy proposals were reported to the Presidential Committee on Green Growth (chairman: Prime Minister) on May 13, 2009 as the comprehensive inter- ministerial initiative jointly taken by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs, the Ministry of Environment and the Korea Communications Commission to ensure they are made public widely and put to action on a national level. Green Growth Business Proud Competence Green CEO for sustainability Training on the renewable energy industry in Japan  New Growth Business 49 Four Implementation Strategies  The 4 implementation strategies include alignment of R&D, patent and standards, facilitation of industry and researchers to participate in standardization, company-friendly and market-friendly standardization and development of standards of domestic technology and establishment of their global presence and it was made clear officially that Koreas standardization initiatives will take a more pragmatic approach for economic growth to build preparedness against potential threats of heightened trade barriers in the global market.  Detailed Tasks Detailed tasks to reach the goal of the above standardization strategy were presented from the two perspectives of establishing the green technology standards framework and formulating the international standardization strategy. First, to establish the green technology standards framework, the following tasks were chosen: responding to climate change convention, promoting resources recycling and enhancing energy efficiency, and building infrastructure for the growth of green technology business including new growth engine, green energy and green IT. Second, to formulate the international standardization strategy, the following tasks were selected: laying the foundation to dominate international standardization, nurturing more experts on international standards and strengthening international cooperation.  Such standardization strategy was set up as a 5-year plan spanning from 2009 to 2014 and inter- ministerial standardization projects for green growth are underway. On top of the achievements made over the years of policy projects, KSA is to contribute to society through sustained efforts for low carbon green growth as a professional standards organization.  Designation as a DOE under the UN CDM Scheme  KSA was designated as a DOE (Designated Operational Entity) under the UN CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) scheme on September 22, 2008 to evaluate the feasibility of projects performed by companies to reduce GHG emissions and to help companies obtain carbon allowances through verification of reductions made. KSAs verification business in this field is growing steadily, making feasibility assessments and verification engagements on 7 GHG emissions removal projects in 2009 and 15 such projects in 2010.  Designation as a Verifier for GHG Emissions Reduction Projects KSA was designated by the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy as a verifier for GHG emissions reduction projects on October 24, 2007. During 2010, KSA made feasibility assessments and verification engagements of 81 GHG emissions removal projects conducted by Korean companies in a move to support their climate change mitigation efforts.  Regarding the government-led GHG/Energy Target Management Verification System that took effect recently, KSA was chosen as a verification body capable of providing fair and objective verification services as a third-party entity and initiated this new type of business support services associated with GHG emissions removal of Korean companies.  On top of these services mentioned above, KSA is determined to expand its green growth business and deliver customer-oriented services to become a strong supporter for Korean companies who work in numerous ways to mitigate climate change and cut GHG emissions.

This is why KSA launched its own training program brand Worklearn to facilitate its e-learning and mobile learning business.  Launching Worklearn To respond to the convergence of high technology and education caused by rapid technology development, diversifying needs from learners who are smarter than ever and shifting paradigm of job performance, KSA came up with a solution to deliver knowledge and information required by worksites in a timely manner. We named this solution Worklearn as our own brand with an aim to strike the right balance between work and learn to maximize organizational performance through learning. Worklearn offers e-learning and mobile learning programs which serve as a major pillar of industrial training and focuses on latest solutions and differentiated and specialized contents.  In 2010, KSA further expanded the learning environment through mobile learning solutions to support informal learning that enables learners to learn whenever and wherever with the help of smart devices.  Developing and Providing Diverse Contents Optimized Training through Customized Diagnostic Services  Worklearn considers individual needs and interaction with learners as top priority to satisfy varied needs of customer companies and learners. This means that Worklearn provides optimized training by evaluating individual learners level and offering customized services.  Most of all, Worklearn solutions are built in a way to diagnose characteristics (Brain Color Diagnosis) and current status (High-performing Team Diagnosis) on an individual and team level and to identify training challenges to tackle. In addition, its quality expert job solution contents are developed and delivered after specific needs of customer companies are thoroughly assessed to produce customized contents. KSA built its own content production environment to create more than 30 types of content by 2010 in the fields of KS, quality and eco-friendliness and set the goal of increasing this number to 100 by 2013 through continued R&D.  Providing Tool-based Small-unit Contents  With shifting learning paradigm for better job performance, KSA is committed to creating ready- to-practice learning content that is immediately applicable on the spot and enables workplace learning. To cope with this new paradigm, KSA moved away from conventional e-learning methodology toward web and mobile services with an emphasis on tool-based contents that are readily applicable and smaller in volume but richer in quality. This allows us to form a service delivery system that meets the needs from workplaces in a highly prompt manner. KSA is determined to work even harder to establish the emerging industrial training paradigm of fully integrating work and learning in the upcoming years.  E-learning  Mobile-learning  Business Proud Competence Worklearn website(www.worklearn.co.kr) Worklearn studio  51 KSA expands the scope of capacity training to include job capacity development for job seekers to address youth unemployment with an aim to foster core talents with proven work capacity who are to lead the nations industry in the future.

Proud Customer :  Customer Satisfaction Management  54 KSA Sustainability Report 2011  KSAs top priority is to help customers increase their future value by delivering knowledge services. KSA is committed to providing optimized services through diverse and effective customer satisfaction initiatives.  Customer Satisfaction Enhancement Given the inherent characteristics of its business areas of training, certification, promotion (awards) and standards, KSA interacts with numerous customers and sometimes competes in the private sector market. This gave rise to growing awareness that KSA needs to enhance the quality of service to the level of leading private sector companies and respective business divisions take varied steps to improve customer satisfaction.  Gathering the Voice of Customers KSA expands channels to listen to what customers need in various ways to ensure sustained improvement of customer satisfaction. When KSA training sessions are over, trainees are surveyed briefly on the spot and administrative officers of customer companies are asked to participate in web-based surveys. These data are used as basic materials for integrative training team workshops at KSA, which are held to analyze issues with the training business and come up with solutions.  When KS certification examinations are completed, web-based surveys are conducted as well and the outcomes are utilized for KS certification teams to carry out customer satisfaction activities.  Analysis of Employee Courteousness to the Customer  As most of its work is done through phone calls, KSA monitors employees courteousness to customers during phone calls regularly every year. According to monitoring conducted by an external research agency, the score has remained in the rage of 85~90 points since 2009.  Relatively low-performing teams are individually notified of the result to encourage them to improve on a team level and high-performing teams are motivated to do even better by sharing their excellent performance throughout KSA. Monitoring of customer phone call courteousness of KSA employees will continue every year to ensure kind and friendly services at customer contact points.  One-Stop Customer Response Services KSA set up the One-Stop Customer Response Service system in December 2010. This makes sure that detailed job descriptions of respective employees are shared across the board so that customers making a phone call to KSA can immediately talk to the appropriate person in charge regardless of who gets the incoming call in order to reduce to the minimum waste of time both for customers and employees.

KSA employees donated their own valuable books maintained in good condition to be stocked at KSA Gasan Digital Center and HRD Center, which were then made available for trainees to read during their break time or bring home for reading. The book sharing project was welcomed with positive response within KSA and the donation and distribution of books will continue on a regular basis.  Service Improvement Feedback To help customers recognize and use improved KSA services, we sent letters that outline our service improvement activities to customer companies in October 2010. These letters illustrated various free training programs offered by KSA, briefing of improved systems and channels for reporting complaints.  These customer letters will be sent regularly to ensure that customers can make use of our services more conveniently.  Department-specific Customer Satisfaction Initiatives At KSA, team-level quality circle activities have begun since 2010 as part of the customer satisfaction initiatives. Each team works intensively to enhance customer satisfaction for 6 months and submit the outcome, which will then be evaluated for performance and reflected in team-level management evaluation.  We witnessed a lack of internal efforts to disseminate good practices across KSA until 2010, which led to discrepancies among regional divisions in terms of service content or quality. We are to address this problem by sharing best practices across the board and facilitate department- level customer satisfaction activities further.  Increasing Awareness of KSA Brand Our quarterly book seminar aims to enhance awareness of KSA as a brand. Twenty seminars were held by December 2010 and these seminars were expanded outside Seoul to local cities in 2011 and met with favorable feedback. These book seminars will take place in local cities in Korea to reach more people in the upcoming years.  One of the commitments we made in our 2009 sustainability report was to measure the value of KSA brand and set up long-term and organization-wide brand promotion strategy. We are working on this commitment and strategy will be created to enhance awareness of and preference for KSA through proactive and organization-wide sharing of opinions. We are committed to enhancing the status of KSA brand for internal and external stakeholders who are directly or indirectly influenced by KSA brand.

Use of Wide-ranging Communication Vehicles KSA opened its own twitter account (@KSAcs) and blog (ksaqs.blog.me) in 2010 to expand communication channels with stakeholders.  KSA Twitter and Blog At KSA twitter account, customer inquiries are answered in real time and information is posted as well on free training programs and events covering job capacity improvement for SMEs training sessions and book seminars. It is also used to hold regular events for free book-giving in our capacity of a reading training body.  KSA blog website has various news and events information available in detail. Not only the head office but also each regional division has their own blog activated and detailed information on training programs and events in respective regional divisions can be found. All blog information is linked to the head office blog.  Customer Section of the KSA Website KSA set a rule of responding to questions posted on the Q&A bulletin board (customer bulletin board) of its web site within up to 48 hours in January 2009. Since then, respective teams response performance has been internally and regularly monitored and they are notified of the outcome. These efforts led to a dramatic cut in the time taken to answer the majority of customer inquiries to 24~36 hours on average.  E-mailing of Knowledge Letters We saw an increase in knowledge letters e-mailed to provide knowledge by business content category and these knowledge letters on specific issues covering e-learning (Worklearn), management HR and sustainability management are sent regularly. KSA will ensure that customer feedback is reflected in the conduct of business and contributes to improvement through expanded communication channels. We are also considering plans to improve the way major changes in KSA services are announced through varied channels to enable customers to get easy access to such information. Expansion of Customer Communication Channels Proud Customer KSA twitter KSA blog  New Growth Business Awareness of the Importance of Information Security  Recent customer information spills at major online portal sites and financial institutions that are increasing in frequency alert us to the serious consequences of these security incidents. As KSA deals with wide-ranging customer information covering numerous trainees and customer companies, we are fully aware of the importance of information security.  In particular, all KSA employees share the awareness that the precautionary principle is critical in preventing these events and are committed to building a water-tight security check system.  KSA In-house Security System We set up an in-house security system to prevent hacker attacks that aim to steal customer information and take thorough technical and administrative measures for information security. In particular, we have dedicated information security personnel to be in charge of prompt response to unexpected hacking incidents such as DDos attacks to prevent damages before they do occur.  Security System Aligned with Related Organizations At KSA, employees are encouraged to enhance their awareness of information security through close cooperation with related organizations and its actual security system is aligned with these organizations as well. KSA is in full compliance with the 7 principles on information protection issued by the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy and a member of the Knowledge & Economy Cyber Security Center operated by the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy to protect the information and telecommunications network of its affiliated organizations. We also proactively adopt the recommendations covering security vulnerabilities and security issues made by the National Cyber Security Center.  The Personal Information Protection Act of Korea that took effect on September 30, 2011 extensively broadened the scope of personal information applications and with this came far more sophisticated management measures and actions to take. KSA is to ensure prompt compliance with the act to protect customer information.

This report outlines KSas own assessment of its social responsibility process and achievements by 7 core subjects of ISO 26000 in accordance with the above check list.  Scope of Assessment KSA reviewed its own regulations, strategy, achievements and procedures regarding social responsibility to assess overall external and internal activities & mid/long-term strategy, social responsibility initiatives and sustainability strategy implementation process.  The assessment was made as of August 2011 and this report does not reflect improvements made after the assessment.  Assessment Methodology With the task force team in charge of creating sustainability reports taking a leading role, KSA gathered evidence materials in accordance with objective assessment criteria and performed the following activities.  - Review of sustainability reports and internal documents on sustainability management activities and achievements  - Interview with employees in charge of respective issues Results of Assessment by   ISO 26000 Social Responsibility Process  KSA has yet to integrate recognition of social responsibility into the entire conduct of business including employees and partner companies. With the first publication of sustainability report in 2009, KSA performed stakeholder engagement and identified material issues to determine its strategic directions but the implementation of concrete tasks was rather insufficient.  In particular, KSA lacks a system to ensure on-going stakeholder engagement in its daily conduct of business and to incorporate material issues in top managements decision-making process. KSA is recommended to communicate its activities regarding social responsibility management through wide-ranging channels in addition to the publication of sustainability reports, to monitor sustainability-related information regularly, and to reflect key sustainability indicators in management evaluation in order to ensure sustained improvement.  Assessment Results by 7 Core Subject of ISO 26000 Organizational Governance KSA does not have a decision-making body which is responsible for integrating social responsibility principles into decision-making and implementation process. KSA would be better positioned to establish its own decision-making body in charge of regularly reporting social responsibility goals and accomplishments associated with stakeholder expectations and interests and continue to improve its operation.  Human Rights KSA is relatively weak in human rights among the 7 core subjects and in particular, it needs to look for ways to improve this area through due diligence of human rights situations of partner companies that it does business with. To put it more concretely, KSA is recommended to carry 68 KSA Sustainability Report 2011  KSAs ISO 26000 Compliance Self-check Report RecognitionofSocialResponsibility StakeholderIdentificationand Engagement AnalysisofCore SubjectsandIssues SettingPrioritiesand ImplementationStrategy Implementation Communication Verification Improvement 80.0 73.3 52.0 90.0 80.0 70.0 60.0 50.0 40.0 30.0 20.0 10.0 0.0 35.0 56.7 85.0 68.0 83.3 Recognition of Social Responsibility Reviewing the current status of an organization based on top managements commitment Stakeholder Identification and Engagement Examining stakeholders interest and demand and formulating engagement strategy Analysis of Core Subjects and Issues Creating a list of issues through review of issues and analysis of organizations internal capacity Verification Taking action and reporting to enhance reliability of achievements Improvement Reviewing achievements regularly to ensure sustained improvement Setting Priorities and Implementation Strategy Setting priorities, goals and implementation plans regarding issues to be improved and managed in consideration of organizations capacity  Implementation Putting strategies, vision, goals and implementation plans into action and regularly monitoring accomplishments associated with social responsibility Communication Communicating with stakeholders by preparing performance reports  69 out policies to respect human rights, establish and implement policies to respect human rights of partner companies and create principles to make sure it is not complicit in human rights abuses.  Labour Practices KSA is well positioned overall regarding labour practices but needs to do better to ensure health and safety at workplace. In particular, non-regular workers are 64 in number, making up a considerable portion of its workforce and this requires KSAs long-term commitment to improvement. In addition, KSA is recommended to provide an equal level of protection for health and safety of partner company employees as well as its part-time and non-regular employees and to come up with better ways to help its employees deal with work-related stress.  The Environment KSA is actively working on varied GHG-related projects and energy- saving initiatives but is not sufficiently managing its GHG Ranging. Besides, KSA needs to inspect the eco-system surrounding its HRD Center to prepare appropriate protection measures in case they are required and also to enhance awareness and management associated with recycling of resources.  Fair Operating Practices KSA takes wide-ranting initiatives on ethics management covering integrity training and the Honesty, Right-Way and Cleanness Campaign. It does not have, however, standards on the prohibition of anti- competitive action and such issues of health, safety, ethics, society, environment and gender equality that require attention in purchasing, distributing and contracting. KSAs efforts to encourage partner companies to be socially responsible are also not adequate enough. KSA is recommended to set up appropriate systems regarding the Korean governments shared growth principle as well.  Consumer Issues KSAs relevance on consumer issues is relatively low but it needs to consider elevating its response level on products and training equipment related with certification services and to make proactive investments in enhancing the protection of private consumer information. KSA would be better positioned to find ways to boost the level of health and safety of products certified under the KSA certification schemes and to use more eco-friendly products and services in its training sessions and various events.  Community Involvement and Development KSA is involved in wide-ranging social giving initiatives covering the One Company One Village campaign, free book seminars and volunteering programs attended by all of its employees. KSA needs to make closer arrangements between these philanthropic activities and its core capacity and to develop programs to make the best use of what it has in the fields of training promotion, function development and industry- academia cooperation. The process of soliciting opinions of local community is also required in developing programs.  Outcomes of Social Responsibility Performance Assessment Conclusions According to the ISO 26000 compliance self-assessment, KSA gained 66.6 scores in process and 70.4 scores in performance on average on a scale of 1 to 100. Process-wise, KSA lacks an organization-wide recognition of social responsibility and its strategic implementation. Performance-wise, KSAs human rights and environment achievements were relatively weak but it made positive accomplishments regarding labour practices, consumer issues and community involvement and development.  KSA is recommended to continue to take action and make improvement in a way that is systemized and aligned with its own business strategy to address the aforementioned weaknesses.
