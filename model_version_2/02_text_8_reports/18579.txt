We secure  sustainable supply of raw materials for our  units and a supply of renewable products for  our customers. the smaller the  environmental  impact, the better All human activity leaves a mark on  the planet. So does our production.  What matters is using energy, raw  materials and other resources efficiently and  maintaining low levels of emissions and waste.  We at Mets Group have reached great results  but we can always do more. We create   Well-being We generate well-being at work, in  local communities, and in society  at large and commit to global  sustainability principles. By behaving  responsibly towards our employees and  society, we can improve the quality of life of  our stakeholders. our approach to  sustainability We have divided our sustainability  approach into four themes covering  the whole value.  2  SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT — OPENING WORDS  2011 – BuIlDING a SuStaINaBIlIty   fOuNDatION fOR thE futuRE Mets Groups President and CEO states in the Annual Reports CEO  letter that in 2011, we put a lot of emphasis on developing our sustain- ability management and launching the new sustainability agenda with  the Group-wide sustainability targets. We wanted to focus on open  communication and highlight that sustainability is as important for us  and our partners as it is for our customers. As a result you are now  reading our new Sustainability Report. It offers a detailed description of  our management practices and our views on the most important sus- tainability themes. Our aim is to emphasise that we are one unified  Mets Group.  We were among the very first companies in Finland to commit to  the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact initiative.  This can also be seen in the fact that sustainability is central to our  mission, vision and values as well as our strategy. In 2011, we took  major steps to adopt sustainability into our management practices and  defined the most essential sustainability issues for the Group. In addi- tion to internal business workshops and management interviews, we  reviewed the global macro trends - climate change; the scarcity of global  water sources; deforestation; waste management and recycling to name  a few; and also asked our external stakeholders to participate in the  process.  Ensuring the origin of wood, promoting forest certification and the  sustainability of the whole supply chain were among the key themes  that emerged during the analysis. Additionally, material efficiency and  work safety were also considered important among our stakeholders. As  a result, we defined four main themes in which we will focus our sus- tainability efforts: sustainable offering; sustainable supply chain and  raw materials; environmental efficiency in production operations and  internal and external stakeholder relations.  Based on this business-driven sustainability agenda, we also pre- pared comprehensive sustainability targets to ensure the systematic  management of sustainability throughout the Group. These targets  cover all aspects of our operations; certified wood raw material and  sustainability of the supply chain; energy efficient processes and  reduced air emissions; ethical business practices as well as work safety  and well-being. The Groups performance against the newly set sustain- ability targets proceeded well during the last year. To maintain a robust and unified working culture, The Groups  policies were revised at the beginning of 2011 including our Sustain- ability Principles and employee Code of Conduct - the bases of our  everyday work. Moreover, as we did not want to limit our approach in  sustainability management to our own operations, the Group adopted a  new Code of Conduct for our suppliers. To confirm that the compli- ance with the same high standards of business ethics is respected in our  suppliers operations, The Group now carries out regular supplier  audits. Our main raw material is renewable and sustainably grown wood.   All the Groups products are recyclable and excellent alternatives for  many carbon-intensive products. Mets Group operates in areas rich in  forest and water resources. We know the origin of the wood   we use and we are efficient in the use of materials and energy,   being a significant user of biofuels and a major producer of bioenergy.  Our production operations are continuously assessed to ensure that  they are efficient and environmentally friendly. Additionally, Mets  Group is a key employer also in many remote areas and an active   member of the local communities in which it operates.  We have a good story to tell and we want to continue the direct and  transparent dialogue with you.   Sustainably yours, Riikka Joukio SVP, Sustainability and Corporate Affairs our commitment to sustainability is  strong. in 2011 We put a lot of  emphasis on developing our  sustainability management and  launching the neW agenda With the  group-Wide targets.

We continuously develop our opera- tions to meet the market demand for sustain- able products, and operate in a cost-efficient  way to achieve profitable growth. governance and reSponSibilitieS Metsliitto Cooperatives Board of Directors  has overall responsibility for governance and  its sustainability at Mets Group. It approves  the guiding policies and sets the Groups  ambition level. The Executive Management  Team prepares the guiding policies, defines  the sustainability targets and monitors the  performance against them. The Corporate Affairs Management Team  steers sustainability and corporate affairs  issues. It supports the Business Areas by gath- ering their views and needs on sustainability,  sets focus areas at the Group level and defines  the Groups positions so that the Business  Areas can enhance their competitiveness in  sustainability. The Sustainability and Corporate Affairs  function provides information to the manage- ment, identifies development needs and coor- dinates the Groups daily sustainability work.  It also supervises and promotes the Groups  interests in legislation and trade policy issues. link to other group functionS As sustainability is a fundamental part of our  business and all operations, it is integrated  into everything we do; for example, it is part  of the risk identification and management  processes as well as crisis management prac- tices. Additionally, Mets Group continuously  monitors its sustainability performance  through various tools and activities such as  internal audits. policieS and principleS Mets Groups sustainability management is  guided by the Groups Sustainability Princi- ples and the employees Code of Conduct,  which include all three aspects of sustainabil- ity: environmental, social and economic  responsibility. The Group also has a set of  policies and related instructions in place for  all relevant topics, including Environmental,  Human Resources, Equal Opportunities and  Purchasing policies in addition to a Supplier  Code of Conduct to guide supply chain oper- ations. group-wide SuStainability targetS  In 2011, Mets Group determined a set of  Group-wide sustainability targets to ensure an  efficient sustainability management. Read  more about the performance against these  targets on the following pages of the report. ManageMent SySteMS Management systems allow us to assess our  performance and to continuously improve our  operations. They help us to achieve the  Groups strategic objectives; improve our key  performance indicators; support our sustain- ability performance; and manage operational  risks. We are committed to promoting sustainable  development in all our business activities and  operations; to continuously improving our  operations; and to conducting business in a  responsible way. We have demonstrated our  aim by committing to the ten principles of the  UN Global Compact initiative, which high- lights the respect for human and labour rights,  environmental responsibility and anti-corrup- tion. The Groups Sustainability Principles are  also based on these universally accepted prin- ciples. MiSSion, viSion and valueS  Mets Groups mission is to competitively  procure, market and upgrade Nordics wood at  its own production units. Our vision is to be a  focused and profitable Finnish forest industry  company that operates in the international  market, and one that integrates sustainable  development, customer-orientation and   innovations in it products and services in   a unique way. Mets Groups values are responsible  profitability, reliability, cooperation and  renewal. These values guide the Group in  achieving its targets and are seen in our daily  activities. We strive to improve the profitabil- ity of our company, while at the same time  bearing responsibility for the environment  and listening to our stakeholder groups.

SuStaINaBIlIty GuIDES all OuR OPERatIONS — SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT  5  tRaNSPaRENt  DIalOGuE WIth  StakEhOlDERS We want to build trusted and open relations  with our main stakeholder groups. We have  defined our customers and personnel as our  most important stakeholder groups together  with members of the Cooperative, other forest  owners, suppliers, investors and financiers,  representatives of non-governmental organisa- tions (NGOs), the media and society at large. Different stakeholder groups have differ- ent expectations from the Group. For this  reason, we aim to engage in a transparent and  open dialogue with our stakeholders to gain a  better understanding of their expectations.  Transparent and constructive stakeholder  dialogue is an essential part of developing the  Groups activities and management, especially  the management of sustainability issues.  SuStainability agenda for the group  In 2011, Mets Groups main focus on sustain- ability management was on determining the  most essential sustainability issues for the  Group and its businesses and on building a  strategic sustainability agenda. In addition to  ten internal workshops for different Business  Areas, 15 management interviews and an  extensive stakeholder survey was conducted in  different geographical regions globally. The  survey covered all the Business Areas and their  stakeholder groups such as customers, ana- lysts, NGOs, the media and employees. We  offered the possibility for over 800 persons to  participate in building our sustainability  agenda, of whom some 200 responded.

Exter- nal stakeholders also emphasised the impor- tance of respecting human rights, product  safety, the well-being of employees and con- ducting ethical business practices. Supply  chain management is clearly becoming more  and more important in the eyes of our stake- holders.

Our advocacy on  these issues is mainly channelled through  industry and trade associations at the national,  European and international levels.  MeMberShipS and aSSociationS Mets Group, its Business Area and subsidiar- ies participate in a number of national indus- try and trade associations in their countries of  operation and actively take part in steering  them. These include: 	 The World Business Council for Sustain- able Development (WBCSD) and its  sector-specific network Forest Solutions 	 The Confederation of European Paper  Industries (CEPI)  	 The European Confederation of Wood- working Industries (CEI-Bois) 	 The Committee of Professional agricul- tural Organisations and the General  Confederation of Agricultural Coopera- tives (COPA-COGECA) 	 The Finnish Forest Industry Federation  (Metsteollisuus ry) 	 The Swedish Forest Industries Federation  (Skogsindustrierna) 	 The Confederation of Finnish Industries  (Elinkeinoelmn Keskusliitto) 	 The UN Global Compact Nordic Net- work and the UNs CEO Water Mandate 	 The forest certification associations: the  Programme for the Endorsement of Forest  Certification (PEFC) and the Forest  Stewardship Council (FSC). Additionally,  the Group or its subsidiaries are taking  part in several national forest industry  associations in the main operating coun- tries. There are also several sector-specific  organisations in which the Business Areas  participate such as the European Tissue  Symposium and the Confederation of  European Fine Paper Industries.

The  offering includes wood products for construc- tion and decoration, pulp, board and office  papers, tissue and cooking papers, as well as  forestry services. Our main raw material is  renewable wood and all our products are  recyclable.  Additionally, first-class raw materials,  excellent fibre technology know-how and the  efficient use of raw materials ensure a continu- ous flow of sustainable innovations. As our products are made of recyclable,  renewable wood raw material, they are excel- lent alternatives in replacing many non-renew- able, non-biodegradable carbon-intensive  products. further developMent of productS The Groups role is to decide in which busi- nesses it operates with each Business Area  responsible for its own product range and  offering. The R&D function of each Business  Area focuses on the further development of  existing products. The Business Areas also  collaborate in running development projects  in order to gain a better understanding of the  entire production chain from wood processing  and pulp production to board and tissue paper  manufacturing.  R&D projects are also carried out in  collaboration with partners such as universi- ties, research institutes and mechanical engi- neering companies. Mets Tissues consumer  and end-user driven product development  process is supported by the companys tech- nology centre in Germany. In 2011, Mets Group invested EUR 19  million in R&D (EUR 21 million in 2010),  which accounts for 0.4% of sales (0.4% in  2010). coMMunicating productS environMental  perforMance We know the environmental impacts of our  products and want to increase understanding  of them among our stakeholders.  lca coverS the whole production chain Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a technique  to assess environmental impacts associated  with all stages of a product's life cycle.

The goal of these product-specific  declarations is to provide objective, transpar- ent and comparable information on key envi- ronmental parameters such as emissions,  electricity, waste and product composition.  We use several product declarations  intended for pulp and paper products, such as  Paper Profile, and are working towards adopt- ing a unified LCA-approach in all main prod- uct categories.

It demon- strates the carbon dioxide emissions of a pro- cess behind the product. Mets Group uses  the carbon footprint to measure the fossil  carbon of its products. The result of the carbon footprint calcula- tion depends on the scope of the calculation:  the wider and more extensive the scope the  higher the emissions. Currently, as different  corporations use different methods for carbon  footprint calculations, they are not compara- ble from company to company. Mets Groups  carbon footprint calculation is wide-ranging  starting from wood raw material procurement  and covers the entire supply chain. Thus it  gives a comprehensive view on climate impacts  of our products and their supply chain.  product Safety iS our top priority One of our most fundamental duties is to  ensure that all our products and operations are  safe and sustainable. We guarantee that our  products are safe for people and the environ- ment when they are used as intended.  We have a strict policy that we know the  origin of the materials that we use and that all  the raw materials meet or exceed the current  legislative requirements. Ensuring product  safety is especially important in products that  are used in applications with strict hygiene  standards such as food or human contact  applications. This mostly applies to packaging  boards, napkins as well as baking and cooking  products. As a minimum requirement, all our mills  that manufacture food contact materials or  chemical pulp used in manufacturing these  products are certified according to ISO 22000  or BRC food safety management systems.

We expect our suppliers to comply with  a high standard of business ethics and integ- rity, to be committed to sustainability and to  follow good working practices.  The Code of Conduct emphasises actions  against corruption and bribery, and stresses  the respect for human rights and a safe work- ing environment. The Code also uncondition- ally prohibits the use of forced or child labour.  Furthermore, the supplier must ensure that all  of its subcontractors know and honour these  requirements. The Supplier Code of Conduct is an  integral part of any agreement documentation  and has been included in all new and renewed  contracts since June 2011. auditS confirM reSponSible operationS During 2011, Mets Group developed a com- mon monitoring process for the Groups  purchases and made audit plans for each of  the purchasing categories.

During 2011,  Mets Group performed 83 supplier audits. The intention is to ensure that the Sup- plier Code of Conduct is fully implemented  and that there are no incidents of child, forced  or compulsory labour in the suppliers opera- tions. In 2011, no risk for such incidents was  identified during the audits. focuS on efficient logiSticS Efficient supply chain management and on- time deliveries are the key elements in our  business operations. We ensure reliable, safe  and efficient logistics. Efficiency is attained by  maximising delivery sizes, optimising modal  selection including return load utilisation, as  well as minimising empty kilometres. As our  mills are located close to our main raw materi- als, we are always able to optimise our trans- port routes. Additionally, as energy efficiency  is an important factor in developing our trans- port operations, we favour rail and waterways  whenever a feasible solution is available. Transport and warehousing operations are  mainly outsourced to partners. Valid environ- mental certifications and policies play a sig- nificant role in selecting the partners as well as  the criteria set in the newly implemented  Supplier Code of Conduct. ENSuRING a SuStaINaBlE SuPPly chaIN — SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN  11  OuR WOOD IS  100%  tRacEaBlE Mets Groups mission is to competitively  procure, market and upgrade Nordic wood at  its own production units. We also offer our  members wide-scale forest management ser- vices, assistance and guidance in timber sales  in addition to investment opportunities such  as various additional shares.  Our operations are based on sustainable  wood raw material. Forests are a renewable  resource and continue to grow as long as they  are utilised in a sustainable way. Wood sup- plied by us originates from sustainably-man- aged forests, and the origin of wood material  can be traced in order to verify this. foreSt growth exceedS the harveSting Perhaps the most important criteria for the  sustainability of forest management are that  forests grow more than they are being utilised  - and when they are being utilised, they are  also being renewed. In Finland, where roughly  70% of the wood supplied by Mets Group  originates, the annual increment of the forests  growing stock (2,200 million m3) exceeds the  drain by over 30%. The growing stock in  Finlands forests has increased by more than  40% over the past 40 years. The past 35 years  has also seen the area of protected forests  being tripled and the introduction of nature  management in commercial forests. proMoting SuStainable foreStry  Mets Group ensures the sustainability of its  supply chain by tracing the origin of wood  and promoting sustainable forestry. Certifica- tion is a tool to ensure both the sustainability  of the supply chain and forestry operations. To  pursue this line, Mets Group holds Chain-of- Custody (CoC) certificates covering all the  wood supplied by the company. In addition,  the main forest areas owned or leased by the  Groups companies hold certificates of sustain- able forest management. In 2011 for example,  Mets Group was the first company in Russia  to obtain double certification (PEFC and  FSC) for its leased forests in Podporozhye, in  Leningrad region. The target of Mets Group is to support  sustainable forest management and to sustain  the amount of certified wood in our opera- tions above 80%. As much as 95% of Finlands  commercial forests are PEFC certified and 2%  according to FSC. Mets Group is actively  promoting forest certification initiatives in the  whole wood supply region. In 2011, 81% of  the wood supplied by Mets Group was either  PEFC or FSC certified or both. As certification aims at continuous  improvement, the standards need to be  updated on a regular basis. At the beginning  of 2011, Mets Group started implementing  the renewed PEFC forest certification stand- we want to Support  SuStainable foreSt  ManageMent and Safeguard  rich biodiverSity in foreSt  operationS. to thiS aiM, our  target iS to SuStain the high  aMount of certified wood   in our operationS at over   80 per cent. 12  SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN — OuR WOOD IS 100% tRacEaBlE  main forest areas oWned or leased by mets group cOUnTRy fOREST OwnER/lEaSEhOldER TOTal aREa, hEcTaRES 1) Of which PROTEcTEd aREaS,  hEcTaRES cERTificaTiOn FiNlaNd Mets-botnia, Metst oy 35,255 566 2) pEFc kirkniemen kartano oy 961 217 2) pEFc RUSSia ooo Metsliitto podporozhye 215,082 53,050 3) pEFc and FSc Zao petrovles podporozhye and Zao petrovles pasha 112,679 62,255 3) pEFc and FSc 1) including forestry land and other land within the forest estate / area. 2) including Nature conservation areas, Natura 2000 areas and conservation programme areas.

In addition to the areas presented in the table,  Mets Group owns small forest estates in  Finland and in Estonia (altogether 214 ha).  Further, Mets Group owns shares (<50%) in  the Finnish forest-owning entities Finsilva Oy  and Suomen Metssijoitus, and in the Russian  forestry holding Vologodskie Lesopromysh- lenniki. ard in Finland. Additionally, the recertifica- tion audit for Mets Forest and Mets Wood  on ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and PEFC CoC  multi-site certification was carried out. we know the origin of our wood Regardless whether the wood originates from  certified or non-certified forests, the origin is  always known. Mets Groups internal audit- ing procedures and wood origin tracing sys- tem cover the actions of the wood supplier or  harvesting contractor as well as the origin and  nature management audit. Internal auditing  thus covers a wide range of sustainability  issues from the preservation of nature values  and legal origin of the wood to social issues  such as safety at work.  Wood suppliers and contractors have also  committed themselves to certain sustainability  principles which are included in the contracts.  The commitments extend to the very begin- ning of the supply chain, including possible  sub-suppliers and subcontractors. In 2011,  Mets Group established and systematically  brought into practice a Supplier Code of Con- duct. Safeguarding nature valueS  Nature management efforts, such as leaving  retention trees, hardwood species and dead- wood in logging operations have received  recognition in a number of reports published  in 2010 and 2011. One reference is the fourth  assessment of threatened species in Finland,  published in late 2010. The study showed that  certain species that live on decaying wood  have benefited from leaving retention trees, a  requirement of the widely-used (some 95% of  Finnish commercial forests) PEFC criteria  since 1999. In 2011, there were some drawbacks in  the national Nature Management Assessment  results in Finland, partly due to an unusually  thick cover of snow prevailing in the country  at the time. This meant that during logging it  was more difficult for the harvester drivers to  detect some of the habitats. This aside, the  results have remained at a high level. We operate in  northern europe in  areas With rich Wood  and Water resources  and Where forests  groW more than they  are harvested. OuR WOOD IS 100% tRacEaBlE — SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN  13  testing the neW finnish fsc standard Mets Group started testing  Finland's new Forest Steward- ship Council (FSC) certifica- tion standard in part of its own  forests. The Group's forests  have already been certified  according to the Programme  for the Endorsement of Forest  Certification (PEFC) standard.  In future, the FSC standard will  be applied in these forests as  well. The project covers the  forests owned by Mets Fibre  and Mets Forest, both part of  the Mets Group. The total  surface area of the forests is  approximately 35,000 hec- tares. Mets Group expects to get the FSC certificate by the end of 2012, and will then offer its  members who have a forest management service agreement the option to join Mets Groups  FSC group certificate. We already offer similar PEFC group certification to those members who  have a forest management service agreement. We support both the current certification sys- tems and promote forest certification in all our areas of operation. forest certification is a  voluntary system Which  supports the Well-being of  forests and confirms the  legal origin of the Wood. Outside Finland Mets Group ensures  that the nature management of harvesting  operations comply with legislation and forest  certification criteria by regular and extensive  field audits. In 2011, the audit results have  remained at a good level and no serious mal- practices were found. For example, minor  observations were made in Russia concerning  soil damage or the tidiness of storage places. we develop our operationS continuouSly The results of the national Nature Manage- ment Assessment and Mets Groups own  inspections are analysed and any needed  corrective actions are brought into the Envi- ronmental Programme of Wood Supply.  Implementation of the Environmental Pro- gramme is followed by an external auditor  within Mets Groups ISO 14001 certifica- tion. Both the inspection results and the  Environmental Programme are reviewed by  the top management. The corrective actions of the Environmen- tal Programme include training at different  levels of the organisation, communications  and development in different contexts. As an  example of development work in the field of  nature management in 2011, Mets Forest in  Finland introduced the implementation of a  pre-logging clearing method which avoids the  excess removal of undergrowth - important  from the point of view of many forest dwell- ing species. Mets Group considers the com- pletion of the Nature Management Card or  similar training for harvester drivers as one of  the most efficient ways to improve environ- mental performance in forestry operations.  This is why such training has been an integral  part of the Environmental Programme already  for several years. enhancing SuStainability together Besides nature management in harvesting  operations, safeguarding the biodiversity of  forests is complemented by additional meas- ures. We have successfully gathered practical  experience in mapping biologically valuable  forests in our leased forest areas in Pod- porozhye, Russia, and have gained much  recognition and interest from our stakehold- ers. We have also continued to share our expe- riences at numerous events with the forest  authorities, NGOs and other companies.  In Finland, the Forest Biodiversity Pro- gramme METSO, initiated in 2008, has con- tinued to gain the forest owners support and  bring valuable forest habitats under METSO  protection. In 2011, we launched a service for  forest owners, enabling them to offer their  valuable forest habitats to the METSO pro- gramme via their own local Mets Groups  contact.  One implementation method of the  METSO programme is cooperation networks.  These aim to help forest owners maintain  forest landscapes, develop recreational activi- ties related to forest biodiversity and manage  valuable habitats. One of these cooperation  networks in which Mets Group participates  was launched in late 2011 and aims to develop  the nature management of the ecotones of  forest areas towards enhancing game (and  consequently other forest dwelling) species  habitat requirements. Another stakeholder  project with Mets Groups participation, led  by the Development Centre of Forestry Tapio,  started at the end of 2011. Its aim is to  develop landscape management practices,  establish a network of example plots and  produce up-to-date training material. Mets Forest in Finland continues to  develop its services for forest owners. Sustain- ability-related services added to the service  package in 2011 include the possibility of  PEFC group certification and the METSO  service described earlier. Mets Groups PEFC  group certification is a service provided for its  14  SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN — OuR WOOD IS 100% tRacEaBlE  We Work closely With our  partners to ensure a  sustainable supply chain.

Additionally,  we haves continued to offer the possibility for  forest owners to order a forestry plan with  emphasis on nature management. long-terM cooperation with partnerS Mets Group plays a significant regional role  in offering work opportunities in rural areas  by using the services of harvesting and trans- port entrepreneurs. Our Entrepreneur Guide- lines aims at long-term cooperation and com- panionship - something that brings benefits to  all the parties. We have also strengthened our  cooperation with contractors by introducing a  service package model, which encourages  entrepreneurs to develop their company. In  addition to this, the expansion of energy  wood harvesting and  the utilisation of this  local, renewable  energy bring addi- tional work opportu- nities to the rural  areas. The Group has  been one of the early pioneers in Finland who  have made several advances in this field so that  today, energy wood is one assortment among  its others.

At the end of 2011, Mets Group introduced  new Group-wide targets for fossil carbon  dioxide emissions and energy efficiency. We  focus on mitigating climate change. To this  end, our target is to reduce fossil-based CO2  emissions in production by 30% per product  ton by 2020 from 2009 level. At the same  time, we ensure efficient energy consumption.  To this aim, we have a target to improve our  energy efficiency by 10% by 2020 from 2009  level. high Share of bioenergy During 2011, Mets Group took major steps  to increase its already high share of bioenergy  in its energy consumption. In 2011, wood- based bioenergy accounted for 63% (62% in  2010) of the Groups total energy use of 31.1  TWh (31.9 TWh), mostly from by-products  from our own production such as black liquor,  bark and sawdust. The rest are mainly forest  residues that are co-sourced together with  round wood. A majority (77%) of the total grid electric- ity sourcing was CO2 neutral energy. Grid  electricity consumption totalled 2.68 TWh  (2.71 TWh). To increase this share in 2011,  Mets Tissue started to source 70% of the  electricity needed at the Zilina mill in Slova- kia from a local hydro power plant. Further- more, Mets Board and Mets Fibre decided  to participate in the planning of a new poten- tial nuclear power plant at Olkiluoto, Finland.  The decisions on the participation in the  project are expected in 2014. further inveStMentS in biofuelS To increase the already high share of bioen- ergy, Mets Group has invested in four large  bioenergy projects that will partially or fully  replace fossil fuel-based energy with renewable  biomass. Together, these projects will reduce  the Groups fossil CO2 emissions by some  200,000 tonnes annually. The continuous  evaluation of additional investments in bioen- ergy continues.  Mets Board completed a turbine invest- ment worth EUR 20 million at Husum mill in  Sweden. The project will increase the mills  bio-based energy generation and electricity  self-sufficiency from  approximately 30% to over  50%. At Kyro mill in Fin- land, Mets Board and its  partners continued with a  EUR 50 million investment  in a biomass boiler.  At Joutseno mill in  Finland, Mets Fibre  started to build a new wood  gasification plant, which will produce biogas  that replaces natural gas at the lime kiln. As a  result, Joutseno mill will have fossil-free opera- tions under normal production conditions  from 2012. At Lohja mill in Finland, Mets  Wood and its partners have an on-going  investment project worth EUR 17 million on  a new wood-fired boiler that will start supply- ing steam to the mill and district heat to the  local community by the end of 2012.  developMentS in energy efficiency In 2011, Mets Group continued to improve  the energy efficiency of its production pro- cesses in line with the Energy Efficiency Sys- tems that have been in place since 2006 and  now cover all the mills. Numerous energy  analyses were conducted across the Group.

Efficiency improvements are an integral  part of all major investments in production  capacity. In 2011, altogether 135 smaller  projects were completed that reduced electric- ity consumption by some 54 GWh and heat  by 260 GWh annually, thus eliminating fossil  CO2 emissions by approximately 47,500  tonnes. Since 2009 we have managed to  decrease our fossil-based CO2 emissions by  16%. We have managed to improve our energy  efficiency by 5% since 2009 regardless of  uneven production rates during the ramp-up  phases after capacity increase investments at  several mills in 2011. Also, Mets Boards  mills in central Europe had poorer efficiencies  due to low production rates last year.  Mets Tissue was granted a subsidy by the  EU under the program of the Sustainable  Industry Low Carbon Scheme with its project  Sustainable Low Carbon Tissue Manufactur- ing. The project is linked to Mets Tissues  project to improve energy efficiency by 20%  by 2012 from the 2007 level.  new eu regulationS New policy measures are planned or imple- mented at the EU level. The Commission has  prepared several roadmaps to achieve a low- carbon and resource-efficient Europe by 2050.  These roadmaps are expected to lead to new  directives and regulations in the forthcoming  years.  In 2011, Mets Groups mills submitted  their applications for free emissions allow- ances for the EUs CO2 Emissions Trading  during 2013–2020. The final allocations will  be settled in 2012. Mets Group is evaluating  the appropriate measures to comply with the  Industrial Emission Directive that comes to  force in 2016. Due to much more stringent  emission limits, minor investments will be  required for boilers at several Group mills.

It is also needed for cleaning, cool- ing and, to a minor extent, making steam for  thermal energy. Our mills are mainly located in the Nor- dic countries which have plenty of good qual- ity fresh water. However, we continuously  seek new ways to minimise the use of fresh  water in our processes e.g. by re-cycling it  effectively. This minimises the wastewater  emissions and saves energy, thus decreasing  the impact on the climate. The percentage of  recycled and reused water varies mill by mill,  mainly depending on product quality require- ments and local water conditions. Mills have set their own targets and con- tinuous improvement plans for water use in  their environmental management systems.  Additionally, Mets Board has started a pro- ject to calculate the water footprint of a prod- uct based on a life-cycle assessment. The first  results from the study will be available in  2012. purely Surface water We mainly use surface water. Our mills water  intake is typically some 0.1–1% of the total  flow of a river or a lake meaning that our water  intake does not limit other water uses in the  same region. With groundwater, the intake  volume is determined and carefully controlled  by the mills environmental permit.  In 2011, our fresh water intake totalled  370 million cubic meters (400 million in  2010), almost all (98%) is surface water from  rivers and lakes. guarded waStewater treatMent Process waters are carefully cleaned before  they are released back into a river, lake or the  sea with most mills oper- ating their own wastewa- ter purification plants.  Furthermore, each mill  has its own specific envi- ronmental permit which  sets limits for pollutants.  The main wastewater  impacts are eutrophica- tion and oxygen demand caused by phospho- rus and nitrogen nutrients and organic matter. cooperation to better water  ManageMent At the local level, we are participating in  several initiatives, together with environmen- tal authorities, which aim to develop water- course management. These are mainly linked  to the implementation of the EU Water  Framework Directive. We also take part in  several international forums related to water  management.

These include  fibre sludge, sludge from deinking recycled  paper, ashes from energy production as well as  green liquor sludge and lime ash from chemi- cal pulp production. Most of these residuals  can be further used for bioenergy production,  as fertiliser, in landfill capping and in earth  construction. In 2011, we reused 90% of the waste,  altogether 700,000 tonnes. Our total amount  of waste to landfill was  70,000 tonnes, which  was 60% less compared to the previous year.  During the year, our production units  generated 1,970 tonnes of hazardous waste.  Typically, these are oils and chemicals, paints,  laboratory waste, fluorescent lamps and bat- teries. The collection of hazardous waste is  outsourced to our partner, who also has a  licence to dispose of them. Mets Group works actively to prevent  waste generation and to find new ways to  reuse residuals and by-products. We continu- ously reduce the amount of waste by enhanc- ing recovery processes, increasing the solid  content of waste to landfill and by increasing  the energy use of organic waste.  Several end-uSeS for waSte Deinking sludge is a fine example of a residual  that has several alternatives for re-use. When  paper and board is recycled, the collected  material is pulped, the ink removed and the  fibres and fillers are recovered. The recycled  fibres are further used in tissue production;  recycled fillers can be reused in paper produc- tion; and the rest  of the mixture,  fibre clay, can be  used as a soil con- ditioner. Fibre clay  is also a by-prod- uct of paper pro- duction from  primary fibres, produced when loose fibres are  removed from wastewater. Fibre clay is considered as waste according  to the current EU legislation. Mets Group  produces some 130,000 tonnes of fibre clay  per year at its Finnish production facilities  and is currently able to reuse almost all of it. Fibre clay can be used in soil improvement  as it has very good erosion prevention proper- ties. It is also suitable, for example, for landfill  construction or landscaping skiing resorts  where fibre clay structures reduce the need for  Material efficiency MeanS  the efficient uSe of natural  reSourceS and the efficient  re-uSe of waSte and  by-productS. for exaMple,  the waSte froM our  proceSSeS can be uSed aS  valuable raw Material  elSewhere.

MetS tiSSue The chemical filling station at Kreuzau mill  was updated. Improvements were also made at  the dosage system for caustic soda thus  improving environmental and work safety. At  Dren mill, a large amount of asbestos was  removed from the soil during the restructur- ing of the production halls. The mill also  installed new, continuous emission measure- ment equipment for CO2 and NOx at the  power plant.  Mntt and Zilina mills have introduced a  new energy management operating system as  part of Mets Tissues energy efficiency pro- ject. The system offers on-line data from the  mills energy use, enabling them to efficiently  control and optimise their energy use.  MetS board New infra dryers were installed at Kyro mill,  which are expected to cut the consumption of  natural gas to almost one half at the board  mill. Simpele mill made several investments to  reduce energy and water consumption, and to  improve wastewater management and waste  handling. Kyro, Simpele, Husum and Kaski- nen mills updated their environmental noise  surveys and made the necessary improve- ments. An environmental risk survey was  updated at Tako mill. The environmental management systems  in Mets Boards Paperboard Business were  developed and integrated into one certified  management system covering all the mills.  MetS fibre Joutseno mill installed a new stripper in the  evaporation plant, which has significantly  reduced the organic loading to the wastewater  treatment plant. The mill will be able to  reduce the use of fresh water and reuse its  by-products with process development. A new  trial for the utilisation of residuals such as lime  and rejects in soil improvement was initiated.  A new recausticising plant was taken into use  at Kemi mill. It is expected to significantly  improve the operation of the recovery line  resulting in lower emissions to air.  A new treatment plant for oxidised white  liquor was taken into operation at Rauma  mill, improving the  control of the mills  chemical balance. The  flue gas treatment for  the lime kiln was also  improved. nekoski  mill improved the  treatment of malodor- ous gases by investing in treatment capacity  and extending the coverage of gas collection.  The flue gas treatment of the recovery boiler  was also improved with repairs in the electro- static precipitator. A development project  aiming at improvements in the operation of  the wastewater treatment plant was finalised  with promising results, especially in nutrient  control. MetS wood Lappeenranta sawmill built a new petrol  filling station with up-to-date safety systems  for the vehicles used on the site. Kyro sawmill  carried out remediation work with contami- nated soil found during the construction of a  new storage facility. Suolahti plywood mill  finalised the construction of a closed water  circuit for the log soaking basins. An OHSAS  18001 occupational health and safety manage- ment system was certified at Eskola sawmill. environMental liabilitieS Mets Group companies have several liabili- ties from previous operations at closed-down,  sold or leased industrial properties and  decommissioned landfills. Mets Group has  been able to reduce its known old environ- mental liabilities over the past few years with  the remediation of contaminated sites and  landfills. Most recently, a clean-up of the  closed-down Wifsta mill site in Sweden was  completed in 2011 by Mets Board. Environ- mental liabilities are recorded in accordance  with the current environmental protection  laws and regulations when it is possible that  the obligations amount can be estimated. environMental incidentS  All environmental incidents that resulted in  major permit violations, claims, compensa- tions or significant media coverage are  detailed in the following table. Additionally,  minor and short-term non-compliances with  environmental permit requirements were  reported at Mets Boards Alizay, Husum,  Gohrsmhle and  Kaskinen mills as well  as Mets Fibres Kemi  mill. The authorities  were informed and  corrective actions  taken in all cases.

The permit limit for nitrogen in wastewater was exceeded due to an overdose  of nutrients to the wastewater treatment plant. Training has been given to staff in nutrient dosing in  wastewater treatment. a development project for the  operation of Mets board's treatment plants as a whole  has been initiated. nevoima oy, Finland an oil spill occurred at nevoima power plant in august due to mechanical  failures in the oil pumping station and spill containment systems. about  10 m3 of heavy fuel oil was discharged to lake kuhnamo, requiring clean-up  measures.  plant monitoring and spill containment systems were  fixed and upgraded. Extensive clean-up measures were  taken at lake kuhnamo.  METS FibRE Rauma mill, Finland The permit limits for sulphur dioxide emissions to air from pulp production  were exceeded in February and November due to malfunctions in the flue gas  treatment. daily emission limits for malodous gases were briefly exceeded in  February, June and august.  The malfunctions in the emission treatment equipment  have been corrected and several improvements made. The permit limits for nitrogen and phosphorous emissions to water, set as a  three-month average value, were exceeded from September to November at  the joint wastewater treatment plant with UpM Rauma mill. The  noncompliance was caused by operational problems at the wastewater  treatment plant in September.  an internal investigation was carried out on the  operation of the wastewater treatment plant. nekoski mill, Finland The permit limit for phosphorous emissions to water was exceeded in  december due to a nutrient unbalance in the production process.  internal surveys to correct the nutrient balance were  carried out. Joutseno mill, Finland The permit limit for phosphorous emissions to water was exceeded in June  due to an unusually high phosphorous content in the wastewater from the  mill.  a temporary, additional chemical treatment of  wastewater to cut down the phosphorous levels was  made. internal surveys to correct the nutrient balance  were carried out.

In the regions  where we operate, we are also a major player  and an active member of the local communi- ties. The socio-economic impacts of our oper- ations thus have major effects on different  stakeholder groups and locations.  WE cREatE  WEll-BEING Mets Group signed a two-year coop- eration agreement with WWF Finland at  the beginning of 2011. We supported  WWF Finlands activities during the UN  International Year of Forests in Finland,  including WWFs 50th anniversary  seminar on forestry and a series of  round table discussions on Finnish  forests and climate. We also partici- pated in a seminar on sustainable  packaging with WWF Finlands other  cooperation partners. Mets Tissue, one of the Groups subsidiaries, offered training to almost 100 employees in  four different regions on themes related to sustainable development such as water, the carbon  footprint, forest certification as well as eco-labelling and environmental management systems.  Within the cooperation agreement WWF Finlands representatives joined the dialogue offering  insights mainly on the status of the worlds forests. cooperation With WWf finland 22  WELL-BEING — WE cREatE WEll-BEING  As well as providing livelihood for forest  owners, Mets Group is an important  employer, also in many remote areas. In addi- tion to the people we employ directly, we  generate significant employment opportuni- ties indirectly for our partners and subcon- tractors. We aim to create well-being for  mutual benefit of all our stakeholders. For this reason, we take into account the  impacts that the surrounding communities  might undergo due to changes in our opera- tions already during the planning phase -  whether it is investing in the current, starting  up new or closing down existing operations.  After the restructuring operations completed  in 2011, the Groups determined restructuring  work has now reached its final phase. Today,  we are a focused and strong international  forest industry group that continuously devel- ops its operations and production units in a  stable and long-term basis.

In 2011,  98% of our employees in  Finland were covered by collective bargaining  agreements and 77% were known to be mem- bers of trade unions. Mets Group applies  country-specific collective bargaining agree- ments. We conduct a formal employee consulta- tion process for Mets Board and Mets Tis- sue Business Areas and develop employee  dialogue across countries through the Euro- pean Works Council (EWC), a forum of  communication between management and  employees. The main objective is to ensure  that cooperation and mutual communication  in working towards common goals is accord- ing to mutual values. Additionally, the parent  company's personnel has elected four mem- bers to the Cooperative's Supervisory Board  each for a three year period. In all operating countries, Mets Group  conforms to the country specific laws and  agreements in terms of employment. At the end of 2011, Mets Group had  total of 12,525 employees, of whom 94% were  permanent employees while 6% had tempo- rary contracts. Part-time employees accounted  for 3% of all Mets Groups personnel at the  end of 2011. The year was challenging for the personnel  as Mets Group implemented several restruc- turing activities to mitigate the losses of its  paper business. The restructuring measures  taken were: the start of the consultation and  negotiation processes to plan the shut down of  the Alizay mill in France and discontinue  unprofitable businesses at the Gohrsmhle  and Reflex mills in Germany; and the restruc- turing of the coated paper business, including  the process of shutting down the nekoski  paper machine in Finland. In addition, tissue  production, converting and supply chain  operations at Konstancin-Jeziorna mill near  Warsaw, Poland, are to be discontinued. The restructuring of businesses affected a  total of 3,270 employees during 2011, of  whom 349 were made redundant and 136  contract ended due to another reasons such as  retirement or temporality.  Total of 822  employees were temporarily laid off in 2011.  Mets Group supports all affected personnel  in finding new employment and takes respon- sibility in the local communities. ethical buSineSS  The Code of Conduct guides employees in  dealing with gifts, possible bribery and corrup- StreaMlining policieS In 2011, Mets Group completed a Group- wide project and introduced 16 new or  revised policies. Best practices from different  parts of the Group were collected, existing  policies streamlined and additional policies  introduced. Our daily sustainability work is  guided by our Sustainability Principles as well  as our employee and supplier Codes of Con- duct.  Ethical business practices are the core of  all our operations. Thus our target is to have  the whole personnel covered by Code of  Conduct training by the end of 2012. Train- ing in the new policies for our employees and  management started with the employee Code  of Conduct in autumn 2011.  reSponSible ManageMent  Mets Group promotes equal opportunities  and emphasises that discrimination may lead  to disciplinary actions. It is the responsibility  of each employee to report any discrimina- tion. All formal complaints are systematically  handled through the Groups Code of Con- duct practices. No cases of discrimination or  human rights violations were reported in  2011. Mets Groups Code of Conduct and  Sustainability Principles guide the employees  24  WELL-BEING — RESPONSIBlE EMPlOyER, RESPONSIBlE BuSINESS  tion, and instructs employees not to accept  any bribes or high-value business gifts, or in  any way advance business through bribery or  blackmail. During 2011, Mets Group has not  been accused of participating in any corrup- tive activities. The Code of Conduct also calls  for each employee to report any conduct  contrary to the guidelines. A report can be  submitted to an employees superior or to the  Group General Counsel. In 2011, two cases  were reported. During 2011, Metshallitus, a state enter- prise that administers state-owned land and  water areas, together with several Finnish  towns, municipalities and private forest own- ers filed claims for damages against Metsliitto  Cooperative and two other forest companies  at the Courts of Finland. The claims relate to  the decision of the Market Court on 3  December 2009 whereby Metsliitto Coop- erative and two other forest industry compa- nies were deemed to have breached competi- tion rules in the Finnish roundwood market  from 1997 to early 2004. Metsliitto Coop- erative considers the claims unfounded in  their entirety. No significant fines were paid or other  non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance  with laws and regulations were received in  2011. Safety iS our top priority We continuously develop and promote the  occupational safety and well-being at work of  our employees. We monitor absenteeism and  accident rates through Group-wide targets  and reporting. Surveys enable us to identify  and address any issues at an early stage that  may potentially threaten work capacity or  safety. Local Occupational Health and Safety  Committees play an important role in train- ing and facilitating health and safety at the  local level. These committees cover 100% of  our employees in all main operating countries.  We strive for continuous improvement and  our aim is to improve our lost-time accident  rate by 10% each year. Our long-term target  for lost-time accident rate is zero. In 2011, the  lost-time accident rate was 18.3 (17.3 in  2010). We want also to ensure a healthy work  environment. Our target is to keep sickness  absenteeism rate at the best European level  and below 3% at all times. In 2011, our sick- ness absenteeism was 4.4% (4.2% in 2010). We continuously seek ways to improve the  safety culture of the organisation and the  safety of the working environment to prevent  all work-related injuries and accidents. How- ever, at the end of 2011, an accident due to  human error caused the death of an employee  at Simpele mill in Finland. According to  corporate safety instructions, we took imme- diate actions to investigate the incident and  find solutions on how to prevent similar acci- dents from happening in the future. high-quality everyday ManageMent Mets Groups HR processes aim to ensure  that the right people are in the right position  at the right time and with the right skills.  Combined with good management practices,  this creates a basis for well-being at work,  organisational efficiency and provides oppor- tunities for personal and organisational devel- opment.  Management processes and systems are  designed to support high-quality everyday  management and provide solutions for the  employees' professional development. These  common tools and processes help our manag- ers provide the quality of leadership that all  employees are entitled to. an attractive eMployer In 2011,  newly recruited permanent employ- ees accounted for 6% of the total number of  employees (full-time equivalent). For all of its  permanent, fixed-term and part-time employ- ees, Mets Group provides the benefits  required by local legislation such as occupa- tional health service, insurance against occu- pational diseases, parental leave and retire- ment benefits. In addition, the Group sup- ports its employees' recreation possibilities. We continuously monitor employee satis- faction. Surveys capture the personnels views  on their working environment and develop- ment compared to previous years. They also  provide ideas for the continuous improvement  of the companys operations which, in turn,  improves working conditions and helps the  Group and its Business Areas reach their  strategic goals. In 2011, on a scale of 4 to 10,  Mets Group had an overall job satisfaction  rating of 8.22 with a response rate of 75%.  We promote safety at Work   – for our employees and for   our partners. our accident   rate is loWer than the industry  average. RESPONSIBlE EMPlOyER, RESPONSIBlE BuSINESS — WELL-BEING  25  Mets Group recognises  that the effective safety  and well-being policies  along with systematic  monitoring of the work- safety related indicators  promote a more long- term approach to the  overall health of the  personnel – something  that the Group considers  crucial. To this aim, we  implemented globally a new unified model to support our employees  work capacity, which includes early support, an assessment of work  capacity and a personal work capacity plan. The model assists in  creating a caring work environment and enables the equal treatment  of all employees. Providing early support is part of good management practices as  it addresses an employees right to receive support and places an  obligation on the superior to provide it. With the new model, and in  tight collaboration with occupational health care, supervisors are  given tools and training to identify any potential situations that can  threaten the employees ability to work . Early support starts with a  discussion with the superior to identify any work capacity difficulties  as not all are shown as sick leave. When the deterioration of work  capacity is identified at an early stage, it can be supported success- fully and major problems prevented. If the superior recognises a need  for further actions, a work capacity assessment can be requested  from the occupational health-care provider who then carries out a  work capacity evaluation. Its purpose is to support the employee who  may be referred to the health-care provider for closer assessment on  the need for rehabilitation. If a need for sick leave is identified, Mets  Group has implemented a corresponding program to manage such  absence and facilitate the return to work. A successful return-to-work  program includes several aspects, such as a return-to-work discus- sion between the superior and employee to ensure active and open  communication. The employee can also be offered an alternative  employment task if needed. In the coming years, we will monitor   the impacts the early support model has on the well-being of our  employees. supporting Work capacity Mets Group has a Group-wide bonus  system that supports the strategy implementa- tion and motivates the personnel to reach the  set targets. Both permanent and temporary  employees are entitled to bonuses. In 2011,  Mets Group paid as salaries, wages and ben- efits (including social security and pension  costs) EUR 863 million (EUR 745 million in  2010). Professional development and growth Mets Group offers its employees the  possibility to obtain new skills through train- ing, internal job rotation and other learning  opportunities. These help to retain highly  skilled, talented and committed employees,  and improve the overall satisfaction of its  personnel. The average years served in Mets  Group is 15.6.  Each employee has the right to work- related training and development. The  employees annual personal development plan  is made for the forthcoming year in the Per- sonnel Development Appraisal (PDA).

St. petersburg planing plant in Russia is not included in the figures above. daTa MEaSUREMEnT TEchniqUES calculation coverage follows that of the financial accounting with the following corrections: 	 discharges to water through external waste water treatment plant (typically municipal) are  taken into account assuming 85% reduction for cod, emissions of bod, phosphorus and  suspended solids are calculated according to flow with the following residual concentrations:  bod 10 mg/l; total phosphorus 0.5 mg/l; total suspended solids 10 mg/l; total nitrogen  emissions is regarded as zero, because there is surplus nitrogen in municipal waste waters  and reduction of our bod is binding nitrogen to biomass and therefore reducing the plants  total nitrogen emission 	 the emission of external waste waters treated in our waste water treatment plants are not  included. allocation of emission between internal and external inflows is carried out assuming  theoretical cod reductions for each inflow, which then are corrected according to the real  cod reduction for the whole plant. other emission parameters are allocated according to flow.  Total energy consumption is expressed as primary fuel consumption and calculated by  assuming 40% energy efficiency for purchased electricity production and 85% energy  efficiency for purchased heat production.  Environmental impacts, acidification and eutrophication, are calculated by multiplying impact  causing emissions by coefficients. acidification is expressed as sulphur dioxide equivalents.  coefficient for So2 emission is 1 and for Nox 0.7. Eutrophication is expressed as phosphorus  equivalents. coefficient for total phosphorus is 1, for bod 0.0088, for total nitrogen 0.14 and  for Nox 0.0041. Greenhouse impact consists only from fossil carbon dioxide emissions with  coefficient 1.  in mill specific data, discharges from waste water plants serving several mills are allocated to  mills using the methodology explained above. Emissions from power plants separate to mill  units are also allocated to mills using the energy. in this allocation, the use of 1 MWh of  electricity is valued double compared to the use of 1 MWh of heat.  Waste volumes are reported including the moisture.

ManageMentS reSponSibility The Management of Mets Group is responsi- ble for preparing the Sustainability informa- tion in accordance with the Reporting Crite- ria as set out in Mets Groups reporting  guidelines and the Sustainability Reporting  Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative  (version 3.1). practitionerS reSponSibility Our responsibility is to express a conclusion  on the Sustainability information based on  our work performed. Our assurance report has  been made in accordance with the terms of  our engagement. We do not accept or assume  INDEPENDENt  aSSuRaNcE  REPORt  responsibility to anyone else, except to Mets  Group for our work, for this report, or for the  conclusions that we have reached.  We conducted our work in accordance  with the International Standard on Assurance  Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Assurance  engagements other than audits or reviews of  historical financial information. This Stand- ard requires that we comply with ethical  requirements and plan and perform the assur- ance engagement to obtain limited assurance  whether any matters come to our attention  that cause us to believe believe that the Sus- tainability information has not been prepared,  in all material respects, in accordance with the  Reporting criteria.  In a limited assurance engagement the  evidence-gathering procedures are more lim- ited than for a reasonable assurance engage- ment, and therefore less assurance is obtained  than in a reasonable assurance engagement.  An assurance engagement involves performing  procedures to obtain evidence about the  amounts and other disclosures in the Sustain- ability information. The procedures selected  depend on the practitioners judgement,  including an assessment of the risks of mate- rial misstatement of the Sustainability infor- mation. Our work consisted of, amongst others,  the following procedures: 	 Interviewing senior management of Mets  Group. 	 Assessing how Mets Group employees  apply the reporting guidelines and proce- dures of the Group.  	 Visiting Mets Groups Head Office as  well as five sites in Finland and Germany  (Mets Wood, Lohja; Mets Tissue, Rau- bach; Mets Board, Joutseno;  Mets  Fibre, Joutseno and Mets Forest, Fin- land). 	 Interviewing employees responsible for  the collection and reporting of the infor- mation presented in the Sustainability  information at Mets Group level and at  the different sites where our visits took  place.
