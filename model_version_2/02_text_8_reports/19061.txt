It is a mindset. Our company  founder Robert Bosch wanted a company that benefits society, a company that generates  social capital beyond its products and services. At Bosch, working to ensure a bright  future has been company policy for 126 years. Our definition of sustainability has grown  organically over generations of associates, and is not merely the product of decisions  made in the boardroom. This is something we are extremely proud of. I am one of more than 300,000 associates who represent the Bosch Group's strategic  imperative Invented for life. Cutting-edge technology provides solutions for the  sustainability challenges of our times, whether they relate to climate and environmental  protection, resource conservation, or the mobility of the future. We are pooling our  innovative strength in these areas, with 38,500 researchers and engineers, more than  4,100 patents filed in 2011, and a development budget for sustainable products of more  Dr. Volkmar Denner,   Chairman of the   Board of Management   of Robert Bosch gmbH environment associates products society Key figures & facts company 3  the major challenges we face require a   shared mindset and approach –   and they always need a leader, either in the form  of countries, companies, or people.               Dr. Volkmar Denner than two billion euros. Solutions developed with the aim of conserving resources and  protecting the environment already account for 40 percent of Bosch Group sales.   These technologies not only create value – they maintain it, too. This will help Bosch secure  its lasting success. Individuals alone cannot tackle the major challenges we face. They require a culture of  shared responsibility, a shared mindset and approach – and they always need a leader,  either in the form of countries, companies, or people. Bosch is leading by example through  its commitment and expertise. One of my predecessors, Hans Lutz Merkle, coined the  phrase: Leading also means serving. We believe that substance is more important than  appearance, and this trait has perhaps helped our company develop from its roots in the  German state of Baden-Wrttemberg into a global player. Results are what count for us. This compact report highlights some of our main commitments to a sustainable future.   It also documents recent measures and the progress we have made as part of the   UN Global Compact, the ten principles of which we agreed to when we signed up to this  initiative in 2004.

Bosch engages in dialog around the world with people inside  and outside the company. our corporate management is guided by the principle that we  need to understand each other in order to learn from one another. this is regardless of  whether we are talking about the future of mobility, responsible use of raw materials, or  how we wish to live and work together in future. Bosch devotes considerable attention to the complex change processes that are informed  by megatrends such as the globalization of markets and lifestyles, climate change, and  finite natural resources. these megatrends span decades and shape the long-term devel- opment of our markets. the current boom in smartphones and eBikes, or the discussion  surrounding the transition to new forms of energy are prime examples of the change  occurring. the global network known as the internet of things and services is contributing  to the speed and scope of this change. and all of this is happening in the context of a   rapidly growing world population, which has a strong impact on all of the challenges   mentioned herein.  in the long term, an honest and fair approach to doing business will always be the most profit- able. and the business world holds such an approach in much higher esteem than is generally  imagined. robert Bosch made this statement in 1921. to this day, the words of our company  founder guide the company in matters of responsible corporate management. thinking – and acting –  responsibly environment associates products society Key figures & facts company 5  demographic change is also affecting companies' working practices and hr policies.  Bosch promotes the education and training of young people worldwide. moreover, the  company is globally committed to equal opportunities for all, and offers new employment  models such as part-time work and jobsharing. requirements vary greatly from one  region to another – and this is something we endeavor to reflect in our policies. Bosch employs more than 300,000 associates worldwide to develop and manufacture  products that improve the quality of life. more than 6,600 young people are  currently  training with us. our Code of Business Conduct, which sets out the principles of integrity and rules of  behavior that are geared to our corporate goals, applies to all associates in equal measure.  it defines all the relevant legal and internal regulations, including the Basic principles of  social responsibility at Bosch, which were approved in 2004. in conjunction with the  Bosch Values, which describe the company's ethos in its dealings with business partners,  investors, associates, and society, the Code of Business Conduct lays the foundation for  the trust placed in Bosch and the company's global success.  today, robert Bosch stiftung gmbh holds 92 percent of Bosch shares. the stiftung carries  on the civic and social endeavors of our company's founder in contemporary form. it sees  itself as a foundation that pursues its objectives with programs and institutions of its own.  the stiftung also supports the projects and initiatives of other organizations that address  the challenges society faces. robert Bosch stiftung mainly promotes international under- standing, welfare, education, and health. // More information on our company can be found here and more information on the  Robert Bosch Stiftung can be found here A global approach to managing global challenges: Scholarship holders of the Fellowship Program for promising  young leaders from the United States in front of Robert Bosch House, the company founders former home. 6  Bosch eXchange program our remanufacturing activities in the auto- motive sector via our Bosch eXchange pro- gram is one example of how we do this. it is  based on an intelligent return system for  old components which no longer work. By  taking back and remanufacturing used  parts, the company reduces its resource  footprint and its materials expenses – ena- bling it to pass these advantages on to its  customers. this makes Boschs remanufac- tured spare parts for vehicle repairs up to  30 to 40 percent less expensive than their  new equivalents. demand for our eXchange  components has soared around the world  in recent years. the market segment is con- tinuously expanding in europe, recording  considerably higher growth rates than the  traditional parts business. We expect the  a s a leading technology and service com- pany, Bosch has been fulfilling its  responsibility to protect the environment  and the climate for over 30 years. the envi- ronmental management systems at our  production plants are a good example of  how we do this. We have methodically  expanded these systems so that more than  half of Boschs 259 sites are now certified in  line with the international environmental  standard iso 14001. By 2020, we also want  to slash carbon dioxide (Co2) emissions by  20 percent and improve energy efficiency  by 20 percent. on top of this, we are pro- moting the sustainable use of natural  resources throughout the company by  offering solutions which help people con- serve resources both at home and at work.  these efforts are not only the result of our  company's awareness of environmental  issues – they are also based on economic  considerations. as a consequence of glo- balization, the resources needed by indus- try are growing increasingly scarce. to  counteract the resulting price and supply  risks, Bosch pays close attention to reduc- ing the materials it uses. the company also  seeks alternatives to rare materials and  makes consistent attempts to integrate  them back into the material cycle. Mitigating climate change, protecting the environment, and conserving natural resources are three  of the major challenges we face in the 21st century, especially in these times of global trade and  business. Bosch offers innovative, forward-looking technologies which show that a commitment  to the environment makes sound economic sense. acTIOn FOR ThE EnvIROnMEnT: the resource cycle Necessity is the mother of  invention: scarce resources  are making remanufacturing  more and more important. company associates products society Key figures & facts environment 7  less Co2 emissions than manufacturing  new ones. the eXchange program also cuts  the amount of energy used at our gttingen  plant alone by approximately 105,000  megawatt-hours a year. that is an 88per- cent reduction compared to manufacturing  new parts. the total volume of reused  materials at this plant in Lower saxony  includes 240 tonnes of copper, 440 tonnes  of aluminium, and 2,200 tonnes of steel.  remanufacturing does not result in a  lower-grade product: all components meet  the same quality, performance and durabil- ity standards as new parts. for this reason,  Bosch is able to offer a two-year guarantee  on remanufactured parts, too. // For more information about our  commitment to the environment, please  click here european remanufacturing market to grow  to 30 million components a year by 2015.  in line with this trend, Bosch now offers  remanufacturing for some 9,000 vehicle  parts from 27 different product groups.  this makes us the leading supplier of  industrially remanufactured automotive  parts – including starters, generators, air- conditioning compressors, brake callipers,  distributors and high-pressure direct- injection systems. Reducing the need for resources and  energy without compromising on quality from an environmental perspective, the  main argument in favor of remanufacturing  vehicle parts is that the majority of the orig- inal product is retained. this means that it  uses fewer resources and emits less Co2  than producing a new component.

Mass motorization will continue to rise, especially in asia, eastern  europe, and latin america. this increased traffic volume is not only a burden on the environ- ment. it is also a drain on oil reserves. this raises two core questions for Bosch, one of the  world's leading automotive suppliers. how can the carbon footprint of the internal-combustion  engine be further reduced? and which new powertrain concepts provide convincing solutions  for the post-fossil fuel era? acTIOn FOR pROducTS: Mobility 2.0   for a cleaner future W hen it comes to developing sustaina- ble mobility solutions, Bosch engi- neers are on a mission to find a low-emis- sions vehicle that is not dependent on fossil  fuels. the electric car that approximately  1,100 Bosch associates are working on around  the world is one example. the goal is to pro- vide the automobile industry with an elec- tric drivetrain concept from a single source.  this also involves engineering high-perfor- mance batteries – one of the greatest chal- lenges to building an electric car for series  production. Battery prices are still too high  to make fitting them as standard equipment  economically viable. in addition, the cur- rent prototypes can run a maximum of 150  kilometers before having to be re-charged  from a socket. for everyday use, electric  vehicles need to achieve a range of at least  250 kilometers. only then will electric driv- ing become a real alternative for 90 percent  of all transport operations. 10  oping suitable engine systems and flexible  injection components for the automotive  industry. this shows our commitment to  drive concepts that are based on renewa- ble energies and use the existing infra- structure and technology. // More information on our sustainable  mobility solutions can be found here halving fuel consumption in the long run, the electric motor will  gain significance. in the meantime, four  out of five cars worldwide will run on gas- oline or diesel. at the same time as work- ing on powertrain electrification, Bosch is  therefore continuing to work on improv- ing the energy efficiency of internal-com- bustion engines and reducing their car- bon dioxide emissions. the first milestone  will be reached in 2015. a mid-range car  fitted with a Bosch gasoline engine should  have an average fuel consumption of 5.5  liters per 100 kilometers – approximately  30percent less than a current standard  engine. and there is still a lot of potential  to be exploited.

They have done this by increasing  exhaust gas recirculation rates and the charge-air and injection  pressures. Exhaust gas treatment also contributes to improving  the efficiency of the diesel. Another feature of the clean diesel  concept is the smaller, 1.2-liter engine with a performance of  83kilowatts per liter of engine displacement. Together, these  measures reduce CO2 emissions to 97 grams per kilometer.

Bearing in mind the growing shortage of  specialists and executives and our need   for innovative strength and quality, we   will need many more qualified female engi- neers in the future. second, studies have  W e were quick to recognize that diver- sity is a crucial element in the success  of our business. our associates contribute  to the innovative strength of the company  with their qualifications, skills, and experi- ence, and this provides us with a competi- tive edge around the world. that is why we  have firmly established diversity as one of  our strategic values, and we actively pro- mote it. at present, our efforts focus espe- cially on the areas of gender, nationality,  working culture and generation. demographic developments are posing enormous challenges for business and society. competition  for specialists and executives is on the rise. at the same time, the proportion of older associates   is growing as the requirements of younger people change. With the shift in personal value systems  and the desire to have a work-family balance, there is a growing need for flexible working models.  Bosch aims to meet these challenges by promoting a culture of diversity and equal opportunities.  this is the basis for a forward-looking human resources policy that will boost the company's inno- vative strength. acTIOn FOR OuR aSSOcIaTES: diversity as advantage  environment company products society Key figures & facts associates 13  shown that mixed teams work more effi- ciently and achieve better results, because  gender-specific skills complement each  other. that is why we encourage male and  female associates to work together and, in  doing so, optimize results. and third, the  proportion of women in management   positions may have increased in the last  decade– by about nine percent in germany,  for example – but women are still under- represented in executive positions. this is  also true at Bosch. We therefore intend to  continue increasing the number of female  executives worldwide, and are already on  the right path. our aim is to increase this  figure to 20 percent by 2020. commitment to equal opportunities  the aim of recruiting and promoting  female specialists and executives has been  on the agenda at Bosch since 1994. the  issue was included in the worldwide  Change roadmap in 2010, becoming one  of our strategic priorities. the corporate  office associate development, diversity  and equal opportunities pools all of the  projects and measures in the company and  has assumed responsibility for driving the  topic forward in the long term. the activi- ties are spread over three key areas –  recruiting more women to Bosch, promot- ing female associates at all levels of the  hierarchy, and implementing measures to  strike a balance between work and family  life, for instance with regard to childcare  and the care of dependants. Inspire, recruit, promote We have developed a variety of measures in  all operating units. these include, for exam- ple, the annual girls' day and girls' Campus,  which we use to inspire schoolgirls and  female students to take up technical and sci- entific careers. one way we promote female  associates is the women's network women@ bosch, through which we have done pio- neering work all over germany. another  example is our Business Women's Program  for trainee specialists and executives in  areas such as clever negotiating, leadership  skills, and self-marketing. for us, acting responsibly also means ena- bling our associates to have a balanced life- style. We are therefore committed to the  compatibility of work and private life. our  commitment to childcare and our varied  range of flexible working models – from  shorter working hours to job-sharing – is  aimed at both men and women. and so the  topic of diversity has come full circle at  Bosch – it's not just about women. // Further information on our commitment  to our associates can be found here Bosch wants to increase the proportion of women in technical professions  and actively encourages talented women to pursue this course.
