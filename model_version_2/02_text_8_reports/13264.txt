2    MESSAGE FROM MESSAGE FROM MESSAGE FROM MESSAGE FROM     GROUP PRESIDENT & CEO GROUP PRESIDENT & CEO GROUP PRESIDENT & CEO GROUP PRESIDENT & CEO               Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  journey began in 1989 when Hyflux started  selling water treatment products and systems  in Singapore and Malaysia. Today, we have  installed more than 1,000 water, wastewater  and desalination systems in over 400  locations worldwide and have developed  several  wastewater  and  recycling  and  seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants  in Singapore, South East Asia, China, India  and the Middle East and North Africa region.    At Hyflux, we believe that what we do on a  daily basis can impact the lives of the  communities  that  we  operate  in.  We  constantly drive operational excellence and  innovation in all aspects of our business to  enhance our ability to deliver products and  solutions that anticipate changing needs and  to  make  water  safe,  affordable  and  accessible. This motivated us to join the UN  Global Compact in 2010 in support of its 10  principles, and also explained why the CSR  function has been placed under the Chief  Executives Office as sustainability is a  company-wide responsibility.     I am pleased to submit this first report and  reaffirm our support for the UN Global  Compact. This marks a new step in our  ongoing journey to be a socially responsible  global citizen. We will continue to work with  like-minded partners to provide long-term  solutions to the challenges of water scarcity  and water pollution and nurture a CSR culture  within our organisation.          Olivia LUM  Group President & CEO  September 2011   3    VISION VISION VISION VISION, MISSION , MISSION , MISSION , MISSION    & APPROA & APPROA & APPROA & APPROACH CH CH CH       Our Vision  To be the leading company the world seeks  for innovative and effective environmental  solutions.      Our Mission  To provide efficient and cost effective  solutions to meet our clients needs through  innovation and technological advancement.                                                Our Approach  Hyflux is a fully-integrated water solutions  company. We offer cost-effective and  sustainable solutions in the areas of  membrane-based seawater desalination,  water  recycling,  wastewater  treatment  including membrane bioreactor technology,  and potable water treatment. We do this by  leveraging on our proprietary membrane  technologies and products as well as  expertise in designing, developing, financing,  operating and managing municipal water  treatment plants of various sizes and  functions.     Our projects deliver water that is  clean, safe and affordable to communities  and industries worldwide. In doing so, we  can have a positive social and economic  impact in the regions where we operate. We  believe  and  invest  in  technological  innovation and people development as we  seek ways to provide reliable long-term  solutions to the challenges of water scarcity  and water pollution.     For Hyflux, the water business is  about making clean water accessible and  affordable to people, and we want to play an  integral  role  in  helping  nations  and  communities  achieve  water  security.  4    CORPORATE  CORPORATE  CORPORATE  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE             Hyflux is committed to best practice  corporate governance and processes that  will enhance our effectiveness, ensure the  appropriate degree of accountability and  transparency, and an increase in long-term  value and return to shareholders.     We subscribe to the Code of Corporate  Governance 2005 and believe that this  forms a sound platform for supporting good  corporate  governance  practices.  In  Singapore,  the  Code  of  Corporate  Governance comes under the purview of  the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the  Singapore Exchange (SGX). Compliance  with the Code is not mandatory, but listed  companies are required under the SGX  Listing Rules, to disclose their corporate  governance  practices  and  provide  explanations for deviations from the Code in  their annual reports.      For detailed information on Hyfluxs  corporate governance practices, please  refer to our Corporate Governance report as  set out in the Hyflux Annual Report 2010  (pages 108 to 117).     All employees are expected to abide by  the companys Code of Ethics which is  given to everyone who joins the company  and is made available to all staff on the  companys intranet. The Code of Ethics  specifies, among other things, the need to  comply with all applicable laws in Singapore  and all local laws and regulations of the  countries that bear our investments and  operations.        5    OUR P OUR P OUR P OUR PEOPLE EOPLE EOPLE EOPLE                 Building a Diverse, Fair Workplace  Our people are crucial to our business. We  employ more than 2,000 people group-wide  and maintain overseas offices and plant  operations in Singapore, Malaysia, China,  India, Netherlands, France and Algeria. We  source for talent globally, and believe in  providing our employees with opportunities  for professional development.     Hyfluxs recruitment and development  policy  centres  on  individuals  whose  competencies, values and aspirations are  aligned with our strategic vision and core  values. We have a diverse and inclusive  workforce. We provide equal opportunities  to employees from different backgrounds,  cultures, gender and age groups. This  community of people is vital to our success,  helping us to connect better with our clients  around the world and build stronger  relationships at the local level where we  operate.    Hyflux imbibes the spirit of the core  conventions covering the key areas of  employment standards set out by the  International Labour Organisation (ILO).  The company abides by the employment  laws and regulations of the different  countries that it has operations.  For  instance, in Singapore, Hyflux adheres to  the recommendations and advisories set out  by  Singapores  Tripartite  partners  on  employment and workplace practices as  well as the guidelines on wages set by the  National Wages Council. The company also  provides  non-wage  benefits  such  as  medical, dental and annual leave benefits.      Cultivating and Rewarding Our  Employees  Apart from on-the-job experience, we  provide  learning  and  development  programmes,  job  rotation,  overseas  postings as well as opportunities to      6          participate in local and international industry  conferences.  Some  assignments  take  business executives out of the office and  onto project sites. This process not only  helps them to become well rounded but also  gives  them  a  better  appreciation  of  operations on the ground and how decisions  at either the strategic or operational level  impact each other.    Outstanding employees who embody  Hyfluxs spirit and values are recognised for  their contributions with the annual CEO  Award and groomed for future roles. We  also run the Hyflux Helping Hands Fund to  provide financial assistance, scholarships  and bursaries to employees with financial  difficulties.    Hyflux also pays tribute to long-service  staff who have worked for the company for  five years or more. In 2010, a total of 109  staff in Singapore received the long-service  awards. Of this number, 30 received their  five-year  awards  with  the  remaining  receiving awards for more than five years of  service.          Enhancing Employee   Engagement   Employee engagement is an important part  of our culture. New employees undergo an  orientation  programme  to  familiarise  themselves with the companys vision and  belief systems, culture and etiquette, as well  as administrative procedures and systems.  As part of their orientation, new employees  also visit a desalination plant that the  company  operates  to  recognise  that  whatever their role and responsibilities, they  have a contribution to make towards  meeting the water needs of the community.    We  continue  to  encourage  open  communication and interaction through  regular  dialogue  sessions  with  senior  management, company-wide celebrations of  festivities, work-life balance programmes  such as sports and recreation, and through  voluntary work. Our office is equipped with a  gym, a staff lounge with pool table and  karaoke facilities, and a canteen where  employees can partake in subsidised meals.  Other platforms include an intranet portal to  share company news and events as well as  general employee resources.                 7    COMMUNITY COMMUNITY COMMUNITY COMMUNITY             As  a  water  solutions  company  with  entrepreneurial roots, Hyfluxs corporate  philanthropy and engagement programmes  focus on issues close to our heart: the  environment, education, entrepreneurship  and community relations.      Giving Back to the Community  We contribute to charitable causes through  donations and fund raising events which  benefit wildlife conservation funds as well as  charity organisations that provide financial  and  social  assistance,  eldercare,  rehabilitation, education and vocational  training, knowledge and skills development.  In  addition,  we  partner  schools  and  institutes  to  provide  awards  and  scholarships for oustanding individuals in  Environmental Management. One of our key  initiatives is a corporate partnership with the  Singapore National Institute of Chemistry  (SNIC) to launch an annual award called the  SNIC â€“ Hyflux Award in Environmental  Chemistry.  The  award  recognises  individuals who have achieved excellence  and  contributed  substantially  to  the  advancement of different emerging areas of  chemical sciences in Singapore and abroad.  It  is  also  a  demonstration  of  our  commitment  to  promote  technologiecal  advances in environmental sciences that  will benefit lives.    We also contribute to disaster relief  efforts through supplying our portable and  easy-to-use Hyflux track membrane water  filters  to  effectively  remove  particle  contaminants, bacteria and turbidity in water.      Encouraging Employee  Volunteerism  Our corporate social responsibility (CSR)  philosophy  goes  beyond  philantrophic  efforts. We also seek to foster a culture of  volunteerism to inspire our employees to  reach out to the communities in which we  live and work. An example of employee  vounteerism is a beach cleaning day  initiated by our staff in Algeria. We also  encourage staff to serve on Volunteer  organisations  helping  the  needy  or  handicapped.      Promoting the Spirit of Enterprise  Hyflux  plays  an  active  role  in  entrepreneurship development. From time  to time, our senior management speak at  entrepreneurship forums or host students  from different parts of the world to share the  story of Hyfluxs success and their personal  work experiences. In doing so, we hope to  promote the spirit of enterprise and to help  aspiring  entrepreneurs  channel  their   creativity toward successful enterprise. We  are also a supporter of the Students in Free    8          Enterprise  (SIFE)  in  Singapore,  a  programme where tertiary students apply  business concepts to develop community  outreach projects that improve the quality of  life and standard of living for people in need.      Making Clean Water Accessible  and Affordable  Water is a basic necessity for sustaining life  but access to safe drinking water remains  one of our centurys key global challenges.  Such inadequacies result in considerable        social costs and high incidences of water-  borne diseases. Hyflux is committed to  playing a part toward a sustainable and  secure water future. We partner with a non- profit social enterprise to bring clean, safe  and affordable water to rural communities in  Southeast Asia through a customised water  filtration system that draws on our technical  expertise  and  membrane  technology.  Designed in a way that is easy to install and  maintain, the system produces clean, safe  water  by  removing  drinking  water  contaminants so that the communities can  enjoy better health.        9    QUALITY, ENVIRONMENT,  QUALITY, ENVIRONMENT,  QUALITY, ENVIRONMENT,  QUALITY, ENVIRONMENT,      HEALTH & SAFETY HEALTH & SAFETY HEALTH & SAFETY HEALTH & SAFETY               At Hyflux, a dedicated team is responsible  for ensuring the health and safety of  employees and integrating environmental  best practices into our business. Our  commitment to quality, environment, health  and safety practices starts from key  management and filters down through the  organisation.    Hyflux  contributes  to  sustainable  development by helping to meet the worlds  growing water needs in environmentally and  socially responsible ways. Our activities are  guided by our goal of making a positive  difference and reducing our impact on the  environment.                Attested Quality  In  2010,  we  were  awarded  the  ISO14001:2004  and  BS  OHSAS  18001:2007 certifications. They affirm that  our processes comply with international  standards for occupational health and safety,  and the environment. In addition, our  flagship ultrafiltration membrane, Kristal, is  the first ultrafiltration membrane certified to  remove the drinking water contaminants  cryptosporidium and giardia, under the new  Public  Drinking  Water  Equipment  Performance Certification Programme by  Americas NSF International. Kristal has  also achieved NSF Standard 61 (Drinking  Water System Components â€“ Health Effect)  Certification. This standard certifies that  products that come into direct contact with  the drinking water do not themselves  contribute contaminants or impurities that  could be a health concern.       10          Caring for Our Environment  through Innovation    Innovation is a way of life at Hyflux. Our  philosophy is to look at how innovation can  create better value and efficiency for our  customers and the communities we operate  in.  This  ranges  from  research  and  development to the design of membrane  systems as well as water treatment plants.  We are investing S$120 million over the  next few years in both the Hyflux Innovation  Centre â€“ a new R&D and commercialisation  centre in Singapore to spearhead the  development of membrane technologies for  municipal and industrial applications â€“ and  Hyflux Production Hub, a new membrane  manufacturing  facility.    Our  Hyflux  Innovation Centre has been conceptualised  with sustainability in mind from the design to  construction  phase,  using  eco-friendly  building materials, and energy and water  conserving  features.  We  are  working  towards achieving the BCA (Building &  Construction Authority) Green Mark, a  benchmarking  scheme  incorporating  internationally recognised best practices in  environmental design and performance of  buildings.                          The  seawater  reverse  osmosis  desalination plants that we develop meet  the  laws,  technical specifications  and  environmental  guidelines  set  by  the  municipalities/governments.  We  conduct  environment impact studies and through  innovative design, layout and processes,  limit and/or mitigate the effects of our  activities on the surroundings.    By  continuously  improving  the  performance of our membrane products and  plants, we are able to deliver high quality  water for domestic and industrial use at  better energy efficiency, smaller plant  footprint, lower chemical requirements, and  lower capital expenditure and operating  costs.                     11          Safeguarding Health and Safety  Safe  and  reliable  operations  are  fundamental to us. It is our mission to create  an accident-free environment and nurture a  safety culture that keeps our employees and  contractors safe at every Hyflux facility. Our  Environment, Safety and Health Committee  continuously strives to strengthen our safety  culture through processes, regular training  programmes and rewards for strong safety  performance.                     Hyflux has attained BizSafe Level 3  certification. This means that we have been  certified by an independent auditor for  having  fully  implemented  the  risk  management plan and having met all the  requirements of the Workplace Safety and  Health regulations under the laws of  Singapore.
