The code is based on our core  values: personal, trustworthy and simple. These core values form the basis   of our day-to-day operations and apply to all our business processes and  external contacts.  In order to facilitate application of the company code in our employees  day-to-day operations we have formulated supporting codes covering four  clusters which provide concrete rules of conduct for specific areas: 1) integrity 2) competition 3) insider trading 4) safety and information security. Supplementing the codes of conduct KPN has a whistleblower procedure, an  integrity review protocol and a policy on fraud. The whistleblower procedure  permits employees to report cases of fraud, suspicion of fraud, non-compliance  with the rules or lapses in ethical conduct. These reports may be made  anonymously and may be made in writing (by letter or on the internet) or via the  Integrity Line, from inside or outside the Netherlands and in various languages.  The company code and whistleblower policy can be found at   http://www.kpn.com/corporate/aboutkpn/investor-relations/corporate- governance/Company-Code.htm. Supplier Company Code KPN attempts to promote sustainability down the supply chain by purchasing  from suppliers that comply with our labor and environmental criteria. Our  Supplier Company Code (SCC; available on http://www.kpn.com/corporate/ aboutkpn/Company-profile/Procurement.htm) sets down our social and  environmental requirements. This code is based on the values set out in the  United Nations Charter and on the core conventions of the International Labor  Organization (ILO). We expect our suppliers in turn to request their own  suppliers to comply with the code. This is set down in the code and its objective  is to push further down the supply chain.

KPN respects and subscribes to the fundamental  human rights laid down in international agreements such as the UN  Declaration of Human Rights.  KPN has signed the United Nations Global Compact. We thereby endorse   the ten principles of this initiative and we have undertaken to respect human  rights, to offer good labor conditions and to make an active contribution to  environmental protection and anti-corruption. Every year, KPN will issue a  progress report in relations to the Global Compact as part of the Sustainability  Report. Details will be given in that report of the measures that have been  taken to implement the ten principles. KPN applies the internationally recognized minimum social standards  according to the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the OECD   in her relations with suppliers, business partners and third parties. 4.13 Memberships in associations and/or national/ international advocacy organizations As part of the policy on sustainability, KPN actively participates in national  and international networks. It helps to be able to compare our social  performance with that of other companies and to strengthen it by  interchanging experiences and ideas. KPN is a member of many networks, including:  GeSi  ETNO  Green Grid  Teleworking Forum  Global Compact  Mobility Management Task Force  Mijn Kind Online is Founding Partner of Digivaardig & Digibewust. We also aim to cooperate in social projects in markets in which we are active.  For example, the subsidiary KPN Group Belgium is a partner of UNIZO (Unie  van Zelfstandige Ondernemingen). KPNs German subsidiary E-Plus is  associated with:  Verband der Anbieter von Telekommunikations-und Mehrwertdiensten  M2M Alliance  Next Generation Mobile Network Allianz  Digitale Stadt Dsseldorf  Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Multimedia-Diensteanbieter  Informationszentrum Mobilfunk  Stiftung Digitale Chancen. http://www.kpn.com/corporate/aboutkpn/Company-profile/company-profile/ the-company/Memberships.htm 4 KPN | Sustainability Report 2011 GRI Index  GRI code Core or  Additional  indicator Indicator Details/reference Stakeholder engagement 4.14 List of stakeholder groups engaged by   the organization. Paragraph 1.3 In discussion with our stakeholders, pp. 22–24 Chapter 7 Scope, p. 66 4.15 Identification and selection of stakeholders KPN selects stakeholders based on their relevance to the IT industry and   to KPNs CSR themes. They are also organizations or persons (or their  representatives) with whom we have a formalized contractual or business  relationship, such as customers, investors, employees and suppliers. A major  additional criterion is whether they had previously indicated their desire   to be involved in KPNs CSR policy. The other category of stakeholders concerns social organizations with which  we do not have a business relationship, but whose views we value because  KPNs activities impact on the interests they represent. We very much wish   to engage in dialog with authoritative, influential organizations, such as   the World Wildlife Fund or the Nationaal Ouderenfonds, an organization  representing senior citizens in the Netherlands. It exceeds our capacity to open  up the dialog to every social organization that works on a particular subject.

This indicator is therefore not material. Environmental Performance Indicators Management approach Care for the environment is an integral part of KPNs business operations.   Our environmental policy focuses on making our products and services  sustainable (in line with the people-planet-profit principle). The  environmental policy is set out in our environmental statement. KPN aspires  to limit the environmental impact of its products and services, from the  production phase to the waste phase. The responsible use of energy is   at the forefront of this.  The ICT industry is one of the worlds major energy consumers. Our sector is  directly responsible for two per cent of global CO2 emissions. The ICT industry  sells millions of mobile phones and IT equipment that put a burden on scarce  natural resources. We also know that the use of ICT resources is more likely to  expand than decline in the future. KPN sees it as its responsibility as market  leader to promote energy savings and innovation in the chain. We are  convinced that the ICT industry can use less energy. But the greatest  contribution ICT is making to an energy-efficient world comes from the   IT solutions in other sectors. KPN believes in green ICT and makes sure it  happens by maximizing energy efficiency while reducing its CO2 emissions.  On the other hand we can enable others to use energy more efficiently and  cut down on their emissions by offering them our products and services. This  is the case, for example, when implementing software that improves logistic  processes and for our products and services that cut down on car mileage in  the area of the New Way of Working. KPN aims to be climate neutral by 2020. This means that on balance we will  cease to emit any CO2. We wish to achieve this through a number of steps,  such as saving on energy, increasing the energy efficiency of our network   and data centers and using green energy. CO2 compensation is the last step. Chapter 4 Energy-efficient, pp. 44–49 This management approach supports Principles 7, 8 and 9 of the UN   Global Compact.

Labor Practices and Decent Work Management approach We want our employees to take pride in KPN and feel involved in the  company. We want the best and brightest to choose KPN because KPN offers  them the best chances of development. KPN believes that we can reinforce  this pride and involvement through corporate social responsibility. A key  building block supporting our policy of motivating and keeping our people  involved in KPN consists of giving them the space to work as a volunteer on  the social projects run by the KPN Mooiste Contact Fonds. We make efforts   to multiply our employees range of abilities, for example by training. We  promote diversity in our workforce.  Diversity KPN wants its workforce to be a reflection of society. We also want more  groups in society to perceive us as an attractive employer. This will widen our  ability to recruit the cream of talent. The trend towards an aging population  emphasizes the importance of the company being able to attract the widest  range of people. Greater diversity means attracting – and retaining – more  women, more people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, people with a  physical impairment and older people.  Deployability Its purpose is to ensure our employees skills remain up to standard and   to improve them, thus enhancing their deployability, whether or not within  KPN Nederland. This fits in with our belief that the contributions made by our  employees come from their skills. Nowadays there is less value to having a  fixed job lasting the ones entire working life. Attention has shifted to the skills  and deployability of employees as affording them maximum security in terms  of ensuring their position on the labor market, both now and in the future. Occupational Health and Safety KPN cares passionately about guaranteeing safe working conditions.   The KPN Security department makes and carries out the policy for this.   The HR department coordinates and facilitates the health and vitality policy.  8 KPN | Sustainability Report 2011 GRI Index  GRI code Core or  Additional  indicator Indicator Details/reference The divisional Human Resources (HR) departments run these arrangements  and programs. All major operations have their own HR department which  advises line management and corporate departments on HR issues Line  management bears operational responsibility for ensuring that we really are   a good employer. At KPN group level Corporate HR is responsible for initiating  projects and new policy initiatives relevant to our segments. Regular joint  discussions are held with HR staff members to review policy development in  order to foster consistency in HR policy at KPN.

KPN  undertakes to honor the human rights of its employees and customers. Some  of the business we conduct, as is the case with Getronics International, is  performed in countries where guarantees of compliance with human rights  requirements are less watertight than is the case for our home markets in  Europe. It is specifically the case that KPN's corporate code applies to these  operations. They are obliged to adhere to the law and the ethical values  concerning the approach to be taken to employees and staff. KPN employees can put any queries they may have about the content and  observance of the company code to the Security & Integrity Helpdesk. The  helpdesk is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A Compliance Officer who   can help employees with questions has been appointed for every supporting  code. Employees can report cases of undesirable conduct to the help desk.  The category includes sexual harassment and intimidation, aggressive  behavior, discrimination and bullying. Reports may be made anonymously if  desired. Employees may also report cases of working relationships that have  gone badly wrong. If needed and desired, they are referred to a confidential  adviser. The type of measure is determined on a case by case basis. The  company code and the supporting codes lay down possible measures that   may consist of a warning, a reprimand, suspension, removal from function   or dismissal. In principle, cases of fraud, theft and serious or repeated  violation of the rules will result in dismissal. We expect our suppliers also to respect human rights. Our Suppliers Company  Code sets down our social and environmental requirements. Human rights are  of course part of the social rights on which we assess suppliers.

Assessment HR10 Core Percentage and total number of operations that   have been subject to human rights assessments. KPN respects and subscribes to the fundamental human rights laid down in  international agreements such as the UN Declaration of Human Rights. KPN  undertakes to honor the human rights of its employees and customers. No human rights assessments of business units operations are being made.  Some of the business we conduct, as is the case with Getronics International,  is performed in countries where guarantees of compliance with human rights  requirements are less watertight than is the case for our home markets in  Europe. It is specifically the case that KPNs corporate code applies to these  operations. They are obliged to adhere to the law and the ethical values  concerning the approach to be taken to employees and staff. Remediation HR11 Core Number of grievances related to human rights filed,  addressed, and resolved through formal grievance  mechanisms. KPN employees can put any queries they may have about the content and  observance of the company code to the Security & Integrity Helpdesk. Employees  can report cases of undesirable conduct to the help desk. The category includes  sexual harassment and intimidation, aggressive behavior, discrimination and  bullying. Reports may be made anonymously if desired. Employees may also  report cases of working relationships that have gone badly wrong. If needed   and desired, they are referred to a confidential adviser. Disciplinary measures   are taken against employees who do not comply with the company codes and  sub codes. The type of measure is determined on a case by case basis. The  company code and the supporting codes lay down possible measures that may  consist of a warning, a reprimand, suspension, removal from function or  dismissal. In principle, cases of fraud, theft and serious or repeated violation   of the rules will result in dismissal. No grievances related to human rights violations were submitted to KPN in 2011. 12 KPN | Sustainability Report 2011 GRI Index  GRI code Core or  Additional  indicator Indicator Details/reference Community Performance Indicators Management approach Company Code and Whistleblower Policy KPNs company code is designed to ensure that KPN acts in an ethically responsible  fashion and according to law. The code is based on our core values: personal,  trustworthy and simple. These core values form the basis of our day-to-day  operations and apply to all our business processes and external contacts. The  Supplier Company Code translates our CSR policy down the supply chain.  In order to facilitate application of the company code in our employees  day-to-day operations we have formulated supporting codes covering four  clusters which provide concrete rules of conduct for specific areas: 1) integrity 2) competition 3) insider trading 4) safety and information security. KPN employees can put any queries they may have about the content and  observance of the company code to the Security & Integrity Helpdesk. The  helpdesk is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A Compliance Officer who   can help employees with questions has been appointed for every supporting  code. Employees can report cases of undesirable conduct to the help desk.  The category includes sexual harassment and intimidation, aggressive  behavior, discrimination and bullying. Reports may be made anonymously if  desired. Employees may also report cases of working relationships that have  gone badly wrong. If needed and desired, they are referred to a confidential  adviser. The type of measure is determined on a case by case basis. The  company code and the supporting codes lay down possible measures that   may consist of a warning, a reprimand, suspension, removal from function or  dismissal. In principle, cases of fraud, theft and serious or repeated violation  of the rules will result in dismissal. The Security & Integrity Helpdesk collects and records reports and data   in the area of security, safety (including industrial accidents) and integrity.   It is important for KPN that this information is channeled to a central point.  Analyses are made of the reports that have been recorded and these are   used to take measures to limit harm and prevent recurrence. Supplementing the codes of conduct KPN has a whistleblower procedure, an  integrity review protocol and a policy on fraud. The whistleblower procedure  permits employees to report cases of fraud, suspicion of fraud, non- compliance with the rules or lapses in ethical conduct. These reports may   be made anonymously and may be made in writing (by letter or by or on the  internet) or via the Integrity Line, from inside or outside the Netherlands   and in various languages. Supplier Company Code KPN attempts to promote sustainability down the supply chain by purchasing  from suppliers that comply with our labor and environmental criteria. Our  Supplier Company Code (SCC; available on http://www.kpn.com/corporate/ aboutkpn/Company-profile/Procurement.htm) sets down our social and  environmental requirements. This code is based on the values set out in the  United Nations Charter and on the core conventions of the International   Labor Organization (ILO). We expect our suppliers in turn to request their   own suppliers to comply with the code. This is set down in the code and   its objective is to push further down the supply chain.

KPN attaches great importance to proper compliance  with this legal and regulatory framework. A key element within our compliance  activities is the Compliance Risk Assessment (CRA), a method for defining and  managing the risks of a breach of the Telecommunications Act. This audit  structure uses the same method that we use for our financial audit. KPNs Group  Compliance Officer is responsible for supervising the CRA, for promoting and  measuring compliance awareness and for taking any measures designed to  ensure compliance with the Telecommunications Act. The Dutch Independent Post and Telecommunications Authority, OPTA,  supervises compliance with the Telecommunications Act. OPTA may decide   to impose fines or other penalties where it has observed a violation, but the  legality of decisions taken by OPTA is always subject to judicial review. The Compliance Charter that we drew up in 2008 together with OPTA forms   the guideline for the way in which we promote awareness of this Act within the  company. KPN reports regularly to OPTA about the operation of its compliance  program on the basis of clearly measurable performance indicators. In addition,  agreements have been reached with OPTA about the manner in which KPN is   to report any violations of the Act that KPN itself has observed and about the  approach to be taken in case of any difference of interpretation. Public policy Two KPN departments, the Public Affairs and the Regulatory & European  Affairs Departments, are responsible for formulating positions on public   issues and for coordinating KPNs lobbying. These departments are part of the  Corporate Legal & Regulatory Department that itself is part of the Corporate  Center and reports to the Board of Management. As and when this is needed  or requested, KPN exchanges viewpoints with the Dutch government and the  European Commission.

SO4 Core Actions taken in response to incidents of corruption In 2011, there were 340 reports of corruption. KPN's policy in respect of fraud  and corruption is set down in the company code and the supporting codes.  Disciplinary measures are taken against employees who do not comply with  the codes. The type of measure is determined on a case by case basis. The  company code and the supporting codes lay down possible measures that   may consist of a warning, a reprimand, suspension, removal from function or  dismissal. In principle, cases of fraud, theft and serious or repeated violation  of the rules will result in dismissal. This indicator supports Principle 10 of the UN Global Compact. Public policy SO5 Core Public policy positions and participation in public  policy development and lobbying  Public policy Two KPN departments, the Public Affairs and the Regulatory & European  Affairs Departments, are responsible for formulating positions on public  issues and for coordinating KPNs lobbying.

The products linked to our services do not pose any  significant health or safety risks and comply with all safety rules set by law.  KPN is aware that issues exist with regard to mobile telecommunication masts  and health risks. KPN wants mobile communication to be useful and enjoyable  as well as safe and reliable. Consequently, KPN complies strictly with all   the national and international regulations, as laid down in the Dutch  Telecommunications Act (2003). KPN observes a wider safety margin than  required by law. Exposure to radio waves emitted by our base stations is 200  times lower than the national and international thresholds. A survey carried  out by the Dutch Radio Communications Agency shows that all the field  strengths measured in the vicinity of GSM and UMTS transmission masts are  well below the prevailing limits. It is possible for people to live their whole   life close to base stations without any problem. More information on this  topic and the survey can be found on the KPN web site   (http://www.kpn.com/corporate/aboutkpn/corporate-responsibility/ CSR-at-KPN/social-themes/telephones-masts-health.htm)  Products, environment and safety KPN ensures that all products it puts on the market comply with the legal and  regulatory framework applicable to the area of the environment and safety.  Two EU Directives covering recycling and dangerous substances (WEEE   and RoHS) are of especial significance in this respect. As a member of the  Stichting ICT-Milieu we ensure that our customers can hand in their discarded  products at municipal collection points for processing and recycling. Stichting  ICT-Milieu runs the IT collection system that was set up after the manufacturers  themselves took on responsibility for collecting and processing discarded  electrical and electronic equipment. The RoHS Directive lists the components  that may be used in electrical and electronic equipment. KPN has incorporated  these requirements in its contracts with the suppliers of the products we sell  under our own brand. The product manuals and symbols featured on the  consumer packaging advise consumers how these products can be used safely  and in an environmentally friendly way. Getronics itself collects used IT  equipment. A decision is made at the collection center as to which equipment  is fit for reuse and which equipment can be dismantled with a view to further  processing. Many of the materials and components can be reused. 16 KPN | Sustainability Report 2011 GRI Index  GRI code Core or  Additional  indicator Indicator Details/reference Privacy The nature of our service means that KPN Nederland has access to customers  personal data and information about voice and data traffic. KPN adheres to the  applicable legislation and regulations when processing this customer data.  Legal obligations also apply to our employee data. KPN has provided the Dutch  Data Protection Authority with precise details of the kind of customer data that  is used, to what end, and to which persons or bodies this information is  provided. As well as the Personal Data Protection Act KPN Nederland, as a  telecommunications service provider, complies with the privacy provisions of  the Telecommunications Act. This mainly concerns the processing of personal  data, traffic data and complementary security requirements but also its  approach to services such as caller ID. KPN Nederland also has its own rules  alongside and sometimes in addition to the statutory rules. Customers can,   for example, choose to have an unlisted number: both ex-directory and not  disclosed by the 0900/8008 directory inquiries service (also termed a  confidential number). They can also prevent use of their personal details for  direct marketing, telemarketing or from being passed on to third parties.  Customers with privacy questions can call KPNs customer service department.  KPNs Privacy Statement, available in Dutch on KPNs web site (http://www. kpn.com/privacy.htm), provides details of KPNs approach to working with  customer data in the Netherlands. The privacy statement applies to all  customers who purchase telephony, Internet or TV services from KPN or from  one of its subsidiaries in the Netherlands and for all users of KPN web sites.
