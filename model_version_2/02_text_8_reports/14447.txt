(FY) 3  Environmental Data Current and Future Initiatives Regarding Our Business Impact on Biodiversity Sompo Japan Environmental Policy Basic Philosophy Sompo Japan Group acknowledges its corporate social responsibility  to promote local and global environmental protection and to support  socioeconomic systems that are based on environmentally sound mate- rial cycles. We, the entire Sompo Japan Group, will consistently and  progressively tackle environmental issues, giving special attention to  the concept of eco-efficiency. Guiding Principles 1. Provide New Products and Services Sompo Japan Group strives to research, develop, and provide society  with new products and services (relating to insurance, risk manage- ment, claims, and financial services, etc.) that will contribute to the  solution of environmental problems. All corporate departments and  affiliated companies will join in this effort. Sompo Japan Group will also  investigate, analyze, and provide information on broader environmental  issues for the benefit of society overall. 2. Promote Resource Conservation Sompo Japan Group recognizes the impact it has on the environment  through the consumption of resources and energy, and the emission of  waste, in the course of conducting business. It will comply with environ- mental laws and regulations. The entire Group, including management  and employees, will work together to promote resource and energy  conservation and recycling activities. 3. Contribute to Society Sompo Japan Group will actively work on corporate citizenship initia- tives relating to the environment, such as nature conservation and  environmental education. It will also promote and support the voluntary  efforts of individual employees as global citizens and as contributing  members of families and communities for the realization of sustainable  society. To enable continuous improvement, the above-mentioned ac- tivities will be subject to periodic review, to reflect the current objectives  and targets of Sompo Japan Group.  (Introduced July 1, 2002) The NKSJ Groups Approach to CSR (Basic CSR Policy), established in April  2010, and the Groups Medium-term CSR Objectives both commit the Group  to fulfilling corporate social responsibility in regards to biodiversity. In October 2010, NKSJ Holdings and 36 Group companies participated  in the Japan Business and Biodiversity Partnership that was established  on occasion of the 10th Conference of Parties (COP10) to the Convention  on Biological Diversity. The objective is to declare broadly to the public a  commitment to perpetually take actions with due consideration paid to  biodiversity and for members of the NKSJ Group to individually engage in  practices that conserve biodiversity. While the Sompo Japan Group is not part of an industry that has a  major and directly adverse effect on biodiversity, it has an indirect impact on  forests through its heavy use of paper. Accordingly, the Sompo Japan Group  implements the following concrete initiatives: Concrete Initiatives <Biodiversity Considerations in regards to Products and   Services> 1.  Save Japan Project to Protect Japans Endangered   Species Sompo Japan has rolled out the Save Japan Project to protect endangered  species in Japan by making donations to environmental NGOs when auto- mobile insurance customers select web-based insurance clause, which can  be viewed on Sompo Japan's website. We hold citizen participation activities  in cooperation with NGOs in 12 regions in Japan in FY2011. 2. The Green Reform Loan Plan This product combines a personal loan service with measures to combat  climate change and protect biodiversity launched in 2009. Loans used to  finance green renovation projects are eligible for a 0.3% interest rate reduc- tion. In addition, a sum equivalent to 0.3% of the actual amount borrowed is  donated to the Satoyama Donguri Charity Fund, an organization established  to support the restoration and conservation of satoyama areas, which are  natural woodlands alongside traditional rural Japanese villages. 3.  Comprehensive Enterprise Biodiversity Consulting Service  Started Through NKSJ Risk management, Inc. developed and provides, in coopera- tion with the worlds largest partnership of conservation organization, the  first consulting service in Japan to comprehensively support corporations  biodiversity preservation initiatives. <Consideration for Biodiversity through Reduction of Paper  Use> Under our Comprehensive Paper Use Management Plan, formulated in  April 2009, we have introduced new document management systems  and are also actively promoting reduced paper use in day-to-day work  as a part of our cost managements. In FY2010 paper use remained at the  same level as FY2009 due to the effects of product revisions that were  not scheduled at the beginning of the year. In FY2011 we will pursue a  9.5% reduction year on year by encouraging customers to select web- based insurance clause and by making greater use of web conferencing  within the company. <Contributing to Biodiversity Protection through Education> Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) includes learning and/or  activities that aim to relate both social issues and our lives, and to facilitate  the new values and behavior in us for achieving a sustainable world. This  concept is reflected in our human resource development, education, and  awareness building efforts in environmental fields.   Public Seminars on the Environment: In FY2010 we held a series of three  seminars on the topic of biodiversity.   Sompo Japan CSO Learning Scholarship Program: Through this program  we are helping to meet the human resource needs of civil society orga- 4  nizations (CSOs) working to conserve biodiversity by sponsoring students  to undertake internships.   Sompo Japan Biodiversity Forum: In October 2010 we held a forum in  Nagoya at the same time of the 10th Conference of the Parties to the  Convention on Biological Diversity. Approximately 80 people from the  Region Headquarters and agencies attended.   We will maintain an ongoing role in nature protection activities throughout  Japan, especially through the Chikyu (Earth) Club, a volunteer organiza- tion in which all of our employees are members. <Developing Forests under a Cooperative Program> We have signed forest development agreements with six local govern- ments in various areas of Japan. Under these agreements we run forest  development projects and environmental educational programs in partner- ship with employees of Sompo Japan, their family and its agencies as well  as people from local communities. <Leadership through Vice Chairmanship of the Keidanren  Committee on Nature Conservation> Masatoshi Sato, Chairman of Sompo Japan, is currently serving as the  Vice Chairman of the Keidanren Committee on Nature Conservation—the  first business organization in the world to become a member of the Inter- national Union for Conservation of Nature. Sompo Japan has also helped  to establish the Keidanren Declaration of Biodiversity as a member of the  planning sub-committee.

(Number of audits) 25  Main details of investigated claims in FY2010 Achievements of the Claims Examination Committee The Claims Examination Committee was established in September 2006 to ensure that claims are paid fairly and appropriately, and consists of third-party  committee members such as lawyers, doctors, academic experts and representatives from consumer groups. The Committee conducts preliminary and ex-post  verifications on claims payments requiring a high level of legal and medical decision-making or interpretations of terms and clauses*. There is also a Claims Ex- amination Committee Task Force, composed of lawyers and other specialists, which meets separately to examine claims payments of a wider range of cases. * Terms and clauses: Fixed terms and conditions of insurance contracts Meetings held Claims investigated Point evaluated Type of insurance Overview of incident, and results of examination Evaluation of intent of  accident Automobile  insurance A request was received by the bereaved family for payment of a claim for an insured party who  had died after driving a car into the sea. An investigation of the circumstances of the accident judged that this was unlikely to have  been an accident spontaneously caused by a traffic accident, and therefore the case was  deemed inappropriate for payment. Evaluation of causal  relationship between accident  and death Personal accident  insurance A request was received by the bereaved family for payment of a claim for an insured party  who had died from a fall. An investigation of the circumstances of the accident and of  the cause of death showed that the accident had a causal relationship to the death, and  therefore payment was approved for the case. Evaluations of externality  (accident while in the bath) Personal accident  insurance A request was received by the bereaved family for payment of a claim for an insured party  who had died in the bath. An investigation of the circumstances of the accident and of their medical history  showed that the cause of death was an endogenous disease, and this was judged to be an  accident without externality, meaning that the case was deemed inappropriate for payment.
