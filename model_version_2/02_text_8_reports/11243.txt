Based on  market inputs and global trends Piraeus Bank is constantly improving its product portfolio  and internal organizational structure.    Commitment to the Serbian market and to company's further progress is witnessed by  the fact that Piraeus Bank in late June became a shareholder of Piraeus Leasing with a  share of 27.27% equity. Result of this recapitalization is a more attractive offer that  includes a full packet of leasing services and favorable terms of payment, flexible  repayment schedule and full costs control.    Bank follows worlds trends in using new technology in order to improve banking sector  and create innovative technological services which would in the best possible way  improve and make easier everyday banking operations.

This activity consists of donation of recycling  containers and boxes for collecting used paper to 18 cities where Piraeus Bank operates.   Also, Bank has developed set of recommendations for energy saving, with the goal to  increase energy efficiency, save energy and reduce CO2 emissions.     Understanding that informing and educating about this environmental problem is very  important Piraeus Bank actively involves all their resources to inform, educate, inspire  citizens and companies and make special effort to support solving of these problems.        Letter of Mr Neoclis Neocleous, Executive Board Chairman    Piraeus Bank Group believes that the quality of life is intricately connected to the quality  of the environment, and to this end, it undertakes initiatives to turn its belief into  practice. Group is committed, via its Corporate Social Responsibility, to apply a policy  that reduces the environmental impact of both its operational and business activities.     Group passes its experience in domain of Corporate Social Responsibility to the countries  where it operates. Piraeus Bank Belgrade has recognized, as a Group member, significant  importance of environment preserving by which it become dedicated to take active role in  green projects.     Piraeus Bank is the first Bank in Serbia which supported the project of the Ministry of  Environment and Spatial Planning and "Let's clean up Serbia" action, with which we  launched joint action titled "Fill to the top!".    Action includes donation of boxes and containers for collecting paper in all cities and  municipalities where Piraeus Bank operates. The aim of this initiative is to raise  awareness of the citizens of Serbia on the importance of environmental protection and  the importance of planning the collection and separation of paper.     During 2009, Bank has started its own campaign Going green. Through this project,  Bank has started to deal with resolving of recycling paper problem, on both external and  internal level. Through informing and education of its employees as well as placing  cardboard boxes for collection of used paper in all branches and offices of Piraeus Bank  AD Belgrade throughout Serbia, Bank has during six months period collected two tons of  paper in the Head Office building alone, thus saving 34 trees from being cut for  production of necessary paper.    Taking part in solving some global issues, Piraeus Bank, as a member of Global Compact  of the United Nations, has given one additional incentive for its activities in the fields of  human and labor rights, environment, support of disabled persons, as well anti- corruption. The Bank is also implementing scholarship programs for young talents and  support programs for individuals and institutions in need of its financial support.    This report outlines the basic achievements of Piraeus Banks environmental policy in the  past three years. In publishing these results, our aim is to transfer valuable know-how to  our partners, customers and the general public. We believe that the effort to protect the  environment will only lead to positive results if we all become actively involved.           An overview of Piraeus Banks environmental performance     Piraeus Bank acknowledges that energy sources are not inexhaustible and should be used  in a responsible way. Therefore, the Banks contribution to the protection of the  environment has two dimensions, an internal one and an external one. The internal  dimension refers to the Banks efforts to decrease the environmental impacts from its  operation. The external dimension concerns the Banks efforts to increase the  environmental awareness of its customers, and also to support actions outside the Bank,  concerning the environmental protection for future generations. In order to satisfy this  objective, an Environmental Management System in compliance with the EMAS European  Regulation is being applied.    Within this framework, the general objectives of environmental management for the  company are as follows:       continuous investigation in view of undertaking preventive or corrective initiatives  for more productive use of resources required for the efficient operation of the  Bank;     continuous awareness-raising among employees on environmental issues;     continuous efforts to reduce potential impacts on the environment by improving  banking services and products provided;      publication of environmental impacts from the operation of Piraeus Bank, and also  measures taken to mitigate these impacts;     preservation and improvement of the companys performance as regards  environmental protection.    These general objectives will be achieved by applying control, monitoring and  measurement methods for all processes included in operations for designing and  producing products/services, procurement and cooperation, technical support etc, and  also by defining specific measurable management objectives.    The ultimate objective of the Banks environmental policy is the continuous reduction of  our ecological footprint and the support of environmentally friendly entrepreneurship.  This is achieved through natural resource management programmes, energy saving in  our buildings, procurement of environmentally friendly materials, raising awareness and  training employees and also through the development of green banking products. To this  end the GREENbanking4Life project was highly instrumental in implementing the Banks  environmental policy.     This report includes the major achievements of Piraeus Banks environmental initiatives.  These include:       Over the past three years, Piraeus Bank has been implementing environmental  programmes in order to mitigate its impact on the environment. These include energy  and water-saving, recycling, travel reduction and green procurement programmes.  Certain environmental programmes presented in this section have been co-funded by the  European Commission within the framework of the LIFE project.

The means by which Piraeus Bank has  applied its environmental policy and the results of this effort are as follows:       We have recycled more than 680 tonnes of paper, 2.6 tonnes of batteries and  60.6 tonnes of PCs.      We have delivered 1,700 printer cartridges and toners for re-use. By procuring  recycled and chlorine free paper we have avoided the felling of 26,000 trees.      We have reduced the consumption of conventional paper by 8.8% and the  consumption of electricity by 1% per employee from 2007 to 2008.      We produce clean energy from pilot photovoltaic stations with a total capacity of  45 KW installed on 4 Banks buildings.      Through e-learning programmes for our employees, we have reduced travels by  950,000km. This amount corresponds to avoiding the emission of 170 tonnes of  carbon dioxide (CO2).      We are replacing Piraeus Banks corporate fleet with low CO2 emission vehicles.

By using recycled paper it was not necessary to fell  26,000 trees, while consumption of 6,000,000 KWh of energy and 46,000,000 litres of  water was avoided.        The creation of innovative green products and  support for green entrepreneurship. The Bank  offers, to both businesses and consumers, a  wide range of green banking products that fund  Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and energy  conservation measures.   In 2006, Piraeus Bank started offering specially  designed green banking products that support a variety of sectors in green  entrepreneurship. Thus, today the Bank offers the following specific products that are  granted under special terms:  1. GREEN PRODUCTS FOR ENTERPRISES WISHING TO INVEST IN LARGE RES PROJECTS  2. GREEN PRODUCTS FOR ENTERPRISES WISHING TO INVEST IN PHOTOVOLTAIC  STATIONS WITH A CAPACITY OF UP TO 150 KWp  3. GREEN MORTGAGES  4. GREEN LOANS  5. GREEN LEASING FINANCING  6. GREEN INSURANCE PRODUCTS    Thus, in the last two years through financing RES  projects we have avoided the emissions of 772,292  tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere.     At the beginning of 2008, we launched GREEN  BANKING, the first green bank branch in the Balkans.  The Green Branch operates as a point of information  in regards to the green products and services that  Piraeus Bank has designed and offers.     Green products and services create effective and far  reaching market-based solutions to address a range  of environmental problems, to meet new legislation  and directives and to raise environmental awareness.  In other words, green banking products allow businesses and individuals to choose a  solution for reducing their environmental impact.
