November 19, 2010    H.E. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General  United Nations  New York, NY 10017  USA    Dear Mr. Secretary-General,    On behalf of our employees across the globe, I am pleased to confirm that PerkinElmer  supports the ten principles of the UN Global Compact with respect to human rights,  labor, environment, and anti-corruption.  Through this commitment, we express our  intent to advance these principles and communicate this intent with our stakeholders  and to the general public.    Since committing to the UN Global Compact principles in November 2009, I am pleased  to note that we created a formal corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative at  PerkinElmer.  Our progress includes the identification and formation of three CSR focus  areas (environmental health and safety, product stewardship and community  engagement), developed key performance indicators, set measurable targets and  published our first annual CSR report.      Our products and services improve human and environmental health across the globe  by focusing on earlier and more accurate diagnosis of disease and improving and  protecting the environment.      We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the UN Global Compact is the  annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company  efforts to implement these ten principles.  We support public accountability and  transparency and commit to submitting an annual COP.   Furthermore, we are  committed to making these principles an integral part of our strategy, culture and day-to- day operations.      I look forward to reporting our progress next year.    Sincerely,    Robert F. Friel  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  PerkinElmer, Inc.  Robert F.
