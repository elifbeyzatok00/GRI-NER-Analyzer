Sustainability is a business imperative.   Its a competitive advantage, an economic  opportunity and a driver of innovation.  Its part of a fundamental shift in the way   we work and how we do business.  Through sustainability we create value for   MCI and the communities which we serve. This is the story of our successes,   learnings and ambitions.

Since  1987, MCI has created corporate events, meetings  and incentives, association and governmental con- ventions, congresses, exhibitions and managed and  provided consulting to associations. MCIs mission  is to help companies, governments and associations  bring people together to create meaningful connec- tions and win. MCI provides many stand-alone solu- tions designed for those who only need a specific  service to complete their projects such as Destination  Management, Sustainability Services, Technical and  Creative Production, Event Hospitality, Event Furni- ture and Decoration and Registration Technology.  With offices currently in 47 cities in Europe, the  Middle East, Asia-Pacific and South America, MCI  is a thought leader in building community around  brands, products and services for companies and  institutions. In 2011, MCI organized 3,256 Events  with over 857,293 participants and had a volume of  business of 307 million (non-audited figure). MCIs  1114 employees represent 62 different nationali- ties and speak 56 different languages offering lo- cal knowledge in a completely international team. MCI is a private company. The Tondeur Fam- ily holds 56% of shares with 44% being owned by  management, employees and equity investors.   47 Cities 1114 Employees 62 Nationalities 52 Languages 3256 Events MCI 2011 SuStaInabIlIty RepoRt   4 Contents  Sebastien tondeur  Chief Executive Officer MCI 2011 SuStaInabIlIty RepoRt   5 message   from our CEO  At MCI, our purpose is building  community; that is helping  our clients create and nurture  meaningful and long lasting  connections with their stakeholders.  By embedding sustainability  into our culture, operations and  client services we run a better  business and we can help  organizations perform better within  a sustainable development reality. this, our third sustainability report, tells the  story of how our people are integrating sustainabil- ity into our services and operations. This years tal- ent survey revealed an astounding 99% of our staff  think MCI should be concerned and held account- able about our environmental and social impact. It  moves me to see how we have responded to this  and how our CSR programme is changing MCI. 74%  of our staff say that they have changed their work  habits due to the CSR programme. It has brought  our values to life, it motivates our talent and helps  us build trust. Perhaps most importantly, it ensures  that we make better business decisions based on  the simple balancing of people, planet and profit.  In 2007, we became the meetings and events in- dustrys first signatory to the United Nations Global  Contents  Watch: Sebastien Tonduer introduces  MCIs 2011 Sustainability Report MCI 2011 SuStaInabIlIty RepoRt   6 Compact. Since then, these values have served as  a foundation for our commitment and are manifested  in our Code of Conduct that guides how we do busi- ness. MCI has also become an Organizational Stake- holder of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and  I am delighted to see us pioneer this level of CSR  reporting for our industry and our clients. We pro- duced 20 sustainability reports for our clients in 2011.  An excellent year for our CSR programme, 2011 saw  85% of our offices report on their environmental and  social impact, we gained commitment from our larg- est supply chain partners to support our sustainabil- ity strategy and our management participated in the  development and implementation of new sustainable  event standards. Our staff supported over 52 com- munity programmes with pride and contributed thou- sands of hours of industry development programmes. It is a real honour to see how governments, as- sociations and corporations with clear sustain- ability visions are choosing MCI to be their event  and association management partner. This year  MCI will support the United Nations at the RIO+20  Corporate Sustainability Forum, the CoP11 Con- ference on Biodiversity and over 80 meetings  about sustainability and renewable energy.  We are proud of our achievements given our resourc- es and the constraints that we face. But we know that  we have a lot more work to do and a long road ahead. I envision an MCI where sustainability is part of  everyones day-to-day work. With this in mind, we  have set ambitious goals to continue to innovate  and improve our sustainable performance. This year  we made the commitment to assess 100% of our  events for safety and sustainability. With the imple- mentation of new technology and processes we will  evaluate the risk and performance of our teams, the  meeting venues, caterers, destinations and clients.  What we do would not be possible without our di- verse teams who motivate us and give us our  unique approach to solving operational and cli- ent challenges that drive sustainability. Its amaz- ing to see how our CSR programme has evolved  and continues to innovate to take our business  into a better future. We know that long term profit- able growth can be enhanced with responsibil- ity and sustainability at the heart of what we do.

Develop sustainability services   to support our clients and the  industry shift toward improved  sustainability performance Rollover to find out more Contents  our Approach our approach to corporate Social  responsibility and Sustainability is  based on the principles of the triple  bottom line: people, planet, profit.  using our values to create value At MCI we are convinced that there is no contradiction  between running a financially viable business  and contributing to sustainable development.  We recognize our responsibility  when it comes to our environmental  impact towards employees, busi- ness partners, stakeholders and  the communities where we oper- ate. We believe that this approach  is essential to being an attractive  business partner, to building endur- ing and meaningful relationships,  and ultimately to our growth.  CSR is increasingly important to en- sure MCIs competitiveness. It allows  us to us build a responsible brand, re- duce cost, capture new business op- portunities, encourage innovation and  strengthen stakeholder relationships.   cSr – the path to sustainability The overall objective of our CSR  programme is to contribute to the  sustainable development of MCI  and the communities we serve.  Our  vision for global sustainable develop- ment is of a sustainable planet, just  society and a growing economy. We strive to be an industry role  model for corporate social respon- sibility. We have been a pioneer in  sustainable event management for  our clients events. By embedding  sustainability into our events we im- prove efficiency, enhance the partici- pant experience. For the associations  we manage and consult, we have an  opportunity to initiate discussions,  raise issues and place sustainability  firmly on their agenda. For the com- munities in which we operate we can  use our skills, resources and talent  to influence and advance sustain- able development to make a more  positive contributionto society.   ethics– the backbone   of our cSr approach The   MCI Code of Business Eth- ics is the Groups policy for Corpo- rate Social Responsibility. Based  on the UN Global Compacts 10  principles, the Code expresses  the values and principles for con- ducting business in an appropri- ate, responsible and transparent  manner. It is the minimum level of  behaviour and is mandatory for all  MCI employees.We apply our poli- cies to our supply chain through the   Supplier Code of Conduct.  We believe our values and  our win-win approach to  CSR allows us to create  value for our clients and  for society. 12 Jacqueline choy  Regional HR Manager (Asia-Pacific),  Director & CSR Champion  recognition Showcase best practice.

Ultimately it is about changing the way  we work, our attitudes and behaviour.  To guide and support this process,  we have researched and built on  the experience of fellow sustain- able organizations to develop our own  MCI Sustainability methodology.

Governance  The CSR programme is meas- ured and appraised monthly by  the Executive vice President  and reviewed by the Executive  Committee and Management  Board on a quarterly basis.   The External Advisory Board  chaired by MCIs founder and  President Roger Tondeur, re- views  our sustainability strategy  and performance annually This Sustainability Report repre- sents an important component  of our stakeholder engagement  and governance. To identify and  prioritize the issues we address  in thisreport we interviewed MCI  talent and clients. We discovered  that 63% of our talent read the  2010 MCI Sustainability Report  and this year we responded to  their request to make it shorter,  simpler and easier to read.  As signatories to the   UN  Global Compact, we report on  the implementation of the ten  principles through our annual  UN Communication on Progress  Report. To enhance comparabil- ity, rigour and transparency, this  sustainability report is produced  using the   Global Reporting  Initiatives G3.1 Framework.  Stakeholder engagement  Our approach to sustainability  is driven by our assessment of  materiality which is regularly  reviewed and refined. In the  assessment, we examine our  position and responsibility to- wards our stakeholders,  evalu- ating how our business practices  affect them and their organiza- tions. We look for potential op- portunities to align our business  goals with our efforts to help  create a more sustainable world.  For this years materiality as- sessment, we focused on five  key stakeholder groups with  whom we are engaged in vari- ous formal and informal ways.  In 2011, we surveyed over 300  employees and 60 of our largest  corporate and association clients  who provided valuable feedback  and ideas for improvement of  our CSR strategy and initiatives.  We engaged our clients, sup- pliers and meetings industry  partners in various meetings  and 22 industry sustainability  events that MCI management  led, facilitated or presented at.

As the global population grows from  7 billion to almost 9 billion by 2040,  and the number of middle-class con- sumers increases by 3 billion over  the next 20 years, the demand for  resources will rise exponentially. By  2030, the world will need at least 50  per cent more food, 45 per cent more  energy and 30 per cent more water  — all at a time when environmental  boundaries are throwing up new lim- its to supply. The current global de- velopment model is unsustainable. The challenges we face are great, but  so too are the new possibilities that ap- pear when we look at old problems with  new and fresh eyes. These possibilities  include technologies capable of pulling  us back from the planetary brink; new  markets, new growth and new jobs em- anating from game-changing products  and services; and new approaches  to public and private finance that can  truly lift people out of the poverty trap. The opportunities for change are vast.  We are not passive, helpless victims  of the impersonal, determinist forces  of history. And the exciting thing is  that we can choose our future The opportunities for change are vast.   We are not passive, helpless victims of  the impersonal, determinist forces of  history.

The annual meeting gathers over 150 regional  and international leaders with an objective  to foster dialogue, share knowledge and ac- celerate the worlds transition to a low carbon,  smarter and more prosperous future. lever- aging MCIs sustainable event management  framework, MCI Hong Kong carefully selected  suppliers and partners that displayed com- mitment to delivering sustainable events and  cost effectiveness. The Hotel Intercontinental  Hong Kong was selected as the venue. Over  65% of recycled materials were used including  name badges, lanyards, napkins and environ- mentally-friendly decoration. The unavoidable  emissions from the production of the event and  from delegate travel were offset accordingly. transforming destinations and  accelerating innovation Here at the Gothenburg  Convention Bureau, we want to  be the leading sustainable events  destination. In 2010 we reached  out to MCIs sustainability team  to help us to develop a strategic  plan and engage our city and  industry leaders in the business  of sustainability. So far, we have  increased hotel eco-certification  to 91% of our total city inventory  and venue certification to 100%  and this year we will certify  all six city-organized events.  In 2011 we were recognized  as Europes number one Eco- Destination by Business Traveller  magazine. There is now an  unstoppable energy in the  air which will help us toward  achieving our goal of being the  worlds greenest city by 2021. lennart Johannson  Director Gothenburg Convention Bureau lennart Johannson  Director Gothenburg Convention Bureau MCI 2011 SuStaInabIlIty RepoRt our progress 29 Contents  In Copenhagen, weve invested  a great deal in creating what  we think of as the   World  Capital of Sustainable Meetings   Sustainability is an important  differentiator for us and brings  a number of important business  benefits to our city.  Our team at  Wonderful Copenhagen is now  well versed in the fundamentals  of sustainability and embraces  the need to think differently to  create new solutions for the  benefit of Copenhagens future.     Thanks to the infectious  enthusiasm, kinetic creativity  and expertise of MCI we have  continued to develop our  sustainability initiatives and  now are again working together  on a bigger, more ambitious  project called the   Danish  Sustainable Events Initiative.

With a vision to the first Sustainable European  Union Presidency, MCI and the Danish Ministry  of Foreign affairs worked together to develop a  sustainable event management system that com- plies with and will be certified to the new ISO20121  standard. Covering over 100 meetings, this will be  the worlds largest implementation of the standard  for a government or corporate organization. The  Danish approach to organizing the   EU Presi- dency in a more sustainable and strategic man- ner is estimated to have saved over $70 Million.  measuring and reporting progress Having produced over 20 Sustainable event reports,  MCI has become a leader in sustainable event meas- urement and reporting. Since 2009 MCI Sustainability  Services have been working with the    European Wind Energy Association to embed  sustainability into the organization of their annual  conferences. Event environmental and social impacts  were assessed before and after the event using the  MeetGreen tool, which measures and benchmarks  over 150 areas of event sustainability. Effort over  the last 4 events has seen a steady improvement of  sustainability practices, with a noteworthy 89% of  event waste being recycled including over 31,340m2  of carpet in their 2011 conference in Brussels. Fighting poverty MCI Madrid helped to organize the   Global Mi- crocredit Summit in valladolid, Spain. The event  supports a campaign to ensure that 175 mil- lion of the worlds poorest families, especially  the female members of those families, receive  credit for self-employment and other financial  and business services by the end of 2015. Careful financial management helped MCI to con- trol budget and reduce expenses so that over  one million euro could be invested in grants to  participants and microcredit development.  Her Majesty Queen Sofa of Spain, No- bel Peace Prize laureate Professor Muham- mad yunus, and more than 2,000 delegates  from over 100 countries attended the event.

We commit  to working together to build a  vibrant culture of responsibility  and care that generates value. This philosophy has become an integral part of the  MCI way. We regularly and proactively engage with  non-governmental organizations to create community  action projects, and use our expertise to help com- munities develop and become more sustainable. power of action  Power of Action is the name we give to  our community outreach initiatives. MCI teams are encouraged (but not obliged)  to consider the following three criteria  when developing community projects: Building community: Does the project create links  and relationships that will bring benefit to people  by facilitating business, creating networks, offering  guidance and/or core MCI skills and resources? Education: Will the programme provide  enhanced access to information? Will  it share or develop knowledge that can  stimulate life chances and development? Fun: Is the initiative engaging and positive,  providing participants with buoyancy of spirit,  increased optimism, hope and esprit de corps?

With the help of  professional musician Corinne Gib- bons, the MCI CSR team recorded  the song, Dreaming on the Outside  which was then performed by 84MCI  Talents and Partners to thousands  of visitors at the Montreux Christmas  market. Uniting together to create and  sing this song, the activity unlocked  passion in the participants, as well  as some hidden singing talent. To- gether over 15,000CHF was raised  for the little Dreams Foundation. The  money is currently being used to fund  the No Difference campaign which  supports children with disabilities. developing creative and  socially responsible leaders  For the 2010 International Business  Meeting (IBM) in Istanbul, MCI part- neredwith The young Guru Academy  (yGA), to support their programme to  create more socially responsible and  innovative young leaders.

MCI has pro- duced the Keith Duffy IAA Annual Ball  for the past five years. last Decem- ber the event raised over 120,000 to  help Children with Autism in Ireland.  This brings the grand total to over  1,000,000 raised since 2007. The  event took place in the Ritz Carlton  Hotel (location?) and had its highest  attendance to date with 400 people at- tending the Gala Fundraising Evening. engaging suppliers and having fun The Ovation marketing team teamed  up with merchandising supplier Sta- tionery 365 on a project where for  every 150 spent by MCI a new cuddly  toy is donated to a child in need. The  Stationery 365 team came into the of- fice to present the toys & share in the  MCI Music Madness Day, which was  created as a fun way to raise money  for the little Dreams Foundation. One of the after dinner speakers at the IAA Autism  Annual Gala Ball spoke about the positive impact of  iPads and how the special apps can help children with  Autism. We invited our client CISCO to the event, and  they were inspired to help, offering to donate five iPads  to the Irish Autism Association.    Last night I received an emotional call from our client. He  and his wife had just dropped off two of the iPads to a  family who have two boys who suffer from autism. They  set up the units and downloaded some Autism friendly  apps. The two boys loved the iPads and took to them like  ducks to water. The boys mother couldnt believe it; it  was one of the first times both kids looked so happy as  they sat quietly playing away with their new technology.     Its great to get such positive feedback from a client,  sometimes the small things can mean the most. mark egan  MCI Dublin, National Events Director MCI 2011 SuStaInabIlIty RepoRt our progress 35 Contents  Working together In June, MCI Barcelona organ- ized a community project for sales  and marketing managers from SAP  who worked together to redecorate  and build furniture for the Nova Es- perana childrens home. Due to  bad weather the project was not  finished, so MCI Barcelona staff  returned a month later to finish the  work. Subsequently, the MCI Bar- celona team choose to make Nova  Esperana their core CSR partner,  and will be offering them additional  hands-on help and fundraising as- sistance in 2012 and beyond. leverage delegates  to leave a legacy On 4th Oct, MCI Singapore organ- ized an event where by 130 Mon- santo leaders congregated to build  27 bicycles for underprivileged  children at two orphanages in lang- kawi, Malaysia.

MCI Buenos Aires supported the Supervielle Bank  to develop a CSR team building activity to engage  their 450 staff in an activity to support disadvan- taged children. The event participants worked to- gether to build and decorate furniture that was then  donated to a foster home in Mar del Plata. Materials  were also donated to finish the bedrooms and bath- rooms.  Children and families from the foster home  joined the team to celebrate all the hard work. having fun! MCI is serious about sustainability.   But for success, we have learned that you must  make it fun! We believe that many small ac- tions aggregate to create lasting change.  In November, MCI Barcelona invited partners, friends  and family for a special MCI Mad Music day in or- der to raise money for the little Dreams Founda- tion. The MCI CSR champions convinced a local  karaoke bar to provide them with a free space and  then negotiated a split on the drinks revenues. Staff  then donated CDs which were auctioned to raise  cash. Sustainability – the entrepreneurial MCI way!
