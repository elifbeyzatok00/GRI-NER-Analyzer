A MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER                                                                                               In April 2010, SMEC became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).  Being a  corporate participant of the UNGC has solidified SMECs commitment to the long-term integration of  SMECs business with the UNGCs ten principles in the four areas of human rights, labour, the  environment and anti-corruption.     This report highlights SMECs commitment to building sustainable practices into every aspect of our  business. SMECs three focus areas are: People; Community; and Sustainability and Environment.   Within Australia, SMEC has made good progress against set targets. However, challenges remain  within our international operations – this will be the focus in the next reporting period; addressing  areas where targets are either not being met, or are not in place.    SMEC recognises the importance of diversity in the workplace. Diversity through race and religion  has been at the heart of the Company since SMEC was founded in 1949, whereby the majority of  employees were Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant migrants from Eastern and Western Europe.  SMECs continued focus on diversity has strengthened over the decades.  Today, a key focus is  gender diversity.  At Board level, we have recognised that it is a business imperative to attract and  retain a greater proportion of women, particularly in senior positions. We have recently developed a  Gender Diversity program to address this commercial issue. I personally, look forward to the gender  balance at SMEC improving.     Another focus area this year has been our commitment to improving the development, health and  safety of our most important assets, our people. In the development area we implemented a Career  Path Framework to provide employees with specific career path options available to them within  SMECs global business.  The Framework emphasises SMECs commitment to the development of  employees and is used as the basis for targeted learning and development programs and equitable  reward and recognition.  In the health and safety realm we focused on hazard identification  reporting, an area which we will continue to focus on in the next reporting period. Our performance  maintained a steady trend across the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate with zero deaths and  permanently disabling injuries reported.      Communities are one of our key stakeholder groups and as a Company we continued to deliver  nation building infrastructure projects that positively impacted local communities. Another way we  enhance the lives of communities is through the SMEC Foundation.  During this reporting period,  $182,000 was raised by the SMEC Foundation through significant employee contributions and other  fundraising activities.  These funds were donated to 18 projects in nine countries in the areas of  community development, health, education, emergency relief and the environment.       SMECs ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability gained momentum this year with the  adoption of the revised Corporate Environmental Policy Statement, released in May 2010.  This  SMECs commitment to corporate social  responsibility is entrenched in the way  we do business – it is part of our  culture. SMEC is one of the worlds  leading engineering and development  consultancies and has significant  opportunities to make positive  contributions to sustainability.           Sustainability Report 2010-2011    2  policy outlines SMECs commitment to the environment and highlights SMECs continuous  improvement in environmental management systems.  In this reporting period, SMEC commissioned  an external provider to research and report on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in SMECs  Melbourne office.  We will use the results of this report as a baseline for energy consumption in  other SMEC offices.     I would like to thank all of you who have contributed to the growth of SMEC and our Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR) journey.  We will continue to evolve and strengthen our focus on CSR and  SMECs management will work closely with all of our employees, business partners, clients and  communities to improve the way in which CSR considerations are integrated into our business  operations.      Ross Hitt  SMEC Chief Executive Officer                                                                       Sustainability Report 2010-2011    3  2. OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY     Society increasingly holds multi-national businesses accountable for responding to worldwide  challenges. Stakeholders believe companies need to be built for long-term prosperity and focus on a  sustainable bottom line which considers: culture, society, the economy and the environment.    The worlds natural resources are rapidly being depleted. Biodiversity is under threat due to climate  change, diminishing oil reserves and deforestation. The impact on the natural environment is  creating opportunities for greater innovation in engineering strategy and design; clients are seeking  sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions.     SMEC seeks to be a good corporate citizen in all aspects of its operations and activities. To this end,  SMEC has brought together a series of operating principles under the broad scope of Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR) to serve in setting the direction for employees in all aspects of their work.   All SMEC employees and contractors are encouraged to adopt CSR considerations in their day-to-day  work.  SMECs main CSR focus areas are: People, Community and Sustainability and Environment.    People  SMEC believes its people are its most important asset. SMEC employees are critical to SMECs  continued success. SMEC will maintain an organisational structure which allows the Company to  grow sustainably (in line with market conditions) and invest in strategies to attract, retain and  develop skilled employees. SMEC is committed to protecting the human rights and health and safety  of all individuals affected by the Companys activities including employees, contractors and the  general public.    Community  SMEC will continue to undertake projects committed to social enhancement, development and  improved living standards in some of the worlds poorest communities.  SMEC will continue to  provide small-scale grant support to community groups and development projects throughout  Australia and in the many countries in which SMEC operates through the SMEC Foundation. The  SMEC Foundations principal areas of focus include health, education, environment, disability,  community development and emergency relief.  SMEC will continue to uphold all aspects of human  rights including abolition of child labour, promotion of the rights of indigenous people and  eradication of discrimination.    Sustainability and Environment  SMEC will invest in a sustainable business to achieve long-term prosperity, which will focus on a  sustainable bottom line, including performance metrics to reflect achievements in economic,  environmental, social and cultural outcomes. SMEC is committed to undertaking its activities in an  environmentally responsible manner and effectively managing any risks that may lead to an impact  on the environment.    SMEC will continue to provide integrated environmental services including Environmental Impact  Assessments, climate change adaptation, renewable energy services, water resource studies, waste  management, environmental management and pollution control. SMEC will continue to provide  socially and environmentally responsible advice and develop customised outcomes that best meet  client and sustainability objectives.                    Sustainability Report 2010-2011    4  3. OUR REPORT    This is SMECs first annual Sustainability Report.  The report covers SMECs economic, environmental  and social performance from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011.  The information in this report pertains  to SMECs Australian operations only and does not include SMEC International or any international  subsidiaries and joint ventures.      SMECs sustainability and CSR policies and procedures are still in the development phase and were  initially implemented in Australia only.  SMEC plans to expand the CSR program throughout Australia  and the international operations over the coming 12 months.  SMEC will be in a position to report in  more detail on the Australian operations and on certain international operations in SMECs 2012  Sustainability Report.     For SMECs first Sustainability Report, the objective was to collect and benchmark data in areas in  which SMEC performed particularly well and areas which SMEC plans to improve upon.  The  reporting process, and the report itself, gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on  sustainability within SMEC.  In 2012, SMEC will build on the experience gained this year and report in  more depth.     SMEC has applied the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 guidelines to a self-declared Level B.  The  GRI G3 guidelines are the worlds most widely-used sustainability reporting guidelines.  By applying  these guidelines, SMEC has ensured that this report is in line with global best practice.  All monetary  figures in this report are in Australian dollars, unless otherwise stated.    The data in this report has been gathered using standard measurement techniques which conform  to national or international guidelines or regulatory requirements.  Specific calculations are  referenced where appropriate.

A copy of the Code of Conduct is presented to, and discussed with, each new employee as part of  their induction training. The Code of Conduct encourages employees who are aware of unethical  practices within SMEC or breaches of SMECs values to report these. This can be done anonymously.    SMEC also has a Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Executives. This separate Code of Conduct  applies an extra layer of desired behaviours on Directors and Senior Executives due to their  leadership responsibilities and duty to represent SMEC publicly.      5.7 Risk Assessment and Management    The Board (through the Audit and Risk Committee) is responsible for ensuring that SMEC has  adequate risk management, compliance, internal control systems and regular reporting policies in  place.

Launched in 2000, the UNGC is a voluntary  initiative to complement regulation and is based on a set of core values in the areas of human rights,  labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. SMEC joined a network of over 8,700 UNGC  participants, from more than 130 countries. In becoming a signatory, SMEC will continue to promote  the UNGCs ten principles and incorporate these into the Companys operations and culture.      Australian Green Infrastructure Council  SMEC Australia is an organisational member of the Australian Green Infrastructure Council (AGIC).  The AGIC is a not-for-profit organisation formed to develop a national sustainability rating scheme  for the design, construction and operation of Australian infrastructure. SMEC is actively involved in  the AGICs Technical Support Working Group. AGIC represents over 70 Australian corporations and  government departments which employ over 57,000 people. AGIC was established in 2008 and relies  on the pro-bono contribution of industry professionals to progress the rating scheme. Through  AGICs work, seven categories and 27 sub-categories have been identified to measure sustainability  across social, economic and environmental aspects of infrastructure project delivery and operation.

OUR STAKEHOLDERS    SMECs stakeholders are those individuals and groups the Company engages with who are involved  in the funding, delivery and operation of projects within the functional sectors and geographic  divisions in which the Company operates.  Active stakeholder participation allows SMEC to build  strong and sustainable relationships with individuals and groups impacted by SMECs activities or  who can impact the Companys future development.  SMECs commitment to providing accurate,  honest and timely communication to stakeholders is vital.  SMECs operations span different  cultures, languages and jurisdictions and as the Company continues to identify risks and  opportunities, it is imperative that SMEC actively listens to stakeholders interests and concerns.    Stakeholder Engagement  SMECs approach to stakeholder engagement assists in minimising risks, identifying ideas for new  services and understanding and responding to the issues that matter to the communities in which  the Company operates.   SMECs three major stakeholders are employees, clients and shareholders.    Employees  SMEC encourages two-way communication with employees.  One of the major ways in which this is  achieved is through the Staff Consultative Committee (SCC). The SCC provides a link to the Executive  Committee; staff raise issues and concerns and make suggestions to improve SMEC as a preferred  place to work. The SCC is a recognised SMEC committee, comprising a group of Continuing  Employees partly nominated by management and partly elected by staff. The SCC acts in an advisory  capacity to pro-actively address an agenda of issues raised by staff, as well as management briefs.  The SCC addresses issues, raises awareness and contributes to change through a range of  communication vehicles, including recommendations to the Executive Committee. Any matter of  concern to staff can be considered by the SCC including:    financial and human resource planning    work organisation and structures    introduction of new technologies, work practices, policies or procedures    personnel management policies    personnel training and development    affirmative action policies and plans    office accommodation and amenities    employee disputes    Clients  SMEC actively solicits feedback from clients.  A number of SMECs functional groups (particularly  Urban Development) and regional offices (particularly the Brisbane office) survey clients about the  Companys performance in the areas of service and technical quality at the completion of a project.   In the functional groups and offices which implement this program, SMECs managers are required  to complete ten client surveys per financial year (as outlined in their KPIs).  The surveys are  conducted face-to-face, over the phone or via email.  The survey responses are forwarded to the  appropriate person for follow-up.  SMEC believes that these qualitative surveys are highly valuable in  relationship building and service improvement.  SMEC plans to develop and implement a company- wide client feedback tool, which is likely to be linked to the Client Relationship Management (CRM)  system during the year ahead.    Shareholders  SMEC operates a policy of continuous disclosure and communication to shareholders. The Company  Secretary is the appointed Officer responsible for communications with the Australian Securities and  Investment Commission (ASIC). This Officer is also responsible for ensuring compliance with the  continuous disclosure requirements of the Corporations Act 2001. SMEC has written policies and         Sustainability Report 2010-2011    19  procedures that focus on the continuous disclosure requirements. These procedures include a  review by the Audit and Risk Committee of matters disclosed and the possible need for further  disclosures at each of its meetings. The Board aims to ensure that shareholders are fully informed of  all material information relating to the Company. Communication with shareholders is undertaken  through: the annual report and half-yearly report which are distributed to all shareholders; media  releases and other publications included on the Companys website at www.smec.com; and periodic  mail-outs to all shareholders.    In addition, the Board encourages full participation of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting  to ensure a high level of accountability and discussion of the Companys strategies and goals. SMEC  invites the external auditor to attend the Annual General Meeting and answer shareholder questions  about the audit and the annual report.    Figure 3 displays each of SMECs stakeholder groups and the approaches to stakeholder engagement  used during the reporting period.      Figure 3.

OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE    SMEC ensures strong economic and commercial performance through sound business strategies.   This generates positive results for all stakeholders including employees, shareholders and clients.   During this reporting period, SMECs revenue increased by 2.3% to $174.8 million and SMECs net  operating profit after tax was $8.7 million.  The highlights of SMECs direct economic impact are  shown in Figure 4 (all figures are in AU$000).    Figure 4.

Eligible R&D activities are those considered to be innovative or which contain high levels of technical  risk. The R&D Tax Concession program provides a tax deduction at 125% of expenditure on eligible  R&D activities.  This results in a before-tax return of 25 cents (7.5 cents after-tax) on every R&D  dollar spent.  There is also an incremental benefit for additional R&D carried out over a prior three  year average at the premium rate of 150% for Australian owned R&D.            Sustainability Report 2010-2011    22  During this reporting period, SMEC spent $7,907,530 on R&D activities.  As a result, SMEC received  $725,739 from the Australian Government as a cashback benefit (an average of 9% after tax).  Figure  5 shows the breakdown of financial assistance.    Figure 5.

PEOPLE    People are the core of SMECs business and their skills, experience and energy are the drivers of the  Companys success.  SMEC maintains a high-performance culture which promotes fairness,  transparency and equal opportunity.  SMECs objectives are to enhance professional development,  strengthen career planning and offer benefits to employees that contribute to their wellbeing. SMEC  is committed to being an equal opportunity employer that provides:    gender equality and cultural diversity    a culture that encourages innovation through learning    a strong career development program    a full spectrum of skills, from graduates to market leaders    opportunities for capable and qualified staff from all countries    As at 31 March 2011, SMEC had a total of 1,193 employees across Australia, as displayed Figure 6.    Figure 6.

SMECs approach incorporates workplace  policies, practices and behaviours that are fair and do not disadvantage employees on the basis of  gender, age, ethnicity, religion or any other indicators of diversity. This commitment is based, in  part, on the need to ensure that the Company complies with equal opportunity laws. SMEC strives to  ensure: a workplace free from all forms of unlawful discrimination and harassment; recruitment and  promotion procedures based on merit; and equal access to training and development for all  employees.      8.2 Gender Diversity    SMEC believes that the Company will derive substantial social and economic benefits from having a  genuinely diverse workplace. Accordingly, the Company is committed to promoting gender diversity.  The Board has incorporated gender diversity through the Nominations Committee and actively  addresses the issue at all levels of the Company.    During 2010, 27% of all new employees and 9% of graduate employees that joined SMEC were  female.  A total of 25% of all SMEC employees were female.  This is significantly higher than the         Sustainability Report 2010-2011    24  engineering industry standard, where, according to Engineers Australia, females represent less than  10% of Australias total engineering workforce and 7% of graduate engineers.    SMEC submits an annual report to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency  (EOWA). The EOWA is a statutory authority within the Australian Commonwealth Department of  Employment and Workplace Relations. SMEC achieved compliance with the Equal Opportunity for  Women in the Workplace Act for the 2009-2010 financial year and will submit a report for the 2010- 2011 financial year.    SMECs management has realised that increasing the number of female employees, particularly at a  senior level, is a commercial issue which requires action.  As such, SMEC is developing a Gender  Diversity Program to address this issue.  Some measures have already been introduced:     revision of SMECs remuneration policy to ensure equitable salary bands across all roles    appointment of females to senior corporate positions    career development of female employees including international work opportunities    flexible work arrangements, particularly for mothers    sessions on equal opportunity, harassment and discrimination in the workplace in the  Company induction program    a minimum of one female (from Human Resources or Management) on all interview panels  for internal positions    increased focus on the provision of opportunities for female engineers to participate in  industry conferences and events    A breakdown of SMECs employees by gender and employment type is shown in Figure 7.  SMEC  classifies employees into three employment types:    Professional: degree qualified staff including engineers, scientists and corporate (finance,  human resources, IT, legal and marketing)    Technical: staff who are not degree qualified but have technical skills including drafters and  CAD managers    Administration: staff in administrative roles including executive assistants, receptionists and  administration assistants    Figure 7.

Breakdown of Employees by Gender and Age Group          8.3 Remuneration    SMECs employees receive competitive salaries across all employment types.  SMECs minimum  wage levels are well above legal requirements and all contracts are in line with the National  Employment Standards which were introduced in Australia on 1 January 2010.    During this reporting period, SMEC began the process of reviewing salary bands across the Company  to ensure equitable scales of remuneration for all male and female employees.  The average male  entry level salary was $60,436 and the average female entry level salary was $54,000.  SMECs  average overall male and female salaries by employment type are displayed in Figure 9.      Figure 9. Breakdown of Salaries by Gender and Employment Type    Employment Type  Male  Female  Professional    $129,541  $95,893  Technical    $64,963  $69,628  Administration    $45,266  $56,179    SMEC recognises that male employees are currently being paid higher salaries than their female  counterparts. SMEC is developing a Gender Diversity Program to address this issue and has already  commenced revision of SMECs remuneration policy to ensure equitable salary bands across all  roles.             Sustainability Report 2010-2011    26  8.4 Career Development    SMEC seeks to attain the highest possible standards in the management and training of staff and is  committed to employee development. Each individual is encouraged to reach their full potential.  This benefits not only the individual, but the Company and its clients.     SMEC has a range of initiatives that enable employees to learn and develop. Key initiatives include:    Professional Development Program  SMEC maintains an active Professional Development Program (PDP). The PDP is administered  internally and developed in association with Engineers Australias structured education and training  program and other professional member associations. The PDP assists young professionals with  career planning by: developing initiatives for attaining accreditation, partnering young professionals  with mentors, providing a platform for rotation to gain exposure to a variety of projects and offering  networking opportunities. SMEC promotes the achievements of their Young Professionals and  regularly nominates individuals for industry awards. Two of SMECs Young Professionals were  nominated for Consult Australias Future Leaders Award in 2010.  During the reporting period, there  were 44 participants in SMECs PDP, 16% were female.    Performance Appraisals  SMEC conducts appraisals for all employees in March each year through the Companys  performance, review and development system: CareerTrac. This process provides an opportunity to  review an employees development over the previous year and identify goals and learning needs for  the year ahead.  At the close of this reporting period, 83% of employees had participated in  CareerTrac. In addition, all employees who are subject to a probationary contract receive regular  performance reviews: at two months, four months and at six months, conclusion of the probationary  period.    Training  SMEC provides training in both technical and management areas as and when required by  employees. SMEC will continue to improve in the area of career development and training in the  year ahead including development of a company-wide Career Path Framework and succession  planning.  The Career Path framework will provide employees with a clearer direction of career  paths that are available within SMECs global business.  The framework will incorporate: assigning  clear responsibilities and capabilities for each level; assigning accurate position titles for each level;  and assigning a remuneration banding for each level; and above all, the framework will ensure that  there is consistency across all levels. The aim of the framework is to emphasise SMECs commitment  to employees, by providing a workplace that provides: clear position responsibilities; clear position  capabilities; consistency of position titles; a basis for targeted learning and development programs;  and a basis for an equitable reward and recognition framework.    The average hours of training per employee for the year in the Southern Region was 21 hours and  for the Central Region it was 25 hours.  Training data for the Northern Region was not available at  the time of reporting.  SMEC will introduce reporting systems for training over the coming 12  months to capture more detailed data.       8.5 Employee Benefits    SMEC understands that performance, motivation, productivity and longevity of employees rely on  the Companys ability to provide a positive, flexible and rewarding working environment.  SMEC  offers a range of benefits that contribute to the wellbeing of employees, these include:         Sustainability Report 2010-2011    27  Parental Leave  Female employees who have been with SMEC for a minimum of 12 months can apply for between  six and 52 weeks of unpaid maternity leave.  Male employees can apply for five business days at the  time of the birth and if they are the primary care giver, they can apply for a further 52 weeks.   Females who have been with the Company for a minimum of 12 months are also entitled to paid  maternity leave:    three weeks full pay or six weeks half pay at the commencement of leave    three weeks full pay or six weeks half pay when returning from leave, paid three months  after returning to work  All entitlements are provided on a pro-rata basis to part-time employees. During this reporting  period, only 1.5% (16) of employees utilised SMECs parental leave benefits.    Flexible Working Arrangements  SMEC provides support to employees who are parents or guardians of a child under school age, or a  child with a disability through flexible working arrangements including flexible working hours, days  and work locations.    Tertiary Education Assistance  SMEC provides Tertiary Education Assistance to any continuing employee who has been employed  by the Company for a minimum of two years.  SMEC will cover up to 50% of course fees, capped at  $5,000 per annum.  During this reporting period, five employees received financial assistance  through this program.    Employee Assistance Program   SMECs Employee Assistance Program (EAP) was introduced in July 2009.  The program aims to  improve the wellbeing and lifestyle of employees and their immediate dependents whose lives and  work performance may be adversely affected by personal or work-related problems.  Staff and  dependents have access to short-term professional, confidential, independent counselling through  the EAP.  The EAP also includes a specific Manager Assistance Program which deals with difficult  people management situations.  In 2010, nine managers used the Manager Assistance Program and  27 employees used the Employee Assistance Program.  This service is provided by an external  provider, at no cost to the employee.    Corporate Health Plan  SMEC offers all employees access to a corporate health plan through BUPA (MBF, HBA, Mutual  Community). The benefits include discounted insurance rates and waived waiting periods.   In 2010,  61 employees joined SMECs Corporate Health Plan.    Skills Management  SMEC provides a range of in-house programs as well as financial assistance for employees to  undertake external training which develop lifelong learning and support continued employability of  staff.  Programs range from time-management courses to training in the Microsoft Office suite of  programs to first aid training and preparing for retirement workshops.    Health Checks  SMEC provides employees the opportunity to receive free, convenient and confidential health  checks in the workplace.  The health checks focus on the risk of heart disease and type two diabetes,  and personal health issues are examined including: diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption.    Company Subsidised Sporting Events  Employees are afforded the opportunity to compete in (and train together for) sporting events such  as the Business Review Weekly (BRW) Corporate Triathlon in the Gold Coast, Melbourne and Sydney.          Sustainability Report 2010-2011    28  SMEC covers the cost of entry fees, uniforms and event day marquees for the annual sporting  events. The events include a 400m swim, a 10km bike ride and 1 4km run. The events foster the  development of important corporate values such as team work and company pride and promote the  benefits of a healthy and active lifestyle.     Fresh Fruit  Fresh fruit is delivered to offices twice weekly for employees.      8.6 Turnover    SMEC maintains proactive policies to attract and retain quality employees. Talent management is  critical to the continued success of the Company.  The average turnover of employees for SMECs  Australian operations in 2010 was 15%.  The demographic profile of this turnover is consistent with  the cultural and legislative environment in which SMEC operates. A breakdown of the turnover of  SMECs employees in 2010 by gender and age group is shown in Figure 10.    Figure 10. Breakdown of Employee Turnover by Gender and Age          8.7 Health and Safety    SMEC is committed to promoting and maintaining a culture where risk to health and safety is  unacceptable. To meet this commitment, SMEC provides healthy and safe working conditions for all  people associated with the business including employees, contractors, visitors and members of the  public.    SMEC takes all practicable steps to eliminate hazards within the workplace through risk  identification, assessment, control and monitoring to ensure continuing effectiveness.  SMEC also  develops safety awareness throughout the Company by initial and ongoing education and training  for employees. SMEC ensures that all incidents are accurately reported, recorded and root causes  identified.  SMEC strives to continuously improve health and safety management by setting  objectives, plans and performance measures and regularly reviewing progress against set targets.           Sustainability Report 2010-2011    29    Health and Safety Performance  During this reporting period, SMEC had the objective of Zero Lost Time Injuries (LTI).  This objective  was not achieved; SMEC had a total of 54 Occupational Health and Safety incidents, seven of which  were reportable LTIs and nine of which were Medical Treatment Injuries (MTI). SMEC reported zero  deaths or permanently disabling injuries for the year.  Figure 11.1 displays a breakdown of reported  incidents by region and Figure 11.2 displays a breakdown of reported incidents by profession.    Figure 11.1 Breakdown of Reported Incidents by Region          Figure 11.2 Breakdown of Reported Incidents by Profession                 Sustainability Report 2010-2011    30  SMEC focused on increasing hazard identification reporting in an effort to achieve the Companys  Zero Lost Time Injuries objective. This type of reporting assists in the prevention of more serious  incidents, increases awareness of risks and encourages incident reporting. A number of initiatives  and procedures were also implemented including improved reporting methods, improved Job Safety  Analysis and Risk Assessment processes and an improved consultation process through the  Occupational Health and Safety Committee.    Figure 12 shows a comparison of SMECs LTI rates to the National (SafeWork Australia) LTI rates.   SMECs LTI rate is lower for every profession type than the national average.    Figure 12.

SMEC conducts  additional OH&S through comprehensive training needs analysis process relative to job roles and  project requirements. The completion rate for the OH&S Fundamentals training during this reporting  period was 83%.        Occupational Health and Safety Objectives and Targets for 2011  SMEC will maintain Zero Lost Time Injuries as its primary Occupational Health and Safety objective  in 2011.  SMEC will also work towards supporting targets:     10% reduction in the LTI frequency rate     10% reduction in the average duration of a LTI through the improvement and  encouragement of a proactive return to work process    50% increase in hazard identification reporting through the encouragement of proactive  reporting of hazards before injuries result                                       Sustainability Report 2010-2011    32  9. COMMUNITY    SMEC is committed to operating in a manner which promotes community engagement and  sustainability.  SMEC tries to work closely with communities in which the Company operates.  Through the adoption of a localisation model, SMEC invests in local operations and nurtures local  talent. This increases the skill level of staff in the communities in which SMEC operates and increases  the Companys local capacity to deliver projects.       9.1 SMEC Foundation    Established in 2001, the SMEC Foundation provides small-scale grant assistance to community  groups and development projects in Australia and internationally. The aim of the SMEC Foundation  is to deliver the best possible social and development outcomes for disadvantaged communities in  which SMEC operates. The SMEC Foundations principal areas of focus are health, education,  environment, community development and emergency relief.    The SMEC Foundation believes that small amounts of money, spent wisely, can produce far-reaching  social and economic benefits. The SMEC Foundation operates with financial support from the SMEC  Group of Companies as well as donations from staff. SMEC staff and external bodies are encouraged  to nominate projects deserving of the SMEC Foundations support. The SMEC Foundation is  registered as a Prescribed Private Fund by the Australian Taxation Office. Donations over $2 are tax  deductible for Australian taxpayers donating to organisations that are registered as Deductible Gift  Recipients with the Australian Taxation Office.    The objectives of the SMEC Foundation are:    to provide small-scale grant assistance to community groups and development projects in  Australia and other parts of the world in which SMEC has a presence    to consolidate links between SMEC and the communities it serves    to create a more systematic process for SMECs traditional corporate social responsibilities,  ensuring the best possible social and developmental impact    to create partnerships with non-government organisations and community groups  addressing poverty, social disadvantage and environmental protection    In June 2010, the SMEC Foundation agreed that future funding requests must align with the UNGCs  core values in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption.  All  applicants must sign a statement which confirms that the organisation supports and upholds the  UNGCs Ten Principles.    During this reporting period, the SMEC Foundation donated over $182,000 to 18 projects in nine  countries: Australia, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Tanzania and Uganda.

Sustainability Report 2010-2011    34                                                                                                          Dederang Township Water Supply (Victoria, Australia)  The Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority (VBRRA)  made a request to the SMEC Foundation to fund a feasibility study for a  permanent water supply to Dederang, a small community in northeast  Victoria. The SMEC Foundation utilised SMECs in-house water engineering  resources and donated $9,800 to fund the feasibility study. The study was  conducted by SMECs Victorian Water Group, which drafted a proposal  addressing community objectives and innovative approaches to the water  supply scheme.  Kind Cuts for Kids Foundation (Victoria, Australia)  Kind Cuts for Kids Foundation (KCFK) is an Australian not-for-profit  organisation operating in developing countries which aims to: improve  medical services for children; educate local health care professionals; and  remedy deficiencies in health care infrastructure.  Since 1993, KCFK has  worked in association with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons to  help provide outreach care to countries in need of surgical and medical  services. The SMEC Foundation donated $3,000 for the purchase of Suture  Boxes to be used in paediatric urology operations.  Suture Boxes contain a  variety of supplies which are used by KCFK doctors and assistant medical  personal during surgery.  KFCK also donates Suture Boxes to local  communities for use by newly trained surgeons.    Sponsorship of Engineering Aid Australias Indigenous Australian  Engineering Summer School (New South Wales, Australia)  Engineering Aid Australia (EAA) funds an annual week-long live-in Indigenous  Australian Engineering Summer School program.  The program is hosted by  the University of New South Wales and the Curtain University of Technology  for indigenous year 11 and 12 high school students. The program gives  students an introduction to engineering and encourages engineering as a  profession.  EAA also funds scholarships for students who have completed  the summer school and go on study engineering at university.  The SMEC  Foundation donated $5,000 (the cost of sponsoring one student) to help  fund the 2011 summer school program.    9.1.1 SMEC Foundation Project Profiles         Sustainability Report 2010-2011    35  9.2 Human Rights    SMEC is a global company that values diversity.   SMEC respects cultural, linguistic, gender and  religious differences in employees, clients, contractors and the communities in which the Company  operates. SMEC supports and respects the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights  and ensures that the Company is not complicit in human rights abuses through its operations.    Child Protection Policy  SMEC maintains a zero-tolerance policy in relation to child abuse. Child protection policy training is a  mandatory requirement for all staff and was the first e-learning module to be developed. In late  2008, AusAID (the Australian Governments overseas aid program) announced that all consultants  were required to implement a zero-tolerance child protection policy and training program. SMECs  CEO ensured that the policy and training program formed part of SMECs Code of Conduct for all  existing and new employees. Child abuse includes unacceptable behaviour directly involving children  or observed by children, any form of child pornography, all forms of physical and mental violence,  injury, abuse, maltreatment and exploitation. The policy applies to SMECs entire operations  including management, permanent, casual and contract staff.  In 2010, the completion rate for the  Child Protection Policy training was 81%.    Forced and Compulsory Labour  SMECs Code of Conduct, along with a variety of other policies and procedures, seek to ensure that  ethical employment and business practises are implemented across the Company.  SMEC complies  with national employment legislation throughout Australia. As a member of the United Nations  Global Compact, SMEC is committed to the elimination of all forms of forced labour and the  abolition of child labour.    Incidents of Discrimination  During this reporting period, SMEC had one incident of discrimination.  In late December 2010, SMEC  received notice from WorkCover that a claim of sexual harassment (psychological injury) had been  made.  An independent investigation was immediately launched that comprehensively examined the  details of the allegations.  SMEC conducted detailed interviews with the parties involved and their  witnesses.  From the evidence obtained, SMEC concluded that the allegations could not be  substantiated.  The workers compensation claim was denied by WorkCover and the matter is  presently before the Anti-Discrimination Board.    Indigenous Rights  SMEC works closely with clients to ensure that the rights and heritage of Australias indigenous  population are protected or restored.  Where required, SMEC includes Indigenous Heritage  Assessment and Management Plans as a component of Environmental Impact Assessments.  These  are conducted prior to the commencement of client projects.     SMEC works with clients to ensure the active participation, skill development and increased long- term employment opportunities for indigenous populations during the lifecycle of a project.  SMECs  Banora Point Upgrade Alliance has an Aboriginal Trainee Program. Members of the Alliance met with  the local indigenous community before work commenced on the highway project to identify and  develop real training opportunities for local indigenous people.  The Alliance has introduced training  packages for indigenous trainees that teach skills which will enable the trainees to work on any  construction site in the future. There are currently ten indigenous trainees working on the project. In  addition to providing training opportunities, the project has also uncovered a number of cultural  heritage sites and artefacts including numerous hidden deposits of shell and 134 stone artefacts  which the project team is preserving.           Sustainability Report 2010-2011    36  10. SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENT    SMEC adopted a Corporate Environmental Policy Statement in May 2010.  This outlines SMECs  commitment to environmental responsibility and continual improvement in project and office  environmental management systems (as required for certification to ISO 14001).      SMEC conducts all activities in an environmentally responsible manner to minimise the potential for  any of SMECs activities or outputs to cause significant adverse environmental impacts.  SMEC aims  to enhance beneficial environmental impacts and improve the quality of the environment for future  generations.  SMEC provides environmentally responsible, sustainable and practical project options  and solutions to clients. SMEC also employs Ecologically Sustainable Development principles to all  projects,wherever wherever possible.      10.1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions    SMEC commissioned Perenia to undertake a Preliminary Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Analysis  for the Melbourne office over a 12 month period. SMEC provides complete carbon solutions through  Perenia (a Joint Venture with Mitsui & Co and Pacific Hydro). Perenia partners with clients to: audit  and assess company operations, develop strategies to manage greenhouse gas emissions and satisfy  regulatory requirements, facilitate emission reduction projects and create carbon credit  transactions. Perenia found that SMECs Melbourne office had 1,315 tonnes COe of GHG emissions  in 12 months. A breakdown of total emissions by scope is displayed in Figure 16.1.    Figure 16.1 Breakdown of GHG Emissions by Scope    Scope 1   (t COe)   Scope 2   (t COe)   Scope 3   (t COe)   Total    183   376   756   1,315       Figure 16.2 Definitions of Emission Types    Emission Type  Description  Scope 1   Direct emissions which occur from sources that are owned or  controlled by an organisation (diesel and petrol consumption  and emissions from on-site wastewater treatment).     Scope 2   Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased  electricity, heat or steam.     Scope 3   Indirect emissions which are generated in the wider  community as a result of the organisations activities. These  emissions physically occur elsewhere (emissions from the  extraction and production of purchased materials, the  transport of purchased fuels and the use of sold products or  services including air travel, taxi travel and waste to landfill).              Sustainability Report 2010-2011    37  A total of 57% of GHG emissions from the Melbourne office were attributed to scope three  emissions, arising from business related air travel. A total of 29% of emissions were attributed to  scope two emissions, arising from the generation of electricity used within the office.   The  remaining 14% of emissions were attributed to scope one emissions, arising from petrol used for  transport.    Figure 16.3 Breakdown of GHG Emissions by Scope        Carbon Management  During this reporting period, SMEC undertook carbon management work including off-setting GHG  emissions generated by domestic employee air travel. SMEC had an agreement with Perenia for the  supply of voluntary carbon off-sets for all domestic air travel at a rate of $5.50 per flight. Under this  agreement, SMEC provided details of its monthly employee air travel to Perenia via its travel agent.  This allowed Perenia to calculate total domestic flight GHG emissions using certified industry  emissions coefficients. This equated to, on average, 115 tonnes COe per month.   Figure 17 displays  the kilometres of domestic air travel per month and the resultant emissions.     Figure 17. Kilometres of Domestic Air Travel per Month and Emissions      (2010)         Sustainability Report 2010-2011    38  Emissions created by SMEC through domestic air travel were off-set by high grade Voluntary Carbon  Standard carbon credits from a sugar cane bagasse electricity generation project in India.  Perenia  successfully retired 799 Voluntary Carbon Units registered under the international Voluntary Carbon  Standard on behalf of SMEC over a six month period from June 2010 to December 2010. SMEC  contributed a total of $7,470.65.      The long-term carbon management objective of SMEC is to assess GHG emissions for all offices and  establish a GHG emissions baseline.   Based on this, SMEC will be able to implement a company-wide  Energy Management Framework to improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.       10.2 Environmentally Sustainable Offices    An initiative stemming from the introduction of SMECs Corporate Environmental Policy Statement  was the development of Environmental Management Plans for SMECs Melbourne and Sydney  offices.  The plans describe the process that SMEC will follow to minimise harm to the environment,  achieve continuous improvement and record progress.    The Sustainable Office Committee was established in the Melbourne office and The Green Group  was established in the Sydney office to oversee the implementation of these plans. These  committees comprise of representatives from key business areas. Initiatives undertaken through  these committees to reduce waste and environmental harm, caused by office activities, include:     purchasing 10% green power in the Melbourne office    defaulting printers and copiers to double-sided printing    purchasing 70% recycled A4 paper    displaying water conservation signage in kitchens and bathrooms    using reusable envelopes for inter-office mail     recycling paper, aluminium, glass and plastics    changing the lights in the Sydney office which resulted in a 50% reduction in energy  consumption    installing teleconferencing equipment to reduce reliance on air travel    Moving forward, SMEC will work towards introducing environmental office committees in more  offices.  SMEC will also work towards broadening the scope of these committees, introducing more  environmental initiatives and increasing the profile of the committees within the Company through  internal communication.      10.3 Environmentally Sustainable Practises in Projects    SMEC is committed to managing risks that may adversely impact the environment. SMEC provides  socially and environmentally responsible advice for its clients and develops customised outcomes  that best meet sustainability objectives. SMECs Natural Resources and Environment group offers  services to clients including: Environmental Impact Assessments and permitting studies, climate  change adaptation, water resource studies, sustainable waste management, pollution control,  ecological assessment, conservation management and contamination assessment and remediation.     SMEC offers these as stand-alone services or as a component of a larger project.  SMEC is highly  experienced in the integration of environmental management and planning aspects with projects  including: Transport, Water, Buildings, Urban Development, Geotechnical, Mining and Tunnelling.           Sustainability Report 2010-2011    39  10.3.1 Natural Resources and Environment Project Profiles    Northern Busway (Royal Childrens Hospital to Windsor) – Queensland, Australia  The Northern Busway project was a highly complex development including a 1.2km elevated  structure, a busway station and cycle centre adjacent to the largest hospital campus in the southern  hemisphere. The project demonstrated leadership and innovation in its consideration of  environmental issues throughout the planning and construction phases.  The site was located within  a heavily constrained urban landscape including: state cultural heritage-listed places (Brisbane  General Hospital Precinct, Bowen Park and the Brisbane Exhibition Grounds including the porphyry  wall on Bowen Bridge Road); and environmentally sensitive areas including contaminated land, Acid  Sulphate Soils (ASS) and marine environments (Enoggera Creek).     The final development is a combined busway and cycle centre which provides sustainable,  alternative methods of transport and incorporates a number of sustainability design features  including: solar photovoltaic panels on the busway station roof for station lighting; passive  ventilation and daylight through design; stormwater harvesting; storage of run-off and rainwater for  use within the precinct; and real-time information panels to illustrate sustainability indicators to  patrons.    SMECs services included: environmental investigations into surface water monitoring, noise and  vibration, air quality, contamination and cultural heritage; development of Environmental  Management Plans (EMPs) for flora and fauna, ASS, contaminated land, water quality, air quality,  noise and vibration, waste and cultural heritage; management and monitoring of ASS; facilitation of  environmental licences, permits and approvals; development of Environmentally Sensitive Area  Drawings for use throughout design and construction; inputs into design, particularly in regard to  impact on state heritage listed places; provision of an Environmental Officer to ensure on-site  compliance including regular site inspections and reporting on mitigation measure compliance.                Dandenong Creek Wetland – Victoria, Australia  SMEC, as a member of the Melbourne Waterways Alliance, designed Melbournes largest man-made  wetland on Dandenong Creek, east of Melbourne.  The wetland covers 48ha of swampland  reclaimed for agriculture and provides significant habitat value.  The wetland has four 1km long, 75m  wide ponds as well as a sedimentation pond.  Over 1.66 million plants were grown in an on-site  nursery and planted in the various wet and dry-land zones in and around the four ponds. Recycled  water was used in the nursery. The wetland also features a diversion weir which includes a rock  ramp fishway to maintain a fish passage past the weir.    SMEC ensured that the design would have no adverse effects on local flooding rates, despite the fact  that it was constructed across the floodplain.  SMEC also incorporated access for monitoring and  maintenance into the design as well as provision for public access, bike path access through the  middle of the wetland and viewing areas to promote engagement of the public.            Sustainability Report 2010-2011    40  All construction works were confined to cleared land, resulting in removal of only six trees.   Construction involved excavation of 315,000m of clay and topsoil. A surplus of 90,000m of clay was  used for adjacent tollway works to avoid the risks associated with heavy vehicle transport on public  roads. All construction works were undertaken under strict environmental controls for noise, dust  and site run-off.    Upon completion, the wetland will reduce discharges of nitrogen into Port Phillip Bay by 28 tonnes  per year, sediment by 5,000 tonnes per year and phosphorus by 9 tonnes per year; it is the single  largest contributor to reaching waterway environmental target levels in Victoria.  (The other 43  wetlands in Victoria average only 1.3 tonnes of nitrogen removal per year). Other positive  environmental impacts arising from the construction of the wetland include: improved water  quality; enlargements to core conservation areas and increased habitat for waterfowl, frog, fish and  other species that rely on wetland environments; retention and improvement of existing habitat  zones along the creek; and revegetation and weed management within the existing riparian zones.                  Dights Falls Weir Replacement – Victoria   Dights Falls Weir is a heritage listed 5m high timber crib weir across the Yarra River in Abbotsford,  Melbourne, at the confluence of the Merri Creek.  Built in 1895, the existing weir has reached the  end of its life and needs replacing.  SMEC is designing the replacement weir. The new weir will  maintain the existing values at the site; it will balance heritage, environmental, recreational and  cultural values, with particular emphasis on the indigenous values of the left bank and the heritage  values of the old mill.      Upon completion, the replacement weir will maintain the existing water level and include fish and  eel passage provision on the right bank.  This will open up 2,500km of riverine environment to the  Yarra Rivers estuary.  The existing riverine habitat in the upstream pool will be protected and the  biodiversity of the freshwater marine environment will be enhanced by allowing all species  unrestricted access across the weir at all flow levels for the first time since 1895.      SMEC has conducted Environmental Impact Assessments and extensive public consultation with  forty stakeholder groups.  This consultation determined the type of weir and mode of construction.   Protection of the upstream pool environs and stability issues with the banks limited drawdown  criteria for the pool and water quality and turbidity issues downstream limited the type of  construction materials.  All these elements were incorporated in SMECs design to achieve lasting  benefits for the environment and the community.    The new weir will be a secant piled wall with a concrete cap to simulate the existing weir.  Sixty  120cm diameter, 11m deep piles will be drilled into the rock to form the weir wall.  SMEC evaluated  possible adverse environmental effects during the construction phase before commencement for  likely incidence and severity.  Adverse effects included: dust, noise, traffic movements, oil spills,  drilling fluid losses, increased turbidity downstream of the weir, disruption to normal fish  movements, public amenity, bike path use and safe passage of floods past the partly constructed         Sustainability Report 2010-2011    41  works.  Ongoing monitoring of the environment and river water quality at the site during  construction further guarantees high standards are maintained and environmental issues are  promptly rectified.      Figure 18.1 View of the Existing Weir        Figure 18.2 Artists Impression of the Completed Replacement Weir and Fishway          10.4 Renewable Energy    SMEC was one of the first companies to enter the field of renewable energy generation with the  landmark Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme in 1949. Since then, SMEC's services in renewable  energy have broadened to include geothermal, photovoltaic and solar thermal, wind, biomass, bio- fuels, mini and micro-hydro technologies and energy efficient strategies.     SMEC provides services for the lifecycle of renewable energy projects including feasibility studies,  comprehensive environmental and engineering design, construction supervision and  commissioning to help clients establish efficient and cost-effective renewable energy systems.       10.4.1 Renewable Energy Project Profiles    Townsville Solar Array Investigation – Queensland, Australia  Ergon (an electricity supplier in regional Queensland) was exploring the possibility of installing a  400kW solar photovoltaic array on the roof of an existing building in Townsville. The building under  consideration was an active sugar storage facility in the centre of Townsville.      SMECs services included: an initial site visit to assess the constraints of the storage facility (the roof  of the facility is asbestos and has a steep rake to match the sugar mound); establishment of         Sustainability Report 2010-2011    42  parameters for health risks and cyclone loading for the storage facility; preparation of a concept  engineering design so that cost estimates for construction and operation could be undertaken;  procurement; and site supervision and commissioning.      SMECs design included an estimate of the daily typical output for the location, orientation and tilt of  the array, wind loading and building modifications required due to the array installation and  assessment of the electrical connection issues and requirements.                  Somerset Dam Hydropower Refurbishment – Queensland, Australia  Somerset Dam is located on the Stanley River near Kilcoy in Queensland. The 305m long concrete  gravity dam has a 3MW capacity.  Water is released through the Somerset power station to  supplement Wivenhoe Dam, which in turn supplements the natural flow of the Brisbane River and  supplies water to the Mount Crosby pumping station located 132km downstream.     Built in 1959, the existing hydropower plant at Somerset Dam reached the end of its life and needed  replacement or upgrade. SMEC undertook a detailed review of all business options for the site.  The  review concluded that the refurbishment of the existing hydropower plant was the best option.  Replacement of key items was required to ensure the turbine was operational and the safety level of  the plant was improved.     SMEC provided engineering and procurement consultancy services for the refurbishment including:  protection design; design of the relocation of the transformer and transmission line; design of  replacement and relocation of the HV cable and Switchgear; refurbishment of generator air cooling  heat exchangers; design of bearing and generator cooling water Temperature Sensor replacement  and monitoring system; technical advice to Seqwater (the owner) regarding the Energex Connection  and Access Agreement; maintenance assistance for all oil, cooling water, turbine inlet and control  systems; upgrading and improving  the safe access and operation of the plant (mechanical and  electrical components); provision of training to operators; and preparation of operation and  maintenance manuals.                     Sustainability Report 2010-2011    43  Sustainability and Environment Objectives and Targets for 2011  It is currently difficult for SMEC to obtain data related to inputs, emissions, effluents and waste  caused by client projects. As such, SMEC will develop environmental reporting systems and  processes to quantify how SMECs services impact biodiversity on projects. SMECs reporting  systems and process will focus on four metrics:    species affected    extent of areas impacted     duration of impacts    reversibility or irreversibility of biodiversity impacts    These metrics are measurable for projects for which SMECs services include:    ecological assessments for feasibility, permitting and design project phases     ecology monitoring and management services for construction, operation and  management or decommissioning project phases     preparation of Environmental Effects or Impact Statements which contain a detailed  assessment of biodiversity impacts    The types of services provided by SMEC which could be covered by the reporting system include:    Environmental Effects Statements and Planning Scheme Amendments for highway or  rail projects    engineering design or proof engineering role for desalination plants    engineering design for waste water treatment plants    planning, design, engineering  and landscape architecture for urban developments     engineering design and supervision for waterway or drainage improvement projects    feasibility studies for decommissioning and rehabilitation of landfill or quarry sites    ecological assessments for land use rezoning and planning for redevelopment    provision of advice to local councils on asset management systems (roads, drainage  systems, parks, gardens and buildings) to reduce vulnerability to climate change    The environmental reporting systems and processes will be integrated into SMECs management  systems, so that data is reported monthly and quarterly.  The estimated timeline for development of  the reporting systems and processes is:    1. 2011-2012 Financial Year    define the types of projects to be reported, define reporting objectives, and design the  reporting systems and processes including metrics    trial and debug the reporting systems and processes within one of SMECs Australian  operating regions    refine the reporting systems and processes in light of the trials    2. 2012-2013 Financial Year    implement the reporting systems and processes in all of SMECs Australian operations  and for selected projects conducted by SMEC International    further refine the reporting systems and processes in light of the experience gained    3. 2013-2014 Financial Year    implement the reporting systems and processes across all of SMECs operations    Once the reporting systems and processes for biodiversity impacts are implemented, SMEC will  address other relevant indicator protocols.
