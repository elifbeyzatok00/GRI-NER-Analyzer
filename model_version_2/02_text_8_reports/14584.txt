Statement of Continued Support  We hereby declare that IFOK – located in Germany and Belgium – and with offices of its wholly-owned  American subsidiary, Meister Consultants Group (MCG) in Boston – continues to embrace the United  Nations Global Compact and its ten principles, as well as to integrate the principles into our daily business  activities. IFOK has participated in the initiative since August 2003. We strongly believe in the value of this  global network and its emphasis on the enlightened self-interest of all relevant social actors, including  companies.      Our Business  IFOK is a change management consultancy offering expert analysis, strategy development, project  implementation and communications services. Some 100 staff members work from our offices in Berlin,  Bensheim, Dsseldorf, Munich, Brussels, and with MCG offices in Boston. In our change management  consultancy work, we develop, facilitate and moderate dialogues between the public, private and third  sector. We build on a stakeholder approach, recognising the essential role of stakeholders in strengthening  the quality of advice we are able to provide our clients and in shaping change processes. The approach  adopted towards our clients is also that which IFOK adopts towards its own stakeholders. We:   help clients from all three sectors of society to implement measures and improve social and  environmental processes, with the very clear aim of turning responsibility into opportunity.   provide internal resources to educate employees on direct actions as well as on long-term goals of  sustainability.   support suppliers and partners with defined guidelines on sourcing and delivery.   build relationships with the media so as to further sustainability goals.    Our Commitment  We perceive environmental and social challenges as opportunities for private enterprise to provide  innovative and entrepreneurial solutions towards sustainable development. Thus, in our consulting  activities, we help our clients and other stakeholders to continuously raise the bar within the sustainability  paradigm. Following our 2010 COP Report, in which we reported on principle 6 and principle 8, we are  happy to now be reporting on our continued and new activities also on principle 7 and 9.                 December 2011, Dr. Hans-Peter Meister, CEO         IFOK    Page 3    Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in  respect of employment and occupation    IFOK is an equal opportunities employer who  evaluates its employees by merits only and not  on grounds of gender, sexual orientation, race or  religion.  Improving the quality of work through  family-friendly working-conditions  IFOK accepts family friendly working-conditions  as one of most important challenges in a modern  working  environment.  We  provide  career  opportunities for women well beyond the average  numbers or quotas in management consultancy -  more than sixty five percent of our workforce and  a third of our board members are female. More  than one-quarter of our employees currently work  part-time; of those about seventy five percent are  female and twenty five percent male. IFOK has  developed family-friendly work schemes to  facilitate a healthy work-life balance, including  teleworking, part-time work opportunities and  extended return programmes for stay-at-home  parents. In 2011, 8 of our employees took  advantage of parenting leave schemes or leave  of absence.   The  nation-wide  TOP-JOB  survey  on  employment culture identified IFOK as being  particularly strong in integrating work and family  life and we were selected as one of the 100 TOP  employers. IFOK has built on this accolade and  seen it as confirmation of our approach. Hence  IFOK continues its efforts as a member of the  corporate  network  Erfolgsfaktor  Familie  (Families: a Success Factor). This network offers  us the opportunity to learn about further success  factors which support balancing family and  working life. Joint partners in the network are the  locale Bndnisse fr Familien (Local Alliances for  Families), the web-portal SMEs and families  and all German Chambers of Commerce. As a  result of our continued efforts to provide the  working environment our employees need, we  enjoy a very high continuity within our workforce  and in 2011 we were thrilled to celebrate two 15  year and five 10 year anniversaries in 2011.    Improving the quality of work through  an open culture  We lay emphasis on an open corporate culture,  which allows for mistakes to be made and that  promotes the strengths of each member of the  IFOK team. Participation is important both in our  work with clients and internally, as are open  communication, regular and structures feedback  and appraisal mechanisms, all of which are  actively practiced at IFOK. We are signatory of  the initiative Diversity as an Opportunity which  was launched by Maria Bhmer, Minister of State  in  the  Federal  Chancellery  and  Federal  Government  Commissioner  for  Migration,  Refugees,  and  Integration.  The  aim  of  implementing the Charter for Diversity within our  company is to create a working environment that  is free of prejudice. All our employees should  experience appreciation – regardless of gender,  race, nationality, ethnicity, religion or philosophy  of life, disability, age, sexual orientation or  identity. Recognising and promoting this diverse  potential creates economic advantages for our  company.  We actively work to create a climate of  acceptance and mutual trust. This has positive  consequences for the recognition we receive  from our partners and customers, both here in  Germany and in other countries throughout the  world.   Beyond this climate of appreciation, IFOK was  awarded the renowned accolade "Top 100" as  one of the 100 most innovative small and  medium sized enterprises in Germany. Selection  for the award was undertaken via a rigorous  process by the Vienna University of Economics  and Business. In addition to being selected                                                                      Global Compact - Communication on Progress 2011        IFOK    Page 4  amongst the top 100 SMEs overall, IFOK was  also amongst the leading 10 companies within a  number of important sub-categories for the  award: Climate of Innovation, Innovation  Marketing,  Innovative  Processes  and  Organisation and Support for Innovation from  Top Management. This award represented an  important recognition of IFOKs open culture of  innovation and anti-discrimination, a culture  which enjoys top management support and which  we continuously seek to improve and express  throughout the organisation.     Building on the IFOK Leadership  Guidelines and developing a unique  network structure within the company  Building on IFOKs significant advances in its  internal processes and organisational structures  by developing the IFOK Leadership Guidelines  we continued our leadership and organisational  development process in 2011.  A central focus of our leadership is the  appreciation  of  diversity,  strengthening  professional development and doing this in-line  with the unique skills each employee brings.   Based on the objective to eliminate discrimination  and  promoting  organisational  learning  and  feedback, IFOK is constantly reviewing its project  feedback  schemes  and  other  feedback  mechanisms within its network-based structure.  The project feedback scheme consists of an  institutionalised  exchange  between  project  management and project team members, which  follows a systematic and holistic appraisal  methodology. The scheme is used to assess  project performance by means of an orientation  interview at the beginning and at least one  feedback meeting toward the end of each project.  The  project  feedback  scheme  enables  management to systematically assess talents  and performance of each employee in each of  the projects. By documenting project feedback  and gathering information from various sources  within the company, IFOK is able to assess the  performance and talents of each employee in an  objective way and thereby further promote the  elimination of all kinds of discrimination.  In 2011, IFOK has advanced significantly in  furthering and strengthening its network structure  and processes. Structuring the company in a  networked manner, rather than by departments  etc., presents IFOK with the unique opportunity to  utilise the benefits of flexible structures, tailored  teams, information exchange and diversity for our  projects and clients. It also offers us valuable  insights and opportunities with relevance for our  work to implement societal change – change  which requires a networked approach. In striving  to transfer these opportunities and principles of a  networked society and networked systems into  our business practises and into every staff  members daily routine, we offer our staff the  necessary training, learning and engagement  opportunities for them to build upon this. In  addition, IFOK is putting in place processes and  offers spaces for joint learning and innovation,  including through the IFOK Campus – the annual  company-wide retreat and training event.       Professional Development Activities  Overall Success Shared Responsibility The Wisdom of Crowds Trust and Continuity Discuss Decide Implement Improvement through feedback Respect Overall Success Shared Responsibility The Wisdom of Crowds Trust and Continuity Discuss Decide Implement Improvement through feedback Respect                                                                     Global Compact - Communication on Progress 2011        IFOK    Page 5  Continuing the high standards and extensive  variety of professional development opportunities  offered to our employees has been a core goal of  our company. Thus, we have taken a number of  important measures to further enhance this  important process of professional improvement  and development. We have expanded the  offerings of the IFOK Academy, our internal  training and development programme. In 2011  IFOK was able to offer more than twenty training  courses in the areas: methods, client relations,  leadership, learning organisations and self- management. IFOK is currently developing  additional training on sustainability issues for all  staff members and trainees. In addition, we have  launched the so-called Columbus Programme, a  unique and tailored programme of personal and  professional development for a number of key  employees  important  for  IFOKs  future  development.  Be  it  attending  conferences,  undertaking external courses or other forms of  professional development, we happy to offer this  opportunity to strengthen the competences of key  staff and to proactively build the companys future  development. The approach we are taking with  the Columbus Programme is in line with our  overarching approach of regular and tailored  training needs and professional development  opportunities being assessed on a regular and  personal basis.      Furthermore, IFOK currently trains six young  professionals in two- to three- year formal, paid  apprenticeship programmes. In 2011, we added  a new apprenticeship programme and are  currently training our first young professional in  an IT-oriented programme.    In this way IFOK has been able to continue its  offering of dedicated and tailor-made education  programmes for employees, continuing to teach  core skills necessary for our work and in this way  to wisely use the available time and resources  during slower project periods. These training  offerings are predominantly hosted by IFOK staff,  facilitating  knowledge  flows  within  the  organisation as well as offering personal and  professional development for those hosting these  events - as well as to the participants. With the  wealth of learning and on-the-job-training offered  by IFOK to its employees a key feature of our  success and our ability to attract the most  important talents for our business, it has been  important for IFOK to maintain and enlarge the  portfolio of these offerings.    Fellows – Providing Flexible Job  Opportunities to Young Talents  In 2011 IFOK has continued and expanded its  Sustainability Fellowship Programme, a seven- month fellowship scheme which offers young  students  seeking  to  enter  employment  opportunities to gain on-the-job-training and  insights  into  our  sustainability  consultancy  services. Candidates are selected through a  rigorous assessment centre process before being  offered a place on the scheme. They are  guaranteed  a  multi-month  programme  that  includes the opportunity to gain work experience  in consulting projects, to work closely with  experienced senior consultants as well as a wide  portfolio of training courses in various relevant  areas within the framework of the IFOK  Academy. Furthermore, each fellow is assigned  to an experienced mentor to guide their learning  process. The fellowships are foreseen to lead  into full time employment at IFOK or MCG. The  fellowships are remunerated, thus maintaining  IFOK and MCGs continued commitment to  decent working practices and opportunities. In  2011, two cohorts of eight and five fellows  respectively  successfully  completed  their  fellowship programmes and in almost all cases  have been taken on as members of our  permanent staff.     The learning organisation                                                                      Global Compact - Communication on Progress 2011        IFOK    Page 6  IFOK embraces the culture of  a learning  organisation and continuously puts efforts into  improving knowledge sharing, training, reflection  and learning processes. In 2011 IFOK for  example expanded on its Lunch and Learn  Scheme. In this scheme, all staff members are  invited to participate in regular lunchtime team  meetings that are hosted and facilitated by other  staff members. During those meetings, IFOK  creates a space for exchange, information and  knowledge  transfer  or  open  innovation  processes. The meetings are made accessible to  all staff members via teleconference. The results  are documented and made available to ensure  continued  developments  and  learning.                                                                           Global Compact - Communication on Progress 2011        IFOK    Page 7  Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges & Principle 8: Businesses should undertake  initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.    Our contribution to environmental solutions is  guided by strict internal policies. We adhere to  national and international standards to advance  responsibility in environmental matters. We also  promote energy efficiency, waste avoidance and  recycling as core elements of our daily business  practice among our employees.  Activities to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions and waste  With carbon dioxide being the primary cause of  human-induced global warming, we work to  analyse, identify and substitute our impact as  much as possible. One area in which we have  been seeking to manage our impact is in our  need for transport. We have a travel and car  policy that aims to reducing greenhouse gas  emissions. Our employees are required to use  the  most  environment-friendly  means  of  transportation whenever possible - primarily  public transport. Again in 2011, IFOK supports  the use of public transport by financing reduced  pricing schemes (BahnCard 50) which are  available to employees also for private use, thus  making public transport attractive for private  activities, too.  IFOK demands that all company cars be used in  accordance with the European Union standards  for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Some  company cars are pooled and available on a per  needs  basis.  Fuel  consumption  and  CO2  emissions form company cars are recorded.  Company cars are leased, and we make sure  that they are equipped with the best available  filter technology to reduce emissions of fine  particulate dust. Moreover, IFOK has established  a system for telephone and video conferences for  internal meeting across offices as well as with  clients. This initiative has allowed us to reduce  the number of travelled kilometres, including  domestic and transatlantic flights and thus has  contributed significantly to the reduction of  IFOKs greenhouse gas emissions.  The office heating system is centrally steered and  adapts, together with the lighting and blinds  system, to the outside conditions, helping reduce  energy consumption. Office materials are chosen  according to environmentally friendly purchasing  guidelines. At IFOK we build awareness to  reduce our waste creation and printing activities  by promoting double-sided printing. For office  printing, we exclusively use  100% degradable  and recyclable paper that is certified totally  chlorine free, licensed by the Nordic Swan and  certified by ISO 9001 and 14001as well as  licensed by FSC. We are currently assessing  options to increase our sustainable procurement  measures by switching to certified supply  providers and to change our energy supply to  more renewable energy providers.     Actions to disseminate greater  environmental responsibility  Via our intranet we are able to facilitate an  exchange between employees amongst each  other on suggestions and best-practises within  the  office  surroundings.  Our  continuous  improvement system is also a well received and  actively used forum for improvements and  innovative suggestions to help reduce our  environmental  impact  and  to  reward  environmental responsibility. In 2011, we have  engaged in a process to re-assess and update  our principles on sustainable business practices  and to disseminate and integrate these principles  into the whole organisation.   In the context of our consultancy work, we have  been commissioned with communicating the  potential offered by environmentally friendly                                                                      Global Compact - Communication on Progress 2011        IFOK    Page 8  technologies and standards. In the context of  disseminating processes, such as brown-bag  lunches and interdepartmental presentations, we  have  communicated  sustainability-related  projects and their outcomes amongst our  employees, thus facilitating joint learning and  criticism. In 2011 IFOK has increased its efforts  to accompany clients in CO2 compensation  processes and has continued to emphasis  environmental standards and protection in all its  internal and client projects.  IFOK lays great importance on the use of  organic, wholefoods and regional products in our  offices. We believe in the merit of unprocessed  and local foods and offer these, especially as fruit  that is offered to customers and employees free  of charge in our offices. Most of our fruit is from  organic sources. In addition we also purchase  regional products, such as fruit and drinks, via  local suppliers.                                                                          Global Compact - Communication on Progress 2011        IFOK    Page 9  Principle 9: Business should encourage the development and diffusion of  environmentally friendly technologies.   For several years, IFOK and MCG have been  working in the field of promoting and incentivising  the diffusion of renewable energy technologies.   In 2011, we accelerated our efforts and have  been  engaged  in  working  with  several  governments and business worldwide to assess  opportunities  to  promote  the  diffusion  of  renewable  energy  technologies.  Especially,  IFOK/MCG has been very active in the field of  designing and sharing knowledge on feed in tariff  schemes in several countries around the globe.    Furthermore,  IFOK  and  MCG  have  been  engaged  in  several  activities  to  explore  opportunities and promote business engagement  in the field of adaptation to climate change. We  have consulted clients on international best  practices in adaptation initiatives and in climate  financing. We seek to promote the critical  contributions the private sector can make in the  global efforts to build resilience and adaptation to  the impacts of climate change.   In 2011 IFOK has been undertaking an  assessment  on  business  engagements,  opportunities  and  risks  in  the  field  of  sustainability.  On a voluntary basis, IFOK serves as an expert  on participatory processes to promote synergies  between science, government, business and civil  society in the context of environmentally friendly  and sustainable technologies. For example, in  2011 IFOK joined the Committee on Technology  and Society of the Association of German  Engineers as a member and advisor on  participatory processes.   IFOK constantly continues to investigate trends  and develop strategies to engage in cooperative  processes to further public and private sector  efforts towards sustainable development   Further Actions  Apart from our focus on principles 6 and 8, we have taken further actions and initiatives to support  principles of the Global Compact initiative and to work towards sustainability goals:    Business and Family  Since 2007 IFOK has been working for the Robert Bosch Foundation on the design, coordination and  implementation of the project Business and Family. The project seeks to foster innovative business  models to help parents align the demands of work and private life, including children, family and care  responsibilities.    Young Foresight Germany/ Young Foresight Europe  Young Foresight Germany (Jugend denkt Zukunft) is a continuous effort, initiated by IFOK, to couple  corporate citizenship programmes with the introduction of innovative thinking and corporate culture to young  people. The project has been named an official project of the UN decade Education for Sustainable  Development for the period 2007 – 2009. In November 2011, IFOK joint with our business initiative  Jugend denkt Zukunft! the National pact for women in science. The goal of the initiative is to promote  young women to pursue science or engineering degrees and successfully enter the according job market.                                                                      Global Compact - Communication on Progress 2011        IFOK    Page 10  Furthermore, the project continued and extended activities towards Youth Foresight Europe (Jugend denkt  Europa), a project supporting young people to get access to political issues and processes.     Supporting Sustainable Strategies at Federal and State Level  IFOK has been supporting the Sustainability Council at Federal level with conceptual input and process  organisation. Amongst others, we organised the peer review process for the German Sustainbility Strategy  resulting in a report handed over to the Federal Chancellor. For the State of Hesse and Baden- Wuerttemberg we set up sustainability strategies involving business, politics and society to bring forward  environmental, social, and economic sustainability at regional and state level.        08/2003    – IFOK joins Global Compact     04/2005    – Youth Foresight Germany launched     09/2005    – First Global Compact Communication on Progress Report     04/2006    – Corporate Ethics and Trust – A tripartite dialogue     05/2006    – Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue by German Sustainability Council     10/2006    – European Citizens Consultations launched     12/2006    – Second Global Compact Communication on Progress Report     07/2007    – Business and Family programme launched     09/2007    – CSR positioning of Christoffel Blindenmission (pro-bono)     12/2007    – Third Global Compact Communication on Progress Report     06/2008    – IFOK joins Diversity as an Opportunity- The Charter for Diversity     06/2008    – Start of the E-I Award     Milestones    06/2008    – Launching Sakhela Imfundo e.V. by the IFOK Young Professionals    12/2008    – Fourth Global Compact Communication on Progress Report    12/2008    – IFOK as Observer at the COP 14 in Poznan     12/2008    – Start of the Relaunch of the Young Professionals Programme                                                                        Global Compact - Communication on Progress 2011        IFOK    Page 11    07-11/09   –  Supporting Peer Review on the German Sustainability Strategy;          presented to the Federal Chancellor in November     11/2009    – Start of IFOKs Sustainability Fellow Programme      12/2009    – IFOK as Observer at the COP 15 in Copenhagen     12/2009    – IFOK Study on the Adaptation of Climate Change published    12/2009   – Fifth Global Compact Communication on Progress Report      12/2010      Summer  2011              10/ 2011      12/ 2011-  -  Sixth Global Compact Communication on Progress Report     IFOK and the German Ministry for Education and Research launch  first of its kind national citizen consultations about the future of  energy in Germany    IFOK hosts the event to present the outcomes of the German Ethics  Commission on the phase-out of nuclear energy in Germany.
