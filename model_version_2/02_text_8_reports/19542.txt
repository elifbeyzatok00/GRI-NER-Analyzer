A R C A  C o n t i n e n tA l        1   Francisco Garza Egloff Chief Executive Officer Manuel L. Barragn Morales Chairman of the Board Message from the chairman of the board and chief executive officer  In 2011, after consolidating the historic merger of  Embotelladoras Arca and Grupo Continental to create a  new, more competitive company, we began a process of  integration that included the standardization of our So- cial Responsibility and Sustainability Model, deploying  it across all our workplaces, in keeping with the broader  scope of every area of the organization. The model forms part of the Arca Continental Compre- hensive Quality and Improvement System, and as such  is incorporated as an integral component of our busi- ness activities and organizational culture, guaranteeing  its control and long-term feasibility.  For the seventh consecutive year, this report was  written on the basis of the guidelines of the Global Re- porting Initiative (GRI). In 2011, the commitment of the  companys diverse areas led to an over 60% increase in  the number of indicators covered; this year, we inclu- ded a supplement for companies in the processed-food  sector and the principles of the United Nations Global  Compact. We were evaluated overall by an external  organization, which assessed our application of the GRI  reporting framework as level B. The achievements described in this report include the  progress we made in 2011 to enhance the quality of  life and comprehensive development of our human  capital; to preserve natural resources and protect the  environment; and to form proactive alliances in order  to achieve the sustainable growth of the communities  in which we operate.  One of the mainstays of Arca Continentals organizatio- nal culture is the professional and personal growth of  its associates, a value that helps to promote an atmos- phere of great motivation, productivity and recognition,  which, in turn, drives us towards success and enables us  to offer continuous development opportunities for the  people who make up this great company. We continue to strengthen our actions in this area in  order to consolidate our company as a better place to  work, including our focus on the Great Place to Work  Program, in which several of our operations are now  certified.  A major initiative that facilitates the involvement of  all our people in the companys decision-making and  development is our Participative Management Program,  through which teams of associates from all organi- zational areas proposed during 2011 more than 500  suggestions for improving our processes and approxi- mately 150 new projects. These suggestions produced  concrete results and significant savings in such areas  as water resource management, operational efficiency,  energy consumption, security and quality.  At Arca Continental, we fully  appreciate the opportunity we  have been given to make a positive  difference to our environment on a  daily basis, through specific actions  aimed at generating a shared  wellbeing and contributing to the  comprehensive development of the  communities we serve.  2       2 0 1 1  S o c i a l  R e S p o n S i b i l i t y  R e p o R t  Since one of Arca Continentals strategic priorities is to  operate under the highest sustainability standards, we have  reinforced the strategies that constantly lower the envi- ronmental impact of our direct and value-chain production,  distribution and marketing activities. Our most important 2011 achievements include a 765  thousand cubic meter reduction in water consumption in  our processes despite an increase in production volume. We also implemented innovative projects to optimize our  product distribution and supply models, such as increasing  the load capacity of our transportation units, using clean  fuels and renewable energy sources, and enhancing the  efficiency of our delivery routes. These are just some of the  actions that, together, have helped to reduce atmospheric  CO2 emissions. By remaining focused on fulfilling our 2020 Vision, in  partnership with The Coca-Cola Company, we have made  great strides forward in our commitment to giving back to  nature 100% of the water we use in our processes, through  timely improvements to our operations and a widespread  reforestation and water-harvesting program implemented  in conjunction with Coca-Cola and Pronatura, A.C. In 2011,  this program resulted in the planting of 3.3 million trees  across approximately 8,400 acres of our territories, an  endeavor that will contribute significantly to the collecting  and filtering of water into the subsoil in several different  regions of Mexico.  Another environmentally-friendly action implemented in  conjunction with The Coca-Cola Company and other peer  bottlers was the acquisition of PetStar, Mexicos largest PET  recycling company, which boasts leading-edge technology  and an annual capacity to convert 30,000 tons of dis- posable plastic bottles into 22,000 tons of high-quality,  food-grade resin at a competitive cost.   Being socially responsible with our communities is a value  that all members of this organization and their families  share and realize through diverse activities during the  year. These include Annual Volunteer Day, which, in 2011,  enjoyed the active participation of 4,500 associates and  their families who planted more than 2,000 trees, restored  public spaces and cleaned more than 10 miles of river banks  and beaches in our territories.  Arca Continental is also engaged in promoting active,  healthy lifestyles, particularly among children and young  people, through programs such as Schools in Motion, which  to date has resulted in the construction of 73 sports areas  with first-rate facilities in state schools in Nuevo Len,  Coahuila and Chihuahua, benefitting over 60,000 children. In 2011, we continued to implement, together with the  Nuevo Len State Departments of Health and Education,  the Health for Learning Program, which seeks to encourage  elementary school students to eat healthily.  This partner- ship led to the State Catalog of School Food, Beverages,  Breakfasts and Snacks, a guide that shows school directors,  parents and food vendors in schools beverage, breakfast and  snack options that offer children a healthy, balanced diet  consistent with their specific energy requirements.  In 2011, the diverse community-outreach and environ- mental-protection actions undertaken by Arca Continental  were recognized by the Mexican Center for Philanthropy  for the ninth consecutive year with its Socially Responsible  Company Award. Additionally, the Mexican Stock Exchange  included our company in its new Sustainability Index, which  considers the best practices in this field.  We appreciate the enthusiasm and participation of all our  associates in each community support initiative and pro- posal, and the support of The Coca-Cola Company in every  community wellbeing program.  We should also like to express our gratitude and apprecia- tion to our stockholders and the Board of Directors for their  trust, and to all the organizations who have worked with us  to achieve our social responsibility and sustainability goals.   We are fully aware that the new dimension of Arca Conti- nental entails a greater responsibility to contribute to the  comprehensive development of our society. As a result, we  have redoubled our efforts and would like to reiterate our  ongoing commitment to collaborating in the construction of  increasingly sustainable communities.  Ing.

The Social Responsibility and Sustainability Model facilitates  the strategic alignment, management and control of our actions,  including those that target environmental protection and  community wellbeing.

We produce and  sell The Coca-Cola Company brand beverages in the nor- thern and western regions of Mexico and also distribute  Jugos del Valle juices and own brands, such as Topo Chico  sparkling water.  South America We focus on launching initiatives to perform our opera- tions with excellence, expand our product portfolio, and  enhance our point-of-sale execution with leading-edge  information systems. This territory consists of Arca Conti- nental Argentina, which is divided into three operational  areas: the Northern Region, the Southern Region and the  Eastern Region, and Arca Continental Ecuador. Complementary Businesses Our commitment to continuous improvement ensures  that we focus our efforts on offering our customers and  consumers new value proposals. We constantly implement  initiatives to make our processes more efficient; launch  new brands and products in keeping with market needs,  backed by strict quality controls; open up new territories;  and improve our services.  The companies comprising the Complementary Busi- nesses operating unit are: Bokados, with plants in Santa  Catarina, Nuevo Len, and Ciudad Obregn, Sonora, both  of which produce snacks and candy, including Mazapn  Azteca, a peanut-based candy; Interex, the distributor of  Topo Chico sparkling water, Topo flavored water, Boka- dos snacks and other brands of snacks, as well as Salsas  Trechas sauces, in the most important cities in the United  States; and IPASA, a plastic crate manufacturing and  distribution company. We also operate a vending-machine  business, a channel that has grown significantly over the  past few years.  Consolidating  our Growth this year we completed the merger between em- botelladoras arca and Grupo continental to form  a new, more competitive company with a stronger  market leadership position, which was reflected in  significant upturns in sales volumes and revenue in  the territories in which we operate, Mexico, argen- tina and ecuador. today we are one of the worlds largest coca-cola  bottling companies, but, more significantly, we are  a better company in every way, with high perfor- mance in everything we do, particularly in our  customer and consumer service.  We are convinced that being bigger is just a means  to being better and are focused on achieving this  quickly and efficiently.  in 2011, we also acquired the shares representing  the capital stock of petStar, S.a. de c.V. (petStar), a  polyethylene terephthalate (pet) recycling com- pany that was a subsidiary of promotora ambiental,  S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV ticker symbol: PASA). As part  of the commitment of the coca-cola System in  Mexico to producing packaging that uses a maxi- mum amount of recycled material, the coca-cola  company, together with an important group of peer  bottlers, will join forces with this firm to advance  towards our sustainability goals and underscore  our commitment to protecting the environment.  petStar uses leading-edge technology to process  approximately 30,000 tons of post-consumption  pet per year and convert them into approximately  22,000 tons of food-grade recycled pet resin, which  can be used as an input for new containers for the  food and beverage industry.  additionally, on March 1, 2011, we acquired the  company Sr. Snacks, increasing arca continentals  bokados customer and product portfolio and  creating synergies in the different areas of opera- tion.  Sr. Snacks is located in la Mirada, california,  and covers routes in california, as well as in some  regions of nevada.                          Sr. Snacks offers 12 different brands of Mexican- style snacks, under brand names such as la abeja  and S Seor, with annual sales totaling seven  million dollars.

We are quite certain that our actions in the area of  quality of life in the company must be based on an  observance of human rights and the constant pur- suit of the success and comprehensive growth of  our employees, as well as improved productivity and  efficiency for the organization. We should particularly  like to mention the participation of our associates in  the Participative Management Program, in which they  share decision-making to improve their respective  work areas and teams.

In 2011, we evaluated our Institutional Development  Program in order to consolidate its functionality in accor- dance with the companys new needs. The evaluation led  to a scheme in which associates can identify, develop and  strengthen —according to their roles and functions— the  ongoing training programs that will allow them to enhan- ce their personal and professional potential. We have implemented a number of programs to fortify  our development plans, such as in-person workshops on  leadership styles and courses about leadership, commu- nication and integration. The continued success of the  Arca Continental Masters Degree Program is particularly  noteworthy. This initiative allows our people to improve  their skills, which are then reflected in the enhancement  and optimization of the company processes in which they  participate. In 2011, a total of 21 executives completed  their masters degree and, in the same year, 21 new execu- tives started the program. In the second half of 2012, 25  executives will become the third generation of graduates. Additionally, associates can enjoy training and instruction  through our e-learning platform, which uses the latest IT  tools to teach them about different business processes, as  well as offer English classes.  One of Arca Continentals most outstanding goals is  the overall development of our personnel, which is why  we look beyond their professional competencies to the  fundamental aspects of their personal growth. This can be  seen in our Human Values Consolidation Program, which  promotes the positive axiological aspects of comprehen- sive human development and seeks to improve the quality  over 862,000 associate training hours  almost 9,000 courses Training hours ASSOCIATE CATEGORY  HOURS Non-managerial staff   476,545 (production, Distribution and Sales Force)    Administrative personnel   382,045 Managers / Assistant directors   3,787 Directors    151 Mexico Beverages and Complementary Businesses 14       2 0 1 1  S o c i a l  R e S p o n S i b i l i t y  R e p o R t  Our Employee  Remuneration and Benefits Plan    contemplates competitive salaries and benefits, in  accordance with the labor market and the profile  and responsibilities of each position, regardless of  gender and in compliance with current legislation  and company policies.   One of our actions in favor of equal opportunities is the  alliance we have made with the Congruence Movement  to support the social and professional integration and  development of the handicapped. By the end of 2011, 160  special needs employees were working at our company.  Arca Continental has an equal-opportunity recruitment  system with transparent hiring processes that are adap- ted to the needs of each position, with the permanent  objective of attracting and retaining talent. We have  implemented a program called Human Talent Reten- tion in order to increase productivity and retain our  best people, increasing their competencies and offering  them a personal and professional development program  within the company. The companys procedures for hiring top executives  locally include a recruitment policy and a succession  plan that gives priority to internal personnel. At the end  of 2011, 99% of senior management comprised local  people from the communities in which we operate. of life of our people and their families, both at home and in  the work environment. In 2011, we invested over one million  pesos, which directly benefitted over 1,400 associates and their  families. To date, more than 21,250 people from Mexico Beve- rages and Complementary Businesses have participated in this  program. In 2011, the company invested over 26 million pesos in more  than 9 thousand courses, which translates into approximately  862 thousand training hours. Another way in which we help our associates reach their  potential is by awarding academic scholarships for secondary  and higher education. In 2011, Arca Continental awarded 122  scholarships, 36 for secondary school and 86 for high school.  In conjunction with the National Institute for Adult Education  (INEA), we also supported those members of our team who wis- hed to complete their elementary studies. The program has been  very well accepted, with primary education indices reaching 97%  at some locations. With regard to personnel performance evaluations, the company  has implemented the 360 Degree Methodology, through which  we measure associates performance on the basis of the com- petencies required for the effective execution of their specific  functions and responsibilities. This evaluation is conducted every  two years and is used to institute training and development  programs for personal and professional growth. In 2011, we  evaluated 100% of our corporate personnel and other associates  in both Argentina and Mexico. Equal Opportunities We categorically reject discrimination and are striving to hire  more women in our work centers and increase their participation  in the companys decision-making processes.  We seek to eli- minate discrimination in any form and in 2011 there was not a  single incidence of discrimination registered at Arca Continental.  ovement  Benefits and Compensation Our employees remuneration and benefit plan is governed  by equal opportunity criteria regardless of gender and  takes into consideration talent, responsibility, competencies  and achievements. The plan involves competitive salaries  and fringe benefits from the market perspective and in  compliance with the law. With regard to salaries, the lowest  wage in the company is at least 2.0 times the minimum  wage corresponding to the operational zone.  Associates from all the business units have the right to an  attractive package of additional benefits that go beyond  those required by law. For each peso of salary, an additional  30% is paid in benefits, the most outstanding of which are:  our savings and investment plan, disability allowance, life  insurance, Christmas bonus, grocery allowance, vacation  premium, recognition for seniority, Sunday premium,  vacations and holidays. Our people are also offered major  medical health insurance, disability coverage, maternity  leave and a pension fund. Since we know that finding a  balance between work and family is so important, we have  introduced several programs focused on physical and social  wellbeing, emphasizing actions that foster the integration,  promotion and encouragement of healthy lifestyles. We also  organize a broad range of recreational and leisure activities  on special dates, such as Epiphany, Childrens Day, Mothers  Day and Christmas, for our employees and their families.  In 2011, over 73,000 people, including associates and  their families, participated in the recreational and leisure  programs the company organized (Mexico Beverages and  Complementary Businesses).  An additional benefit consists of the Bottle Cap of Honor,  a program that offers academic merit scholarships to our  associates children for any academic level from elementary  school through higher education. In 2011, more than 3,000  students were awarded a scholarship from this program. The companys pension plan is fully compliant with Mexi- can Federal Labor Law and encourages our associates to  save so that they will have sufficient resources for their re- tirement. The plan comprises three individual subaccounts:  employee contributions, in which the associate decides  how much to contribute every month throughout the year;  company contributions based on the savings plan selected  by the employee and his or her seniority; and contributions  from the Personnel Retirement Plan which pays 100% of  their retirement benefits and, in particular cases, makes pa- yments for death, permanent or total disability, resignation,  and justified or unjustified dismissal. over 73,000 people, including associates  and their families, took part in the companys  recreational and leisure programs in 2011.   16       2 0 1 1  S o c i a l  R e S p o n S i b i l i t y  R e p o R t  Health Week We hold this event every year to ad- vise our associates and their families  about safety, health and disease pre- vention issues, with the support  of specialized institutions.  Arca Continental has an Occupational Health and Safety  System to protect and promote its associates health and  wellbeing. This System stipulates the standards for our  control protocols and permanent training in health issues  and in contingency response procedures, seeking to miti- gate any situations that might have a negative effect on  the business or the environment.  Our work centers have Safety and Hygiene Committees  that represent 100% of the associates who participate in  health and safety programs at work.  As an additional accident prevention measure, the  company has implemented an Incident Management  and Crisis Resolution System which makes it possible to  analyze any risk potential, determine the best prevention  methods, and minimize the possibility of their occurrence.  With regard to our associates health, every year we  allocate human and material resources to educational  programs and activities that promote an active, healthy  lifestyle. In 2011, we offered numerous training courses  on serious disease control, benefitting over 7,900 associa- tes and 285 of their family members. We also organized  Health Week, a welfare program that seeks to educate,  train and advise associates and their families on topics  related to safety, health, disease prevention and risk con- trol, personal hygiene, vaccination campaigns, detection  and high blood pressure. These programs boasted the  participation of 16,774 people in 2011.

As a result of our  ties with them, our brands  are permanently available  to millions of consumers.  18       2 0 1 1  S o c i a l  R e S p o n S i b i l i t y  R e p o R t  Our customer service and efforts to drive its impro- vement and development are the cornerstone of our  company-customer relations. We learn about their  perceptions and needs in relation to the service we  offer through effective communication channels,  thus generating greater confidence in our products  and promoting positive, long-term relationships. In  order to consolidate a shared development, Arca  Continental offers its customers the Distinguished  Partner Program, a collaboration model that seeks to  develop micro-entrepreneurs through the offering of  training courses on such topics as business adminis- tration, sales support mechanisms and motivation.  All these initiatives, financed by the company, seek  to improve the quality of the service our customers  offer to consumers. Some of the most noteworthy  programs during 2011 were: 14,000 retailers participated in  the 134 courses we offered to help  them to grow their sales and generate  savings in their businesses.  rs cold front  The aim of this program is to offer the end consumer cold beverages;  to this end, in 2011, we reached our goal of installing more than  47,000 CFC-free refrigerators. We now have more than 340,000 cooling  units installed in the market, of which 62% operate with specialized  energy-saving technology. This program allows us to offer the product  quality consumers demand, expand our coverage and, at the same  time, fulfill our commitment to environmental protection. Route to Market (RTM)  Route to Market (RTM) is a work strategy for continuously eva- luating our distribution model to cater to the market dynamics,  acknowledging the diversity of service requirements and posi- tioning us to make any changes needed to offer more efficient  distribution routes, reduce costs and achieve complete customer  satisfaction.    SIC Telephone Line  The SIC Telephone Line is a communication channel through  which our customers can present their comments, complaints and  suggestions, allowing us to appreciate their expectations and needs  and serve them in the best possible way. Information and data  confidentiality is, and always has been, a priority for us and in 2011  there were no complaints of any kind in relation to this issue.    A R C A  C o n t i n e n tA l      19   Our value approach to customers  translates into five principal actions:  1. EXTENSIVE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO  We understand that our consumers expectations and  needs are continuously changing, which is why we pro- vide an extensive product portfolio with 44 products  across more than 39 Coca-Cola Company brands. This  comprehensive offer includes: water, flavored water,  teas, juices, energy drinks, isotonic beverages, vitamin  beverages, coffee and sodas, with low-calorie bevera- ges accounting for 45% of these products.   Bokados offers 23 brands of snacks and candy, such  as: peanuts, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, flour-based  snacks, fruit-based candy, peanut-based candy (Maza- pn) and Mazapn combined with Oreo cookies.  45%  of our snacks are low-fat, low-sodium and low-calorie  products, including low-sugar candy, giving us a broad  portfolio that meets our consumers diversity of prefe- rences. The success of our business is based on satisfying the  consumers changing demands and offering more low- calorie and natural-ingredient options that contribute  to their wellbeing and health. 2.

SALES AND RESPONSIBLE MARKETING  The communication and promotion strategy for our pro- ducts is based on an adherence to applicable laws and  codes, which is why we take responsibility for the content  and quality of the information on our products that reaches  consumers.  Consistent with World Health Organization (WHO) gui- delines, demonstrating our commitment to the health of  Mexicos children and in our quest to promote healthy  lifestyles, in 2008 Arca Continental adopted the PABI Code  (Self-regulation of Advertising of Food and Non-Alcoholic  Beverages Targeting Children and Young People), which pro- vides specific guidelines for the minor-oriented advertising  of food and non-alcoholic beverages.  5. ACTIVE, HEALTHY LIFESTYLES In accordance with the guidelines for the sale of sugared  beverages in schools, we have developed a special portfolio  for school consumption, known as ECOES, targeting elemen- tary school children.  This type of action reaffirms our conviction and social  commitment to being an agent of positive change in the  regions in which we operate.                                     To this end, we offer a va- riety of options to meet the  tastes and preferences of  our consumers and provide  the necessary information  to promote sports and  exercise together with a  healthy, balanced diet.  We are partnering with  diverse state and natio- nal organizations and  authorities to promote  healthy eating habits.  consumer service and responding to their comments and  requirements.  At Arca Continental, listening, informing and assuring we  meet our consumers rights is one of the fundamental pillars  of our consumer service.  Our contact line serves to collect data and generate  information on complaints and grievances, helping us to  enhance our service and adapt the strategies of all our  business areas to the customers leading demands.  As a result of our responsible communication strategy and  compliance with communication laws, during 2011 the  company complied with all standards related to the supply  or use of its products and services. 3. PRODUCT LABELING Our policy of providing clear, accurate, open information  about our products ingredients on their packaging and  labels, including the data needed to make an informed  decision on their consumption, is part of our commitment  to our consumers and their wellbeing.   In order to achieve a balanced diet, consumers need to be  informed about the ingredients in the products they eat  and drink. Therefore, The Coca-Cola Company is including  on its labels Daily Diet Guides (DDGs), which are simple  graphs of the calorie, sugar, fat and sodium content of its  products. The graphs also include the percentage of the  recommended daily intake of each ingredient for a diet  of 2,000 calories per day. DDGs can already be found on  Coca-Cola bottles and cans and will soon be printed on  all our products. This labeling system is aligned to the  recommendations of the Mexican Council for the Con- sumption Industry (ConMxico). In the case of Bokados, each products labeling contains  nutrition information and, moreover, many of its products  comply with the guidelines for the distribution and sale  of food in elementary schools. We promote sports  and exercise as part of  a healthy lifestyle. mers tastes and  preferences   A R C A  C o n t i n e n tA l      21   the value chain  We buy 98% of our raw  materials from domestic  suppliers. We implement responsible practices in  the value chain, establishing ethical, trans- parent, unbiased, environmentally-friendly  commercial processes. We are aware of the importance of forming stra- tegic relationships with our suppliers to assure  Arca Continentals success in the marketplace.  We work hard to strengthen our new and current  suppliers management processes, sharing our  Code of Ethics with them, and in the case of stra- tegic suppliers, the Coca-Cola Supplier Guiding  Principles Handbook.  The latter document explains what we ex- pect from our partner-suppliers, sets out the  companys essential values, describes compliance  evaluations and audits, and explains the social  responsibility principles that govern our com- mercial activities. Some examples are: respect for  human rights, freedom of association, the prohi- bition of child and forced labor and worker abuse,  zero discrimination, safe and healthy workplaces,  proper working hours, salaries in compliance with  the law, and, last but not least, environmental  protection.  The Supplier Guiding Principles Handbook  reaffirms our commitment to the development  of relationships based on integrity, respect for  human rights, diversity of customs and cultures,  and compliance with current legislation.  The principles in Spanish can be consulted  at: http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ citizenship/pdf/SupplierSGPOmplementationGui- deSPANISH.pdf. United through  to be better committed to  22       2 0 1 1  S o c i a l  R e S p o n S i b i l i t y  R e p o R t  We seek to promote community wellbeing and progress  through a broad range of programs that contribute to the  all-round development of our neighboring communities. Our commitment to society is one of the most important  aspects of Arca Continentals Social Responsibility and Sus- tainability Model. The companys social efforts aim to fulfill  two key objectives:  1. To promote social responsibility as part of our organi- zational culture, by implementing programs, generating  alliances and evaluating results. 2. To integrate the Social Responsibility and Sustainability  Model into our business strategy and, in this way, comply  with applicable national and international standards.   Promoting Social Responsibility In order to promote sustainable development, Arca Con- tinental is committed to investing human and material  resources to generate value in the communities in which  we operate. To this end, we have built mutually beneficial  alliances with members of the community, authorities and  diverse social organizations. In 2011, the following programs  were particularly noteworthy: ANSPAC We have worked with the National Association for Per- sonal Improvement (ANSPAC) for 21 years, helping the  wives, mothers and daughters of our associates to grow  by offering educational programs in ethics and human  values and developing new knowledge and training tools  to help them to improve their family finances.  These programs have been very well accepted and are cu- rrently operational at 24 ANSPAC Arca Continental units.  Women who live in the surrounding communities have  also been invited to participate.  In 2011, over 2 million pesos were invested in this  initiative and 1,200 women took the basic and advanced  courses. Additionally, we introduced a pilot program at  the Guadalupe Plant called Young ANSPAC, which focuses  on the ethical and social development of young people  between 13 and 16 years of age. This years 80 partici- pants were all our associates children.  development   A R C A  C o n t i n e n tA l        23   ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION BENEFICIARIES 2011 Childrens Day collection of toys among our associates, as well  as diverse activities involving the volunteers,  the children and their families.  over 20,000 children.

Annual Volunteer Day the 2011 annual Volunteer Day included refo- restation activities and the restoration of public  spaces, such as parks and schools. the clean  Water campaign for diverse bodies of water  was also put into practice. 15 schools and 10 parks were remodeled and over  2,480 trees planted. 4,581 volunteers, including  our associates, their families and members of the  community, collected more than 11 tons of garbage  along more than 10 miles of river banks and beaches  in our territories. Volunteer Program  This program was created seven years ago with  the objective of encouraging the companys asso- ciates to donate money, time and skills to benefit  specific social organizations in our operating  territories.  The programs operations and management are  carried out by volunteer committees at each busi- ness unit.  Apart from each committees local activities, there  are also five annual institutional community par- ticipation and outreach activities in each territory,  including the Annual Volunteer Day, which stren- gthens our values, our way of thinking, but, above  all, our mindset and actions.  Resources come from voluntary contributions  from the associates at each business unit. These  contributions are deducted from their salaries and  deposited in a company savings account.  Arca  Continental gives one peso for each peso donated  by the committees to the different causes.  More than 4,500 volunteers  participated in the  annual Volunteer Day 24       2 0 1 1  S o c i a l  R e S p o n S i b i l i t y  R e p o R t  Responsibility in Face of  Natural Disasters The company has always been ready to help the community  in the event of natural disasters and, when necessary, joins  forces with non-profit organizations such as the Red Cross,  Civil Protection and other local organizations that are  experts in relief efforts.

Schools in Motion The Schools in Motion Program promotes a culture  of general physical wellbeing in an effort to address  the problems of obesity that are rife in Mexico. The  programs objective is to prevent and combat some of  the related public health problems by: a) restoring sports  spaces so that children have a place to play and exercise;  b) supporting physical activity programs that modify  sedentary behavior; and c) creating awareness among  students and parents about the importance of healthy  eating habits and of doing exercise. In 2011, this pro- gram was implemented in 10 public schools in Saltillo,  Coahuila, benefiting over 7,000 boys and girls. Since the  programs inception, we have constructed sports areas  in 73 schools in the states of Nuevo Len, Coahuila and  Chihuahua, directly benefitting more than 60,000 pupils. NATURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE IN 2011:   A R C A  C o n t i n e n tA l      25   Coca-Cola Cup Together with Coca-Cola de Mxico, we continued  to support the most important inter-school tourna- ment in the country. For 14 consecutive years, this  event has generated a hotbed of talent, fostering  teamwork and promoting an active, healthy lifestyle  among young people. Since the tournaments incep- tion, a total of more than one million 13 to 15 year  olds have participated in over 6,000 schools. Health for Learning (SPA) In partnership with the Nuevo Len State Government,  the State Departments of Education and Health and  other companies from the food and beverage industry, we  signed a pledge to contribute to promoting healthy eating  habits to improve the health of elementary school pupils.  One of the first fruits of this alliance is the State Catalog  of School Food, Beverages, Breakfasts and Snacks, the  purpose of which is to offer school directors, school food  vendors and parents nutritionally balanced options for  meals, especially breakfasts, beverages and snacks for  children and young people. Powerade Marathon As part of our initiatives to promote sports and  encourage more people to adopt healthy lifestyles,  for the sixth consecutive year we organized the Arca  Continental Powerade Marathon in the city of Monte- rrey in conjunction with the Nuevo Len State Runners  Association. 3,108 runners participated in this race, surpassing  by 4% the race registration record set in 2010 and  making this the marathon with the most participants  in the history of Nuevo Len and third on a national  level. The event was particularly successful in that  900 athletes from 24 Mexican states took part, which  translated into significant revenues for the city.  For the second year in a row, we awarded the Valua- ble Runner Trophy to the participant who managed to  collect the most money to be donated to a charity ins- titution. Luis Puente, the trophy winner, collected over  50,000 pesos, which was donated to ARENA, an institu- tion that supports autistic children. Furthermore, the  Pheidippides Award was presented to Dulce Mara Ro- drguez, a Mexican athlete whose performance in the  Olympic, Pan-American and Central-American Games  and World Championships has been outstanding. In order to promote physical activity and a healthy  lifestyle among Mexicos children, within the fra- mework of this event, we organized a Mini Marathon,  a 2.6-mile race to promote exercise for children and  family time. More than 1,200 people, mostly children  and teens, participated in this years Mini Marathon.  in 2011, 3,108 runners registered for  the powerade Marathon, surpassing  its previous record by 4%. 26       2 0 1 1  S o c i a l  R e S p o n S i b i l i t y  R e p o R t  Respect for human rights leads to the  construction of solid communities from  which to drive economic growth and  the development of society.  Arca Continental operates in accordance with ethics and  business standards that respect human, civil, political,  economic, social and cultural rights. We offer our key  audiences an environment of mutual respect, free from  any form of harassment and discrimination, with equal  opportunities and fair treatment. Our values reflect our  commitment to being good corporate citizens and to ac- ting in a socially responsible manner in our neighboring  communities.  Arca Continentals investments are guided by our policy  of respect for human rights, even though our investment  agreements do not contain specific clauses related to  this issue.  In 2006, we incorporated the Coca-Cola Supplier Guiding  Principles Handbook into the companys contractual  conditions, providing specific clauses for social respon- sibility required from our value chain. In this way, every  purchase implicitly involves respect for human rights, the  rejection of the use of child labor, the abolition of every  type of discrimination and forced labor, and complian- ce with other guidelines that promote the freedom of  humankind (see the section on suppliers). During 2011,  no disciplinary measures were needed against any of our  suppliers for human rights violations and no complaints  were received from third parties in relation to the issue.  With regard to human rights training, we should like to  reiterate that our business culture fully complies with  human rights and so far a specific training program  Human Rights for this subject matter has not been deemed necessary.  However, on a daily basis, we strive to educate our people  and make them aware of topics such as gender diversity,  inclusion of the handicapped and sexual harassment,  among many others.  Arca Continental values and takes formal complaints  about human rights violations, discrimination or rela- ted topics very seriously. There are  no complaints on record for Arca  Continental relating to incidents  of child exploitation, violations of  the rights of indigenous groups,  proven cases of forced labor or  nonconsensual exploitation, or  any other human-rights related  violation.  We respect and evaluate the  impact of all our operations  on Human Rights.

Environmental management is a guiding principle in our  determination to be good corporate citizens and is a component of  our business strategy as we seek to achieve operational efficiency,  reduce costs and generate lasting value. We aim to run our business in a way that will protect and  preserve the environment and, therefore, are committed to  integrating the principles of environmental management  into our business decisions and processes. We operate with  systems that ensure that we comply with the law and mi- nimize environmental risks in all our regions. An example  of this is our Environmental Management System based on  the ISO 14000 standard.  Our focus on good environmental practices and innovation  has gained us the leadership position in areas where we  can have a greater influence.

Our strategy to reduce the direct effects involved in the  production and distribution of food and beverages is  contained in a sustainability model which contemplates  seven key factors, focusing on prevention and the efficient  use of natural resources through human capital, effective  management and infrastructure.  Environmental Policy We are committed to caring for and improving the environment, to complying  with current laws and the other requirements to which the organization  subscribes in the area of environmental sustainability, and to using our  natural resources rationally and efficiently.  30       2 0 1 1  S o c i a l  R e S p o n S i b i l i t y  R e p o R t  Water is the most important ingredient in the production  of our beverages and is a crucial factor in the businesss  sustainability. As a result, we are aware of our obligation to  use this vital liquid responsibly and to form alliances that  will allow us to raise local communities awareness of the  importance of water and to keep them informed.  Our water stewardship proposal focuses on three  principles:  Reducing our water use index while increasing unitary  production volume, in order to achieve a 26% improve- ment in the index by 2012 in relation to 2004.  Recycling the water we use in our operations, returning  100% of our wastewater to the environment at a level  of quality that assures biodiversity development.  Replacing the water used in the production of our  beverages, by participating in local water-source conser- vation projects and supporting community programs.  We are committed to returning  to our communities and to  nature the amount of water we  use in beverage production.

Another initiative we have implemented in this area is a cons- tant training program that promotes a culture of saving water  and using it rationally among our associates. To date, 100% of  our production personnel have been trained in topics related  to environmental protection and water usage.  These actions have enabled us to reduce our water-use indi- cator by 5.4% year-over-year.  2.10 2.05 2.00 1.95 1.90 1.85 1.80 1.75 1.70   2009  2010  2011  2012   2.07  2.00  1.89  1.82   2.02  1.96  1.85 LITERS WATER/LITERS BEVERAGE   Water indicator goal Liters water/Liters beverage Indicator Liters water/Liters beverage additionally, in an alliance with coca-cola de  Mxico and the WWF, we consolidated a project  called Source-water Vulnerability assessment.

As a result  of these actions, in 2011 15.5% of our water consump- tion was reused in processes such as watering gardens,  cooling, washing the vehicle fleet, conveyor belts, sani- tary services, boilers and the installation of water silos.  Replacing Water  Participating in important local projects allows us to  come closer to our objective of returning the water  we use to the community and to nature. To this end, in  2007 we formed an alliance with Coca-Cola de Mxico  and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to launch a project  called Source-water Vulnerability Assessment (SVA).  This project identifies the impact of our water use in  order to mitigate it by taking precautionary measures  to ensure that this resource is not depleted and sources  are not polluted. As a result of this initiative, we can  now identify and assess replacement projects for the  benefit of the community. At Arca Continental, we are committed to protecting and  mitigating the impact of our operations on the water- sheds that supply our territories. To this end, we have  established, in partnership with Coca-Cola de Mxico,  the Bottling System and Pronatura, A.C., the National  Reforestation and Water Harvesting Program, which seeks  to recover more than 60,000 acres of Mexican woodland  to foment the continuity of the water cycle. In 2011, 3.3  million trees were planted over a total area of 8,400 acres  in Arca Continentals territories alone. IMPROVEMENT   A R C A  C o n t i n e n tA l      33   energy We seek to be the leading be- verage enterprise in energy  efficiency and climate change  mitigation.   The optimization of energy use depends on operational  efficiency in the production and distribution of our food  and beverages. To this end, we make ongoing investments  to lower our electricity consumption through a variety of  initiatives aimed at reducing, replacing and innovating at  our work centers.  Reducing Energy Our efforts to reduce energy use in our production pro- cesses include monitoring and analyzing their energy  consumption and emissions. We have also implemen- ted a Winter Energy Savings Program, reducing the  number of shifts from two to three during the winter  months to lower energy consumption.

Replacing Energy In 2011, we implemented a variety of initiatives  to introduce new technologies that reduce energy  consumption, replacing motors, pumps, lighting and  evaluating renewable energy sources (wind power). We  also continued with our environmental analyses, mo- nitoring and control, evolving to green facilities and  evaluating technologies to reduce fuel consumption.  Innovating to become                                    More Energy Efficient  Our goal is to integrate clean energy from renewable  sources into our processes by 2015, in order to reduce  atmospheric emissions reflected as tons of CO2. In partnership with our suppliers, we have developed te- chnologies that reduce the consumption of energy in our  refrigerators and, consequently, greenhouse gas emissions.  100% of Arca Continental refrigerators in the market are  CFC free and 63% of them are equipped with energy- saving devices. This led to an almost 3% year-over-year  reduction in energy consumption in 2011. Other initiatives that allowed us to optimize our opera- tions and save energy during the year were:   Testing CO2 as a refrigerant gas   Using fuel-efficient, four-cylinder vehicles   Purchasing forklifts that run on natural gas  We have joined the fight against climate change, which  we see as one of the key issues in our business strategy.  Consequently, we seek to increase the efficiency of all our  operations by using climate protection processes, resource  conservation and renewable raw materials. We are working internally and with our haulage contractor  partners to improve the efficiency of our vehicles by ser- vicing and upgrading our fleet of vehicles, evaluating the  acquisition of hybrid vehicles and reducing fuel consump- tion through enhanced route-to-market logistics.  We saved 80,682 GJ of energy in  2011, which represents a 4.4%  reduction compared to 2010. production grew 7.9% and,  with our greater energy  efficiency, we reduced our  co2 emissions by 6,759  tons year-over-year.  0.280 0.270 0.260 0.250 0.240 0.230 0.220 0.210 0.200   2009  2010  2011  2012   0.270  0.260  0.250  0.240   0.263  0.255  0.244 USE OF ENERGY (MJ/LITERS BEVERAGE)  Objective   MJ/Liters Beverage MJ/Liters beverage INDIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION (GJ)   2009  2010   2011   949,824  959,870  1,016,901 IMPROVEMENT   A R C A  C o n t i n e n tA l        35   Packaging Waste and  Recycling Through the appropriate channeling of waste and diverse  initiatives for recycling materials used in the production  processes, we have managed to reduce waste significantly,  acting always in accordance with current legislation and  constantly looking for alternatives to generate even grea- ter reductions.

We work together with Coca-Cola de Mxico to improve  our packaging, constantly seeking new technologies for  lightweighting, recycling and reuse.  In 2011, we invested 25 million pesos in lightweighting  our packaging, which translated into savings of 1,161 tons  of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) resin. During the year, we acquired PetStar, a PET recycling  company and subsidiary of Promotora Ambiental. This  acquisition will move us forward towards our sustainabi- lity goals and underscores our environmental protection  commitment. PetStar uses leading-edge technology to  process almost 30,000 tons of post-consumption PET  per year and transform them into approximately 22,000  tons of food-grade recycled PET resin, which can be used  as an input for new containers in the food and beverage  industry. In 2011, our Mexican operations used 1,721 tons of post- consumption resin (PCR) to manufacture non-refillable  PET (NR PET) bottles, equivalent to 2.17% of our total re- sin consumption in NR PET bottles (79,449 tons). By 2015,  we hope to be using approximately 28,000 tons of PCR,  which will represent over 30% of our total consumption of  resin in NR PET bottles.

The criteria we have implemented focus on:  saving water, energy efficiency and protecting the atmosphere, the use of renewable energies,  air quality and respecting local biodiversity. Biodiversity Our biodiversity protection efforts include the maintenan- ce of freshwater bodies to guarantee the conservation of  thousands of species that are endemic to the territories in  which we operate, as well as soil conservation work that  contributes to the collection and infiltration of water to  the subsoil, thus replenishing groundwater and conserving  catchment areas.  We promote a green culture among our associates and  their families with initiatives to clean up bodies of water  and our Annual Volunteer Day, as well as many other  projects. Through such efforts, this year more than 4,500  people participated in reforestation activities, planting  more than 13,000 trees over 31 acres. Our actions to clean  up bodies of water produced over 25,000 lbs. of garbage  from more than nine miles of beaches and almost two  miles of riverbanks.  Additionally, we are currently collaborating and participating  with institutions that specialize in conservation activities in  order to preserve the flora and fauna in our territories.  Environmental  Legislation  Our company, like every social organization, forms  part of a global community that exists in every  location where we operate. It is our responsibility to  ensure our compliance with all the environmental  standards and laws that lead to the conservation of  the balance between our business system and the  communities to which we belong.  In 2011, none of the products used in our operations  were spilt and we received no sanctions or fines for  non-compliance with environmental regulations.

These values have  allowed the company to evolve since its foundation as a  regional bottling company to its current position as a major  player with an ongoing investment strategy and profitable  participation in international markets. The diversification of the companys operations has  produced excellent results through new vehicles of value  creation closely related to its core beverage business.  SIGNIFICANT SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS CONCEPT                                     YEAR 2011 created direct economic value    $ 45,028 Distributed economic value    $ 45,647 (Figures in millions of Mexican pesos) 40       2 0 1 1  S o c i a l  R e S p o n S i b i l i t y  R e p o R t  Investment In 2011, Arca Continentals capital expenditures totaled  $2,895 million pesos, which translated into a significant  demand for a very broad variety of goods and services,  through the acquisition of new refrigerators, our inves- tment in projects to optimize resources and enhance  production activities at our plants, construction, vehicle  purchases and, in general, the procurement of raw mate- rials, such as glass, sugar and peanuts. Employment  Employment is one of the most  important factors in the social  wellbeing of a country and is  the cornerstone of economic  development.  As a result of  our growth, in 2011 we were  able to provide direct jobs for  38,172 people. In addition, for every direct  job we provide, we create 3.5  indirect jobs, especially in the  small store sector, and we also  have a positive effect on em- ployment through the over  31,470 suppliers with  whom we work. Our Code of Ethics is the founda- tion of our company and the guide  for our behavior in every setting in  which we operate.  Our Code of Ethics governs our internal labor relations as  well as those with our stakeholders, and all our associates  and members of the Board of Directors are fully conversant  with the main guidelines of the Code. The document is  updated every two years with the active participation of  the Board of Directors and the Management Committee,  thus ensuring a swift, timely response to an increasingly  demanding social setting.  In this document, the company draws on the basic princi- ple of obeying the law and applicable regulations in all the  countries in which we operate, establishing and regulating  associates behavior with regard to acts of extortion, corrup- tion and fraud, and favoring transparency and compliance  with free market rules; rejecting bribery, corruption or any  type of contribution that seeks to gain business advantages;  and respecting the rules of free competition.    Our Code of Ethics is disseminated continuously through  diverse internal media, such as our internal magazine, posters,  our website, message boards and the intranet portal, as well  as through courses in the topic. In addition, each new associa- te is given a copy of the Code of Ethics.  In terms of marketing ethics, we stopped targeting children  under the age of twelve with our advertisements many years  ago, thus respecting the right of parents and tutors to choose  what they believe is best for their children. Our Transparency Inbox is available online at:  www.arcacontal.com and through 01 800 000 2722, where any behavior that violates the Code of Ethics can be  reported. Such reports are analyzed by an external consulting  company, which evaluates and makes concrete recommenda- tions to the corresponding areas.

This guide is a generally accepted international tool for  reporting on organizations sustainability performance  and seeks to guarantee the quality of the information  disclosed and to facilitate its measurement and com- parison. Because of the merger, we have not presented  comparative elements to evaluate performance, except  in relation to the environment since our two companies  work under the same environmental performance sys- tem and we can therefore comparatively measure and  evaluate events in this area. Arca Continental is ranked in category B of the diverse  GRI application levels. It is worth noting that in a year  of increasing transparency, the number of indicators  reported rose 64% in relation to the previous year  and the company underwent an external verification  process. This report also includes indicators for the  Processed Food Sector Supplement. Additionally, this report on Arca Continentals social  responsibility practices includes indicators from the  Sustainability Index proposed by the Mexican Stock Ex- change (BMV) and the principles of the Global Compact.  The tool Making the Connection was used to link the  GRI indicators and the Global Compact principles.  In order to assure the  transparency of our economic,  social and environmental  performance, we have  duly disclosed the stances,  commitments and actions  that Arca Continental has  adopted and implemented  after consolidating its merger  process. This year, we are  presenting our seventh  consecutive Sustainability  Report, but our first as an  integrated company.  About  this 48       2 0 1 1  S o c i a l  R e S p o n S i b i l i t y  R e p o R t  This document presents the most relevant aspects of the  companys operations with regard to the area of social  responsibility for the period from January 1st through  December 31st, 2011. The data contained in the Our  Company section refer to the entire company and its  three main business areas: Mexico Beverages, South Ame- rica and Complementary Businesses. The social and economic performance data refer to the  operations of Mexico Beverages, which represents almost  80% of the companys total operations. This year, we  included a brief description of the social performance  practices of our Bokados brand in the report. South Ame- rica operations were not included.  With regard to social performance, figures from previous  years corresponded solely to the company Arca, before  the merger. With regard to the environment, for the first  year ever, the information from the three business areas  has been combined on bases that are comparable to  previous years. The information reported is complemented by an annual  financial report, which describes Corporate Governan- ce practices and the risks identified for the businesss  sustainability.  In relation to content, the Area of Corporate Communica- tion and Social Responsibility defined the materiality of  the report, with the methodological support of McBride  SustainAbility. The report emphasizes the topics that  are key for the companys sustainability, analyzing those  indicators that reflect significant economic, social and  environmental impact and that might have a substantial  influence on our stakeholders evaluations and decisions.   We are in constant communication with our  stakeholders through the different media. This  interaction has allowed us to understand their  concerns and what they expect from their relation- ship with Arca Continental. As a result, we changed  some of the chapter headings of the report in order  to provide greater clarity in its structure and the  information it contains. We also included a spe- cial chapter on Human Rights, to clearly state the  companys commitment to this issue, and sought to  present the information within the broad-ranging  sustainability context of the industry.   Measurement and data collection techniques for  this report included requesting the refined data for  each indicator from the corresponding departments.  This data has been processed through internal con- trols, operating systems and audits, on the basis of  the Social Responsibility and Sustainability Model.   Environmental indicators were calculated on bases  standardized with those of the Coca-Cola de Mxico  System to ensure their comparability.
