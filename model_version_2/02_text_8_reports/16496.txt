Page 1/9          United Nations Global Compact      Communication on Progress    Year: 2011        STATEMENT  Exxaro Resources became a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact in 2007. This was a logical  progression in our ongoing commitment to sustainability, given our shared goals and focus on universal  values.    In preparing this report, we drew on our annual review for 2011, stakeholder feedback, a review of  current standards and conventions (including Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), UN Global Compact  principles, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines on  multinational enterprises, International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions 69 and 176, as well as  UN declaration of human rights) in developing material themes that will guide this and future reports.     These themes include:    Implementation and maintenance of ethical business practices and sound systems of corporate  governance     Integration of sustainable development considerations in corporate decision-making processes     Implementation of risk management strategies based on credible data sets    Adherence to fundamental human rights and respect of cultures, customs and values in dealings  with stakeholders    Contributing to the social, economic and institutional development of home societies    Implementing effective, sustained and transparent engagement strategies with all stakeholders  groups, as well as explicit responsiveness to stakeholder concerns    Striving towards zero harm in all aspects of business    Demonstrating understanding of and implementing responses to the business case for  sustainability.    In an extract from a message by the CEO in the 2011 integrated annual report, Mr Sipho Nkosi  wrote:     .In November 2011, Exxaro celebrated its fifth year, and we believe with just cause. In those first  five years — and through tumultuous economic conditions — we made many things count. We  prioritised diversity, collaboration, consistency and partnership. We pursued innovation with passion  and integrity. We pledged responsibility, foresight and renewal. We placed the highest value on  adapting our vision for the future and preserving our countrys heritage. But, above all, we have done it  with people in mind: our people who enable us to conduct business; our customers who recognise the  care we put into meeting their needs; our shareholders and our other stakeholders who back us with       Page 2/9  their confidence. In the next five years, people will count even more and we look forward to the key  role that all our stakeholders will play in the ongoing success of our company.      The groups progress in implementing Global Compact principles is summarised overleaf.  This is an  incremental process, with the ultimate aim of measurable annual progress in those principles where we are  not already fully supportive.

There are  structures in place to protect employees  human rights in the workplace.      Induction programmes educate employees on human  rights. Policies on discrimination, harassment and racism  are in place, as are structures to protect employees  human rights in the workplace. All employees including  security personnel are fully trained after appointment on  Human rights aspects relevant to each operation.   Refresher courses also cover human rights issues.  2: and make sure that they are  not complicit in human rights  abuses.  Exxaro subscribes to the Bill of Rights  enshrined in the South African  Constitution which, among other things,  prohibits human rights abuse.  Exxaro has a disciplinary code, which is  based on the principle of fairness as  required by labour law should there be  transgressions.    To date Exxaro has not been complicit in the violation of  any human rights.       Labour  3: Businesses should uphold  the freedom of association and  the effective recognition of the  right to collective bargaining;  As a responsible corporate citizen,  Exxaro complies with all labour legislation  in South Africa and with International  Labour Organisation guidelines.    As a signatory to the UN Global Compact,  Exxaro encourages freedom of  association and collective bargaining.  Almost 75% of Exxaro employees are represented by  affiliated trade unions, predominantly by the National  Union of Mine Workers (NUM) at 57.2%; and Solidarity  at 11.5%. Other recognised unions are Mineworkers  Union of Namibia (MUN); National Union of  Metalworkers in South Africa (NUMSA); and United  Association of South Africa (UASA).  Negotiations for  improved wages and conditions for bargaining unit  employees are conducted in various in-house forums  and through the Chamber of Mines.   Changes to conditions of employment for employees  outside the bargaining unit will be consulted with  employees with a view to reaching consensus.   Adjustments to guaranteed remuneration for these  employees are dealt with in accordance with their  performance contracts.  In July 2011, wage negotiations  between the Chamber of Mines, NUM, Solidarity and  UASA deadlocked after which members of the NUM and  Solidarity employed in the bargaining unit employed at     Page 4/9  Global Compact Principle  Summary of Actions taken and Impact  Achieved  Measurement of results  Exxaro Coal Mpumalanga (Pty) Ltd went on strike. The  strike was resolved after one week.  Minimum losses  were incurred. This case illustrates Exxaros  commitment to freedom of association and the effective  recognition of the right to collective bargaining.    4: the elimination of all forms  of forced and compulsory  labour;  An extract of the Exxaro Labour and  Human Rights Policy states: Subject to  the provisions of the Constitution of the  Republic of South Africa, the Company  will not cause, demand or impose forced  labour on any other person      At the heart of the groups employment equity strategy  there are detailed plans developed by each business  operation in consultation with employees and trade  unions. These plans are updated and progress reported  to the board of directors quarterly and to the government  authorities annually.   By following these plans, each business operation  ensures that all vacancies are advertised and that  recruitment and skills development are conducted  responsibly. No employee is forced to provide services  against his/her will.     5: the effective abolition of  child labour;  As a responsible corporate citizen,  Exxaro complies with all labour legislation  in South Africa and with International  Labour Organisation guidelines which  prohibits child labour.    Exxaro ensures child labour is not  tolerated.                 No children are in the employ of Exxaro.

Exxaros employment policy is in line with  the SA Constitution which specifically  prohibits any form of discrimination,  including gender, race and sexual  orientation, amongst others. Attracting  women to work in the groups core  business of mining remains a focus area  for Exxaro.  Exxaro already exceeds SA mining charter targets of  10% on Women in Mining. Attracting women to work in  core business remains a strategic focus.    In 2011 the five women aiming to become miners  successfully completed their training programme and  were appointed as Miners within the Group.   Environment  7: Businesses should support  a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges;  The Sustainability, Risk and Compliance  (SRC) committee of the Board of  Directors oversees the group-wide  development of policies and guidelines for  Health, Environmental and Safety  management and Community (SHEC) as  well as all the environmental material  issues impacting the company.    Sustainable development values are  central to Exxaros business, particularly  in the use of natural resources like water,  air, biodiversity and land.  Ensuring the  responsible use of all natural resources  entails the following principles:   Ensuring all activities are properly  authorised   Using energy and water as efficiently  as possible   Ensuring activities are conducted  responsibly, from the twin  perspectives of compliance and  natural resource use.    An extract from the Revised Exxaro  Safety, Health, Environment and  Community and Development (SSD)  Policy states:  All Exxaro operations have Environmental Management  Plans (EMP) as required by legislation and are  constantly being kept up to date. The group also has a  record number of integrated water use licences (IWUL)  which were approved by the relevant regulatory  department in 2010. Both the EMPs and IWULs are key  indicators in ensuring that Exxaro becomes, and remains  a sustainable business.    Exxaro amongst ranks among the top participants in the  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for its fully integrated  climate change strategy driving significant maturity in  climate change initiatives. Exxaro has now progressed to  reporting on Scope 1, 2, and 3 level emissions and is  receiving independent external assurance for the 2011  CDP report.     In 2011 the JSE declared Exxaro one of the best  performers in the Socially Responsible Investment Index  (SRI).  This is an honour awarded to only 22 of the listed  companies in South Africa.  The current JSE SRI  assessment covered social, governance, climate change  thresholds and the new environmental performance  threshold. This recognition reflected a concerted effort  from Exxaro management focused on integrating  environmental imperatives into core business process.   This is clearly captured in our green timeline since the  inception of Exxaro in 2006. It is imperative that Exxaro     Page 6/9  Global Compact Principle  Summary of Actions taken and Impact  Achieved  Measurement of results  Exxaro commits to complying with all  applicable SHE legislation and  international obligations as a minimum  requirement and implementing effective  company standards, programmes and  processes to manage risks;      maintains and improves on this JSE SRI rating by  continuously implementing innovating environmental  solutions.    All Exxaro business units have ISO 14001 accreditation,  reflecting the global industry standards in place.     8: undertake initiatives to  promote greater environmental  responsibility;  Exxaros core focus is on conserving  natural resources and reducing the  burden of pollutants on the environment  by:   Complying with all applicable  environmental legislation –       as a  starting point. The aim is to exceed  compliance.   And developing innovative policies  and programmes for addressing  environmental impacts.   Exxaro has been actively participating  in CDP since 2006    In 2011, Exxaro embarked on a number of initiatives:    Participated in the inaugural CDP water project;    A major water management programme aimed at  setting clean water utilisation and efficiency targets  throughout the group has been introduced;    Conducting annual safety, health and environment  audits at all business operations to ensure  compliance with legislation as well as with  international protocols    9: and encourage the  development and diffusion of  environmentally friendly  technologies.  Exxaro encourages innovative  technologies to reduce environmental  impacts, reuse and recycling of waste.     Exxaro has recently constructed 800 eco- friendly homes in the northern region of  South Africa that have, amongst others,  the following features:   Grey-water recycling – recycled water  used for toilets, garden and washing  cars, etc;   Overhanging roofs to capture  rainwater that can be used for  cooking, washing and gardening; and  Exxaro has made progress with the implementation of a  number of green projects:      Sophisticated fume-extraction system installed at  Namakwa Sands, with noticeable reduction of visible  fumes;    Development of renewable energy projects, namely  wind farm projects in Tsitsikamma in the Eastern  Cape and Brand-se-Baai in the Western Cape, and  solar and gas projects in the Limpopo province; and    Feasibility studies on using furnace off gas to co- generate electricity are in the final stages.    This is considerably more energy efficient requires  no water and involves less capital costs     Page 7/9  Global Compact Principle  Summary of Actions taken and Impact  Achieved  Measurement of results   Solar systems to heat water; save  electricity and reduce greenhouse  emissions.    Secondly Exxaro continually utilises new  technologies, for example:   At the Grootegeluk Medupi expansion  project, we have introduced dry  screening of coal products   Exxaro has developed sanitation dams  at the Grootegeluk mine;    Furthermore Exxaro strives towards  cleaner production and has several  research projects underway to reduce the  environmental footprint from waste  production to water use. These include;   Characterising and assessing coal  discards for electricity generation;   Investigating further implementation of  dry processing technologies as well as  water treatment technologies      These dams rely on an evaporation process and the  water is not re-used.  The new bacterial cleaning  process allows waste water to be re-used in the  production process    The cleaner production investment is linked to  Exxaros goal of becoming a leading clean energy  independent power producer.  These projects are  still in research stage.        Page 8/9  Global Compact Principle  Summary of Actions taken and Impact  Achieved  Measurement of results  Anti Corruption  10: Businesses should work  against all forms of corruption,  including extortion and bribery.    Exxaro remains committed to the highest  standards of honesty, integrity and  fairness. To support its zero-tolerance  approach, a fraud-prevention policy  articulates group standards and  consequences for committing or  concealing fraudulent acts by employees,  contractors or suppliers.     The groups ethics committee comprises  of executives and representatives of  internal audit and the chief audit  executive. This committees terms of  reference were reviewed and updated  during the year, and its processes  entrenched.     The Exxaro ethics committee is chaired by the chief  audit executive, and it meets monthly to consider issues  of non-compliance to the group code of ethics or conflict  of interest policy, as well as matters reported on the  ethics line or to management.  All required investigations  are conducted by a dedicated forensics team. This  approach is reinforced by articles highlighting the  importance of ethical behaviour in the quarterly internal  newsletter.     A dedicated 24-hour ethics hot-line is available to report  all related matters including possible fraud and  corruption.     This is independently operated by Tip-Offs at a cost of  R48,000 ( U$6,000) per annum.     During the year, Exxaro assessed its anti-fraud and  corruption processes. This was designed to help  evaluate the maturity of the control systems for fraud,  corruption and bribery risks, and how effectively the  relationship between these risks, controls and  performance is managed in relation to industry peers.  The review included assessing current policies and  practices, and surveys in which 1 320 employees  participated. Overall scores indicate that although  required activities are established, these need to be  enhanced to be more efficient and effective. This will  receive attention in 2012 and beyond.    The ethics committee formally reports to the new social  and ethics committee of the board.    In 2011, 240 cases of alleged fraud were reported for  forensic investigation, 37 of these via the ethics line. Six  of these led to disciplinary action and the dismissal of  employees concerned. Two cases were also reported to     Page 9/9  Global Compact Principle  Summary of Actions taken and Impact  Achieved  Measurement of results  the South African Police Services (SAPS) for criminal  prosecution. The estimated impact or saving to the  group of prompt action against suspected fraud was  R5,7 million ( U$700,000). At business unit level, 203  cases of alleged fraud were reported, resulting in  disciplinary hearings in 102 cases and 32 cases reported  to SAPS.  The types of fraud investigated included:    Fraudulently changing bank accounts    Credit card fraud    Submitting false qualifications    Tender fraud  Employees and all stakeholders can report suspected  incidents of fraud or corruption to Tip-offs Anonymous  via a toll-free hotline or an email address. This is an  independent service designed to help people report  incidents while remaining anonymous for their  protection.
