Cavafy  5 The unprecedented international and European financial crisis with which we are faced has created a new, highly volatile business environment, which makes it imperative for businesses to redefine their priorities and their relation with society. In this context, Greek passenger shipping has become the focus of significant developments and changes, also combined with remarkable rises in the cost of fuel.  Being one of the largest passenger shipping companies on the routes of the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete and Adriatic Sea, we are fully aware of the responsibility we have assumed, but also of the trust shown by our clients. Therefore, our focus on the principles of Sustainable Development and social cohesion has remained a top priority for Attica Group in 2011.   From a strategic point of view, the Group has incorporated Social Corporate Responsibility in the quality and innovation of the services it offers, by implementing two important investments to further upgrade and modernize its fleet: delivery of the newly built passenger-car ferry BLUE STAR DELOS in October 2011, and delivery of a second ferry, BLUE STAR PATMOS, in the first half of 2012.  As regards the social responsibility programme - which was implemented for the fifth consecutive year – 2011 was characterized by a new action entitled Traditional Professions, which presented a number of crafts under the increasing threat of extinction in local societies. Always loyal to the protection of our national cultural heritage, but also to the promotion of local society, this initiative turns the motto of with you as our destination to practice and embraces all Group activities. Under the Sun protection programme, we travelled to Leros and Patmos and offered free medical tests and gave speeches about sun protection, while company employees and crews provided actual support to the residents of remote islands by taking part in Blood Ties, the voluntary blood donation programme.   Human resources is the Groups most important asset for its growth. We keep investing in the ongoing care for, and wellbeing of our employees, building a discrimination-free working environment which promotes their growth, training, safety and health.  The companys key goal is full harmonization with the UN principles of Global Compact, and further actions as an Operation Active citizen, through rational management of available resources, as well as actions which substantially contribute to society and sustainable development.  Corporate responsibility, transparency, integrity and social solidarity – principles key to Attica Group – will act as drivers for the companys further growth in a constantly changing environment.

Over the last eleven years, the Group has stood by the islanders providing its support to Parents Associations, Charities and Non-Profit Organi- zations, Metropolitan churches, Cultural and Athletic clubs, the medical community, etc, in order to facilitate and provide support. In parallel, it has acted as an important bridge and, on occasions, even a lifeline, by providing transportation for patients who needed to be transferred to Athens, by going to destinations not included in its scheduled itineraries. It has also supported a number of organizations and associations in the sectors of health, education, culture and sports by providing free or discount tickets. Finally, a number of Municipalities and Communities have been supported by the Group which responds to various requests, by sponsoring initiatives in the interests of residents in the fields of environment, society and local economy. The following pages present in detail the Groups most important CSR best practices and initiatives for 2011, and the last pages present the correlation of the content with the GRI – G3 indicators.  With the environment as our destination With the sustainable development as our destination  With the local societies as our destination with you as our destination With the market and governance as our destination With the employees as our destination  23 Attica Group implements policies that reinforce the personal growth of our staff; realizing that these are the people that, through their work in our ofces and on board our ships, show their commitment, contributing to the provision of high quality services and towards maintaining the companys reputation.  Its Internal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics states in writing the basic principles and rules that govern all business activities of Attica Group, based on international best practices, beyond the existing legal and regulatory obligations. The Administration and Staff of the Group and its companies are bound to respect these principles in carrying out their duties and to recognize, acknowledge, accept and support the 10 universally accepted principles of the United Nations Global Compact (a strategic policy initiative) in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and business activity within the market. The Department of Human Resources is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Code. The Department seeks to:  Include the Code in the information package given to all new employees.  Obtain a signed declaration of acceptance and commitment to abide by the principles of the Code from all employees, whenever issued or amended. Our Groups core belief is that its employees are the most important asset for its growth, contributing signicantly towards the implementation of its strategic goals and choices. For us, it is a basic, vitally important choice to provide our staff with a high quality of life and access to healthcare in case of accident or illness. The Groups Management offers a private group insurance program for its ofce-based staff, which includes life insurance and medical coverage. This program also includes the employees families – spouses and children.   Today, 1,071 people work for Attica Group. 201 are ofce-based and 870 work on board our vessels.  Our ofce-based staff mainly consists of women compared to men; there are currently 107 women and 94 men. The majority of our staff have higher education degrees. The average age of our ofce-based staff is 43.96 for men and 38.38 for women. On board average age is 37.42 years.

Data 2011 Distribution of ofce-based employees per educational level. Data 2011  A fundamental axis of every companys growth and prosperity is the careful selection and subsequently the growth and development of its Human Resources. There is a predefined recruitment process and policy, which outlines and denes the actions required for the selection of the best candidates by merit, and also for their better development. This ensures that workers have the skills, capabilities, abilities and effectiveness necessary to their position, according to the principles and culture of our Group, and also that we are able to meet the challenges and demands of our times. In 2011, 5 new employees joined forces with the existing staff of Attica Group to further promote the dynamic growth of our company. Believing in the ongoing training of our people, a total of 2,143 hours of further training and specialization seminars were conducted in 2011, up by 59.5% in relation to 2010 when 1,344 hours of seminars were held.  In 2008, for the rst time, we implemented a Performance Management System for the Administrative Staff of Attica Group. A similar Evaluation System is being implemented for our onboard staff, with performance appraisal conducted at two hierarchical levels. This Performance Management System is developmental in nature, and the purpose of the exercise is to identify the strengths and the weaknesses of staff, in order to develop their individual performance in general, by capitalizing on their skills and improving their weaker points. This evaluation procedure aims to create better professionals and more efcient employees. The entire Administrative staff of Attica Group participates in this evaluation process and soon this system will be linked to our Compensation and Benets System. The Group would like to know the views and opinions of its employees, and believing that Human Resources are its most important asset, it is interested in the level of satisfaction of each employee.  In order for employees to freely express their opinion, and also to have the option of producing measurable statistics, but mostly useful conclusions, the Department of Human Resources carries out each year an anonymous and voluntary Staff Opinion Survey. Specically, the rst Administrative Personnel Opinions and Satisfaction survey took place in December of 2008 with 86% participation, and the second in December of 2009, with 69% participation. A similar survey was carried out in November 2010 for the first time for our Groups seamen, with a 73% participation.  24 2,143 1,344 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 HOURS OF SEMINARS FOR 2010 HOURS OF SEMINARS FOR 2011 Educational Programs. Comparative 2010-2011  The Group places particular emphasis on a policy of transparency in all corporate activity and transactions. In this context, Attica Holdings SA prepared the Corporate Governance Code which aims at setting out the corporate governance practices applied by the Company, both at own initiative and pursuant to the applicable legislation. The Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies, as published by the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises (January 2011), was taken account in the preparation of the code, as well as the obligations arising from the provisions of Greek Law on corporate governance, and the general corporate governance principles adopted by EU countries. The Code will form a reference framework on which the corporate governance declaration will be based, which must be included in the Directors Annual Management Report, pursuant to Law 3873/2010.  Within the scope of Corporate Government:  There are 3 executive members, 4 non executive members and 2 independent non executive members in the nine-member Board of Directors of the company.  The responsibilities of Chairman and Managing Director do not fall to the same person.  In the Companys Internal Rules of Procedure, as drawn up and implemented, there is a full description of the tasks and duties of all the organizational units of the company and the Group.  An Audit Committee was established and operates according to the provisions of L. 3693/2008 nr. 37.   There is an Internal Audit Department in operation, as well Corporate Communications and Shareholders' Support services.

The Domestic Sales Network of the Group is well developed. In every port of departure there are travel agents, who are connected online to the central reservation system, whilst through the CRS systems (ForthCRS, Ferryscreen, Start), more than 20,000 travel agencies in Greece and abroad are able to place reservations via the Groups central reservation system. Through the corporate websites www.bluestarferries.com and www.superfast.com, the Group has an additional channel of communication with its customers through which online reservations and ticket purchases can be made. International Lines The Sales Network of Attica Group for international lines expands across the world and is supported by 3 ofces that belong to the Group (Athens, Thessaloniki & Crete) and by 30 Premium Sales Agents in the main markets and port agents at the departure ports.  Attica Group is a full member of the management and commercial bodies of the International Union of Railways (UIC), the International Common Tariff System of Railways (former TCV now NRT) and other associated railway organizations (such as the EURAIL, the INTERRAIL, etc.), the Interna- tional Rail Transport  Committee (CIT), the Central Clearing Bureau of Railways (BCC), the European Statistics and railway InformationOrganizations, etc. Today the International Union of Railways has 200 members from 91 countries and 5 continents, through which our services are available.

More than 20,000 travel agencies are connected online to these networks, offering direct integrated services. The Group aims to identify new markets and meet new challenges in order to expand its collaborations and increase sales. Our experienced personnel, after careful strategic planning, using a variety of marketing tools, is in communication with its partner networks, informing and guiding commercial policy, as well as keeping them up to date with the companys activities and new products. Simultaneously, by investing in new technologies and means of communication, the Group promotes online ticket sales through its website, www.superfast.com, as well through the websites of its partners, achieving ever increasing sales each year. It also participates in the main Tourism and Transportation trade fairs in Europe, promoting the programs and services it offers.  31 Attica Group, via Superfast Ferries and Blue Star Ferries places particular importance on environmental issues and the aspects that are most likely to be affected by their operation.  The Groups companies evaluate the environmental issues identied on an annual basis and aim to minimize the impact of their operations on the environment. The most important of these issues are: emissions, discharges into the sea, waste disposal management, land pollution, use of raw materials and resources and the environmental demands of local societies.  The Group's environmental consciousness is inseparable from our commitment to providing superior customer service and satisfaction of our passengers. The policy objectives of the Group are:     To continue to invest in new technologies and to apply environmentally friendly methods.  To minimize the negative impact from engine operation, through their timely and proper maintenance.   To encourage its staff, both on board and ofce-based, to adopt environmentally friendly methods and to develop their environmental conscience, through proper information and training.   To actively participate in organizations which promote the principles of environmental safety and protection.  To participate in international research and development programs which promote efciency, responsibility and reduction of pollution in the shipping sector.  To be kept up to date with regard to environmental issues and to adopt appropriate new practices. The Attica Group eet is one of the most modern eets in Europe, with newly built ships that meet all international regulations for the protection of the environment. The most important is the convention MARPOL 73/78 of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).  Examples of the implementation of strict environmental operation criteria are:  The fuel used in the Group's ships comply with national and international regulations.  The oily bilge water residue, which is discharged in the sea, meets the 15 ppm. limit set by the international and national regulations.  The antifouling paints are non-toxic, and non-poisonous for marine organisms. This is another practice, which was adopted before it became mandatory under international regulations.  All chemicals used in ships are environmentally friendly.  The use of substances that cause ozone depletion is prohibited. Any chemical additives in use must be environmentally compatible. Most of the water used onboard is desalinated, via special boilers. Only low consumption light bulbs are used onboard the Groups vessels, apart from emergency lighting. The warm air for heating in common areas and hot water used for sanitation purposes is generated via the heat exhaustion from the main engines through the specially designed installations.  Via the human resources department, Attica Group trains its employees in best practices to minimize impact on the environment.  Each ship has designated officers who are responsible for the implementation of the environmental measures adopted. At the ofces, there are qualified engineers and designated officers who monitor performance and set the guidelines for the general and specialized environmental training needed. On-board and office-based staff systematically participates in environmental emergency exercises, in cooperation with the local authorities.  Superfast Ferries and Blue Star Ferries are the rst Greek companies in the passenger shipping sector which received the ISO 14001:1996 Environmental Management certication. The Groups vessels have been certied based on the same standard. The efciency and enforcement of the companys Environmental Management is monitored by the American Certification Body ABS Quality Evaluations of the international Group of Companies, American Bureau of Shipping. In 2006, the Groups companies and ships were certied according to the new environmental management standard ISO 14001:2004. Superfast Ferries and Blue Star Ferries are active members of HELMEPA, the Hellenic Marine Environment Protection Association, a non-profit, non-governmental organization that aims to cultivate environmental awareness and concepts of safe operation in the shipping sector, through information, advertising and publicity.  Attica Group is member of the Sustainable Mobility Group, the International Union of Railways (UIC) and the only shipping company which, together with 43 carrier companies-UIC members, signed the Sustainable Declaration. Attica Group continuously promotes provision of information through contributions to specialized publications, and has an ongoing concern about environmental issues.  Attica Group in 2008 began recording of the ecological footprint of its ships. The Group initially calculated the consumption of diesel fuel and lubricants and engine and boiler room emissions (carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, methane, nitrous nitrogen, nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulates). The second phase involved calculation of the overall footprint, which apart from emissions and diesel fuel consumption, includes the materials used by the Hotel Division (sheets, soaps, chemicals, textiles, carpets, edible raw materials, water, food and drinks packaging). The results of the annual recording of the footprint are evaluated by the Group with the ultimate purpose of reinforcing the efforts of the companys preventive environmental policy. Cooking Oil Collection When used oils cannot be used anymore, instead of being disposed of as waste, with all the well known environmental implications, they can be collected in order to produce, after proper processing, biofuels and biolubricants which are environmentally friendly and are responsible for much lower levels of pollution damage than conventional ones. The Group, and more specically the Blue Star Ferries ships, generated 5,375 liters of waste cooking oil during 2009 which was disposed of in an environmentally appropriate way. In 2010 an increase of 32.7% was seen compared to 2009, and a total of 8,645 liters were collected. In 2011 this initiative was expanded to Superfast Ferries vessels which perform itineraries in the Adriatic Sea, resulting in an increase in collected cooking oil by 49.2% compared to 2010, the total volume reaching 17,575 liters in total.  Reduction of Emissions  The newly built vessels Blue Star Delos and Blue Star Patmos were designed so as to achieve the best ship-building characteristics for high efciency with improved special emissions coefcients. Further, by adopting:  the most optimized hybrid propulsion-power generation system,  the most modern and automated air conditioning system,  the generalized use of energy-efcient and low voltage LED bulbs,  the use of suitable laminated stadip glass panels,  the use of suitable new generation ceramic insulating materials, the required power is reduced, thus achieving a respective reduction of total emissions. 32 0 5,375 8,645 17,575 2009 YEAR LITERS 2010 2011 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 Cooking Oil  35 The protection of the environment is one of the most important issues faced by modern society, and is, in consequence, one of the greatest challenges for Attica Group. Therefore, the Group recycles various materials it uses in order to reduce waste volume and its impact on environment. Paper Recycling The main priority in this direction is paper recycling in the ofces of the Group. Nowadays, the protection of forests, and thus of the biodiversity, is crucial, but wasting paper unfortunately continues to be a daily practice. If we consider that one ton of paper is equivalent to 17 large trees, and that 93% of business waste is paper, then we can comprehend how paper recycling can turn the page and make a difference towards a new, viable future. Today, computers play an integral part in our lives and contribute signicantly to the reduction of paper consumption. However, a large number of documents are printed every day, resulting in a huge waste of paper. At the same time, companies continue to print advertising leaets,  which usually end up in common garbage and not in recycle bins. In Attica Group we seek to reduce total paper consumption with daily practices such as double-sided printing. At the same time, new initiatives are being evaluated to further increase the quantity of paper that can be sent for recycling and to reduce required quantities of printed advertising material.  Recycling electronic devices & used ink cartridges In 2011, 13 electronic devices were collected from the Group's vessels and ofces, which were delivered to the Thiva Recycling Centre. Under the used ink cartridge recycling programme, 370 ink cartridges were collected from the Groups ofces and vessels for recycling in 2011.  Battery recycling The Group, in cooperation with the company AFIS (battery recycling), has placed special battery recycling bins in all ofces and vessels for all battery types up to 1,500 grams, whether primary (single use) or secondary (rechargeable). In 2008 we managed to collect 147 kilos of batteries from ships and ofces, in 2009, 575 kilos of batteries were collected and sent directly for recycling, whilst in 2010 593 kilos were collected in total. It is worth noting that larger batteries used by vessels were also added to the quantities of recyclable batteries in 2011, collecting 10,358 kilos in total. In terms of figures, in 2008 we recycled 17,574 liters of paper, in 2009 31,712 liters of paper, while in 2010 36,290 liters of paper were recycled.  All this paper is sent for recycling via the non-profit organization Klimaka, thus supporting its charitable work. Apart from paper recycled by the Group, many of our advertising pamphlets have been printed on chlorine-free paper, which consists of wood pulp ber from certied controlled cultivations (Forest Stewardship Council Certied- FSC). The Group uses this type of paper to print the annual Report of Sustainable Development (2007 – 2008 – 2009 – 2010), small cards with useful tips on dealing with climate changes as part of everyday practices, which are distributed onboard and via the Groups partner agencies, as well as other corporate pamphlets and ashtrays for the beach. 36 LITERS YEAR 17,574 31,712 36,290 2008 2009 2010 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000 35,000 40,000 KILOS YEAR 0 2,000 575 593 10,358 2009 2010 2011 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 Paper recycling Battery recycling It has been reported that since 2011 and according to a new modication, the recommended measurement with regard to paper recycling is made in kilos and corresponds to the quantity of paper which was actually recycled. According to the Groups available data, 9,352 kilos of paper were recycled in 2011.  37 The reckless destruction of the environment and the systematic shrinking of our natural resources create a new reality which every organization, company and individuals should oppose by any possible means. We aim to be more than a simple ferry company, and within a short period of time, we have been able to actively demonstrate that we have made a substantial contribution to the preservation and protection of our natural resources. Under this light the Attica Group adopts practices and actions that focus on sustainable development and improvement of the quality of life. Promoting the Use of New Technologies In order to promote the use of new technologies, we offer a 50% discount for all hybrid cars on our Adriatic Sea routes. Alternative – Environmentally friendly ways to travel We promote alternative and environmentally-friendly ways to travel, by offering travel packages combining Train and Ferry for destinations outside Europe. Beach Ashtrays The Group continues to actively participate in the effort to keep our beaches clean, with two main activities. For the fourth consecutive year, the Group prints and distributes recyclable beach ashtrays, through the magazine Travelers Icons, as well as at its agencies in Athens, Thessaloniki and Heraklion, onboard all ships, during the voluntary coast cleaning campaigns organized by the Group in Amorgos, and by hand to hand distribution on the beaches of the islands. In total, in 2007, 2008 and 2009 Attica Group printed 570,000 beach ashtrays and in 2010 it printed 208,500. The respective quantity in 2011 reached 200,000 pieces. Leaets with Useful Tips for Planet Protection The Group reprinted leaflets with useful tips for dealing with climate change by making small changes in daily routines which are distributed onboard and through the partner agencies. Pan-Cycladic student competition with subject: My town/village Our Group, concerned about issues of environmental education, especially when the persons involved are students and youth, supported the Pan-Cycladic competition on the subject of My town/village. The competition addressed to students of kindergartens and primary schools of the Cycladic islands and it included: a. Group collage project b. Painting c. Photography Attica Group undertook the expenses for the competitions informative poster and the publication of a 2012 calendar which included the awarded works.  Pan-Cycladic student poster competition with subject:  Cyclades, Environment and Culture; Loving and caring for our land" Inspired by the subject of the competition, the Secondary Education Division of the Prefecture of the Cyclades organised an original painting exhibition which travelled across the Cyclades onboard of the Groups vessels, reaching out to a wide public. Attica Group supports the efforts of junior, high school, and special school students from small and large islands and hosts an album which contains their works. The purpose of the competition was to present a spontaneous, pure and warm view of the islands seen through the eyes of young students, promote their urge for communication with the world and show their different views on the culture and environment of the Cyclades. Optimization of Recycling and Waste Removal Attica Group supports the program for improving the recycling and the removal of the waste of the Municipality of Heraklion, which is carried out in cooperation with the Technological Educational Institues (TEI) of Crete, by undertaking the issue of the printed information material. The program aims to maximize the results of recycling, making the city of Heraklion cleaner by reducing the volume of the waste and improving its removal. Transport of Recyclable Materials With the aim of supporting and contributing to the development of recycling as an institution, as well as to enhance sustainable development, Attica Group offers free or discount tickets for the transport of recyclable materials. In particular, in 2011 we cooperated with a number of entities, non-prot organizations, schools and companies from local societies to transport materials to Athens. 38  According to the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) WBCSD/CSI guidelines, biodiversity is dened as the variability of living organisms from all sources, including the ecological complexes of which they are part, and diversity within and between species and of ecosystems (as dened in the Convention on Biological Diversity). The intensied urbanization and the increase of infrastructures, the over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution of all kinds, and the introduction of alien species into ecosystems signicantly harm biodiversity. This is why Attica Group actively participates in the protection of ora and fauna, aiming at preserving or developing environmental values.  Supporting LIFE programme Supporting all information-awareness actions under the LIFE Programme for seabirds implemented by the Hellenic Ornithological Society, starting from summer 2011, all Blue Star Ferries and Superfast Ferries ships performing itineraries to the Cyclades, the Dodecanese and Crete have leaets available for the information of passengers about sea birds, the actions of LIFE Programme and the importance of the island and sea areas of the Aegean.  During their journey, passengers can observe the Aegean sea birds. Using the sea bird observation leaet made available at the ships receptions, passengers can identify sea birds and contribute themselves to the counting of their population in Greece, by lling in and handing in the special recording form at the reception or by posting their notes on www.ornithologiki.gr/seabirds. It is worth noting that in 2011 the Hellenic Ornithological Society received 26 written and 247 online records through the special form made available onboard of Group ships.  39 Photo: Aris Christidis  43 For Attica Group, which travels to the Aegean daily, the support of local societies is a priority, as regards the full spectrum of its activities: social care, environment, culture, sports, education, health, and even more so when the nal recipients are the children and the young people who reside on our islands. An important initiative in the context of social contribution is the systematic response to numerous requests for donations or direct sponsorships of societies from the islands of the Aegean and other places in Greece. Local tradition and athletics have long been a wide eld of social contribution for the Group. In this context, Attica Group offered for another year discount or free tickets to cultural and athletic clubs, this way supporting the continuity of local culture and sports activities.  Some of the main bodies which the Group supported in 2011 are listed in the following unit. Traditional Occupations In 2011, the Group launched a new business responsibility programme entitled Traditional Occupations.  Through the ofcial website of Blue Star Ferries www.bluestarferries.gr, Attica Group introduces a series of occupations and arts that are continuously facing the danger of extinction. This programme aims at reviving and preserving these occupations, promoting the role of local societies whilst sustaining and protecting our national heritage.  While implementing this programme the Company came in contact with many gifted people who, in their own unique way shared their expertise and secrets; for example how to create molds for handmade bells at the island of Symi, understanding the utility value of tradi- tional techniques used for the preparation of local cheese (tyrovolia) at the island of Astypalaia, finding the correct geographical location for the construction of pigeon houses at Tinos and many more.  Personal testimonials and narrations highlight professionals from older and more recent generations living at the islands of the Aegean that continue with the same devotion to preserve and keep alive those occupations using local materials and techniques.  The website is updated on a regular basis enhancing its content and thus reinforcing the cultural tradition of insular Greece.   Other actions  In the context of its social contribution, the Group systematically responds to requests for donations or sponsorships for cultural and social societies of islands. These requests reach the company daily, and are followed by the thank you letters, which are our reward.  Within this framework Attica Group has enthusiastically responded to numerous requests made by cultural groups in Cyclades, Dodecanese and Crete, thus supporting local traditions and the preservation of the unique cultural characteristics of each place.

The Groups support, apart from giving free or discount tickets, also includes direct nancial aid. Recognizing the important role which sports can play in developing the tourism market and by supporting the organization of sports events with international audiences in our country, as well as the promotion of fair competition, we have sponsored or supported the following, with the provision of free or discount tickets:  Schinoussa Athletic Club  Diagoras Rhodes Fc  Kolossos Rhodes Bc   Ergotelis Fc  Ippokratis Kos Club    Ierapetra Fc  Porto Rafti Sailing Club  Stavros Rhodes Club  Volleyball Federation of The Dodecanese  Association of Basketball Unions, Cyclades  Xanthos Patmios Club  Rodilios Cycling Club  Team Racing – Th.Marinakis  Pao Kos  Foinikas Syros Volleyball Club  Paros Yacht Club  Syros Yacht Club  Kolossos Kallithea, Rhodes Club  Motorsports Club, Heraklion  Greek Chess Federation  Greek Shooting Sport Federation, Rhodes  Hellenic Equestrian Federation  Cyclades Equestrian Club  Ipc World Shoot – World Shooting Championships, Rhodes  Mykonos Yacht Club  Heraklion Tennis & Sports Club  Ergotelis Womens Fc  Marathon Runners Club, Crete  Prometheus Club, Patras  Mountaineering Club of Chania  Athletic Educational Club of Heraklion  Supporting the programme Agoni Grammi Gonimi 2011 For the 5th consecutive year, Attica Group focused on local island communities, by supporting the non-profit organization Diadrasi, as GRAND SPONSOR, within its programme Agoni Grammi Gonimi  2011.  During the visits to the islands, the actions are divided in three areas, including Reading Clubs, a Childrens Book Reading Competition, and the main actions of the Diadrasi festival, where children and adults can take part in range of educational workshops and cultural activities. This year the programme reached the residents of Iraklia, Antiparos, Halki, Thirasia, Kastellorizo, Kalymnos, Amorgos and Tinos. The enthusiasm and commitment demonstrated by all members of the team create a unique atmosphere in all events, and take the residents of the par- ticipating islands to a journey full of theatre, music, sports events and strong emotions, proving people in all areas can come together in fruitful procedures.  This initiative brings artistic expression to people who live in remote areas and have no access to such activities, and at the same time provides entertainment during the difficult long winter months. Blood Ties Attica Group acknowledges the ever increasing need in blood and wishes to help deal with this social problem. As a result, it implemented the Blood Ties programme for the 3rd consecutive year. This programme has been designed in a way that it has become an institution for the Group.  Since 2009 when the programme was launched, blood donation is an act of respon- sibility, contribution and solidarity of our employees to people in need, in the hope that within the next few years Blood Ties concept will have become an institution. The voluntary blood donation of the Attica Group employees continued for the 3rd year, supporting with continuity and consistency our Groups commitment to offer a helping hand, fostering voluntarism and social contribution. The organized blood donation days of 2011 took place in April and October in cooperation with the Athens General Hospital G. Gennimatas, with ofce- based and on board employees giving once more a strong message of sensi- tivity and selessness. The Blood Bank that was created meets demands for residents of remote islands which the Company services in the Cyclades and the Dodecanese, and at the same time covers emergency needs both for Group employees and for their families.  By 31.12.2011 we had already responded to 52 cases which required blood immediately. 46  47 Information speeches and education about Diabetes Mellitus Attica Group and MITERA Childrens Hospital, in cooperation with the Hellenic Diabetes Federation, being fully aware of their enhanced social role and always with a focus on people and their needs, joined forces for the first time to deal with emergency situations of passengers suffering from Diabetes Mellitus. In July, the experienced medical staff of MITERA Childrens Hospital, offered information speeches and educational meetings about Diabetes Mellitus, the symptoms demonstrated in case of hypoglycemia and the methods to deal with it to the crews of Blue Star Ferries, BLUE STAR 1, BLUE STAR 2, BLUE STAR ITHAKI & DIAGORAS, and SUPERFAST I.  Information material was handed out during the meeting, while participants attended a demonstration of how to use a blood sugar metering device. At the end of the presentation, testing strips were handed out to deck officers, to deal with potential emergencies.  It is everyones goal to disseminate this initiative and train the crews of all vessels, as well as office personnel of Attica Group. Sun Protection Programme  The Group, in cooperation with the Melampous Melanoma Prevention and Treatment Organization and the assistance of local doctors and bodies, organized free check-ups and informative speeches for the third year, with the purpose of informing islanders enjoying the Greek sun regarding the risk of prolonged exposure and methods of prevention. In May and June 2011, Blue Star Ferries and the medical team travelled to the islands of Patmos and Leros where 586 adults and children were examined, while even more were informed about the appropriate methods of prevention which help benefit from the sun and eliminate health risks.  Further, Blue Star Ferries distributed informative leaflets to islanders with references to the indicated methods of self-examination. Leaflets are also available at the companys central and port agencies and the domestic line ships of Attica Group all year round. Since 2008 the programme has been implemented in 10 islands, while further implementation is planned for 2012 in Ios and Santorini.  The Melampous team Leros, at the Hospitals garden, last day of the program, time 16:00 upon completion of the free examinations to the local population. The president of Melampous (third from the right) exhausted after performing 43 hours of examinations and 11 hours of speeches in both islands!!!   Drawing given as a gift by 6 year old Pantelis to the our doctor what a great message!!! Upon arrival at the Health Centre, opening the boxes with the medicines and sanitary material. Everything was provided by Blue Star Ferries in order not to charge the Health Centre.  At the end of the speeches we handed out information leaets regarding sun protection, baseball cups, and bags for our little friends.

And the priest said: Arent you bored of black already? You see my black robes every single day. Why dont you add a vivid color? Head of library in the Patmos Monastery.

Leros Moments  The beautiful island. The Venetian buildings in Lakki and Agia Marina blend harmoniously with the culture brought by people from Asia Minor and Egypt. Wind mills on the castle. From here you can see Bodrum, the Greek city of Alikarnassos. Turkish boats come to Leros every day for food and shopping.  The old psychiatric clinic weighs on the island's name.  Wing 16 (used for severe cases) was nally closed in 1994 after the imposition of a ne by the EU on Greece. The psychiatric clinic now accommodates 300 patients under standard programmes subsidized by the EU. On our last day, the residents would hug and kiss us.  An older man said we had honored them by visiting their island. All hospital nurses, doctors, the director, would check on us about 4 times a day to make sure everything was all right and that we had everything we needed. Last but not least, the people. All of them. In both islands.  Those who were tested or attended the speeches and those seen in the streets, in coffee shops. As soon as they would see licence plates from Athens, they would beep and wave, welcome us, open their hearts and homes to us.         49 Cooperation with Non-Government Organizations In the context of the companys responsible actions for the greater good, Attica Group offered a helping hand to the non-government organizations The smile of the child and Medicins du Monde, providing support to their signicant work and initiatives. The Group recognizes the efforts made by those two organizations, and placed charity boxes on all ships, thus proving in practice its intention to support them in their work.

By our actions, we have not and do not aim to substitute for the State or regional infrastructure planning. We just wish to be an integral part of the local societies, of the places we travel to every day. We do not want to just be a bystander, who focuses solely on corporate development.  This is why, every time a small, simple thank you note reaches our offices from Municipalities, Communities, Associations and Non-Governmental Organizations, it gives us great pleasure and satisfaction, and encourages us to continue our work in the same manner.  53 Communication on Progress (COP) Global Compact   Attica Group, within the framework of its Corporate Responsibility Programme, is committed since the beginning of 2009 to the Global Compact of the United Nations, which encourages companies to adopt 10 universally accepted principles for the sustainability of the environment, human rights, labor conditions and the fight against corruption, via universal implementation of the principles in all international activities.

The Global Compact is a purely voluntary global initiative with two primary goals:  That these 10 principles should become the main trend governing business activities all over the world.

Page  25, 26, 27  54 GRI-G3 Indicator Table The Corporate Responsibility Report of Attica Group is based on the Guidelines GRI / G3 applied for the composition of sustainability reports. The GRI instructions are a sum of principles and indicators, with a wide range of technical and specialized guidelines, notes and annexes, depending on the sector, which were formed through the international cooperation of multiple interested parties and are evaluated within the composition of these sustainability reports. More specifically, these reports are based on the GRI Sustainability Report Publication Framework and disclose all conclusions and results extracted during the reporting process concerning the commitments, strategic policy and administrative methods of the organization. The Framework is applied to all organizations, of any size, type or geographical location, and it is already in use as a foundation for the publication of sustainability reports by thousands of international companies, associations and organizations, in all sectors. The Report refers to the period 2011 and records the performance of Attica Group in the sectors of corporate governance, environmental policy, human rights, personnel and society at large. This is the 3rd consecutive annual Social Responsibility Report issued according to the guidelines of the GRI/G3 International Sustainability Reporting Initiative. Electronic database management systems were used for the data collection included at the Report in hand. It is worth mentioning that the methodology used for the calculation of the Reports indicators remained the same as in the previous years apart from the recommended methodology for calculating paper recycling which was modified during 2011 from liters to kilos. Finally, it is specifically stated that the present Report has not yet been certified by an external, independent body but it is anticipated to be implemented in the near future. 1.1 1.2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 2.10 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 Statement from the most senior decision maker of the organization (e.g., CEO, chair, or equivalent senior position) about the relevance of sustainability to the organization and its strategy.
