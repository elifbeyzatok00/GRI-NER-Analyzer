It also adopts a new format, designed to  focus on both the Global Compact Principles as well as the CSR Pillars that govern our  efforts.    As our work on corporate social responsibility develops and takes into account the  changing and expanding portfolio of the EIL Group, future Communication on Progress  Reports would integrate the efforts and initiatives of all member companies of the EIL  Group of Companies.

Underpinning our performance and success in our new strategic  direction of corporate growth is our commitment to human development, leadership and a culture of  execution. This is our key strategy for business growth, aligned with our responsibilities and commitment to  our stakeholders. Responsible business practices is therefore at the heart of our strategy and the people at  the EIL Group of Companies are committed more than ever, to being good corporate citizens, to leading  change and being involved in solutions that can improve the societies in which we live and work.     EIL therefore remains committed as a continuing participant and good corporate citizen in the United Nations  Global Compact (UNGC) since 2007. Joining the Global Compact was natural to us as we focus our efforts  based on our belief that doing good means doing good business. We are ever vigilant in our execution of  our business practices and constantly work to improve the 4 Pillars which govern our CSR Activities - Social  Investment & Education, Good Governance, Environment, and Marketplace. Our main objective is to ensure  that the 10 principles of the Global Compact forms an integral part of our Companys culture and business  development.    The following pages of this CoP report, describe the approach we have taken thus far in implementing the  UNGCs 10 principles within EIL. What started as an effort to communicate our progress became a maniacal  focus on developing a formalized CSR structure that would allow for a more organised approach to Social  responsibility and Corporate Citizenship.  I am therefore proud to submit our second Communication on  Progress Report on the developments made in supporting the ten principles espoused by the UNGC during the  year 2010.

It is established with financial resources donated by the Group and from voluntary contributions  through CSR initiatives. The Foundation is committed to dedicating its resources as it pertains to the four pillars that govern our CSR activities.    During the year 2010, a CSR Committee was established to keep under review and make appropriate recommendations as it regards to the Companys  management of Corporate Social Responsibility and the EIL Foundation as well as the conduct of business in accordance with the CSR Framework. Moving into  2011 however, the Committees vision and efforts were redirected towards the organization and execution of a core CSR initiative for each quarter of the year.

Our compliance with the IRA allows us to make better  provision for the stabilisation, improvement and promotion of industrial  relations across our organization.      Minimum Wages Act   EIL also maintains compliance with the Minimum Wages Act, respecting  minimum wages and terms and conditions of employment.     Occupational Health and Safety Act  As part of EILs holistic approach to Health and Safety, the OSH Act  provides the foundation for us as an employer, to provide a workplace free  of recognized safety hazards that are likely to cause injury or death.

Occupational Health and Safety Act  During 2010,  over 220 hours of training related to  Occupational Health and Safety were conducted with  employees. These included:  a. OSH Surveillance   b. Risk Assessment  c. Safety Awareness  d. Safety Induction    2. Employee Handbook  While a revised Employee Handbook was due in 2010, based  on the pending acquisition of another organization, a  decision was made to postpone the publication of this new  handbook until an integrated one could be developed.           Electrical Industries Limited                                                                                           Communication on Progress Report 2010     Page | 6            Labour Practices - Principles 3-6  Child Labour   Abolition of Child Labour  EIL strictly prohibits the employ of child labour and will continue to identify  and encourage the abolition of child labour within our own supply chain.    Age Verification  Upon employment all individuals must submit their personal documents.  Human Resource Department verifies the persons age during recruitment  and ensures that provision regarding child labour is not violated.  Civil and Political Rights   Collective Bargaining  All our employees have the right to collective bargaining which takes place  every 3 years or as requested by the TEMCO Staff Association.    Employers Consultative Association  Membership with the ECA provides an invaluable resource in addressing  Human Rights Issues. Their advice is sought after almost on a monthly basis  in order to promote fair Industrial Relations Practices.  Conditions of work and Social Protection   Compensation Benchmarking  This annual exercise serves as a useful tool for fair compensation and to  attract and retain talent.   Contracts of Employment  One way to help abolish forced and compulsory labour is through  controlled and legal employment and employment relationships. EIL  therefore ensures that no employee enters into an employment contract  without first understanding that they are not being employed under  anything other than free and fair terms and conditions and that they are  free to terminate such employment at any time, of their own volition, with  appropriate notice.   Employee Assistance Programs  EIL recognises that there are times when personal problems can affect the  employees well-being and performance. Due to this concern, EIL has  established an EAP to provide assistance to employees and their  immediate family during times of need.     1.  Employee Relief Program  This programme offers financial assistance to weekly-paid workers in times  of emergency. It is funded 50% by the Company and 50% by weekly and  monthly paid employees via a weekly contribution of $1.25.  2.  Soft Loans  All weekly paid employees can access a Soft Loan from a $10,000.00 float.  Applications must be submitted to the HR Department   Employee Benefits  EIL contributes 2/3 of the total premium for Group Health and the entire  premium for Group Life and a 5% contribution to the Employees Pension  Plan.    Flexible Working Hours  EIL strives to enhance systems that allow employees increased flexibly to  select working styles according to their personal circumstances. Flexible  working hours are intended to support the employee in maintaining a  healthy balance between work and family life. EIL believes that only when  the employee has struck an effective work-family balance, can they  achieve their best at work.    General Health and Wellness  1.  Sport Club and Gym Facilities   EIL has a Sports Club and Gym Facilities which is accessible to all employees  in order to promote health and general well-being.  2.  Health and Wellbeing Programme   A Wellness Programme was developed to expose employees to various  training sessions aimed at equipping them with the knowledge and tools to  manage their everyday lives.    Insurance and Pension Plan  Insurance Policies form part of our employees total compensation and are  intended to provide protection for the employee and their dependents in  the event of serious illness, retirement, disability or death. EIL contributes  2/3 of the total premium for Group Health and the entire premium for  Group Life and a 5% contribution to the Employees Pension Plan.     Highlights of 2010    1. Health and Wellbeing Programme was executed  a. Work-Life Balance  b. Effective Parenting  c. Managing Substances  d. Meditation    2. Employee Assistance Programme  a. Employee Relief Program was accessed 7 times  b. Soft Loans were accessed 61 times    3. Collective Bargaining   This  process began in 2010 and continued into 2011.

Every year we conduct our Employee Opinion Survey in order to  understand and respond to some of the views of our employees. In 2009  the results of the Survey was 74%, falling to 69% in 2010. There are a  number of reasons for this reduction in employee satisfaction and a full  analysis of these issues was conducted with a comprehensive action plan  ready for roll-out in 2011.   Performance Management  As part of an employees career development and compensation for  achievements, all employees are subject to a semi-annual performance  review. The Performance Appraisal system is used as a guide to offer  special incentives and also to direct managements decisions in promoting  employees and awarding salary increases.    Recruitment and Selection Policy   EIL supports the principle to eliminate discrimination in respect of  employment and occupation. Our policy clearly defines the procedure of  personnel planning, search and selection. Our Policy states that employees  are selected in accordance with their education, competence, professional  qualifications, advancement potential and character without reference to  race, colour, class, or gender.   Tendering Process  Our intention in 2010 was to review the Procurement Tendering  Procedures by possibly including labour standards and health and safety  and environmental considerations into our contracting and procurement  practices. Additionally, EIL was exploring opportunities to CSR-based  questions as part of the contracting and supplier qualification process in  order to gauge supplier commitment to human rights and practices. There  has been dialogue with Procurement Personnel in order to determine the  best mechanism for employing this initiative. However, with the  acquisition of another organization, these efforts were postponed until  2011 when a Group Procurement Function would have been fully  established.    Supplier Engagement and Support   Arising from a fully established Group Procurement Function, EIL also plans  to work with Suppliers who share our commitment to the sustainability of  Human Rights. We will actively encourage those throughout the Supply  Chain to abide by local laws that prohibit acts of key human rights issues  such as child labour, discrimination and poor working conditions.  Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work   Standard Working Hours  EIL supports the principle of elimination of any form of forced and  compulsory labour by establishing a 40-hour work week. While the hours  of work will be determined by the employees departmental requirements,  every effort will be made to ensure that an employees normal hours of  work are maintained.  Health and Safety at Work   Annual Risk Assessments  EIL currently undertakes an annual Risk Assessment, conducted by an  Independent Certified Party, the results of which are available to  stakeholders. In 2010, Workplace Hazard Observation & Occupational Risk  Assessments were conducted and specific recommendations were made  with respect to preventive measures and controls to be implemented for  the mitigation of risks.   Environmental Testing and Surveillance   Laboratory testing, conducted by a certified Party, assesses all industrial  effluent, as well as Indoor Air Quality, Heat Stress & Noise, as part of  regulatory requirements. EIL has, to date, passed all required testing and is  in full compliance with all relevant Statutory and Environmental & Health  Regulations.   Medical Testing and Surveillance  Significant work has been completed in the development of this initiative,  scheduled for a 2011 roll-out. This programme would encompass Pre- employment, Pre-assignment, Periodic, Post accident / incident, for cause,  Employee Monitoring programs, Unannounced follow-up, Random.    Safety Committee  The Safety Committee is responsible for review and oversight of the  Corporate QHSSE Policy. The Safety Committee communicates the Risk  Assessment to all Stakeholders as well as submits monthly Statutory  Reports to OSHA and the EMA.     Safety Awareness and Education  The Health and Safety Department engages in continuous training sessions  with various groups of employees in order to bring awareness and  continuously educate on safety requirements both at the workplace and at  home.

Essentially, its about  identifying the right people with the right skills for the right job. It was  therefore clear that a critical HR Strategic objective was the development  of our human capital to facilitate the achievement of corporate growth.  We therefore had to look to the future and develop a Strategic Resourcing  Plan that sought to meet future business needs for the long-term benefit  of the organization. Arising out of several strategic sessions, it was  concluded that in order to promote individual career development and  build potential across the organization, it meant that the learning  curriculum at EIL needed to be reviewed and improved upon so that a  comprehensive learning and development programme could be developed.  This strategic developmental plan is meant to provide routes to enhance  employees knowledge, skills and abilities as they progress in their career.     1.  Personal Goals Aligned to Strategy  During the latter half of 2010, the Office of Strategy Management along  with the HR Department initiated a program of developing employees  personals goals, whilst documenting and communicating this to them to  ensure that all employees have a clear understanding of their roles and  responsibilities as well as their contribution to achieving our corporate  strategy.   2.  Strategic Development Training Programme  This programme has been developed to assist in improving the knowledge,  skills and abilities of the strategic job-holders in the organization in order  to better equip them to meet the future demands of the organization.    EIL Leadership Programme   EILs continued expansion efforts require its executive management and  leadership positions to evolve and develop in synchronicity with the needs  of the organization. Such leadership that is required by the organization  transcends any individual but is exemplified by the words and actions of all  members of the leadership team. The leadership programme developed at  EIL aims to equip our leaders with the skills and techniques to manage  complexities and competing interests in the workplace; to develop their  emotional intelligence; to enable their understanding of their roles in  strategy execution; to conduct effective root cause analysis as well as other  self-awareness, mentoring, team-building and coaching-type training  sessions. While this plan was developed in 2010, it is scheduled for  implementation in 2011.    Internal Selection  During the selection period, priority is given to EIL employees if they meet  the requirements for the vacant position. If no adequate employees are  found inside the Company, an external search is conducted. Job ads do not  specify sex or age of the potential candidate, only qualification  requirements.    Social Dialogue   Corporate Newsletter  During the latter part of 2010, the Office of Strategy Management  developed a strategic communication strategy, part of which involved the  use of a Corporate Newsletter to promote updates on corporate strategy,  internal activities, innovation and recognition and general corporate  information.   Governance Meetings  As EIL moves towards a participative environment, a critical channel of  communication that is often utilized between management and employees  is the Governance Meeting. These sessions encourage dialogue/feedback  from ALL employees.   Highlights of 2010    1. Risk Assessments  During the course of 2010, all recommendations that were  made during our extensive annual risk assessment were  completed and fully implemented at all EIL locations.    2. Safety Awareness and Education  In 2010, 15 different health and safety related training  sessions were held with several groups, totaling 1,189 hours  of employee training time.     3. Personal Goals aligned to Strategy  At the end of 2010, 82% of employees had their personal  goals developed and communicated to them.    4. Corporate Newsletter  Two quarterly issues of the newsletter were successfully  created covering the period Q3 and Q4 2010.    5. Developing our Human Capital  A  Strategic  Development  Training  Programme  was  developed to improve employee KSAs.    6. Governance Meetings  Each of the 10 Departments within EIL held on average 6  Governance Meetings during 2010.

Reducing our Carbon Footprint;  2. Reducing the quantity of waste sent to land-fills;  3. Conforming to best-practice standards and surpassing statutory  and regulatory environmental requirements;  4.

Quality Management System    EIL is committed to a Policy of responsible resource usage and  environmental management resulting in sustainable and efficient  management of resources and waste. EIL seeks to minimize its production  of waste and use of energy through our Quality Management System. ISO  9001:2008 specifies requirements for a quality management system. EIL is  committed to implementing quality management systems and processes  that would enable the delivery of the highest quality products and services.  The QMS Policy outlines the quality system, documentation structure,  procedures and business practices which are used by EIL to achieve our  vision and ensure that our customers requirements are satisfied.     Computer-Based Technologies replacing Paper-based  Systems  Since 2000, EIL has been making increasing strides in eliminating paper- based systems with computer-based applications in an effort to reduce our  consumption of paper.     1.  Corporate Portal and Intranet  All work related documents and information for employees are placed on  the intranet. In 2000, absolute access to this information was ensured to all  employees; therefore the need to circulate hardcopy documents was  eliminated.  Promoting Social Responsibility in the Sphere of  Influence   Environmental Management Act  EIL maintains compliance with the following environmental Act of Trinidad  and Tobago:    Water Pollution Rules    Noise Pollution Control Rules    Trinidad & Tobago Waste Water Management Act 2001  EIL has the necessary environmental permits and authorisations to  operate, from the relevant authorities and has a systematic approach in  place to ensure knowledge and compliance of new environmental  legislation and any other legal environmental requirements.     Highways Beautification Program  EIL has partnered with the Governments National Highways Beautification  Program, geared towards upgrading the appearance and aesthetics along  the main transport corridors of the country.    Membership on National Technical Committees  EIL is an active member of the National Technical Committee - a joint  Committee of the Board of Engineering of Trinidad & Tobago and the  Trinidad & Tobago Bureau of Standards, mandated to the continuous  monitoring and revision of standards within Trinidad and Tobago.    Energy Management  EIL has not been blind in our assessment of the global changes and we are  very aware of our corporate responsibility to always act for the  preservation of our environment and efficient use of resources. At the  beginning of 2010, EIL started a process of analyzing our energy usage and  as part of this initiative, we have Power Factor Correction Equipment at  our facility which has resulted in savings of 15% on our monthly electric  bill. The savings are equivalent to annual greenhouse gas emissions from  11 passenger vehicles or CO2 emissions from 140 barrels of oil consumed or  carbon sequestered by 1,533 tree seedlings grown for 10 years every  month.   We have been so impressed with the savings being generated and its  impact on our environment, that we have launched a new business line  focusing on energy management, leveraging on our first-hand technical  expertise and experience gained with our own installation. This business  line is directly related to our values of innovation and social responsibility  and we are pleased to be at the forefront in our drive to help preserve our  environment.

The development of  rules for corporate governance rules around the world has prompted EIL to  focus on anti-corruption measures as part of our need to protect the  reputation and interests of our stakeholders.      Code of Conduct     EILs Code of Conduct Policy provides employees with a set of standards  meant to promote honest and ethical behavior in the conduct of the  Companys business. Employees, in discharging their duties, have a legal  obligation to act honestly, ethically, in good faith and with the best  interests of the Company in mind.     To this end, the HR Department conducts a Code of Conduct/Ethics session  with new recruit during their orientation period as well as outlines all  policies relevant to employees in the Employee Handbook, which is revised  on an on-going basis.     Conflict of Interest    This issue is addressed as part of the Code of Conduct Policy as well as  incorporated into the Employee Handbook. The Policy recognises that  although employees have the right to engage in activities outside of their  employment, such activities should not, in any way, conflict with the  Companys business. It then proceeds to identify activities from which the  employee must refrain.   Internal and External Audit System    We have developed an effective Internal Audit System that monitors the  internal control process. Together, the internal and external auditors  secure assurance concerning the state of the organisations internal  controls.     Whistle-Blowing Policy    EIL holds a positive commitment and open approach to whistle blowing  and encourages employees to raise concerns about a dangerous or illegal  activity that they are aware of in the organisation.     This Policy is in line with our commitment to Integrity and Social  Responsibility. Employees are able to raise concerns about illegal activities  that they are aware of in the workplace, such as malpractice, criminal  offences, non-compliance etc.                                                                          CEO Commitment  Environment  Anti-Corruption  Our Responsibilities  CSR at EIL  Social Investment  Human Rights  Labour Practices  Highlights of 2010    1.
