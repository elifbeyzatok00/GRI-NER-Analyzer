The success of Unisas association with  the UNGC can be seen in the culture of accountability, recog- nition of human rights and responsible behaviour that is evident  in its staff and students. This will continue even after Unisas  three-year UNGC project comes to an end. With a background in theology and law (speci cally human  rights and international law), I made it my personal objective to  place Unisa on the path of economic, social and environmental  sustainability. My vision was for Unisa to serve humanity by  ensuring the continued existence not only of the people (of  Africa and South Africa), but also of the planet and pro t,  without forfeiting the principles of sound corporate governance.  This commitment is re ected in the principles of the UNGC.  When Unisa resolved to become a signatory of the UNGC in  January 2007, I saw this as a means of furthering this universitys  dedication to sustainability, and to in uencing an even larger  population with its institutional activities and achievements.  This relates speci cally to the principles of human rights, labour  standards, the environment and anti-corruption. My vision with the signing of the UNGC was, within the  sphere of its in uence, for Unisa to infuse the principles of  respect, dignity and justice into all its academic activities and  institutional operations.  As a member of the inaugural committee of the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI), I noticed that the concept of  reporting on more than just  nancial performance in order to  develop a culture of accountability was beginning to emerge  as one of the responsibilities of states.  Unisa had already established a Centre for Corporate  Citizenship, and the UNGC provided a context for the  University to give effect to the principles of responsible  citizenship according to which it was conducting its academic,  research and community engagement activities. It is important  for Unisa to lead by example in order to encourage its staff and  students to act responsibly. As the ten principles of the UNGC  were consistent with the principles to which the institution  was already subscribing, it was not dif cult to commit to them.  Reporting annually on its adherence to the principles of the  UNGC is aligned with Unisas vision to be a progressive  African university that is aware of the responsibilities it has  My vision was for Unisa to  serve humanity by ensuring  the continued existence not  only of the people (of Africa  and South Africa), but also of  the planet and pro t, without  forfeiting the principles of  sound corporate governance.  This commitment is re ected  in the principles of the  UNGC.     Communication on Progress 2010  |  3 to its employees and its communities, as well as to the  environment. The biggest contribution that Unisa can make  to the sustainability of the planet is to effect a change of  behaviour in its graduates and the way they view the world  around them. When one considers the unique characteristics  that Unisa wishes to cultivate in its students, being a  responsible graduate is certainly at the top of the list. The ten principles of the UNGC capture the essence of  Unisas de nition of graduateness and being part of a world  community. The shift in the institutions academic activities  and research focus areas to human rights, anti-corruption on  fraud and labour practices since signing the UNGC, as well  as the community engagement initiatives being undertaken  by the University, re ects the success with which Unisa has  managed to in uence the behaviour and scholarly thinking of  its staff and students.  Its commitment to comply with the principles of the  UNGC even extends to Unisas non-academic departments.  Maintaining a position on human rights, responsible labour  practices and anti-corruption in its dealings with service  providers and institutional partners plays a role in in uencing  the actions of these individuals and communities as well. This is  particularly applicable in the case of collaboration agreements  and partnerships with governments and individuals from  countries with a poor human rights record, where Unisa  can infuse the principles of responsible citizenship and good  corporate governance into the lives of these people. As the only university in South Africa to be a signatory to the  UNGC, it has been a great privilege for Unisa to be part of  the global compact and to be recognised worldwide for its  achievements. Although the project is coming to an end, this  university is committed to further contributing to the lives of  its communities as it holds its staff and students accountable  for their behaviour.  The model of accountability that was established with the  UNGC is a re ection of the integrity of the institution. As  a result, Unisa has succeeded in developing an identity that  infuses the behaviour of its people into the values of the  institution. This will extend beyond the lifetime of the UNGC  and illustrates what a degree from Unisa is all about. Prof Barney Pityana Principal and Vice-Chancellor University of South Africa The Unisa mosaic staircase  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 4 In December 2006, Unisas Management Committee approved  a proposal to support the UNGC for responsible corporate  citizenship. The signing of the compact signi ed a vital step in  the Universitys demonstration of its commitment to human  rights, fair labour practices, environmental preservation and  anti-corruption. It also ensured that the sustainable use of  natural resources would enjoy heightened attention in the  day-to-day teaching, research and community engagement  activities of the University. As we know, universities are leading social agents that give  intellectual content and form to the choices made by society.  Unisa is acutely aware that the graduates it produces will –  through their top-of-mind consciousness, day-to-day actions  and the decisions made in the world of work and in civil society  – eventually have an impact on society by raising an awareness  about responsible citizenship. As such, they are important agents  of change. While under its in uence and tutelage, the University  has a duty to cultivate an understanding about and aware- ness of the environment and the sustainable use of resources.    With the conclusion at the end of 2010 of the Universitys  three-year project initiated to give effect to the UNGC, it is  perhaps opportune to look back at some of the highlights  that have been achieved in propelling the institution along the  pathway of sustainable development. Currently, there is strong  institutional support for human rights and anti-corruption.  However, labour and environmental issues need more attention.  Efforts to conserve energy, to utilise environmentally friendly  technologies and to implement anti-corruption measures have  increased exponentially over the past two years. Unisas commitment to the principles of the UNGC has had a  positive impact on its internal community, as well as on society,  by placing sustainability issues prominently on the agenda. An  awareness has been created of scarce resources and the crisis  that is brought about by the irresponsible use of water and  energy, not just on human health through the contamination  of environmental resources, but also on the economy. As a  result, Unisa can succeed in achieving its primary objective of  producing knowledge and contributing to a better life for all. Within a well-de ned governance structure, important policy  advances that give effect to the principles of the UNGC include  institutional policies on corporate citizenship, the environment  and stakeholders. Existing policies are being systematically  revised to ensure the inclusivity of all stakeholders and to  include aspects of good corporate citizenship.  PREFACE AND  FUTURE STRATEGIC INTENTION  Unisa has an important role  to play in the South African  higher education landscape.  Because of its geographical  reach nationally and on the  continent, as well as its high  public visibility, anything it  does has a high potential  to in uence the actions  of others. It can therefore  succeed in advocating and  advancing the cause of  sustainability.  Communication on Progress 2010  |  5 Once it has raised awareness at the institutional level, Unisa  can proceed to make an impact in the public domain and  in uence the greater society. Giving the principles of the  UNGC, sustained impetus will lead to a con uence of efforts  and advocacy, which will force sustainability issues onto the  national agenda and the agendas of various institutions in  order to ultimately make an enormous impact on society.  In this way, Unisa will lead the way for institutions of higher  learning to contribute to social welfare, social justice and the  sustainability of South Africas political, social and economic  activities. In all it does, Unisa strives to give expression to its vision of  being in the service of humanity. Without doubt, the slew of  efforts precipitated through the UNGC project places Unisa  at the leading edge of promoting corporate citizenship and  sustainability at the national level. The investment of resources  to develop the necessary knowledge base of the institution  and the lessons learned from our pioneering initiatives  place us in a good position to in uence other organisations,  particularly in the corporate sector.  Unisas primary strategic agenda is transformation on various  levels and the UNGC provided the ideal framework to actively  address important governance, societal, environmental and  broader economic issues. With the consciousness that has  been raised, issues such as the ef cient use of energy resources,  the minimisation of waste, recycling and implementing green  building practices are permeating the decisions and actions  of the Universitys management committee at every level.  As an institution, Unisa adopts an integrated approach in all its  management decisions, achieving institutional sustainability  by contemplating the effect of its actions on the sustainability  of its people, the planet and pro t.  Unisa has an important role to play in the South African  higher education landscape. Because of its geographical reach  nationally and on the continent, as well as its high public  visibility, anything it does has a high potential to in uence the  actions of others. It can therefore succeed in advocating and  advancing the cause of sustainability.  In addition to merely articulating a commitment, Unisa  has succeeded in infusing the principles of the UNGC into  every aspect of its core business, which, in turn, make them  performance imperatives for managers. This is a vital step in  demonstrating commitment.   Unisas commitment to the principles of the UNGC is  nding  expression at the level of decision-making and policy, thereby  shifting from advocacy to action.  By doing things right and doing the right things, Unisa  serves as a benchmark; its actions in uencing those of other  institutions. In this regard, the principles of the UNGC are  seeped into Unisas thinking and strategic planning. It is  therefore a leading light for other higher education institutions  and the nation in general. Prof Narend Baijnath Vice-Principal: Strategy, Planning and Partnerships University of South Africa The Unisa main campus, Pretoria  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 6 This desire for institutional sustainability requires a continuous  commitment to uphold not only the principles of the UNGC,  but also the principles stated in the GRI and the King III Code.  Unisa remains committed to advocating these principles  throughout its sphere of in uence, not only at the University,  but also to share its experiences with the world out there. This  commitment is underscored by a bid to promote sustainable  development by sub-Saharan African higher education institu- tions (HEIs), where Unisa was invited to participate in a survey  earlier in 2010. The survey was conducted by the Global Uni- versity Network for Innovation (GUNI), the International Asso- ciation of Universities (IAU) and the Association of African Uni- versities (AAU). This opportunity to participate in the survey  enabled Unisa to take stock of its sustainable issues and identify  what could be improved in order to facilitate the ful lment of  the institutions responsibility with regard to sustainability. As a thrust to further integrate sustainable development in  the institutions curricular and operational activities, the newly  launched Global Compact Self-assessment Tool (GCSAT) was  used to measure Unisas performance across all four principal  areas of the UNGC. A follow-up report was generated and  areas of improvement were identi ed. Improvement actions  have been agreed upon and a detailed plan of action has been  tabled for implementation in 2011. Unisas extensive geographical footprint requires quality to  be included in all its operations. In order to remain at the  forefront in the national and international higher education  arena, the range of initiatives undertaken by the University and  the aspirations outlined in Unisa 2015 Revisited bear testimony  to the deepening of the institutions ability to promote a  culture of continuous innovation and improvement. To ensure  sustainable and cutting-edge innovation, Unisa operates within  an established planning culture of integration and alignment  to bring about further innovation and renewal of its processes  and systems.   The publication of this Communication on Progress (COP)  increases its competitiveness in the academic  eld. It serves  as a public and visible record of progress and future planning  in Unisas sustainability journey, and presents a valuable  opportunity to engage with all stakeholder groups. It is hoped  that the information chronicled in this third COP will be of  interest to all readers. Ms Liana Griesel Executive Director: Strategy, Planning and Quality Assurance University of South Africa EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As the only higher  education institution (HEI)  in South Africa to be a  signatory to the UNGC,  Unisa has become a proud  and dynamic leader in the  country when it comes  to advocating the core  principles of being a good  corporate citizen. The  UNGCs stated principles  permitted the University  to embrace these into  its institutional academic  activities and support  functions.  Communication on Progress 2010  |  7 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND The UNGCs code of corporate conduct is based on the principles  of sustainability and corporate citizenship, emphasising the  responsible role of organisations in contributing to their  economic, social and environmental sustainability and to the  societies and communities in which they operate.  The GCSAT, which was developed by the UNGC in partnership  with the Confederation of Danish Industry, the Danish  Ministry for Economy and Business Affairs and the Investment  Fund for Developing Countries, was launched at the UNGC  Leaders Summit in New York in June 2010. It is designed  for organisations and institutions that are committed to  upholding basic social and environmental standards in their  operations. As a signatory to the UNGC, Unisa is committed to  establishing itself as a leader in sound corporate governance.  In the light of this, Unisa used the GCSAT to conduct a  study among its major internal stakeholders to establish  the institutions current sustainability score and to develop  guidelines indicating what remedial actions are required for  planning, monitoring, reviewing and training in the institution.  This benchmarking will take the institution to another level by  further facilitating the following:   The improvement of existing policies and systems   The building of staff awareness   Stakeholder engagement to improve internal and  external reporting   The tracking of improvements, demonstrating progress  and planning ahead In doing this, it aims to further inculcate the UNGC and King III  Code into all relevant university activities. This highlights  its endeavour to promote sustainability by developing an  integrated strategy for corporate social responsibility in respect  of economic, social and environmental areas and reporting on its  responsibility in terms of the requirements agreed to by Council  and the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET).  In its recently revised strategic plan, Unisa 2015 Revisited,  the University emphasises its social responsibility, not only  through its inspiring vision, but also in striving to embrace  the core values of social justice and fairness, and excellence  with integrity. It is against this backdrop that this COP reports on institutional  activities and achievements, and the governance of the  UNGC within the institution, and makes recommendations  and institutional commitments for 2011. 1.2 LAYOUT OF THE REPORT This report complies with the stipulations as re ected in the  general COP layout by the UNGC and comprises the following  sections: Section 1: Introduction and layout of the report Section 2: Vision, mission and Unisas geographical reach Section 3: Commitment towards institutional sustainability Section 4: Institutional achievements – 2010 Section 5: Future commitments Section 6: Conclusion Section 7: Acknowledgements Unisa Music Foundation community engagement project.  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 8 2.1 BACKGROUND Unisa plays a vital role in South Africa, on the continent  and internationally and has an important social mandate to  serve those who would otherwise not have had access to  higher education. Unisa is becoming increasingly involved in  providing quality higher education throughout Africa, building  capacity and sharing expertise through its core institutional  activities. This gives expression to Unisas inspiring vision:  Towards the African University in the service of Humanity.  The vision, mission and core values Unisa aspires to uphold  are carefully woven into its core educational processes and  systems and consequently have standing in Unisas extensive  geographical footprint. Enrolment  gures for 2009 show  that registered students are dispersed across 38 countries,  totalling 263 559 students across the  ve colleges. The  African dispersion is found across the African continent,  while the global pattern reveals that the rest of the students  are situated mainly in European countries, North and South  America, Asia, Australia and Oceania. Unisa is therefore in a  position of considerable in uence to advocate and advance  the cause of sustainability (see Figure 2). The following table and diagrams illustrate the geographical  dispersion of Unisa students. 2.

UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 10 For the  rst COP for the UN Unisa conducted desktop  research to determine the alignment of its 2007/08 modules  with the UNGC principles. This assessment concluded that  7% of Unisa modules were already aligned in some way  or the other to the principles and it was decided to repeat  such an analysis on the current and product range for the  University. It was found that the awareness and incorporation  of the UNGC principles into the critical leaning outcomes has  resulted in an increase from the 7% in 2007 to 15% (644  modules of the active 4180 modules) in 2010.

It is noted that some colleges are more inclined to  be associated with the UNGC principles than others, but the  analysis clearly showed that the principles are represented in  the product ranges of each college, with the College of Human  Sciences contributing 6% towards the 15% alignment.  To promote social, economic, and environmental sustainability  within its geographical reach, Unisa is acutely aware that the  graduates it produces will eventually, through their top-of- mind consciousness, their day-to-day actions, and decisions in  the world of work and in civil society, have an impact on the  environment and society. As such, they are important agents  of change. While under Unisas in uence and tutelage as a  university, the University believes that it is its duty to cultivate  an understanding and consciousness about the environment  and sustainability issues (Baijnath, 2010).   This re-emphasises the vision of Prof Barney Pityana, Principal  and Vice-Chancellor, when signing the UNGC on behalf of  the University on 17 January 2007. The success of Unisas  association with the UNGC can be seen in the culture of  accountability, recognition of human rights and responsible  behaviour that is evident in its staff and students. This will  continue even after the Unisa/UNGC Project comes to an end. In his opening address at the International Seminar on Education  for Sustainable Development (ESD): Strategies and Experiences  from Germany, India, Mexico and South Africa on Friday,   Communication on Progress 2010  |  11 12 November 2010, Prof Baijnath indicated that as an  institution whose primary strategic agenda is transformation on  various levels, the UNGC initiative provides an ideal framework  from which important governance, societal, environmental and  broader economic issues can be actively addressed.  2.2 INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS To give expression to our vision, mission and strategic goal,  Unisas International Relations and Partnerships Policy states  that as a comprehensive dedicated distance education  university, Unisa strongly promotes strategic partnerships and  cooperation at institutional, organisational and government  level. In pursuit of its vision and mission, Unisa seeks to  promote open and distance learning internationally and, more  speci cally, on the African continent. In this way, it contributes  to the reconstruction and development of Africa, promoting  networking among African scholars, and addresses the  knowledge and capacity development needs of Africa.  Fruitful and meaningful partnerships are the pillars of Unisas  International Relations and Partnerships Policy, also referred  to as its foreign policy. Unisa Library  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 12 Furthermore, to promote its endeavours, the University  established the Directorate: International Relations and  Partnerships with the following key functions:    To strategically position Unisa as a leading open distance  learning (ODL) institution   To advance ODL on the African continent and inter- nationally. These objectives can be achieved by establishing mutually  bene cial partnerships with African governments, tertiary  institutions, national and regional institutions, donor agencies  and international organisations that have a special focus on  African issues, such as the African Union (AU), the AAU,  the New Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD),  the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the  African Development Bank, United Nations (UN) agencies  and the African Council for Distance Education.  Possible forms of partnerships and cooperation include the  following:   Academic cooperation   Staff and student exchanges   Collaborative research   Knowledge transfer   Capacity-building for open distance learning   Speci cally designed projects   Collaboration with international organisations   Cooperation with and participation in international  professional bodies   Consortia (for tendering purposes)   Material development and exchanges   Pulling/exchange of resources Unisa has collaboration agreements with institutions in and  outside Africa, situated in Mauritius, Botswana, Zambia,  Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Namibia,  Rwanda, Ghana, Swaziland, Canada, Germany, the United  Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Furthermore,  collaboration agreements exist between Unisa and various  colleges throughout South Africa. The following are a few of Unisas highlights and achievements  in its international sphere of in uence: New developments Purpose Signing of a memorandum of agreement with the Thomas  Edison University in Trenton, New Jersey To strengthen relationships with existing university partners,  to cultivate new relationships with role-players in the  elds of  higher education and training, especially in open and distance  learning Discussions with Virginia Tech To promote student exchange and sharing of knowledge in  various  elds Discussions with Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute  of Technology (MIT), Howard University and selected agents  of the United States Department in Washington DC To implement a partnership to promote democracy-building  in Africa and other related projects of mutual interest in the  furtherance of quality services to humanity Strengthened ties with  the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam  (VUA) To host a number of soccer clinics and academic seminars  before and during the 2010 FIFA World Cup at Unisa at  selected regional centres A visit by a NEPAD delegation to the School of Business  Leadership (SBL) To examine the SBLs facilities and offerings, thus exploring the  possibility of a partnership to enable the SBL to be part of the  capacity-building initiatives of the NEPAD Secretariat in Africa. The SBL signed a capacity-building agreement with the  African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) To enable the SBL to assist AMISOM in its capacity building  for Somali civil servants A visit by the Mexican Youth Institute Delegation To share experiences and insights with regard to training and  the education of youth workers  Memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with the West  African Insurance Institute in Gambia To assist with the training of accountants in West Africa Hosted the 2010 Standing Conference of Presidents (SCoP)  and the Policy Forum of the International Council for Open  and Distance Education (ICDE) To give rectors, presidents, vice-chancellors and chief  executive of cers of open and distance learning universities  an opportunity to meet with peers from around the world Signed MoU with Hamdan Bin Mohammed e-University  To promote a staff and student exchange programme Signed MoU with the Eduardo Mondlane University  (Mozambique)  To support the development of the Injury Prevention and  Safety Promotion Unit at the University  Communication on Progress 2010  |  13 3.1 CONTEXT According to the United Nations 1987 Brundtland  Commission, sustainability is de ned as meeting the needs  of the present without compromising the ability of future  generations to meet their own needs. To sum it all up,  sustainability could be viewed as a goal to be reached by  working equally towards the environment, society and the  economy. There is therefore a signi cant challenge for organisations  to strive for a sustainability approach, not only as the right  thing to do, but also to lean closer to sustainability being  obligatory. In Unisas bid to establish itself as a leader in sound corporate  governance and sustainability by inculcating the King III Code  and the UNGC principles into all relevant university activities,  a workshop on sustainability reporting was organised  by the Vice-Principal: Finance and University Estates in  February 2010. The aim of the workshop was to promote  sustainability by developing an integrated strategy for  corporate social responsibility in respect of economic, social  and environmental areas, and reporting on its responsibility  in terms of the requirements agreed to by Council and the  Department of Higher Education and Training. Combined with the move towards sustainability is a  strong recommendation to take a calculated step towards  sustainability reporting in conjunction with other initiatives in  the GRI, as well as the AA1000 (an assurance standard on  stakeholder engagement) and the Millennium Development  Goals (MDGs). The recommendation to adopt sustainability  reporting in the form of a discussion document has been  submitted to the management of Unisa and the process is  now open for consideration by the various stakeholders  involved. 3.2 ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED  IN SUPPORT OF THE MOVEMENT  TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY  3.2.1 GUNI Survey The GUNI, the IAU and the AAU initiated a project entitled  Promotion of Sustainable Development by sub-Saharan African  Higher Education Institutions. The main objectives of the project are as follows:   To develop an overview of major actions, experiences  and practices that sub-Saharan HEIs are developing to  integrate sustainable development considerations within  their activities.   To identify the emerging trends and the priority lines of  action for the integration of sustainable development  considerations in the work of sub-Saharan African HEIs.   To raise awareness about the important role of HEIs in  promoting sustainable development in the region. Unisa was invited to participate in the survey. The questionnaire  was found to be very useful to the institution. In answering  the questions, it was realised that Unisa engages in a number  of sustainability issues, although these issues are carried out  in pockets of isolation. The move to establish a sustainability  of ce in the institution would therefore coordinate all  institutional sustainability activities from a central point. 3.2.2 Global Compact Self-assessment Tool The GCSAT enables organisations to measure their  performance across all four UNGC issue areas (human  rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption) and inspire  continuous improvement. Unisa scored 44.44% across all  four UNGC issue areas when the GCSAT was used to assess  the standard of operations (see Appendix 2 and Appendix  3). By using the GCSAT, a number of follow-up actions  were generated that formed the basis of the institutional  recommendations for 2011. 3.3 RISK MANAGEMENT Recently the University adopted an integrated planning and  enterprise risk management methodology that is in line with  the institutionally accepted de nition of risk management,  which states: Risk management is a systematic application of  management policies, procedures and practices, effected by  Council and management, aimed at protecting the University,  its people and its assets against the physical and  nancial  consequences of risk. It involves the managing of risks to be  within the agreed risk appetite of the University and to provide  reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives. Integrated planning and the optimal management of risks  supports University management to be responsive to  changing priorities shaped by both internal and external  factors to achieve Unisas desired strategic goals and to  preserve Unisas vision and mission. In so doing, the University  follows a dual planning approach that comprises an inside- out view (looking at the unique and core competencies of  3. COMMITMENT TOWARDS INSTITUTIONAL  SUSTAINABILITY  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 14 the University as an ODL institution) and an outside-in view  (analysing the external opportunities and threats and the  internal strengths and weaknesses).  The integrated enterprise risk methodology consists of the  following steps, which form an integral part of the Universitys  planning framework. The key activities and their insertion into  the planning rhythms are explained below: Risk identi cation: This takes place during the Universitys  annual planning cycle. The strategic and functional risks of the  University are veri ed and new risks are identi ed during the  annual management team-building planning session. Once  agreed on, the key risks are documented and circulated for   nancial scrutiny. Risk assessment: An expert group, which comprises  key stakeholders, analyses and evaluates the identi ed risks  immediately after the Lekgotla (the Universitys strategic  planning meeting  lekgotla is a Setswana word meaning  a gathering of elders). This group clusters the risks with  similar characteristics and aligns them to the pro le of the  key processes and process owners. Furthermore, the expert  group considers the scale of impact and ranks the risks in  terms of their net potential effect on the realisation of the  strategic vision. The outcome of the risk assessment process  is the compilation of the institutional risk register. Control requirements: The Institutional Operational  Plan (IOP) is the mitigating medium for the key risk  register. Mitigation actions are identi ed through a series  of discussions with the relevant process owners and are  then incorporated into the IOP. At this stage, milestones and  targets are identi ed and responsibilities are assigned.   Documenting risks: The key risk register contains a  consolidated view of the actions aimed at improving or  changing risk mitigation measures. It is kept as a main  source document. The IOP creates awareness among all  stakeholders and assigned responsibilities that translate into  performance agreements. Integrated reporting and feedback: The referencing  to risk mitigation actions in the IOP enables the University  to consolidate its annual reporting into one single  comprehensive report to Council and management. This  reporting approach will ensure that Council and management  have a clear understanding of and are able to effectively  monitor developments regarding risk and risk management  at Unisa. The following risks, which  ow from the key risk register and  the departmental risks, have been categorised in accordance  with the UNGC principles. 3.3.1 Human rights Risks  Existing controls Proposed mitigating actions Instability in partner countries could  lead to closure of school   The Quality Management  System  for Partnership Collaboration and  Licencees   Due diligence process   Assess the pro le of the country  or the potential partner looking at  their  nancial and political stability   Undertake visits to the proposed  partners to ensure that Unisa sees  their facilities and gets  rst-hand  information about the particular  institution   Implement the Quality Manage- ment  System for Partnership Col- laboration and Licencees Non-compliance  to  Occupational  Health and Safety (OHS) Act Health-sensitive employees falling ill  due to renovation and construction  waste (fumes, dust etc)   Safety committees.

A key concept in managing quality is the student- centred nature of Unisa as a dedicated and comprehensive  ODL institution. This requires the institution, its subsystems and  individual staff members to place student needs and aspirations  in the foreground when designing procedures and services. The framework facilitates the development and implement- ation of integrated quality management to enable the  establishment of a responsive quality assurance regimen.  It is important to note that – within the three core areas of  teaching and learning, research and postgraduate education,  and community engagement – a tactical distinction is made  between quality management and quality assurance in each  core area. The IQMAF serves as the implementation vehicle  for the provisions of the Quality Assurance Policy to fully  institutionalise all planned quality management and assurance  initiatives at Unisa in an ODL context.  The framework makes provision for creating a supportive  environment where expectations and quality standards  are de ned, continuous improvement and innovation are  encouraged, and development and training opportunities  provided.  Unisa will monitor and evaluate (review) quality management  for teaching and learning, research and community engage- ment by means of a quality evaluation instrument (QEI)  in each core area. The quality measuring instrument will  determine whether quality management in each area is  effectively implemented and whether it is able to achieve  the stated criteria and standards in an ODL environment and  ensure a quality learning experience for the student. Feedback   Communication on Progress 2010  |  17 Theme 1: Strategic and sustainable repositioning (Rec 1, 2 and  portion of 20)  1.

Develop and sustain an external stakeholder impact assessment, monitoring and evaluation system  to evaluate the impact of Unisas graduates and contributions at systemic levels.  is actively sought from students and other major stakeholders  and any duplication of effort is strenuously avoided. Quality  improvement at Unisa takes place in a planned, systematic,  conscientious and repetitive cycle to ensure that the institution  learns from its performance outcomes, standardises its  operations in a well-documented manner and improves  operations and outputs through self-re ection. Unisa has  consciously embarked on subjecting its institutional quality  assurance arrangements to external scrutiny since the 2007  Commonwealth of Learning (CoL) Trial Audit and the 2008  Higher Education Quality Committee (HEQC) Institutional  Audit, as well as different national and professional council  reviews. The institutional audits, as well as the national and  professional councils programme reviews, essentially provide  a heuristic framework to facilitate a systematic engagement  with identi ed quality improvement challenges.  Within this framework, the institutional quality improvement  plan is prepared, which demonstrates how Unisa has met  and plans to respond to the recommendations for quality  improvements contained in the different feedback reports. In  addressing the commendations and recommendations, Unisa  is compelled to rethink its practices, systems and processes in  an attempt to sharpen emerging improvement initiatives for  steering the University towards the desired state of providing  quality service and a quality learning experience for students.  The improvement initiatives in the quality improvement plan  are not detached from the institutional planning processes,  but are seamlessly integrated into Unisas medium-term  and long-term plans that set the direction for the next  ve  years and provide a heightened responsiveness to a series of  transformational challenges.  The Professional, Academic and Administrative Quality Assurance  Committee (PAAQAC), a subcommittee of management, is  responsible for monitoring and evaluating the implementation  of Unisas Quality Improvement Plan and submitting regular  progress to management, as well as to the HEQC.

To this end, Corporate  Affairs, on behalf of the Of ce of the Principal and Vice-  Chancellor, developed and consulted broadly with staff and  student representatives to conclude a substantive Women  Empowerment and Gender Mainstreaming Framework.  The framework, approved by the Executive and extended  management committees, seeks to achieve the following  objectives:   Translate the vision and mission of Unisa into clear equity  goals and realistic targets   Create a Unisa Women Empowerment and Gender  Mainstreaming Framework that is an integral part of the  academic, professional and administrative functions at the  University   Align the goals of women empowerment and gender  equity with the planning and performance cycles of all  structures and employees at Unisa   Support the integration of systems and processes for con- tinuing improvement of gender equity at all levels at Unisa   Transform the institutional culture with respect to gender  relations   Correct gender imbalances towards more equitable  power relations   Enable Unisa to achieve gender equity in line with broader  national priorities related to the social justice agenda   Equip staff with the requisite knowledge and skills to  understand the value of attaining women empowerment  and gender equity. In addition, the institution has a vibrant Unisa Womens Forum.  This is an institutional body that seeks to do the following:   Actively engage with the Unisa community to promote  womens issues.    Celebrate the contributions of women to Unisa and the  community.   Create opportunities for women to learn from role  models, as well as initiate mentorship and other structured  programmes. For the past six years, the Of ce of the Principal and Vice-  Chancellor and the Unisa Womens Forum have collaborated  by jointly addressing the condition and position of women  at the University. Hence, women empowerment and gender  equity are integral to the broader social transformation of  the institution. The fundamental strategic choice to promote  women empowerment and gender equality through equal  access to resources, opportunities and outcomes for women  and men further highlights Unisas commitment to promote  sustainable change and transformation throughout its sphere  of in uence.  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 20 Unisa upholds the de nitions of sustainability according to the  Brundtland Commission of the United Nations. Sustainability  will therefore be de ned as meeting the needs of the present  without compromising the ability of future generations to meet  their own needs.  4.1  SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY The social dimension of sustainability concerns Unisas impacts  on the social conditions of its stakeholders and on social  systems at local, national and global levels. The following broad  criteria are linked to this category to promote sound reporting  in this COP: 4.1.1 Institutional achievements  Research Prof MC Mar, Vice-Principal: Academic  and Research Teaching  and  learning,  research,  community engagement and outreach  are Unisas key business areas. As  research represents one of the central  characteristics of academia, much has  been done at Unisa in the last few years to establish and  promote a research culture aligned with the UNGC principles. In the Unisa Research Report 2009, Prof Rita Mar, Vice- Principal: Academic and Research, discusses some of the  exciting initiatives around research at Unisa: Inspired by the  discussions around Unisa 2015 Revisited, in 2009, the Academic  and Research portfolio resolved to revisit the institutional  research plan and align the plan with the rede ned mission  of Unisa, namely to ensure, among others, that the research  agenda produces excellent scholarship that contributes to the  knowledge and information society, advances development,  nurtures a critical citizenry and ensures sustainability.  After much thought, the Senate Research Committee  formulated Unisas niche areas as follows: Unisa focuses its expertise and resources in research on the  following areas:   Knowledge production and capacity-building in response  to the needs of South Africa and the African continent   The promotion of democracy, human rights and  responsible citizenship   Innovation in science and technology   Economic and environmental sustainability   Open distance learning1 Human rights  The theme of human rights in the UNGC principles not  only overlaps with the remaining three focus areas (labour  standards, the environment and anti-corruption), but actually  forms the foundation of all the principles. Furthermore, human  rights permeate throughout the United Nations declaration  of three special observances for 2010.  This  rst year of the new decade has been declared  International Year of Biodiversity, International Year of  Rapprochement of Cultures and International Year for Youth:  Dialogue and Mutual Understanding.  The theme of biodiversity focuses on the value of biodiversity  in life as the world is urged to take action to safeguard the  variety of life on earth.  The second theme recommends that interreligious and inter- cultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace  be undertaken in an effort to establish harmonious relations.  By dedicating the year to young people, the United Nations  aims to encourage dialogue and understanding across  generations, and to encourage young people to strive to  achieve the objectives of progress and development, including  the Millennium Development Goals. It was against this  background that Unisa celebrated Human Rights Day in South  Africa on 21 March, which coincided with the United Nations  International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.  Human rights are embedded in Unisas core and societal  values. However, Unisa is cognisant of the fact that human  rights is an umbrella term and that the perception and  understanding by stakeholders of the wide spectrum of issues  covered by human rights are often limited. The following gives  an account of how Unisa has been accelerating the process  to inculcate various aspects of human rights in its day-to-day  academic and operational activities within the framework of  the GCSAT for human rights. Health and safety Unisa strives to ensure that its employees are afforded safe,  suitable and sanitary working conditions. Precautionary  measures are in place to protect employees from work-related  hazards and anticipated dangers. Protective equipment and  4. INSTITUTIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS – 2010 1 http://www.unisa.ac.za/media/PDF ips/Researchreport/2009/ les/ nal%20unisa%20research%20report%202009.pdf  Communication on Progress 2010  |  21 necessary training are provided where needed to ensure that  employees have the necessary skills to safely perform the  tasks required. Employees nominated as health and safety  of cers received training by a knowledgeable expert on the  general health and safety regulations for workplaces. Training  was also offered on the South African Occupational Health  and Safety Act, 1993 (Act No 85 of 1993), which aims to  remedy the state of affairs and places the responsibility for  health and safety squarely on the shoulders of employers and  employees. Fair treatment Grievance mechanisms are in place whereby employees can  report abuse and, generally, be assured a fair hearing, as  well as the processing and settling of grievances. The Unisa  whistleblowers hotline gave way to Unisa Ethics Hotline when  Unisa entered into agreement with KPMG as the preferred  supplier of this service from 1 April 2010. The Unisa Ethics  Hotline was established with the aim of enhancing an honest  work ethic and simultaneously providing all stakeholders with  a mechanism to bring any unethical business practices to the  attention of management. The Unisa Ethics Hotline will serve  as an independent conduit between management, employees,  students and all other relevant stakeholders. All information  that is reported will be treated with the utmost con dentiality  and the anonymity of callers will be protected. The hotline  number will operate 24 hours a day for 365 days a year. Employee health and wellness strategy The key focus areas of the HIV/Aids Division of the Directorate:  Human Resources Development and Employee Assistance  include the following:   Coordination of Unisas programme on HIV/Aids    Provision, prevention, care and support services Advances have been made in the academic mainstreaming of  HIV/Aids in teaching, research and community engagement.  The  Sexually Transmitted  Infections  (STI)  Awareness  Campaign, which was held in February 2010, included a variety  of educational material, including posters,  yers, stickers and  pamphlets. The material contained information about HIV,  Aids, living with HIV and Aids, caring for people with the  disease and the rights of a person living with HIV and/or Aids.  This campaign is in line with one of Unisas strategic objectives  to enhance the health and wellness of its students. Outreach to Haiti  Unisa was the  rst tertiary institution in South Africa to respond  to the Red Cross Humanitarian Emergency Appeal for quake- struck Haiti. Prof Barney Pityana, Principal and Vice-Chancellor,  urged Unisas staff and students to contribute generously to  help the Haitians. Unisa further pledged to help the South  African Red Cross with annual donations. Better World Village Project The Better World Project was launched in February 2010 in  partnership with Unisas Summer Schools Project. Five leading  institutions, the Tshwane Leadership Foundation, Heartlines,  Life College, the City of Tshwane and Ashoka Innovations for  the Public, joined forces with Unisa to create a safer and better  City of Tshwane.   The aim of the project was as follows:    Create a village to celebrate soccer during the 2010 FIFA  World Cup by offering a space of hospitality, celebration,  conversation and socio-economic empowerment.     Provide a glimpse into a better world with more peace,  socio-economic justice and environmental integrity.    Facilitate conversations on critical global issues, ranging  from homelessness to human traf cking, HIV/Aids,  xenophobia, sustainable development and greening cities,  all within the framework of celebration and play.  Unisa made use of this opportunity to gauge the learning  needs of its surrounding communities. The Unit of Learning  compiled a comprehensive questionnaire and members of the  public were given the chance to state their needs and obtain  advice. Unisa students were trained to facilitate this process.  The objective was to promote the idea that learning is fun,  exciting and accessible.  Unisa Bargaining Forum The Unisa Bargaining Forum (UBF) engages with organised  labour with the purpose of information-sharing, negotiation  and consultation on all policies and procedures related to  human resources, annual salary negotiations and all labour- related matters. University staff and recognised unions are  represented on the UBF. The National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union  (NEHAWU), established in 1987, is the biggest public sector  trade union in South Africa and is af liated with the Congress  of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). NEHAWU uses its  collective power to provide better conditions of employment  and wages for its Unisa members. Earlier in 2010, a recognition and procedural agreement  was signed between Unisa management and the Academic  and Professional Staff Association (APSA). APSA represents  the interests of academic, non-academic, professional and  support staff in the UBF. Freedom of association In terms of the principle to uphold the freedom of association  and the effective recognition of the right to collective  bargaining, the library management has instituted monthly  meetings with unions. The purpose is to have continuous  dialogue on matters of interest to staff in the library and to  discuss any concerns and innovations to improve the working   UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 22 environment. The freedom of association of all library staff is  acknowledged and respected.  Non-discrimination The library upholds the elimination of discrimination in respect  of employment and occupation, and has performed well in  terms of the Library Employment Equity Plan: 2008–2010.   The targets set for this period were to  ll 90% of all vacancies  with candidates from designated groups and the library has  exceeded the target by 6.29%.  Services for students with disabilities are managed and  coordinated by the Advocacy and Resource Centre for  Students with Disabilities (ARCSWiD), which is located within  the portfolio of Student Affairs. ARCSWiD strives to provide a  range of services to accommodate and support students with  disabilities.  These services include the following:   Producing study material in alternative formats, for  example Braille, large print, electronic and audio tape    Facilitating support with regard to need in terms of  assignments, examinations and the curriculum   Providing sign language interpretation services for deaf  students   Providing training to staff in all regions on how best to  accommodate the needs of students with disabilities   Developing and implementing advocacy and awareness- raising programmes   Undertaking recruitment drives to encourage students  with disabilities to study through Unisa Furthermore, Unisa declared September Disability Awareness  Month. One of the objectives of Unisa 2015 Revisited is to  create an enabling environment for people with disabilities.   The challenges and concerns faced by disabled students and  staff will be taken into account in policy development, planning  and general practices, including infrastructural facilities. This  move towards an integrated strategy will contribute to the  elimination of discrimination and social exclusion experienced  by disabled staff and students. Community engagement In opening the 5th Unisa International String Competition  in January 2010, Prof Barney Pityana, Principal and Vice-  Chancellor, said that music is part of our human condition and it  comes naturally. People sing in times of pain and sorrow. If you  feel down, you sing a song that inspires and speaks to you, he  said. He spoke of the power of music. Orphaned children at the  Kingdom of Life Children Centre were treated to classical music  when some members of the 5th Unisa String Competition jury  visited one of the Unisa Music Foundation centres.  Unisa is involved in the development of music in the  communities. The Music Foundation is engaged in upliftment  programmes such as the loan of instruments, payment of  music examination fees,  nancial contribution to music  competition expenses,  nancing of performances of new  South African compositions,  nancial contribution to music  publications, etc. The Festival for the Youth in the Tshwane  Metro is an annual event under the patronage of the Princess  of Africa, Yvonne Chaka Chaka. This music festival aims to  explore and promote new talents in various music categories.   4.1.2 College contributions to social sustainability The college contributions are categorised according to the  teaching, research and community engagement activities that  have given expression to the UNGC principles in 2010. College of Science, Engineering and Technology   Prof M Setati, Dean: College of Science  Engineering and Technology Community engagement  One of the College of Science, Engineer- ing  and  Technologys  community  engagement projects, launched in 2009,  is the FIRST Lego (FLL) Project. This project aims to stimulate  childrens interest, creativity and problem-solving abilities in  science, technology and mathematics through engaging in  real-world projects. Learners from three schools sponsored by  the college were introduced to the real world of engineering  challenges. The college provided equipment and personnel  to mentor and guide team development to help the learners  reach the regional competition. Two teams competed in the  national First Lego League Championships. The theme of  the competition was transforming transportation and the  challenge was to explore how to change the way we look at  transportation.  Another project, MathsEdge, is a community engagement  project with the objective of creating awareness around  mathematics-related career opportunities. This academically  inspired initiative aims to stimulate the interest of high school  learners in mathematics and its applications. College of Human Sciences  Prof RMH Moekesti, Dean: College of  Human Sciences Teaching The  College  of  Human  Sciences  developed a new module as part  of a major in World Languages and  Literatures, entitled Cultural Diversity in Literary Contexts,  which strives to demonstrate, through a study of selected  literature from around the world, the potentially harmful  effects of prejudice and xenophobia.  Communication on Progress 2010  |  23 An MoU was signed with LOrientale Naples University to  promote academic and student exchange and access to the net- works of the Africa-Europe Group for Interdisciplinary Studies. Prof Anil Bhatti, New Delhi, delivered a public lecture and  presentation entitled Heterogeneity vs homogeneity: on the  tension between religious nationalism and secular/syncretic  positions and Monolingual and multilingual contexts of writing:  crossing borders and translating, as well as a workshop on  Writing (in) transit. A few modules in Religious Studies deal with the ambivalent  relationship between religion and human rights. The modules  help students to analyse instances in which religions have  violated human rights, but also show how religions have  inspired human rights. Some colleagues in the department  have published articles in this focus area. Research The workshop and conference that was held on Writing (in)  transit: theory and migration/migration of theory formed part  of an ongoing National Research Foundation (NRF) focus area  project entitled Locations of Literature in Global Contexts.  Reading and discussion sessions were held with postgraduate  and staff participating from Unisas departments of English,  Religious Studies, Classics and World Languages. These  included aspects of Portuguese, Italian, German and French  language and literature in African post-colony, aspects of  travelling theory and migration, cultural interfaces and the  politics of culture, language, literature and translation, and  the history of slavery, diaspora and post-slavery cultures and  subcultures. Visiting PhD student Marco Guadagnino from Naples  University presented his research on the communication  strategies of migrants. Visiting PhD student Annett Schulze  from the Cultural Studies Institute, Humboldt University, Berlin,  delivered a presentation on Unity in diversity: architecture of  cultural remembrance in post-apartheid South Africa. The Department of Religious Studies and Arabic is the only  department at a South African university that is conducting  specialist research work on the Horn of Africa. The 2009  publication, Somaliland: an African struggle for nationhood  and international recognition, contributes to the momentum  of good governance, global citizenship and human rights.  Prof Iqbal Jhazbhays text has been reviewed by four academics  and a Kenyan national newspaper.  Community engagement The Unisa Bright Site Project in Sunnyside is the pilot phase  of a strategic project in partnership with the Thomas Edison  State College, New Jersey, USA. It supports the vision of Unisa  to become an African University in the service of humanity.  It is also aligned with the mission to utilise the resources and  capacities of the University in mutually bene cial community  development initiatives. The project was launched and steered  by a dedicated team from the Department of Social Work. College of Law   Prof NL Mahao, Dean: College of Law Community engagement  The College of Law is involved in  ve  community engagement projects.   The Legal Aid Clinic: The primary purpose of this  project is to provide legal advice and assistance to the  indigent community, while at the same time teaching the  practice of law to law students.   The Street Law Programme: This programme  provides legal training by involving law students in legal  community workshops and in community service.   Victim Empowerment in collaboration with the  Bright Site at Sunnyside Project: This project aims  to identify and provide support to victims of crime by  facilitating referral to auxiliary support services, for example,  rape crisis, People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA), HIV/ Aids counselling and substance abuse counselling.   Research projects on crime prevention and  crime reduction strategies in collaboration with  the Bright Site at Sunnyside Project: This project  aims to encourage postgraduate students to conduct  research on crime prevention and crime reduction and  to develop strategies to assist the community in securing  their neighbourhood.   The Short Learning Programme in Refugee Law  and Humanitarian Support Project in collabor- ation with the Department of Social Work and  the Bright Site Project: This programme aims to  provide an integrated approach to the problem of human  migration and displacement from a legal, humanitarian  and psychological perspective. Furthermore, as part of its corporate social investment project  to establish close ties with a charity organisation, the College  of Law has reached out to the Jakaranda Childrens Home. This  home cares for 250 children between the ages of three and  18 years who have been placed there by the Childrens Court  due to neglect, abandonment, physical and mental abuse. The  college contributes gifts of food, clothes and stationery to  assist in improving the quality of life of these children.  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 24 College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences   Dr MJ Linington, Dean: College of  Agriculture and Environmental Sciences Community engagement  The Department of Geography in the  College of Agriculture and Environ- mental Sciences hosted a symposium  with the theme Back to the ABCDs: creating an enabling  environment for sustainable socio-economic development at  grassroots level through community-driven initiatives. ABCD is  an asset-based community-driven approach to development,  which moves away from conventional approaches to  community development that have often proved to be  unsuccessful. The ABCD approach is based on the premise  that communities should take the lead in identifying their own  problems and the solutions to these problems by utilising  existing resources. If properly accessed and channelled, these  resources will lead to sustainable development. Examples  of cases from around the world include Kenya and Ethiopia,  where citizen-led or community-driven developments have  had a signi cant impact.  In her opening address, Dr Maggi Linington, Executive Dean  of the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences,  said the theme of the symposium was close to Unisa and the  college, as it coincided with the Universitys vision to be the  African university in the service of humanity. She said Unisa  chose not to be a university that was viewed as an ivory tower,  but rather one that was relevant and responded to the needs  of society. She also indicated that environmental sciences were  very important in ensuring sustainability in communities and  the environment itself. The Mathopestat community in North  West has been selected as the pilot project of the ABCD  approach in South Africa. The project was initiated by the  Greater Rustenburg Community Foundation (GRCF). Unisas  Department of Geography joined forces with the GRCF as  part of its community engagement initiative. 4.2  ENVIRONMENTAL    SUSTAINABILITY According to the GRI, the environmental dimension of  sustainability concerns an organisations impacts on living  and non-living natural systems, including ecosystems, land,  air and water. Environmental indicators cover performance  related to inputs (for example, material, energy, water) and  outputs (for example, emissions, ef uents, waste). In addition,  they cover performance related to biodiversity, environmental  compliance and other relevant information, such as  environmental expenditure and the impacts of products and  services. The following broad criteria are linked to this category: 4.2.1 Institutional achievements Unisa is striving to align its operations and activities to  nationally  and  internationally  accepted  environmental  legislation.  Measures have been introduced to manage environmental  issues by doing the following:   Proactively addressing actions that could adversely affect  the environment   Selecting suppliers who strive to achieve similar environ- mental  precautions   Launching awareness campaigns in respect of responsible  energy consumption, the use of natural resources, waste  disposal management and pollution in all its forms   Creating an awareness about climate change   Minimising negative impacts on biodiversity   Encouraging the development of environmentally friendly  technologies  Communication on Progress 2010  |  25 Energy Wise Campaign Several initiatives were undertaken to ensure the Universitys  alignment to the environmental principles of the UNGC,  thus contributing to environmental sustainability. Prominent  among the initiatives is the Energy Wise Campaign, which  encourages taking energy-saving measures.  The main objectives of this campaign are the following:   Ensure effective and ef cient usage of energy at all Unisa  hubs.   Inculcate a culture of energy conservation at all Unisa  hubs.   Decrease the Universitys energy consumption at all the  hubs. The campaign was launched with the introduction of energy  barometers on the main campus, as well as the regional hubs.  The barometers were dubbed Unisas green gauge and  indicate the total monthly consumption of energy. Monthly  cartoon strips featuring energy-saving tips are published in  the monthly staff newsletter (Focus) and staff members are  encouraged to contribute as the part they play in contributing  towards global climate change. The following are some of the  cartoons depicted in staff newsletters: Gearing physical facilities towards energy savings Unisa has developed an energy management programme,  which aims to remove and reduce non-productive, wasteful  and inef cient electricity consumption from the system. Unisa  has already implemented or is in the process of implementing  the following measures on some of its campuses:   Non-essential air-conditioning units are switched off after  hours by means of a building management system.    Occupational sensors are being installed in all restrooms  in all buildings to assist in the reduction of electrical load  during normal workings hours. Occupational sensors are  also planned for some of the larger areas (for example,  computer rooms). When of ces are not occupied, the  lighting and heating or air-conditioning units in the area  are automatically switched off.    Lights in certain open areas on campus are switched off  daily at 20:00 and switched back on again at 06:00 in the  morning during weekdays.   With the planned installation of timing programs, all the  hydro boils (already functioning in two buildings), geysers  and hot-water systems will be controlled to reduce  electrical usage during peak tariff periods.    Speed controllers will be installed in the heating and  ventilation systems, which will reduce the electrical load  of the respective air handling units by about 10%. This is  already functioning in two buildings. Earth Hour The Earth Hour initiative is an initiative of the World Wildlife  Fund (WWF). It is a global call to action to every individual,  every business and every community throughout the world.  It is a call to stand up, to take responsibility, to get involved  and lead the way towards a sustainable future. Unisa takes  this responsibility seriously and supported Earth Hour 2010  by switching off all lights on the main campus between 20:30  and 21:30 on Saturday, 27 March 2010.  Through the use of electronic media, staff members and  students were encouraged to support  Earth Hour by switch- ing off their lights between the stipulated times.  World Environment Day The  theme  of  World  Environment  Day  (WED)  2010  was  Biodiversity  Ecosystems  Management  and the Green Economy.  This was to raise awareness  about the importance of the millions of species that inhabit  the earth that are becoming extinct at a very fast rate. To  celebrate World Environment Day, the College of Agriculture  and Environmental Studies took the initiative to create an  awareness of biodiversity loss and other critical environmental  issues. Unisa staff and students spent the day learning about  the importance of World Environment Day and ways to  conserve biodiversity. Environmentally friendly technologies In support of the development of environmentally friendly  technologies, the Unisa library has adopted an e-strategy.  The Library Operational Plan includes various goals with set  targets to ensure an awareness of the UNGC principles and  to facilitate the integration of these into the operations of all  the directorates. These goals include the librarys e-strategy  to promote online services and processes to replace paper-  based systems. This strategy was expanded in the Library  Operational Plan. Electronic collection developments, including  electronic selection and ordering processes, are implemented  to replace manual and paper-based systems. Other goals of  the librarys e-strategy include the digitisation of collections  and global access to these to enhance access and limit paper  copies, print and duplication. The implementation of mobile   UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 26 services (Airpac) facilitates paperless requests, renewals and  searches. Paper notices to students are replaced by a short  message service (SMS) system. The library plans the acquisition of shelf-ready material to limit  the use of paper-based accessioning materials and processes.   The library participated in the development of the of ce auto- mation project to move from manual processes to automated  processes. Within the targets of the goal, the principles are  integrated into operations in all the directorates.  The library has equipped its meeting rooms with overhead  projectors and screens to facilitate the projection of  documentation for meetings to limit printing by participants.  Documentation is also distributed electronically. Wireless  connections are also implemented in these rooms to enable  participants to use their laptops to access documents for  meetings and workshops. The library also made online request forms available for various  services and encouraged users to request information and  resources online instead of printing, posting or faxing requests.   In addition to all the electronic resources available to its users,  the library has developed an institutional repository with a  comprehensive collection of Unisas research and intellectual  output. The library also maintains the African Digital Library  and facilitates access to the collection for all residents on the  continent. The library has submitted a proposal to distribute informa- tion from the e-reserves with study materials to eliminate the  printing and additional posting of these resources. 4.2.2  College contributions towards environ-   mental sustainability College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences Community engagement  The College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences  initiated the Water from Inkungu Project. The word inkungu  means fog in Xhosa, the water quality of which is very high,  conforming to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and  South African quality standards for potable water. The fog  water harvesting project was launched in the Eastern Cape,  at Cabazane, in partnership with the Alfred Nzo Municipality.  The system used is specially designed for use in rural areas. It  is cost-effective, uses material that is readily available and is  suitable for use in areas without electricity.  College of Human Sciences   Teaching  The Department of Classics and World Languages has  developed a module in the Classical Studies major called  Perspectives on the Environment, in which students develop  the ability to understand, explore and critically evaluate positive  and negative aspects of the binary relationship between  humankind and nature from several angles, for instance,  the impact of human activities on the natural world, such as  agriculture, hunting and war, and – conversely – the impact  of powerfully disruptive natural forces on human life, such as  volcanic eruptions, and their potential for introducing renewal  in the wake of destruction. Research  A decision was taken by the Department of African Languages  to include a subtheme: Folklore and environmental challenges  (the promotion of environmental responsibility) in the call  for papers for the South African Folklore Society (SAFOS)  Conference held in September 2010, showing a commitment  to global environmental issues.  The department anticipated  a number of presentations in this area, which will eventually  feed back into the departments curriculum mix. 4.3 Economic sustainability  The economic dimension of sustainability concerns Unisas  impacts on the economic conditions of its stakeholders and  on economic systems at local, national and global levels. The  following broad criteria are linked to this category. 4.3.1 Institutional achievements Anti-corruption In support of the values of Unisa, Council issued a statement  that unethical, fraudulent, corrupt and irregular conduct is not  accepted by Unisa. On behalf of Unisa, KPMG is conducting  an Ethical Risk Assessment Survey at Unisa to ascertain  the ethical and integrity awareness of employees, and their  perceptions of the ethical conduct of others, as well as to  evaluate the effectiveness of Unisas existing ethics framework.  This initiative forms part of Unisas ongoing commitment to  enhance its corporate governance programmes and create  a positive ethical culture for all Unisa stakeholders. Unisa  has based its reporting on the institutions anti-corruption  commitment on the UNGCs Reporting Guidance on the 10th  Principle.2 Commitment and policy Unisa has committed itself to working against corruption  in all its forms, including bribery and extortion, by issuing  the following statement against fraud, corruption and  irregularities, and introducing the statement: The Council, as the governing body of Unisa, and  Unisas management, comprising the Principal and  Vice-Chancellor, the Pro Vice-Chancellor, the Registrar,  all vice-principals, all executive directors and executive  deans hereby declare that fraud/corruption and any kind  of irregularity involving dishonesty will not be tolerated.  2 http://www.unglobalcompact.org  Communication on Progress 2010  |  27 The statement was approved by Council in November 2007.  This statement can be viewed on the Unisa website under  policies and procedures at www.unisa.ac.za/ungc/. The following policies support this statement:   Unisa Code of Ethics and Conduct3   Policy on Prevention of Fraud/Corruption and other Ir- regularities4   The Unisa Ombudsman5   Policy on Whistle-blowing6   Procedures for Making a Protected Disclosure7   The Unisa Fraud/Corruption/Irregularity Response Protocol8 Commitment to compliance with all relevant laws All policies are reviewed for legal soundness by the Legal  Services Of ce (LSO) before being submitted to the  Unisa Management Committee and Council for approval.  A procedure for policies has been compiled by the LSO and  compliance is a requirement before a policy may be submitted  for approval. As part of this procedure, the LSO considers the  applicable and relevant laws. Publicly stated formal policy of zero tolerance of  corruption   Unisa has declared its intent for zero tolerance. Statement of support for international and  regional legal frameworks  Unisa is a signing party to the UNGC initiative. The Universitys  intention regarding the UNGC is included on Unisas website.  The Pro Vice-Chancellors Of ce arranges corruption awareness  seminars throughout the year, for example, the Seminar on the  World Drug Report and the seminar in conjunction with the  UN Of ce on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Report on Human  and Drug Traf cking. The University community is made aware  of Anti-Corruption Day (9 December) through the Universitys  internet communication, for example its e-news. Risk assessment of potential areas of corruption The Unisa Audit and Enterprise Risk Management Committee  (ERMC) is responsible for the oversight and governance of risk  management processes at the University. The Risk, Ethics and  Controls (REC) Committee is responsible for the operational  oversight and monitoring of risk management activities  and reports to the Management Committee and the Audit  Committee. The Enterprise Risk Management Directorate  (ERMD) is responsible for deploying risk management to all  departments in the University, as well as the facilitation of  risk assessment procedures. The Enterprise Risk Management  Policy has been approved by Council and may be viewed at  www.unisa.ac.za/cmsys/staff/contents/departments/corp_ policies/docs/EnterpriseRiskManagementPolicy_approved_ Council_29Nov06.pdf. The ERMD facilitates the assessment of the Universitys  strategic and operational risks, and is supported by the  Department Strategy, Planning and Quality Assurance  (DSPQA) to ensure that risk management is also considered  in the Universitys planning processes. The ERMD submits the strategic and operational risk  assessment to the REC Committee, Management Committee  and the Audit Committee for acceptance and approval. The  ERMD is currently in the process of facilitating functional and  departmental risk assessments and has undertaken this in  a number of areas, for example Human Resources, Finance,  University Estates and Protection Services. Detailed policies for high-risk areas of corruption The Universitys anti-corruption policies cover the main  and general areas of fraud, corruption and irregularities,  for example procurement, human resources, the misuse of  resources and some more speci c aspects related to the  education sector, for example, plagiarism. Policies are found  in the corporate manual on the web and hard copy  les are  provided to each head of department. Translation of the anti-corruption commitment  into actions Currently, the University has an awareness campaign on  ethical conduct and has launched the Unisa Code of Ethics and  Conduct. The aim of the campaign is to provide training to all  employees. Online resources are available for ethics awareness.  ICT assists by requesting online acknowledgement of the  Code of Ethics. In addition, the Internal Audit Department  sends electronic newsletters out on a quarterly basis on  aspects of fraud, corruption, irregularities and improvement  in internal controls, ethics.  Experienced speakers are invited to make presentations to  Unisas Directors and Executive Directors Forum on being  aware of and preventing fraud, corruption and irregularities.  Ethics awareness training has been provided to Council and  management. The Pro Vice-Chancellors Of ce organises  anti-corruption awareness seminars. Support by the organisations leadership for anti- corruption When addressing staff assemblies, the Vice-Chancellor  and Principal includes statements with regard to ethics and  indicates what controls are in place to support ethical conduct.  Decisions taken by the Management Committee and other  committees take ethics into consideration. It is also noted  that reference to the UNGC support is highlighted during  management discussions. 3 http://www.unisa.ac.za/ungc/Code%20of%20EthicsCCM_p.html 4–8 http://www.unisa.ac.za/ungc/corporate_p.html  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 28 Communication and training on the anti-corruption  commitment for all employees The Human Resources Department is currently driving the  ethics awareness and training campaign with the assistance of  the Department of Corporate Communication and Marketing.  The training involves familiarisation with the code and an  online self-evaluation of an understanding of the code. As  part of the code, any interest perceived to cause a con ict is  required to be declared on a prescribed form and submitted  to Human Resources. This is a recent initiative.  An ethical risk assessment is scheduled to be done by an  external service provider, and the Internal Audit Department is  facilitating the survey for report back to the REC Committee. The Internal Audit Department compiles quarterly newsletters  covering areas of fraud, corruption, controls and ethics.  Seminars on corruption information are presented through  the Pro Vice-Chancellors Of ce. Internal checks and balances to ensure consistency  with the anti-corruption commitment  Unisa policies are designed to comply with laws and regulations  where applicable and relevant. The adequacy of policies and  the extent to which they are adequate for internal control  purposes form part of the internal audit reviews. Internal  controls exist, for example business forms, signing powers,  and segregation of duties. The controls are reviewed as part  of planned and ad hoc internal audit assignments. As part of  the internal audit review, the managers of the respective areas  are requested to complete a control self-assessment. Controls  are automated as far as possible and reviewed as part of audit  reviews. Actions encouraging business partners to imple- ment anti-corruption commitments Unisas business partners consist of government, other  educational institutions, the public and private sector,  suppliers, students, agents, joint ventures and partnerships,  and funders/donors. Management responsibility and accountability for  implementation of the anti-corruption commit- ment or policy Responsibilities are assigned at Unisa according the statutory  requirements of the Higher Education Act. The Unisa statute  is one of the guiding documents, as well as all the  nancial  and other policies, for example, the Delegation of Powers  Policy, the Procurement Policy and academic policies. The con dential report prepared by the Internal Audit  Department (IAD) and submitted to the Audit and ERMC  is currently a reporting indicator used by management to  support responsibility and accountability for anti-corruption  commitment. Human resources procedures supporting the anti- corruption commitment or policy  Unisa has a bargaining forum where matters such as human  resources-related policies and remuneration negotiations  are submitted and considered. The acknowledged union  and management are represented on the bargaining forum.  Matters on which agreement is reached are referred for  further approval processes, for example the Human Resources  Committee of Council. If a dispute is declared, procedures are  in place to attend to such matters. In a new initiative, all employees are now trained on the Unisa  Code of Ethics and Conduct, and various training initiatives are  currently made available by HR. ICT assists in providing online  acknowledgement of the code. New recruits are introduced to  the code and the policies that support the code as mentioned  in the rest of the report are available in a corporate manual  on the web. Hard copies are also distributed to heads of  departments. The update to policies is communicated to  heads of department through e-mail and to other employees  through the e-news. Managers are also currently required to attend training on the  Disciplinary Code and processes. Communications (whistle-blowing) channels and  follow-up mechanisms for reporting concerns or  seeking advice  Unisa has a whistle-blowing line where whistle-blowers can  report alleged fraudulent/corrupt/irregular behaviour. The  reports can be made anonymously and are sent to the head  of the IAD for investigation. The reports received through the whistle-blowing line are  recorded in an investigations register and the status of the  investigations is tracked through to  nalisation and reporting.  Follow-up on completed investigations were previously done  by ERMC, but will be done by Internal Audit in future. The  register, together with a summary of signi cant investigations,  is submitted to the Unisa Audit and ERMC under separate  cover for con dential discussions during which the nature of  investigations, as well as results and actions, is discussed. The fraud/corruption/irregularity risks are reported to the  Unisa REC Committee, which reports to the MANCOM and  thereafter the Audit and ERMC. These identi ed risks are  taken into consideration when the strategic and operational  risks of the University are assessed by management. The main categories of whistle-blower reports that are  received through the hotline are as follows:   Permanent and temporary payroll  Communication on Progress 2010  |  29   Procurement in various areas   Human resources management-related matters, for ex- ample non-adherence to smoking regulations, harass- ment, racism, nepotism and favouritism   Misuse of University resources, for example reckless driv- ing and illegal internet usage Internal accounting and auditing procedures re- lated to anti-corruption  The University has various policies that provide for internal  control, for example the policies on the delegation of powers,  procurement, travel and accommodation, receipt of fees,  selection and appointment of employees, to name but a few.  The aforementioned policies are available in the corporate  manual on the University website. Some of these policies are  supported by approved procedures and prescribed forms, for  example the application for employment form. The revision of the policies and procedures and the  establishment and update of supportive processes are the  responsibility of the respective policy-owners, for example the  Finance, Human Resource (HR), ICT and other departments.  The compilation and update of policies are governed by a  policy and procedure as compiled by the Legal Services Of ce.  The policies are approved by the Unisa Council. Internal and external audits  External auditors are appointed to conduct the statutory  audit of the Universitys  nancial statements and this audit is  conducted on an interim and year-end basis. External auditors  are required to provide an audit opinion on the accuracy and  fairness of the  nancial statements in the  nal annual report  of the University. The external auditors may place reliance on  the internal audit work performed by the IAD. Internal audits are performed throughout the year according  to a three-year rolling internal audit coverage plan as approved  by the Audit and ERMC. Apart from the approved audits, ad  hoc audits and investigations are also performed by the IAD.  Investigations and audits are outsourced by the IAD. The IAD is a department that reports functionally to the Audit and  ERMC and administratively to the Vice-Chancellor and Principal.  The departments mandate is to provide an independent  and objective assurance service to add value and improve  the Universitys operations through a systematic, disciplined  approach in evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk  management, control and governance processes. The IADs  activities are governed by the International Internal Auditing  Standards and the approved charter and audit protocol. Participation in voluntary anti-corruption initiatives The University is a signing party to the UNGC. Unisa is a member of Ethics South Africa (ESA). The Pro Vice-Chancellors Of ce arranges seminars on anti- corruption, and presenters of the UN are invited to make  presentations. Monitoring Monitoring and improvement processes Monitoring and continuous improvement are undertaken  through the following:   Performance reviews   Quality reviews   Audit reviews Performance reviews are guided by human resources policies  and guidelines, and are performed twice a year, at interim and  year-end. The performance ratings are used to identify areas  for improvement, acknowledgement or corrective action. The  results of managements performance reviews are submitted  to MANCOM, The Human Resources Committee of Council  and Council. The performance agreements of managers  include the aspects of risk, ethics and control, and therefore  managers from the level of manager/supervisor and above  are assessed on their achievement of risk management,  communicating and upholding ethics, and the implementation  of controls in their respective areas of responsibility. In this way,  monitoring and improvement form part of the performance  management system.  In addition, quality reviews are done and facilitated by  DSPQA, and the results are used by managers to improve  on quality. Quality reviews are done as the need is identi ed  and occur throughout the year. Quality reviews are guided  by the Quality Assurance Policy and guidelines, the UNGC  commitment and HEQC guidelines, and are performed  according to the requirements of the Higher Education  Committee and Department of Education as well as  accreditation and professional requirements. The results of  the quality reviews are submitted to the MANCOM, Quality  Assurance Committees and Council.  Audit reviews are external and internal. External audits are  done at interim and  nancial year-end. Internal audits are  performed throughout the year according the approved  three-year rolling internal audit coverage plan and as ad hoc  requests are submitted or whistle-blower reports are received.  External and internal audit reviews are reported to the REC,  management and Audit and ERMC, with the  nal oversight  on risk, control and governance matters assigned to the Audit  and ERMC for report to the Council. The REC Committee and  the Audit and ERMC have approved terms of reference or  charters and meet four (4) times a year. The MANCOM meets  every Tuesday. Apart from these committees, there are other  speci c committees who meet according to the speci c terms  of reference and execute monitoring accordingly. Improvement  initiatives are assigned to the respective manager,s for example  the vice-principals, executive directors or directors, depending  on the level at which improvement is required.  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 30 Leadership review of monitoring and improve- ment results  The responsibility for monitoring and improvement resides  with the Vice-Chancellor and Principal and is supported by  the extended management. Governance overview is the  responsibility of the Council and its subcommittees. Reviews are done as explained elsewhere and are reported on  according to the respective aspects of reporting, for example  audit, risk, control and governance matters are reported to  the Audit and ERMC. Improvement plans and actions are the responsibility of the  respective portfolio managers, for example vice-principals,  executive directors, directors, managers, supervisors, and  are included in the planning processes of the University.  This is achieved by including the improvement plans in the  strategic, operational, portfolio and departmental plans,  and the managers translating these plans into their budgets  and performance agreements. Progress reports on the  achievement of the plans are submitted to DSPQA and  performance reviews measure whether the staff members  performances are on track. Dealing with incidents  Incidents are dealt with according to approved policies  and procedures. Employee-related matters are attended to  according to the Employee Disciplinary Code and procedures.  As part of the disciplinary procedures, an appeal process is  in place. The disciplinary proceedings are attended to by HR. If the appeals process provides the same result as the  disciplinary hearing, dissatis ed employees may take recourse  in the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration  (CCMA) or Labour Court. Externally referred labour relations  matters are attended to by Labour Services Of ce (LSO). Student-related incidents are dealt with according to the  Student Disciplinary Code and procedures and are attended  to by the Registrars of ce. Incidents related to dissatisfactory service at the University  are attended to by the Unisa Ombudsman. The Principal and Vice-Chancellor determines the nature of  public statements in relation to media or external incidents. If external incidents involve criminal activity and if negotiation  fails, the police service is used. Protection Services attends to  the external/campus-related incidents. Fraud/corruption/irregularity incidents are dealt internally  through the disciplinary processes and externally through  the police service and according to the requirements for  prosecution, for example the Prevention and Combat of  Corrupt Activities Act, 2004. Information on fraud/corruption/ irregularities is attended to by Internal Audit. Use of independent external assurance of anti- corruption programme  An external assurance of the anti-corruption programme in  Unisa has not been done, because it has only recently been  actively launched. The launch of the code of ethics  Communication on Progress 2010  |  31 5. FUTURE COMMITMENTS The institutional achievements listed in the 2009 Unisa/UNGC COP indicated that Unisa had achieved moderate success  in inculcating the UNGC principles into its most relevant activities. Based on the follow-up actions that were generated for  implementation in 2010, together with the GCSAT results, the following recommendations were put forward to management  for consideration: 5.1 Human rights Recommendation Actions Health and safety   Health and safety information and procedures should be made available to employees in a  language they understand.   At a minimum of every two years, and when assigned to new tasks, employees should receive  training by a knowledgeable expert in the safe use of equipment and processes, and an accu- rate record should be kept of who has been trained and for what tasks. Fair treatment   Managers should receive training on how to identify and deal with instances of harassment in  the workplace.   A procedure should be put in place stating which kinds of workplace monitoring are allowed,  what kind of personal employee information is retained, where it is stored, who has access and  why the information is necessary.   Employees should have access to all personal data collected about them, including data con- cerning disciplinary decisions and data obtained through monitoring, but excluding con dential  management-speci c information related to performance evaluations, salary negotiations, pro- motions, rotation and similar employment decisions. Community impacts   A procedure should be developed to assess and address the environmental and social impact  of its operations on the human rights of local communities.   Before starting new operations or developments, an impact study to assess the potential envi- ronmental and social impacts of the planned activities, including an assessment of their poten- tial human rights consequences for local inhabitants or other affected communities, should be  conducted.   Findings of the institutions social and environmental impact assessment studies should be  shared with the affected individuals in a form and language accessible to them.   In consultation with the affected individuals, the institution should develop appropriate man- agement plans to prevent, reduce and mitigate adverse social and environmental impacts.   The institution should continuously monitor its social and environmental impacts and provide  affected individuals with regular access to updated information about the social and environ- mental impacts of its operations. Suppliers   An assessment of the institutions supply chain should be conducted to identify which suppliers  have the greatest risk of human rights abuses.   Where necessary, the institution should collaborate with individual suppliers to implement con- tinuous improvements of human rights standards.   The institution should collaborate with other companies to promote improved human rights  standards in suppliers. Product stewardship NOTE: Unisa complies within a university context by looking at course content, modules,  programmes, disciplines, quali cations and how these translate into certain criteria and critical  learning incomes for the institution regarding human rights. There is a strong research focus on  human rights.  Country risks   Unisa should take into account the human rights conditions according to the government laws,  religious and cultural practices in the countries where it operates.  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 32 5.2 Labour Recommendation Actions Non-discrimination   All hiring managers should receive training regarding the institutions non-discrimination poli- cies. Suppliers   An assessment of the institutions supply chain should be done to identify which suppliers have  the greatest risk of abusive labour standards.   Procurement staff should be trained to understand labour standards and the supply chain.   The institution should engage with companies to implement fair labour standards.   The institution should collaborate with other companies to promote improved labour stand- ards in suppliers. 5.3 Environment Compliance and  management   The necessary environmental permits and authorisations to operate should be obtained from  the relevant authorities.   A systematic approach should be put in place to ensure knowledge of new environmental  legislation and compliance with permits and any other legal environmental requirements.   The institution should develop a formal environmental policy, approved by top management,  which includes a commitment to legal compliance and continuous improvements in  environmental performance.   Employees should be made aware of the environmental issues relevant to the institutions  operations and activities.   Roles and responsibilities with regard to environmental issues should be de ned and  communicated.   Employees involved in activities that have, or could have, adverse environmental impacts should  be regularly trained to ensure they are aware of environmental risks, requirements and agreed  procedures.   An action plan to improve environmental performance, which describes time frames,  responsibilities and means of obtaining the targeted improvements, should be developed.   Suf cient monitoring and documentation to demonstrate continuous improvements to the  institutions environmental performance regarding signi cant impacts should be in place.   The institution should regularly report externally on its environmental performance (eg  annually).   The institution should have an institution-wide environmental management system that is  certi ed according to eg ISO 14001 and/or operates in accordance with sector-speci c codes  and standards.   Commitment to promote the continuous improvement of the environmental performance of  the institutions suppliers should be in place.   This commitment should be supported by training on environmental performance for relevant  management and procurement staff.   An assessment of the institutions supply chain should be conducted to identify which suppliers  have the greatest environmental impacts.   Minimum requirements for the environmental performance of suppliers should be de ned and  communicated in writing to new and existing suppliers and business partners.   Where necessary, the institution should collaborate with individual suppliers to implement  continuous improvements to environmental performance.   The institutions procurement practices, such as prices, delivery times and internal incentive  structures, should encourage improved environmental performance of suppliers and business  partners.   There should be collaboration with other institutions to promote improved environmental  performance of suppliers.  Communication on Progress 2010  |  33 Responsibility and  performance   Targets for reducing water consumption and/or increasing the amount of water reused or  recycled in different business operations and activities should be developed.   The institution should engage with national, regional and local public authorities, and civil  society organisations to address water sustainability issues related to the affected water  resources.   Employees should be trained on the safe management of wastewater.   Wastewater discharges, including types, limit values and quantities of pollutants, should be  monitored.   Measures should be taken to reduce the production of waste and ensure responsible waste  management.    The institution should provide information and train employees on the safe handling, storage,  transport and disposal of hazardous and special waste types.   The institution should clearly mark areas used for the storage of waste and properly label all  containers for storing waste, including a relevant symbol of danger for hazardous waste.   Recycling and disposal receipts should be requested from transport contractors.   Legal requirements for levels of noise, odour, light and vibrations should be investigated and  relevant standards should be set.   An effective training and information programme should be developed to build awareness  among managers and staff in the affected areas.   A system should be introduced to monitor the levels of waste in the affected areas and  introduce mitigating actions.   An assessment tool should be introduced to evaluate the positive and negative impacts of  Unisas operations on the natural environment.   Areas used for storage of chemical substances and products should be clearly marked.   All chemical substances and products should be clearly marked to include the name of the  chemical and a relevant symbol of danger. 5.4 Anti-corruption Recommendation Actions Anti-corruption  environment   All potential areas of corruption, including factors such as type of transaction, countries of  operation, industries, and customers or business partners involved, should be evaluated.   Risk of corruption when employees, agents, intermediaries or consultants deal with public  of cials, including employees of state-owned companies, should be evaluated. Policy and procedures   The institution should de ne benchmarks and indicators regarding the institutions anti-corruption  actions, and initiatives should be de ned and reported to the public (ie in its COP).   Publishing legal cases regarding corruption should be considered.   Anti-corruption and/or ethical behaviour should be mentioned in contracts with partners in  high-risk countries, sectors and transactions. Third parties   Enquiries (eg  nancial, legal, labour, tax, IT, environment, and market/commercial) should be  conducted on all agents, intermediaries and consultants.   Contracts with agents, intermediaries and consultants should include a section on anti-corruption  and state that the contractholder must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.   Agents, intermediaries and consultants should be provided with information on the companys  anti-corruption commitment, anti-corruption policies, training material on anti-corrupt behaviour  and information on disciplinary procedures for violations of company anti-corruption policies. Joint actions   Joint actions with others should be taken to engage in and promote anti-corruption initiatives and  level the playing  eld.   Experiences, procedures and challenges of corruption should be shared with other organisations,  ie the local business community, sector initiatives, networks etc.   Joint initiatives should be initiated with other companies in the same sector for the purpose of  promoting a fair business environment.   Multi-stakeholder dialogue on challenges of corruption should be stimulated.   Local business community and business partners should be encouraged to initiate cooperation to   ght corruption.   The institution should consider the use of independent external assurance for its anti-corruption  programmes.  UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT REPORT 34 The COP Report highlights the achievements attained during  the period under review. The resulting recommendations  allow for improvements in Unisas operational and academic  dimensions. Strategy, governance, stakeholder involvement  and the mainstreaming of the UNGC principles in the  institutions academic offerings will contribute signi cantly to  further Unisas sustainability. 7.
