A Plan that confirms the Intesa Sanpaolo Groups commitment to promote the  sustainability of its economic performance, welfare and development. A commitment proved by  the many initiatives that have been accomplished to meet the demands of our stakeholders which  are brought together in this Social Report to encourage new initiatives to support the social side  of the economy. In particular, we continue to deem it important to focus the Group's attention on  households and businesses affected by reduced income, on the persistence of a high percentage  of unemployment and on the weakness of the upturning demand. We were able to overcome the tensions of the last three years by positioning ourselves among  the strongest banking groups on the international stage. A confirmation of the validity of our  organisational model and of the sustainability of the choices made which took into account the  needs of our stakeholders. The Group stood besides households in need, laid-off workers and enterprises through the launch  of its debt moratorium initiatives, by adhering to similar banking system initiatives and by signing  agreements to facilitate access to credit. The Group favoured immigrants and young people -  that is the most vulnerable social groups and largely excluded from access to credit, through  microfinance products to start up businesses, loans for workers on temporary contracts and  bridge loans for university students. As for men and women who work hard and achieve results, the Bank feels it has a strong duty  to carry out all necessary actions to ensure equal development opportunities. The simplification  of the assessment systems, the promotion of innovative training programmes accessible to all,  attention to gender issues, the establishment of a corporate welfare system designed to increase  the level of wellbeing in the company being but some examples. Attention to our customers, to the communities in which we operate and to our people, is the  essence of our way of banking. We want to be a responsible financial intermediary seeking  the most suitable answers to create collective value, being aware that only true innovation in  developing products, services and business activities can help reduce the impacts on society of  global phenomena such as climate change and the spread of social inequality. From this understanding are born the commitments we have undertaken with major international  organisations such as the Global Compact, an initiative launched by the United Nations to promote  environmental protection, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption, as well as the  LETTER TO THE STAKEHOLDERS    7 Giovanni Bazoli Andrea Beltratti Corrado Passera Equator Principles, guidelines based on the World Bank standards to assess and manage impacts  on the environment and communities in project financing. These principles are a reference point  when we face complex choices, when support for the economic and social development must  face the determined commitment to environmental protection and respect for human rights. We  are also committed to developing new products and services for energy efficiency and for the use  of renewable sources, because we believe in the importance of the affirmation of a development  model based on fairness and equality, which also includes access to resources. No less important is our on-going commitment to the community through initiatives of micro-credit  and social inclusion, carried out in partnership with local foundations and non-profit organisations.  Banca Prossima continued to operate through the Fund for the Development of Social Enterprise  to support types of entities that would otherwise have no access to credit. Furthermore, the awareness that art and culture are essential tools for understanding the processes  of social change and promote civil growth and social dialogue, guided us in launching a project to  make the Groups artistic heritage accessible to all. The new improvement objectives have become a fully fledged part of the new Business Plan  which the entire corporate organisation will face in the next three years to make our commitment  to creating value for all stakeholders real and measurable. The accomplishment of our objectives  will also be favoured by the new capital increase, which will enable us to provide even greater  autonomy from any external shocks and independence from any conditionings. This years Social Report is presented with a new graphic layout that makes the readers navigation  among the various channels easier: from the report itself to the Groups website, to which the Social  Report refers for additional insights and updates. Engaged as we are in a continuous listening  activity, this report falls fully within the ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders. Their suggestions  and criticisms have stimulated us to meet increasingly important and ambitious objectives.  8 The 2010 Social Report presents the most significant activities and projects undertaken with  the aim of meeting our stakeholders expectations and the improvement objectives announced  in 2009. Further details are available on the website V. INCLUSION OF STAKEHOLDERS AND MATERIALITY OF TOPICS In 2010 the stakeholders engagement activities were continued based on the methods of the AA1000SES  standard. Dialogue was strengthened with a higher number of stakeholders representatives than in the  past. Listening to their expectations and assessing their impact on corporate strategies allowed us  to draw up an improvement plan (incorporated into the strategies of the 2011-2013 Business Plan)  and identify issues of greatest importance that were included in this years Social Report (Materiality  analysis, p. 25 V). REPORTING PRINCIPLES The Social Report was drawn up in compliance with the GRI 3 (Global Reporting Initiative)  Sustainability Reporting guidelines, the most recent GRI Financial Services Sector Supplement  and with the guidelines for the preparation of Social Reports for the banking sector The Report  to Stakeholders. A Guide for Banks published by the ABI in collaboration with EconomEtica (the  Multi-University Centre for Economic Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility). Specifically,  for the generation and redistribution of economic value, we referred to ABIs publication dated 12  March 2010. We have adopted GRI principles for content selection (materiality, inclusiveness, the  sustainability context and completeness), reporting quality criteria definition (balance/neutrality,  comparability, accuracy, promptness, clarity and reliability) and for the reporting boundary. EXTERNAL CERTIFICATION This years Social Report has been reviewed – in compliance with the drafting principles reported  in this methodology section – by the independent auditors, Reconta Ernst & Young. The report  describing the activities carried out and their conclusions can be found on page 115 V.

The reporting  process is defined in special Guidelines for the preparation of the Social Report and related  management processes, which became corporate policy in 2009 V. MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS The indicators illustrated in the Social Report were identified on the basis of reference standard  indications, our obligations deriving from the adoption of international sustainability protocols and  from the commitment to ensuring that the path to achieving our objectives is measurable. Most of  the data was collected directly, except for certain estimates which are duly specified. To ensure  accuracy in the collection and uniformity in the interpretation of the required indicators, the data  measurement systems are now supported by a technical manual which, for the quantitative  indicators, formalises their relevance, the calculation methods and the data source. THE REPORTING PERIOD AND BOUNDARY The Social Report is published on an annual basis. The previous Report was published in July  2010. The data presented herein refer to 2010 and, where possible, are accompanied by data from  the previous two years for comparative purposes. The reporting boundary for the Social Report  includes active companies important for sustainability reporting purposes and which are included  in the 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements. The evaluation criteria adopted for the inclusion of  each Group company in the reporting boundary took into account the features of the companies  based on the social and environmental impacts generated, their contribution to the Consolidated  Financial Statements in terms of capital and profit and the number of employees. No significant  changes in the reporting boundary were recorded in 2010 compared to 2009. A summary of the 2010 Social Report is also published in the Report on Operations in the  Intesa Sanpaolo Group Consolidated Financial Statements (see pages 26-27 Stakeholder map  and pages 107-116 Social and environmental responsibility). In drawing up this summary, we  implemented the Guidelines issued by the Consiglio Nazionale dei Dottori Commercialisti e degli  Esperti Contabili (National Council of Chartered and Certified Accountants) published in March  2009 in light of changes introduced by Legislative Decree 32/2007. This edition of the Social Report is also available on the Internet V.  10.IDENTITY AND GOvERNANCE IDENTITY  AND GOvERNANCE    11 MISSION AND vALUES  INTEGRITY We pursue our goals with honesty, fairness and  responsibility in the full and true respect of the rules  and professional ethics and in the spirit of signed  agreements. EXCELLENCE We set ourselves the goal of continuous improvement,  farsightedness, anticipating challenges, cultivating  extensive creativity aimed at innovation; moreover we  recognise and reward merits. TRANSPARENCY We are committed to making transparency the basis of  our actions, advertising and contracts in order to allow  all our stakeholders to make independent and informed  decisions. RESPECT FOR SPECIFIC qUALITIES It is our intention to combine large-scale operations  with profound local roots and to be a bank with a broad  vision, without losing sight of individuals. EqUALITY We are committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination  from our conduct and to respect differences in sex,  age, race, religion, political and union persuasions,  language or disability. vALUES OF THE INDIvIDUAL The value of each single person is a guide for our  modus operandi: we use listening and dialogue as tools  for continuously improving our relationships with all our  stakeholders. RESPONSIBILITY IN THE USE OF RESOURCES We aim to use all our resources attentively, promote  behaviour based on the best use of resources and the  avoidance of waste and ostentation, and we give priority  to choices that take sustainability into account. We work to provide quality banking and financial services to our customers and activate ways to  promote development in all the areas where we operate. Conscious of the value of our activity in Italy and abroad, we promote a style of growth that is  attentive to sustainable results and the creation of a process based on the trust deriving from  customer and shareholder satisfaction, a sense of belonging on the part of our employees and  close monitoring of the needs of the community and the local area. We compete on the market with a sense of fair play and are ready to cooperate with other economic  entities, both private and public, whenever necessary to reinforce the overall capacity for growth of  the economies of the countries in which we operate. We take responsibility for prudent savings management, we undertake to widen the access to credit  and financial instruments to everyone, and the sustainable development of the entrepreneurial  system, being aware that our decisions have important impacts, direct and indirect, on the natural  environment and the community. We want to contribute to the wellbeing (not only material) of both  by sustaining and carrying out cultural projects and others that are for the common good. Our growth strategy aims at creating solid and sustainable values from economic and financial, social  and environmental points of view, built on the trust of all our stakeholders and based on our values. (from the Code of Ethics V)  12.IDENTITY AND GOvERNANCE STRATEGIES In a scenario which, after some extremely challenging years, sees the economy returning to levels of moderate growth, though still in a context of uncertainty and  market volatility, the new Business Plan confirms our strategy geared towards growth and the creation of sustainable value for all stakeholders with whom the Bank  has relations. We are aiming at strong, sustainable growth, centred on cost control and increased productivity, which remain the key factors of success in our industry.  A growth that stems from the constant and careful control of risks, a sound capital base and liquidity, which we intend to preserve as factors of a competitive edge also  through the capital increase, and which allow us to look ahead with confidence under the new Basel 3 rules which impose stricter requirements for all banks. Our identity, built on strong and shared values and marked by a responsible attitude, compels us to renew our commitment towards social and environmental  responsibility, in addition to setting earning objectives. Therefore we pursue our growth objectives with responsibility based on the following strategic lines: we are close to our customers, family and people through specialised service models focused on changing needs during all stages of life, innovating the    relationships and continually making our services and products simpler and more accessible; we support businesses, diversifying our business offerings based on their needs for growth, risk profile and life cycle, supporting sound business projects and    facilitating their growth, promoting the consolidation and internationalisation of enterprises, also paying attention to social and environmental sustainability  criteria; in all contexts in which we operate, we promote initiatives that strengthen the whole economic system, by supporting investments in infrastructures, innovation    and the third sector, under the principle of financial inclusion over the medium-term; we promote the development of our people through excellent training programmes both in terms of quantity and quality, continuously improving labour    relations, the working environment and communication, incentivising people through systems that are also linked to customer satisfaction; we continuously improve the quality of life in the company and the wellbeing of people, evolving and innovating the welfare system, strengthening efforts to    balance work and private life; we preserve the environment and we fight against the climate change by reducing the impacts from our activities by monitoring and improving energy efficiency    by offering green products and services and by driving our credit operations also based on environmental criteria. we continuously strengthen our ability to interpret the needs of the territories and to meet local expectations, including by strategically planning our initiatives    in the cultural area, considering them to be an essential part of our social responsibility, making the Groups rich architectural and artistic heritage accessible  and available throughout the territory. we foster access to culture and art for all, especially young people because we believe that art and culture are key to  understanding the dynamics of the evolution of society and that they are the foundations of social dialogue and the very meaning of citizenship.    13 The Intesa Sanpaolo Group is the leading banking group in Italy, with about 11.4 million customers  and 5,800 branches, and one of the top banking groups in Europe. It is the leading provider of in financial products and service to both households and businesses  in  Italy, notably of banking intermediation, pension funds, bancassurance, asset management  and factoring. Furthermore, with its strategic coverage of the territory through its local subsidiaries, the Group is  one of the largest banking groups in 13 countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and  North-Africa, where it serves 8.4 million customers through a network of over 1,700 branches: it is  the first bank in Serbia, second in Croatia and Slovakia, third in Albania, fifth in Egypt and Hungary,  sixth in Bosnia-Herzegovina and eighth in Slovenia.

The governance structure  complies with the Codes aims and indications to ensure effective and transparent appointment of  roles and responsibilities of the Group's bodies and a proper balance between strategic supervision,  control and management. Intesa Sanpaolo has adopted the dual management and control model,  based on the presence of a Supervisory Board and a Management Board. The system of corporate governance is fully illustrated in the Report on Corporate Governance  and Ownership Structures V. The Shareholders Meeting  is the body deemed to represent the will of all Shareholders and  its resolutions are binding on all shareholders, irrespective of their attendance or dissent. The  Shareholders Meeting is amongst other things expected to resolve upon the appointment and  dismissal of the Supervisory Board; the responsibilities of members of the Supervisory Board and,  without prejudice to concurrent duties of the Supervisory Board, of members of the Management  Board; the allocation of net income; the appointment and removal of independent auditors; the  approval of financial statements unless approved by the Supervisory Board; transactions reserved  by law to resolution of the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting. The Supervisory Board1 is appointed by the Shareholders Meeting and supervises the activities  entrusted to the Management Board. It approves the Financial statements and Consolidated  financial statements, examines the proposed allocation of the net income and expresses its  opinion to the Shareholders Meeting. As to its strategic supervisory role, the Supervisory Board,  on recommendations from the Management Board deliberates general, programme-related and  strategic guidelines; approves the business and/or financial plans and budgets; authorises strategic  transactions; approves strategic guidelines and risk management policies. All the members of the  Supervisory Board meet the independence requirement pursuant to the Consolidated Law on  Finance. The Law establishes that there be no self-employment, employment or other relations of  an economic or professional nature between the Board Member and the Bank as well as between  the Board Member and any subsidiaries, parent companies or companies subject to joint control. The Supervisory Board has set up six internal committees, three of which are specifically indicated  in the Articles of Association (Remuneration Committee, Nomination Committee and Control  Committee). The Management Board2, appointed by the Supervisory Board, is entrusted with the  management of the company in compliance with all general, programme-related, strategic  lines approved by the Supervisory Board; carries out all transactions considered useful or  The composition of the Supervisory Board along with short biographical and professional  1.  notes on its members is available on the Groups website V. The Groups website also provides the composition of the Management Board and the  2.  management and control roles of its members V.

In particular, but by no means exhaustively,  the Board has powers regarding the following areas, without prejudice, if any, to concurrent  competences of the Supervisory Board: structure, organisation and operation of the Board;  strategies and general guidelines of the Bank and the Group; structure and organisation of the  Bank and the Group; control and prudential supervision policies; financial reporting, financial  statements and relations with independent auditors; Shareholders Meetings and relations with  Bank shareholders. Of the nine members of the Management Board, six are executive Members: the Managing  Director in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer and five Members to whom are entrusted  duties related to corporate management and who work in specific Commissions with advisory  and investigational functions. The Management Board, on recommendation of the Supervisory Board, nominates among its  members the Managing Director who also holds the post of Chief Executive Officer and of  General Manager. The Managing Director is the Chief Executive Officer and supervises the  corporate management. He ensures the implementation of resolutions of the Management Board  and ensures that the organisational, administrative and accounting structure is adequate given the  nature and size of the Bank. The Management Board has also entrusted the Managing Director  with a specific responsibility on risk management and internal controls policies. The last audit carried out by the Management Board, in the light of facts and information provided  by Consob, has assessed the requirements of independence pursuant to the Consolidated Law  on Finance of two directors – Andrea Beltratti and Elio Catania – requirements regarding the  inexistence of administrative office held in Group companies or self-employment, established  employee or other relations of economic or professional nature with the company V. As regards remunerations, all members of the Supervisory Board receive compensations that are  defined for the entire period of office and are not based on financial instruments, nor on incentives  related to economic results. As for the remuneration of the members of the Management Board,  including the Managing Director, and of management, limitations are set based on a fair balance  of fixed and variable components and, for the latter, weighting systems for the risks are applied  as are evaluation mechanisms designed to ensure a connection to real and lasting results. To ensure the necessary overall unity for Groups governance, the structure of Intesa Sanpaolo  is divided into: six Business Units, Head Office Departments and Staff Units, most of which are  grouped into four areas of responsibility, reporting directly to the Managing Director and CEO V. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM The internal control system has been designed to  achieve constant identification, governance and control  of the risks involved in our activities. It is structured on  three levels: the first is represented by the line controls which are    carried out by the operating structures, are built in our  procedures and are part of back-office activities; the second is entrusted to the Chief Risk Officer and,    in addition to the legal area, includes controls on  risk management; compliance with standards; credit  granting process; internal validation; the third is the internal audit, carried out by the Internal    Audit Department, that operates independently  and separate from the operational departments, to  identify anomalous trends, violations of procedures  and regulations, and to assess the good order of the  overall. CONTROL OF SOCIAL AND ENvIRONMENTAL RISKS The Control Committee, reporting to the Supervisory  Board, also supervises social and environmental risks,  in accordance with the principles and values of the  Code of Ethics. It receives a regular report drawn up  by the Corporate Social Responsibility Unit – based  also on information gathered by the Internal Audit and  Compliance Departments – on the outcome of controls,  internal processes of adjustment by each corporate unit,  the management of corrective actions and anomalies  and non-compliances which are deemed to be serious.  16.IDENTITY AND GOvERNANCE OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY In 2010 we worked to make sustainability issues ever more linked to the lines governing the  conduct of corporate activities: optimisation of human resource skills, quality of products and  services to customers, creating economic and social value for the Bank and the communities  in which it operates. In particular, we have carefully monitored the quality of the relationship with our stakeholders  and the efficiency of our organisational processes that ensure continuity in the implementation  of the principles of the Code of Ethics. The results of these assessment activities, for which  we chose to make use of specialised consulting firms to ensure neutrality, were processed  through two information dashboards which were developed by applying internationally accepted  methodologies (Institute of Social and Ethical Accountability and Vigeo). In 2010, these tools were fully integrated in management activities providing the Bank management  with an overview of the degree of interaction between CSR and decision-making policies and  enabling a more systematic definition of the areas to be improved. With regard to the new adopted policies, the activities of the working group for the implementation  of the Equator Principles in organisational processes relating to project finance have been com- pleted. The Service Note that integrates these principles of the World Bank was issued on July  2010. The policy makes the social and environmental underlying criteria a compulsory step in the  financing decisions. Support to International Subsidiary Banks was also further extended to ensure proper  implementation of the policy governing funding and transactions to companies dealing in the  arms sector. To find a solution to the presence of different regulatory and operational standards,  in June 2010 rules governing the International Subsidiary Banks operations in the arms sector  were issued, which defined the management, reporting and control of arms sector operations. In  every bank a contact has been identified and placed in charge of monitoring the implementation  of the policy and submit a quarterly report with all information regarding the operations performed  in line with the principles of the policy.

The increase in the number of reports is due to increased sensitivity, as a result of targeted  training by the CSR Unit of employees who are committed to identifying reports that are related  to ethics, regardless of whether the reporting party has labelled the report as such.

To ensure the engagement be effective and strategic, we adopted AA1000 series of standards issued  by Account Ability V. Some significant elements that emerged from stakeholders listening and  dialogue are described below. For a comprehensive analysis, please refer to the publication on  stakeholder engagement V.  With regard to customers, the perception of the ease in talking with branch employees and on their  helpfulness and professionalism, is overall positive although a demand to further invest in the internal  organisational processes to improve the quality of the relationship, simplify the decision-making  powers, shortening response times, emerged. The perceived support on the issues of access to  credit and the promotion of local economies varies greatly among the customers interviewed. Firm  support was requested for the development of new enterprises and the introduction of a higher number  of factors for qualitative assessment on credit decision such as: the ability to be innovative, know- how, patents, business capacity, reliability and correctness of corporate management, compliance  with legal requirements and quality. Interviews with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) also showed the need for the Bank to gain  more knowledge and strengthen its ability to assess the social and environmental risks associated  with the businesses of customers operating in particularly sensitive industrial sectors, and that  such risks be properly evaluated in the funding choices. The interviewed NGOs believe that it is  not necessary to exclude from funding these sectors, but rather carry out solid assessments of  the impacts and require that companies equip themselves with the tools to prevent and mitigate  them. The views expressed by employees showed a significant improvement compared to 2008  on all the areas investigated, especially with regard to personnel recruitment and management  methods and to policies that facilitate the balance between personal and professional life, although  significant differences emerged between the outcomes of focus groups in Northern Italy, where  efforts made are appreciated, and Southern Italy, where many of the initiatives fostering a home- work balance are not yet begun. Of great importance is the issue of the definition of objective  and transparent incentive systems, a topic which is particularly felt by colleagues managing  customer relationships. Training was generally considered positive even if classroom training  was preferred over the online mode, more difficult to attend for those working in branches who  are in continuous contact with customers. In 2010 shareholders and suppliers were also involved.  Investors believe the issue of governance and excellence in personnel management to be strategic  for the strong correlation between employees' motivation and customer satisfaction.  The questionnaire to suppliers has shown that listening and dialogue should be strengthened to  foster a continuous improvement of the relationship with the Bank.

The Intesa Sanpaolo Group  closed 2010 with a net income of 2,705 million euro (- 3.6%). The downturn was essentially due to  lower operating income, which was impacted chiefly by the reduction of spreads and by financial  market volatility. The still unstable operating context, albeit with signs of improvement, confirms the  need for careful management of the Groups liquidity, solidity and risk profile. The Group continues  to maintain direct customer deposits that broadly cover the corresponding lending: over 70% of  funding derives from the retail segment and, therefore, is highly stable. The amounts of the balance  sheet aggregates confirmed the Groups sound financial position. Direct customer deposits stood  at 427 billion euro (+0.5% compared to the end of 2009), whilst loans to customers, despite the still  difficult macroeconomic environment, grew by almost 4 billion euro, exceeding 379 billion euro. In  terms of solidity, the regulatory ratios were suitable with a Core Tier 1 of 7.9%, Tier 1 of 9.4% and  a Total capital ratio of 13.2%. These values were at even higher levels due to the share capital  increase of 5 billion euro approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of 10 May 2011. CALCULATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ECONOMIC vALUE The economic value generated  was over 15 billion euro. This amount expresses the value of the  wealth produced, most of which is distributed among the various stakeholders. In particular: employees and financial advisors benefited from approximately 41%, for a total of 6.1 billion euro;   suppliers received approximately 20% of the economic value generated, for a total of 3 billion    euro in payment for goods and services; the government, organisations and institutions received 2 billion euro, around 13% of the    economic value generated and for the most part referring to income taxes for the year;  17 million euro was used to the benefit of the community, through the allocation of profits to    charities and as donations and gifts; approximately 7% of the economic value generated was allocated to shareholders and    minority interests, for a total of over 1.1 billion euro; the remaining 2.8 billion euro was withheld by the corporate system. This refers to prepaid    and deferred taxes, amortisation, provisions for risks and charges and retained earnings.  Self-financing is considered an investment that other stakeholder categories make each year  to maintain efficiency and allow development of the Bank as a whole. The figures and comments refer to the reclassified consolidated income statement published in the Intesa  1.  Sanpaolo 2010 Annual Report. Changes in annual percentages are calculated on 2009 figures, restated  on a consistent basis to take into account changes in the scope of consolidation. The amounts are  expressed in millions of euro. For further details or clarification, reference should be made to the Intesa  Sanpaolo 2010 consolidated financial statements V. The economic value generated is calculated in accordance with new ABI instructions issued in March  2.  2010, consistent with international reference standards. The calculation is made by reclassifying  consolidated income statement items recorded in the financial statements, as required under Bank of  Italy Regulation no. 262.

The whole Bank was involved in the project for simplification and the innovation of process and communications. Has  been set up a department dedicated to the quality of relations, that handles communication, complaints, development  of branch layouts, control of quality of service, remote channel management and customer satisfaction surveys. In  analysing quality, the SEIoK system allowed to monitor the service provided to customers that offer support to employees  who are in contact with customers both at the individual branch level and in the central offices.     Further innovated the Banks commercial offer to strengthen its social role: strengthening projects and services for access to credit for the most    disadvantaged groups; support for companies in development, innovation and internationalisation    plans;  taking part in large infrastructure projects.   To support families and SMEs facing critical situations (financial crises, natural disasters), the Bank - in agreements with  associations and organisations – suspended or rescheduled mortgage and loan payments; offered products and services  in support of workers who have been laid off, young people and immigrants; allocated several billion euro to businesses  to help them overcome the economic crisis. To promote innovation, research and development to production companies,  the Banks offer was expanded with innovative support, consultancy, financing and equity services. New infrastructure  projects were financed in Italy and abroad.     Involved and listened to employees emphasising their skills and ensuring  opportunities for growth: enhancement of employees skills by introducing assessment systems    that promote career guidance; improve the quality of life in the Company;    listening and involving people to foster a proactive attitude.    New assessment systems place greater emphasis on key behaviours in activities that are carried out. Initiatives have been  implemented in the integrated corporate welfare programme, including the establishment of the new Unified Group Health  Fund open to employees, their families and pensioners. Among the highlights of listening and involvement are the climate  surveys, sharing projects and objectives in the Company-Trade Union Joint Committees, and training on the sharing of best  practices and fostering the development of employees contributions.     Further developed environmental initiatives to provide a decisive  contribution in the fight against climate change: interventions to reduce the ecological footprint and assess criteria for    safeguarding biodiversity; supporting customers in pursuing the fight against climate change by    offering products for adopting renewable energy;  strengthening processes and services to identify risks and opportunities    arising from customers and suppliers attention to social and  environmental issues. UNI ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System was integrated with the EN16001 Energy Management System.  Management and energy efficiency measures, energy supply from renewable sources (in Italy, over 92% of electricity  consumption) have led to a reduction of 26.5% in CO2 emissions on electricity and heat consumption. The offer for financing and  consulting services for investments in energy from renewable sources, energy efficiency and the environment was extended.  the monitoring of social and environmental criteria on lending decisions relating to project financing were strengthened: in 2010  the projects screened numbered 84. Protected the value of long-term profitability and safeguarded it by  strengthening the fundamental bases for the Groups sustainable growth. In 2010 the consolidated net income was 2,705 million euro. The regulatory ratios confirm the solidity of the Group with a Core  Tier 1 of 7.9%, Tier 1 of 9.4% and a Total capital ratio of 13.2%, reflecting the positive outcome of the capital strengthening  enacted in the year. The average economic value generated was over 15 billion euro. The average dividend yield was 3.23%  for ordinary shares and 4.63% for savings shares.    25 MATERIALITY ANALYSIS The 2010 Social Report focuses concentrates on the  issues that are of greatest interest and relevance to  our core business and the Group's stakeholders. The  process of identifying material issues, that is to say the  risks and opportunities that are most relevant to the Bank,  was based on principles set out in the leading standards  of reference: the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 3)  guidelines and the Accountability AA1000APS standard. The starting points for this analysis were the Groups  mission, values and improvement objectives as reported  in the last Social Report, and business strategies set out  in the 2011 - 2013 Business Plan. This analysis was paired  with a careful study of the issues that emerged from the  activities of stakeholder engagement in recent years and  the continuous monitoring of the main sustainability trends  in the financial sector V. The issues covered in each section are taken from this  analysis which, for the first time in this Social Report, led  us to focus on a small number of issues deemed to be of  great importance, yet reserving adequate space for other  issues on other information sources (Website, specific  publications, etc.). The materiality matrix lists the positioning of the issues  both with respect to the relevance and priority given  by the stakeholders on our process of stakeholder  engagement and the level of priority for the Group, also  defined as possible financial or reputational impacts on  the Bank. Issues having a high value on both axes are  those on which the Group will focus mainly its attention  in the next three years.

With this aim a number of initiatives and agreements have been implemented to  provide concrete support to workers and their families, the local economy and entrepreneurs,  confirming the Banks vocation towards local service.  Crises loosen the bonds of solidarity leading to increased exclusion, especially of the weaker  segments of the population. One of the most important elements to counter the loss of social  cohesion is financial inclusion and in this area, Intesa Sanpaolo has further increased its  commitment. Improving the quality of customer relations was the core element that characterised activities  during the year. Listening, simplicity, clarity and continuous monitoring of quality have been the  principles that have allowed us to extend our consultancy role, fostering mutual understanding  between customers and the local units.  With regard to companies of any category, the emphasis has been placed on the role of the Bank  in re-launching competitiveness. With this aim in mind, we organised dozens of meetings with local  entrepreneurs, their associations and local institutions to foster growth in size, internationalisation  and innovation. To support enterprises in reaching these objectives, the Bank has expanded its  offer with innovative support, consulting, financing and equity services. To facilitate access to  credit, strong synergies have been initiated - including through numerous agreements - with the  authorities and associations operating in the territory. For companies experiencing problems, yet  having the ability to re-launch themselves on the market, anti-cyclical evaluation mechanisms  have been introduced to enable them to overcome the phase of economic downturn and fully  exploit the economic upturn. Finally, the Bank continued to support the Public Administration and  the implementation of both major strategic works and public utility infrastructures.    27 BEING CLOSE TO FAMILIES Increasingly more families are struggling to pay their bills and make it to the end of the month. This  alarming situation, which is indicative of an economic crisis that has continued to affect people,  families and communities, has called for our commitment to provide innovative financial solutions,  and make the repayment conditions for holders of mortgages and personal loans less difficult.  Particular attention has been paid to interventions in support of debt sustainability for customers  who are most vulnerable to income reduction or the loss of employment.  Our adherence to the Family Plan, an initiative sponsored by ABI and the basis of an agreement with the  main Consumer Associations, was on-going. The initiative provides for the possibility of suspending the  payment of mortgage instalments on the main house in the face of events that significantly affect the ability  to repay. Events such as job loss, being laid off, the death of the subscriber or the loss of self-sufficiency.  Over 6,400 applications were accepted during the year. With the aim of being close to families for needs associated with the purchase of a house, we  have joined the initiative, promoted and managed by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, Acri and Abi, by  underwriting shares in the Fondo Investimenti per lAbitare (Investment Fund for Living) for a  total of 250 million euro. The Fund is active on a national level investing in local initiatives to build  affordable houses. Another initiative in support of families was the adhesion to the agreement with the Department  for Family Policies which includes the provision of funding for families with new-born or adopted  children in 2009, 2010 and 2011. For families of children born or adopted in 2009 who are affected  by rare diseases, the agreement provides for the payment of contributions on loans. A total of over  3,900 loans were disbursed for over 19 million euro. Our International Subsidiary Banks have also been very active in supporting families. Among  the numerous initiatives, Banka Bosna i Hercegovina has activated subsidised credit lines for  low-income families and pensioners: about 1,800 loans were disbursed for over 4.1 million euro.  The Slovak Bank VUB has taken part in programmes of national aid for citizens having lost  their jobs because of the crisis by suspending mortgage instalments during the unemployment  period, postponing the instalment credits and by introducing new forms of consumer credit at  very favourable rates for young spouses.  NATURAL DISASTERS 2010 was a year marked by natural disasters that severely  afflicted the communities in which Intesa Sanpaolo is  active. In support of the people affected by the flood in  the Veneto region, we immediately provided financing to  offset the damages caused by the bad weather: families  were granted loans for about 850,000 euro while small  businesses were granted a moratorium on their debts. In  the municipalities of Abruzzo affected by the April 2009  earthquake, the Bank extended its suspension of loan  instalment payments by small businesses.  International Subsidiary Banks were also active in  support of the communities affected by natural disasters.  In particular, in Slovakia, where extensive damage was  caused by floods (981 towns were flooded and thousands  of people were forced to leave their home), VUB suspended  or reduced mortgage rates and consumer loans at no  charge and donated over 53,000 euro to humanitarian  organisations that brought aid to the population.  In Hungary, in October 2010 in the province of Veszprm,  many families suffered extensive damage to their homes  due to flood waters and red mud in the aftermath of the  accident at the aluminium factory in Ajka. Following this, CIB cancelled the mortgages on those  homes that had been completely destroyed and decided  to grant a two-year moratorium on the payment of the  instalments for homes that were damaged and on all  existing loans to customers (individuals and small  business) resident in the three cities affected by the  disaster. CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT SHAREHOLDERS SUPPLIERS  28.SOCIAL REPORT—CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL INCLUSION There are about 8 million people in Italy who do not have access to financial services: about 16%  of the population, against the euro zone average of 7%1. The most vulnerable social groups are  those who do not have an on-going income, for example young people and immigrants, for whom  non access to banks is often paired with social exclusion. Expanding access to our services with  products tailored to the needs of these citizens is a bet on the future to offer a large number of people  the opportunity to accomplish their projects and ensure the sustainability of our business over time.  The Bank's commercial offer and services have long taken these assumptions into account. For young people, we have developed a new mortgage and loan, also aimed at temporary workers,  a current account free of charge and investment solutions to plan their future. Bridge V, has been  available since 2003 - a loan for university students and researchers which offers them greater  financial independence: it is a bridge that brings university students closer to the work environment  and requires no collateral; access is based on educational merit. Financing granted to date have  exceeded 41 million euro. The products we currently offer to foreign customers are the same as those for our Italian customers,  except for the GetMoney to Family remittance services that allow sending money to 18 countries  through specific agreements with banks and financial institutions in the countries of the main ethnic  groups residing in Italy. Statistics2 register over 4 million foreign living in Italy. 78% of migrants  often send remittances to their country of origin through unconventional channels that may be  subject to illegal activities. With the GetMoney to Family service – which ensures transparency  and certainty in timing and costs, which are pre-set for all payments (from transfer to banking the  money) – approximately 37 million euro (0.6% of remittances sent from Italy) were made through  Intesa Sanpaolo.  Our collaboration with ABI and Cespi on the project sponsored by the World Bank to monitor global  costs of migrant remittances, continued in 2010. The project website V provides comparative  information on the methods and costs of sending remittances. The Groups International Subsidiary Banks have also continued to support the population groups in  difficulty, fostering the development of micro enterprises. Banca Intesa Russia financed the start-up  of micro-enterprises with nearly 92 million euro. To support the working population that lives below  the poverty line, the Egyptian AlexBank has disbursed more than 23 million euro in micro-financing.  Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Romania on the other hand addresses farmers with start-up financing and  credit lines to cover current expenses. In all, the Bank has disbursed over 18.5 million euro. Banca  Intesa Beograd promotes the development of female self-employment for the Vojvodina autonomous  province in Serbia V. The International Subsidiary Banks Division continued to work with ALDA (Association of Local  Democracy Agency) on creating social projects in the Balkans, with particular attention to the  development of new and small businesses and opportunities for young entrepreneurs. In 2010,  20 projects were funded for a total of 1 million euro. PROjECT ANTICIPAZIONE SOCIALE  FOR LAID OFF wORKERS In 2010, Italian companies made use of 397 million  hours of extraordinary and temporary layoffs (against  242 million in 2009)3. This grim sign of crisis has a strong  impact on employees who, when a company enters a  crisis period, only begin to receive layoff compensation  5/6 months after they apply. For workers who do not  receive advances from their employer, Intesa Sanpaolo  promoted the Anticipazione Sociale project to make  credit available in monthly instalments proportionate to  the amount of unemployment benefit due to workers. The  loan is repaid when the delayed benefits are received  from the INPS (Italys social security agency). Workers  do not incur any expenses and the interest accrued is  paid by the project partners. The project, initially tested in the Lombardy Region, has  now become available throughout the Intesa Sanpaolo  network: 5,140 households have received approximately  24 million euro in financial support.

NOTE     29 THE qUALITY OF RELATIONSHIPS FOSTER PURCHASE AwARENESS   The commitment to promote a greater knowledge of financial tools is essential to simplify customer  relations, provide an additional protection tool - which allows customers to use the banking and  financial services in a conscious manner that is appropriate to their needs - and help the Bank to  develop products and services more tailored to the real needs of customers. Italy ranks at the bottom  of the lists of financial literacy: a recent survey by ABI (Italian Banking Association) notes that over  70% of savers feel highly inadequate in matters related to financial decisions1. For this reason, we  have partnered with the Osservatorio Permanente Giovani Editori V Permanent Observatory Youth  and Media to implement a financial education course for young people aged 14-18 attending  secondary schools. The project involves ten hours of lessons on the subject to allow students  to develop greater awareness in handling choices regarding their future and therefore become  more responsible citizens. To date (school year 2010/2011) the Cultura finanziaria a scuola: per  prepararsi a scegliere (Financial culture at school: get ready to make choices) project has involved  over 112,000 students and almost 2,900 teachers from Italian secondary schools. Support to financial education initiatives promoted by the Consorzio Patti Chiari through educational  programmes aimed at primary, secondary and higher school students continued. The 2010  PattiChiari con l'economia edition saw the involvement of three of the Groups banks: Cassa  di Risparmio del Veneto, Cassa di Risparmio di Venezia and Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna. In  particular, Cassa di Risparmio del Veneto was tutor Bank of the class that won the Patti Chiari  Develop your business idea national competition. Training sessions are also organised in the social security field for employees of companies that  enter into collective agreements with Intesa Sanpaolo Previdenza. In addition to enabling the  presentation of the open pension fund, these meetings devote much time to the rules of operation  and performance of public pension schemes and supplementary pension system to create  awareness about the benefits, constraints and performance expectations that characterise this  choice. To cite some examples, such training sessions were organised at Microsoft, Ing Direct,  Mediaworld, as well as at associations such as Acli, Compagnia delle Opere and Associazione  Ricerca sul Cancro. PROGETTO RISPARMIO AND THE INvESTMENT  CONSULTING MODEL Progetto Risparmio, launched in recent years, has been  imbued by the logic of protecting the customers savings  and involved a comprehensive review of the offer and a  gradual evolution of the investment advisory service.  Progetto Risparmio set three goals: help customers  become aware of their financial profiles and needs; support  them in the allocation of assets in line with their needs and  investment objectives; offer them a customised investment  proposal, choosing the most appropriate portfolio together.  In 2010, significant progresses were also made through the  improvement of the customer segmentation and profiling  processes, starting from a highly detailed questionnaire.  The questionnaire, which helps understand the customer  risk profile, has been broadened with questions that better  target investment objectives and enable to gain a better  understanding of their time horizon. Internal control mechanisms have been identified to create  a process of product and investment tools development  based on the needs expressed by customers during the  periodical profiling.  The evolution of the offer range was consistently oriented  following the principle of developing products tailored to  the needs of the customer. For young people in particular,  Intesa Sanpaolo focused on innovative products that are  distinguished. 1. ABI (2009) Banche e inclusione finanziaria, Bancaria Editrice. NOTE   30.SOCIAL REPORT—CUSTOMERS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURvEYS Gaining customer trust, knowing their level of satisfaction, expectations and needs is key  to our business. With this in mind, in 2010 some 280,000 interviews were carried out  with customers who entered our branches which allowed us to measure the perceived  quality in branches. The outcomes of the surveys were included in the incentive system  of employees working in the branches and, together with the outcomes of the analysis of  the quality provided, contributed to determining 5% of the variable remuneration. In addition to these, benchmark surveys were undertaken to gauge our customer  satisfaction against our competitors and the entire banking system, to identify strong  points and any critical issues. These surveys formed the basis for our improvement plans. INDIvIDUAL CUSTOMERS IN ITALY  Even in 2010 opinions regarding branch staff remain positive (in line with our competitors and  an increase against 2009).  Compared to 2009, satisfaction regarding ATM and Internet Banking  channels, also rose, in line with industry trends. On the upturn was the level of satisfaction regarding  investments, although it remains slightly lower than the rest of the banking system. Finally, the  outcomes show a decline in opinions relating to financing and loans (data in line with the industry).  This data confirms that, in the face of a crisis that is not yet over, confidence in the banking system  remains low.  SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN ITALY Opinions for each area subject to surveys have improved compared to the previous year, with a  growth above the industry average. In 2010, there is substantial alignment with the industry in  the areas of branch staff and short and long term financing. Still critical areas regarding remote  channels (Internet, remote banking), Pos, collection and payment services and in the branch  office environment remain. In contrast to individual customers, there is a significant increase in satisfaction regarding the  credit area (higher than the industry), which is proof of the high attention paid by our Bank to  small Italian companies. SEIok qUALITY PROjECT SEIok is the quality management system of processes  which aims to constantly improve customer service.  The Intesa Sanpaolo System of Excellence provides  for developments in different operational sectors for the  2010-2012 period.  The first step is defining the regulatory service processes  and standards at branches and the central offices, followed  by quality analysis of the provided service through the  monitoring of specific indicators. The perceived service  is also analysed through targeted customer satisfaction  surveys.  This activity is flanked by listening to our customers and  the analysis and handling of their complaints. Employees  are heavily involved through periodic surveys, polls and  forums. To facilitate monitoring and focus on the most critical  issues to be tackled first, a true quality dashboard of  specific indicators was created to monitor the progress of  all the items that make up the quality index. The goal of Qualit SEIok is to achieve innovation and  continuous improvement to allow the Bank to progressively  aim at excellence and compliance with Total Quality  Management standards.    31 MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESSES  In 2010 a customer satisfaction survey on Italian medium-sized business was carried out to  understand their perception of the relation with the Bank and analyse the levels of satisfaction,  trust and loyalty towards the contacts and the products and services offered. The outcome of  the survey, which involved strategic contacts from around 1,600 customer companies, was  that 75% of customers are satisfied or completely satisfied; the level of overall satisfaction is  medium-high, equal to 7.3 (on a scale of 1 to 10); one of the main strong points is the ability to  listen and understand customer needs, accredited to our contacts; process efficiency in service  delivery is perceived at a lower level.  The survey showed a consolidated relationship with our Bank centred on the commercial  aspects; also important is the percentage of those who have a strategic partnership with the  Intesa Sanpaolo Group and who are looking for quality consulting skills, particularly with regard  to the most advanced products. On the basis of the findings, specific working groups were  introduced to define targeted action plans. Following the survey outcomes, further structured  surveys will be carried out on the various classes of customers to further enhance interactive  and continuous listening.  INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARY BANKS' CUSTOMERS  Listening 100%, the International subsidiary banks programme launched in the last years, has  further enhanced its surveys. Aimed at systematically measuring their customers satisfaction  and identifying any areas of dissatisfaction, telephone interviews continued to be carried out with  representative samples from the individual and SME segments. A benchmark survey is also  carried out every year. The survey measuring the satisfaction of individual customers who use the  Internet Banking service was also continued.  The monitoring system has been adopted by 9 of the Groups 11 International Subsidiary Banks  with a total of about 106,000 interviews.  The data collected in January 2011 on a representative sample of individual customers show  a general improvement in satisfaction across the different banks involved in the survey, albeit  with varying sizes and characteristics from country to country; this improvement should also be  read in light of the leadership gains in customer satisfaction in many of the countries where the  Group's Subsidiary Banks operate. Most banks, in order to support the improvement in satisfaction and the centrality of a customer  culture based on actions and results, decided to include customer satisfaction indicators into  their marketing plans and incentive remuneration systems.

In 2010 the process of organisational  consolidation of the management of reports and complaints with regard to the entire network of  branches of the Group in Italy was completed. This allowed us to address in an effective and timely  manner the commitments arising from recent regulatory innovations affecting this area, including  the launch of the Arbitro Bancario Finanziario and the coming into effect of the new requirements  for intermediaries to respond to customers complaints (excluding those related to investment)  within 30 days. In 2010 the average time for handling complaints, relating to both financial products  and services and investment products, was reduced. With regard to complaints received from customers in Italy: Investments   complaints regarding investment services registered a noticeable decline, which can be  attributed to the absence of strong critical issues and the virtual disappearance of critical issues  tied to the Lehman Brothers default; current accounts, loans, customer information and requests for documentation.   associated to a slight overall decrease in complaints, some of the issues that had already  emerged in 2009 concerning credits re-surfaced, such as debt portability and renegotiation,  cancellation of mortgage guarantees and, more broadly, credit lines, also with reference to the  change in the fees started in 2009; Payment cards   complaints related to cases of the reversal of debit card transactions also remained in line  with 2009. As regards the International Subsidiary Banks, the importance of listening to customers and  the Bank commitment on this front were re-affirmed in 2010, through sharing the guidelines  for the communication campaign focused on the message Some suggestions make us grow:  yours.

This, in a nutshell,  is the analysis of the Osservatorio Nazionale dei distretti italiani1 that shows the first signs  of recovery after a 2009 marked by the deep crisis in all productive sectors. Intesa Sanpaolo  continued to initiate many important support initiatives, aware that banks can play a key role in  promoting the acceleration of recovery from the crisis. With regard to micro, small and medium companies, Intesa Sanpaolo adhered to a joint notice  undersigned by ABI (Italian Banking Association), Italian Government and business associations  for the suspension of SMEs debts owed to the credit system. With an independent initiative,  Intesa Sanpaolo decided to extend the benefits of the joint notice to freelance professionals, a  category excluded from the public moratorium. Short and medium-long term credit transactions  being suspended numbered over 53,600, for a postponed debt equal to around 2,500 million  euro. For freelance professionals, the number of suspensions was 312 (the initiative started in  March 2010), for a postponed debt amounting to 3.8 million euro. In 2010 the Bank continued to work dynamically acting as a bridge with the entities that can  facilitate access to credit. Of special relevance among these: Confidi - for which, in addition to  ordinary management and the renewal of the agreements, a portal to automate reporting and  provide online services has been activated.  Since the undersizing of SMEs limits innovation, the Bank has been heavily involved in  promoting processes of aggregation and growth in size. With this view, Intesa Sanpaolo shared  with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Italian Banking Association, Confindustria,  Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, Unicredit and Monte dei Paschi di Siena Bank, a project to create  a financial support tool for SMEs with the subscription of shares in the Fondo Italiano di  Investimento for a total of 250 million euro. The initial amount of the fund was 1.2 billion euro.  The fund potentially addresses the approximately 15,000 Italian SMEs and will pursue the goal  of fostering capitalisation and encouraging aggregation processes in order to stimulate the  creation of larger size companies able to strengthen their competitiveness. AGREEMENTS FOR GROwING TOGETHER  wITH SMALL COMPANIES As part of the national agreement Growing together  with small companies, signed in July 2009 by Intesa  Sanpaolo and Confindustria, in February 2010, the Bank  re-established the plafond of 5 billion euro for small SMEs  in Italy, which follows the almost 2 billion euro of the  previous tranche. In September, Intesa Sanpaolo and Confindustria Piccola  Industria signed a new agreement which confirms  and extends the anti-crisis measures already taken to  address major emergencies brought about by the crisis,  such as an additional credit line for the management of  outstanding bills, lengthening the short-term deadlines to  270 days, programmes to recapitalise and postponement  of the payment of mortgages and leasing instalments.  Through this agreement, which provided the allocation of  a 10 billion euro plafond, over 50,000 applications were  accepted. A further 10 billion euro plafond was allocated to operations  and investments in three strategic areas, identified by  the Bank and Confindustria Piccola Industria, to boost  the competitiveness of Italian companies: growth in size,  innovation and internationalisation. Overall, 5.5 billion euro were made available to production  companies through other important agreements: with  Confesercenti, to support companies active in the trade,  tourism and services industry; with CreditAgri Coldiretti, to  enhance growth and development of agricultural and food  companies; with Confcommercio, to foster programmes  to recapitalise associated companies. 1.

NOTE   34.SOCIAL REPORT—CUSTOMERS PROMOTING INNOvATION Intesa Sanpaolo has always supported the development programmes of the most dynamic  companies, providing assistance, advice and financing through dedicated structures. Technological  innovation is an important tool to compete and make the best of new growth opportunities, especially  in a market that changes quickly and where companies must innovate to stay competitive. Standing  out in the offer is Nova+, a specific line of funding earmarked to support business research and  development projects as well as organic investment plans aimed at enriching the technological  content of their products, processes and services. The specialised structures of Mediocredito  Italiano, in collaboration with some of the most authoritative Italian universities, perform technical  and market analysis of the projects submitted, which complement and support the standard credit  analysis. This process helps to enhance the relationship between banks, companies, universities  and research centres by facilitating the development of relations between the technical and scientific  researchers and businesses, thereby promoting the process of technology transfer. Funding for  Nova+ exceeded 430 million euro. Traditional credit instruments are flanked by the activities of Intesa Sanpaolo Eurodesk V, the Intesa  Sanpaolo Group company with headquarters in Brussels that supports companies in accessing EU  block grant with a special focus on research and technological innovation. It also acts as a partner  in large transnational research projects promoted by the European Commission in order to foster  collaboration between public and private sectors, from industry, university and finance. The range of services and products available to Italian companies intending to pursue a path  of growth through innovation and research has been further expanded with Start-up Initiative, a  project designed to bring together start-up companies pursuing innovation with investors. The aim  is to uncover new, highly innovative businesses, prepare them to face the market and give them an  opportunity to present themselves to potential investors and industrial partners so as to bring the  world of finance even closer to that of technological innovation and research.  Convinced that in addition to being able to boast excellent research centres, Italy has an extraordinary  entrepreneurial potential that should be put effectively in contact with, we created the Fondazione  Ricerca e Imprenditorialit (Research and Entrepreneurship Foundation). The objective is to  promote technology transfer from laboratories and research centres, accompanying and stimulating  the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises and high-tech start-up companies. The initiative  is a partnership between Intesa Sanpaolo, Fondazione Politecnico di Milano, Italian Institute of  Technology, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Enel, Finmeccanica and Telecom Italia, which have  decided to make complementary resources and expertise a shared issue. vENTURE CAPITAL FOR INNOvATION:  ATLANTE vENTURES Italy has significant strong points in terms of  entrepreneurship and process innovation. Fully aware  of this, to promote research, activities under the Atlante  Ventures fund, which was born with the aim of getting  small, innovative companies in touch with each other,  with medium-large companies and with universities  and research centres, thus creating a true business  accelerator, continued. As of 31 December 2010, the  fund invested 4.3 million euro in three unlisted companies  dealing with technologies and solutions with high social  impact:  IGEA Spa, active in the field of biophysics applied    to clinical orthopedics and diagnostics, has recently  developed a device capable of treating skin tumors  and metastases with an innovative technique called  electrochemotherapy (ECT), patented under the name  Cliniporator, and currently in experimental use at some  major Italian cancer centres; Silicon Biosystem Spa, active in research and    development of equipment for use in laboratories and  clinics/hospitals, aims to improve diagnostic standards  in prenatal screening for Down syndrome and in the  diagnosis of cancers; Tethis Spa, active in nanotechnology, launched a    development project in the molecular cytogenetics tests  field, which is considered the future of test techniques for  identifying chromosomal abnormalities associated with  congenital diseases or cancers. ABI AwARD FOR INNOvATION OF BANKING SERvICES In March 2011, a technical-scientific committee and a jury,  including representatives from the business, academic and  institutional sectors, ranked Intesa Sanpaolo in first place in  the category Tailor made Bank with the project the bank  close to the customer which includes: personalised service  at branches with modular accounts, online services with a  virtual branch and mobile services with mobile banking V.    35 SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS In the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, operations with institutions and public companies are overseen  by Banca Infrastrutture Innovazione e Sviluppo (BIIS), which operates on both the national and  international markets. Dedicated to customers in government, public entities, local authorities, public  utilities, general contractors and public and private healthcare providers, BIIS develops funding and  current banking operations, project financing and provides financial advisory services. The Bank is committed to promoting both large strategic works (including Brebemi, Pedemontana  Lombarda, the Milan Tangenziale Esterna Est, Quadrilatero and the Cremona-Mantua motorway)  and public utility infrastructures: ports, airports, freight terminals, pre-schools, parking areas,  barracks, multi-purpose sports facilities, hospitals (among which the restructuring and upgrading of  the building complex of the Brescia Spedali Civili stands out), and social housing projects such as  the Istituto Trentino per l'Edilizia Abitativa (ITEA). Wholly owned by the Autonomous Province of  Trento, ITEA creates housing to meet the needs of those who do not have sufficient means to turn  to the housing market, through construction, renovation, purchase and management measures. Works needed to re-launch Italys economic recovery and that of the countries where the Bank  operates, which bears witness to the Banks continued commitment to encourage local governments  through public-private partnership to transform potential into prosperity for the country. This is the  context in which the financing for the construction and modernisation of school facilities in the  Belgian region of Flanders should be placed. The project provides for the restoration of about 211  school buildings, of which 173 are newly built. The total cost of the project amounts to approximately  1.5 billion euro, with 700 million euro being underwritten by BIIS as part of a consortium of banks. More detailed information about the many funded projects is available on the Internet V. Total loans granted in 2010 equal 3.9 billion euro. wIND POwER PARK ON AL MOUNTAINS Among the many projects financed in the field of renewable  energy with low environmental impact is the building of a  wind park – Italy's largest and one of the largest in Europe  – in Sardinia. The park, which was started in early 2010,  is situated on the plateau of the Mountains of Al, has 69  turbines with a total installed capacity of 138 MWp and is  able to produce over 300 GWh/year to meet the electricity  needs of 110,000 families. The plant, saving 180,000 tonnes of CO2 per year,  will allow Sardinia to become one of the first Italian  regions to meet the Kyoto Protocol objectives. The  total cost of the project is approximately 261 million  euro, while the funding granted, amounting to 230  million euro, was underwritten by a consortium of  Italian and foreign banks.

This section describes some of the issues having the greatest social interest, referring to relations with customers. The Antitrust Authority started some proceedings against the Bank, the more significant ones being: Simplified Mortgage Cancellation.     In 2009 the Bank received two penalties for a total of 325,000 euro. In 2010, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court partially accepted the appeal of the  Bank ordering the repayment of a penalty of 160,000 euro. For the second penalty of 165,000 euro, the Bank has appealed to the State Council (the first  hearing is scheduled for 5 July 2011). Active mortgage transferability (transferring mortgages from other banks).    In 2008 the Antitrust Authority sanctioned Intesa Sanpaolo for unfair business practice with regard to active mortgage transferability with a penalty of  480,000 euro. In 2009, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court accepted the Banks appeal. In 2010 the State Council rejected the appeal presented by  the Authority against the Regional Courts decision and the 480,000 euro penalty has been paid back to the Bank. Passive mortgage transferability (transferring mortgages to other banks).    In July 2010 the Authority started a proceeding which terminated with a penalty of 40,000 euro. The Authority, while accepting the Banks defence, deemed  there had been an unfair commercial practice in the delay time for the completion of part of the transferability operations. The Bank is considering whether  to appeal the decision with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court. Proceeding against MasterCard, Intesa Sanpaolo and other Italian banks.    The proceeding aims to assess whether a cartel has been formed in the credit cards industry. On 3 November 2010, the Authority decided that the parties  have put in place vertical arrangements, issuing a penalty of 700,000 euro against Intesa Sanpaolo. On 28 January 2011, the Lazio Regional Administrative  Court accepted the Banks appeal, suspending the enforcement of the order until the hearing scheduled for 22 June 2011.  Default bonds litigation (widely dealt in the Financial Report 2010 p. 362-366 V. As for the Parmalat bonds, in June 2010, Intesa Sanpaolo, in agreement with Consumer Associations nationwide, completed its review of applications  submitted by customers and made repayments of about 15 million euro. The evaluations were carried out by five regional committees, jointly composed of a  Bank representative and a representative of a Consumer Association chosen by the customer. As for the default of the Cirio group securities (nominal value of approximately 1.25 billion euro), in April 2007 10 companies of the Cirio group currently  under extraordinary administration, issued a writ of summons against Intesa Sanpaolo and Banca Caboto and five other banks. In November 2009 the Court  of Rome considered the claims unfounded and rejected them. The companies of the Cirio group have appealed against the Court decision. In implementing the directives set out by the Bank of Italy, an audit was carried out in the transfer of a fifth of the salary area: Neos Finance made a provision  for the reimbursement to customers of expenses that were not matured when the loans were discharged early of 30 million euro . Still in this area, since an  outdated version of the information sheet by Moneta Spa reported a cost for the required insurance coverage that was lower than that stated in the contract,  customers were reimbursed some 800,000 euro. In June 2009, the Slovak Antitrust Authority sanctioned VUB Banka and two other banks for a total of 10 million euro, 3.8 of which to the subsidiary VUB for  the alleged formation of a cartel. Following an appeal by VUB, the Bratislava Court cancelled the penalty in December 2010. The Slovak Antitrust Authority  appealed to the Slovak Supreme Court. DISPUTES AND  CONTROvERSIAL SECTORS    37 THE ARMS SECTOR The complex and controversial issue of arms production and trade has been well represented in  the Banks strategies for some time. We are aware that Intesa Sanpaolo is fully responsible for  how it conducts its business as financial intermediary. Consequently, the Bank, in keeping with the  values and principles embodied in its Code of Ethics, adopted a policy that calls for the suspension  of all operations (financing and transactions) pertaining to the import and export of arms and arms  systems across the range of the entire Groups operations in the arms sector. The legal foundation  of this policy is Article 11 of the Italian Constitution, cited by Law 185/90, which defines limits and  rules for the export, import and transit of arms and represents a point of reference for Italys defence  industry, and, in turn, the credit system. The policy allows for exceptions to be authorised by the  Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer on an extraordinary basis. Among the exceptions  introduced in the concrete application of the policy, in addition to the inter-governmental agreements  currently in force, under which Italy is participating in large-scale operations involving European  Union countries (with a view towards achieving integrated European defence and importations by  Italys ministries or armed forces), it was decided not to damage customers and compromise in  cases where transactions had already been launched or agreed upon prior to the official issuance  of the policy. In these cases only when it is not possible to transfer the operations onto other banks  the authorisation to carry on the transaction can be granted. During the last few years authorised operations have progressively been reduced. In 2010  there was a further sharp decline, with a total on authorised exports less then one million euro  compared with 186 million euro in 2009 (excluding transactions effected by Cassa di Risparmio  di La Spezia, which left the group in 2011). Even with respect to inter-governmental programmes,  2010 data reveal a sharp contraction with about 180 million euro traded, compared to 806 million  euro in 2009.  During 2010 support to International Subsidiary Banks was also further extended to ensure proper  implementation of the policy governing funding and transactions to companies dealing in the arms  sector. To find a solution to the presence of different regulatory and operational standards, in June  2010 rules governing the International Subsidiary Banks operations in the arms sector were issued,  which defined the management, reporting and control of arms sector operations. In every bank a  contact has been identified and placed in charge of monitoring the implementation of the policy and  submit a quarterly report with all information regarding the operations performed in line with the  principles of the policy. Although the Bank has not been able to completely halt  its operations in the sector, there has been a decrease up  to 1.3% of the overall operations in 2010 compared to the  Italian industry.   8% Other 15% Norway 3% Ireland 27% France 6% Usa 41% Netherlands COMPARISON INTESA SANPAOLO – BANKING SYSTEM INTESA SANPAOLO INDUSTRY 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 AUTHORISATIONS FOR EXPORTS ISSUED TO THE BANK IN 2010,  BY END-USER COUNTRY  38.SOCIAL REPORT—EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES Investing in the promotion of human resources has always been a distinctive and qualifying  feature of the Group. This has translated into the promotion of conduct, competence and systems to guarantee respect  and development for individuals through adequate professional training and refresher courses;  recognition of individual and team merit; involvement and motivation in order to attain our goals,  also with a view to integration; equal treatment; trust and a sense of belonging; promoting a work  environment based on dialogue and the quality of life. In 2010, with the winding up of the next stage of the merger and the three-year Business Plan  having come to a close, throughout the organisation, the Bank has devoted further attention to  achieving objectives of greater simplicity, innovation and inclusion. This has had a significant  impact on personnel management policies.  Assessment systems have been simplified, with more emphasis placed on key behaviours;  information systems have been improved; individuals self-responsibility with regard to time  management has been increased, in the belief that trust generates simplification which in turn  leads to new trust; processes of internal mobility were favoured to develop a multidisciplinary  management and a culture geared towards listening to needs and to change. Finally, to increase  the level of wellbeing within the Bank and improve the quality of life of individuals and their  families, important initiatives have been implemented within the framework of the integrated  corporate welfare programme, offering solutions that range from traditional to highly innovative  in response to specific areas of needs and interests.    39 ATTENTION AND LISTENING FROM THE vERY FIRST MEETING Applications are collected throughout the Group via the corporate website, with the screening  of resumes that are registered in the Jobs & Careers V, section which was updated in 2010  with new information to make known the roles and personnel within Intesa Sanpaolo. On the  website, the Meet our people and hear their stories section features interviews with employees  to learn more about some of our professionals and their corporate history. Specific content, on the  Groups territorial break-down and organisation, Intesa Sanpaolos values as well as training and  development initiatives, can be accessed. Access to further information about open positions, the  selection process and appointments regarding career orientation is also available on-line. In 2010, strong support was given to employer branding initiatives with numerous meetings and  seminars held at major Italian universities and business schools as an introduction to the Group  and the employment opportunities it offers. INTESA SANPAOLO AND EMPLOYMENT Over 5,400 people have been hired by the Group: (+2,436 in Italy and +3,026 abroad). The turnover  rate in Italy of 0.9% is a significant upswing compared to 2009, when it was -2.9%, with the number  of people joining the Group exceeding those who left by 600. Overseas, the turnover rate was -4.8%  (against -9.8% in 2009), due mainly to the unique combination of the economic crisis – particularly  in some Eastern European countries – and a reorganisation. In 2010, in the difficult Italian employment scenario, the Group made a significant commitment to  create new job opportunities: following the Trade Union agreement of 2 February 2010, 480 people  were recruited from geographical areas suffering from a severe employment crisis (LAquila, Lecce  and Potenza) and workers, whether in mobility, laid-off or unemployed. Furthermore, the Bank committed to creating 400 new jobs by 31 March 2011 and additional  placements in lieu of any vacations following incentivised resignations of those employees having  matured the right to retire. Commitments upheld: the new job placements were carried out for people  having worked at least 9 months on a non-permanent contract at one of the Groups companies. In general, the Bank also pays attention that the workplace assigned to the new employee is  geographically adjacent to the municipality where they reside or are domiciled. RECRUITMENT POLICY STAFF BREAKDOwN AND DEvELOPMENT The Intesa Sanpaolo Groups workforce is made up of  100,740 human resources of which almost 70,000 in Italy  and over 30,000 abroad.  Female employees are constantly increasing: in Italy they  comprise 49% (+0.4% compared to 2009) and abroad  63.9% (+0.2% compared to 2009). The average age is 43.4 years in Italy and 37.6 abroad;  the level of education indicates that, at the Group level,  the percentage of graduates is 39.3%. In Italy part-time  employees reaches 11.6%, three points above the Italian  average (8.6%)1. ABI (2010), Rapporto sul mercato del lavoro nellindustria finanziaria, Roma, Bancaria Editrice. 1.

This is the goal of the new Talent Management platform that  defines an organic and coherent framework of the various corporate development communities:  Emerging, young people with high potential, to develop distinctive skills and strengthen their  motivation (also used as an employer branding tool); Talent, employees under 40 with high  performance and potential, to create a pool of future managers; Job Master, people who already  have distinctive skills and expertise, to enhance and retain the more developed experiences; Key  Leaders, mid-level managers with high potential, to foster their development into positions of  greater responsibility; Top management, high level managers, to spread the culture and identity  of the Group to all management levels. The platform falls under the Banks diversity management policies since it allows targeted  interventions to be carried out according to population groups that have different characteristics,  developing their merit in relation to their different background and experience. Top Management  and Emerging were the first two communities to be launched.  Alongside the Communities structured talent management systems, are specific development  projects created within the different Bank structures, for example the Corporate and Investment  Banking Divisions Progetto Imagine V. THE NEw PERFORMER ASSESSMENT SYSTEM The new assessment system for measuring individual performance introduced in 2010 has  been designed to enhance performance excellence wherever it lies, taking into account the  different levels of complexity associated with the tasks carried out. Profiles of corporate behaviours to be evaluated were identified based on varying levels of  complexity with regard to seniority or professional role. Drawing up expected profiles helps the  assessor to be more objective in identifying outstanding performances regardless of corporate  seniority or length of employment. In short, this means a fair assessment for all levels of  seniority, in particular those associated with less complex jobs. This makes it easier to spot  talented people even with a view to diversity management, since often the youngest or the  part-time workers (predominantly women) are precisely at the levels where the new system  applies these new measures. In Italy, all employees undergo a professional assessment and  this assessment culture is expanding abroad: in 2010, 73.5% of employees was evaluated  (+4.5% compared to 2009). THE EMERGING COMMUNITY To identify those who belong to this developing community,  emphasis was placed on the self-application tool and  therefore ones willingness to face the challenge: of  3,200 graduates in the company (maximum age 32)  with a permanent contract, 1,000 have submitted their  application. 106 young people have been identified who,  in September 2010, started their University Master at the  Universit Bocconi. The arrangement with the Bocconi  University is one of several Bank-University partnerships  the Group has formed and which provides access to  higher education. INTERNAL MOBILITY POLICIES Job posting is an important tool for managing and moni- toring mobility, which, via the Intranet, allows employees  to know about and apply for job openings posted by the  Bank. Job posting, which has been in operation for some  years, has been further enhanced to promote the enrich- ment of experiences. 121 job postings were published in  2010 to which 1,600 applicants applied: this resulted in  118 people changing their jobs. At year-end, even abroad, the search and collection of  professional profiles was started. PARTICIPANTS - EMERGING COMMUNITIES [%] Women 56.5% 59.1% Men 43.5% 40.9% SELF-APPLICATIONS SUITABLE    41 REMUNERATION POLICIES AND INCENTIvE SYSTEMS V The general objectives and guidelines adopted by the Bank with regard to the remuneration polices  are: equality, to reduce remuneration inconsistencies and standardise treatment; merit, to ensure  a closer connection between remuneration and the work performed and displayed managerial  potential; sustainability, through containment of the costs stemming from application of the  remuneration policy within limits that are compatible with cost objectives outlined in the Business  Plan. The application of these criteria takes into account the assessment of organisational positions,  potential, performance and recognition of merit. The incentive system offers diversified incentives according to business areas in order to  implement measures consistent with the characteristics of the professionals working in the  company, to recognise individual merit, to reward teamwork, and, for management, it covers  a medium-long time span. For the Banca dei Territori, in particular, the system highlights the  specific characteristics of the different types of Organisational Units; enhances the achievement  of the earnings margin; attributes particular relevance to the quality of service and customer  satisfaction; rewards teamwork and distinctive individual contributions. REMUNERATION EqUALITY AND GENDER Generally, there is a difference in wage between men and women, which in Italy is between 9 and  14% depending on the category. Attaining gender equality can also be accomplished through a  consistent management system that is respectful of differences. The principle of fairness is assured,  for example, through the analysis of pay levels by gender. With a view to continuous improvement, Intesa Sanpaolo has begun monitoring the various  indicators that detect any signs of gender discrimination. Particular attention is paid to promotions  that show an increasing percentage of positive interventions on behalf of women. In this way, the  gap noted in general – which is also due to fewer positions of seniority in the Group being held by  women – is considerably reduced. Further concrete initiatives aimed at enhancing the development of female talent form an integral  part of the projects within the Business Plan 2011-2013. LEADERSHIP DEvELOPMENT PROGRAMME Classroom training got underway in all the Group's  International Subsidiary Banks, as part of the management  assessment process, involving over 500 people. This  is the first cross-management training programme  specifically targeted to first and second line managers  of the International Subsidiary Banks Division, focusing  on the appreciation of cultural diversity, integration  and a sense of belonging to the Group and shared  values and behaviours. The topics covered during the  training, which is made up of three modules, cover key  management skills such as: leadership styles, coaching,  being able to work in an international context, flexibility  and proactivity.  IDEAS OF vALUE Simply better is the name of an engagement initiative  for employees of the Hungarian CIB bank to reward  ideas that reinforce some corporate values: excellence,  development of human resources and responsibility in the  use of resources. Participants suggested ideas in the areas  of customer satisfaction, streamlining and simplification of  processes and for increasing cost efficiencies. PROMOTIONS BY GENDER ITALY 2010 2009 2008 No. promotions   7,537 4,756 4,473 No. promotions - Men 3,277 2,364 2,400 No. promotions - Women 4,260 2,392 2,073  42.SOCIAL REPORT—EMPLOYEES THE vALUE OF DIFFERENCES DIvERSITY MANAGEMENT POLICIES IN PROCESSES Over the past two years staff management systems and tools available to the Group have been  extensively redesigned and refined, with particular attention being paid to the support that these can  give to the policies of diversity management – especially of, but not limited to, gender – through correct  identification and promotion of merit. The selection process has been completely revised and is now divided into three steps (the last of which  is carried out using the Assessment Centre methodology) and with more selectors (line structures and  recruitment specialists). Under this selection method, more women meet the selection criteria in the pre- selection phase. From approximately 55% of women out of the total number of selection participants,  the number of women deemed suitable candidates at the end of the selection rose to over 63%. The new performance assessment system PERforMEr is specifically intended to effectively highlight  behaviours of excellence even in less complex roles: such a system should ensure that women and  young people (who primarily occupy lower level and in less complex roles), receive a fairer assessment  of their performance – a necessary condition and driving force for management actions that allow for  their professional growth. The assessment of managerial potential for appointment to positions of responsibility has been entrusted  to professional external assessors, to ensure objective, unbiased judgement. The process review,  which makes use of the assessment management tool, establishes the shift from group assessment  to individual assessment since the effect of group dynamics on individual participants can sometimes  inhibit people with less aggressive leadership styles. The trend in female participation has been positive:  from 15% in the 2007/2009 three-year period to 26% in 2010. The choice to launch the participants identification phase under the Talent Management platform  through self-application has brought out the candidates initiative without restrictions. The different  levels of subsequent selection have proved to be non-gender biased, leading to a distribution clearly  dominated by women, mirroring the gender composition in the age range involved. The communication channel which the Bank has made available to stakeholders for reporting non- compliance with the principles of the Code of Ethics, has received two reports regarding equality.  Internal verifications found that one case was unfounded and the second was resolved to the  satisfaction of the parties. MENTORSHIP PROGRAMMES In early 2010, a mentorship programme was set up for 15  female employees with managerial responsibilities, who  were mentored in their duties by top managers of the Group  (men and women). The initiative serves as a contribution  and support for the further managerial development of  women who, through exchanges with senior managers  during the six-month programme, have had occasions  to discuss and understand the organisational dynamics,  as well as receiving suggestions regarding their own  personal development. The positive feedback about the  experience suggests the programme should be used  and disseminated as a tool for different managerial  levels as well as for those about to take on this kind of  responsibility. DISABILITY As part of our recruitment policy, particular attention has  been paid to seek out human resources falling under  the protected categories group, both through monitoring  resumes from orientation sessions, as well as those  submitted by candidates on the Banks website. Visually  impaired and blind employees have a technology platform  available to them to support their activities. Given the  success of the English courses for the 13 blind switchboard  operators in Milan, these courses will be extended to Turin  and Rome starting in January 2011.    43                   PROGETTO  The Gemma Project, launched in 2007 with the aim of making the best use of corporate talent  (especially women), and which has promoted the development of a culture and attention towards  enhancing the exploitation of potential and diversity, continues. The Gemma work group, involving  people from different business backgrounds and who have inter-disciplinary experiences, provides  input in a number of areas: from business, development and training, broadening the possibilities  of reconciliation, female leadership, to the area of internal communications on these issues. The  on-line Gemm@ community has been operative since 2009 – a virtual meeting place dedicated to  inclusion and talent, accessible from the corporate Intranet. Participation has always been active  since its inception. Over 14,000 people are enrolled in the community, of these over 10,000 are  women and almost 3,000 are men, with an average of about 300 daily visits. Since it began to the  end of 2010, the forum has registered over 3,000 comments. Intesa Sanpaolo is one of the founders of "Valore D" V, which takes part in the Gemma Project. THE SEARCH FOR INNOvATIvE SOLUTIONS Brainshops are creative meetings to collect innovative ideas which are attended even by the  Trade Unions. Already in 2009 these types of meetings produced concrete results on issues of  health and safety, which led to the arrangement of safety training courses targeted to specific  personnel and the development of classroom training courses for assistants to the disabled. This  approach was implemented in 2010 to issues of gender, diversity and stereotypes within the  activities carried out by the EOC, which are joint committees that also see the participation by  the Trade Unions. Four work groups were set up looking at diversity related to gender, culture,  disabilities and different age groups, within which several actionable ideas were developed that  will be further explored. MEETINGS ON THE ROAD  Over time, starting from the positive experience of the  Gemm@ virtual community, heed was paid to the need of  meeting up personally. And so were born the "Meetings on the road", seminars  held in Italy focusing on the experiences of successful  women - whether belonging to the Group or from the  outside. The purpose of the meetings is to explore cases  of female success stories, be inspired by positive role  models, and also to share experiences beyond the virtual  realm. The meetings will continue in 2011.  jOINT COMMITTEES The search for constructive dialogue with Trade Unions  is carried out also within other bilateral Organisations: the Commission for Monitoring Safety and Sustainable    Development  discussed  initiatives  concerning  physical safety: robbery prevention through training,  work on the layout, provide assistance to colleagues  involved (medical and psychological support); the Joint Training Committee discussed training    courses on the cultural integration of a large portion  of the business population (e.g. customers assistants  and area specialist personnel). With the signing of  specific agreements, access was gained to funding  made available by the Fondo Banche e Assicurazioni  (Bank and Insurance Fund).  In addition to Company representatives, also two members  from each of the Trade Unions, representing the total  workforce in Italy, take part in the Joint Committees.  44.SOCIAL REPORT—EMPLOYEES PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER: OUR CULTURE Disseminating culture and values to guide the future: this is the vision Intesa Sanpaolos training  adopts in support of its people in Italy and abroad. In 2010, training activities were marked by projects that considered the effectiveness perceived  by participants: listening to them enabled the targeting of methods, times and places of our  ever developing training programmes V. At the Group level, a significant number of days, totalling over 950,000 (in 2009 the number  was about 930,000) accompanied an equally wide variety of quality offerings – a number  that would be significantly higher were television training also to be taken into account.  Training has made a notable contribution to working together on the issue of trust which is at  the basis of the possibility of pursuing sustainable growth and relationships. Two projects were launched in March and April, after the involvement between 2009 and 2010,  of some 5,000 Branch Managers in the Fiducia Direttori (Trust in Managers) project: Fiducia  Aree e Regioni (Trust in Areas and Regions) and Fiducia Assistenti alla Clientela (Trust in  Customer Assistants). In the belief that sustainable growth must also be supported by widespread knowledge and  awareness of the issues associated with banking, the 'The words of finance' in training  programme was created for the Web TV On Demand channel: a 35 episode video glossary  which simply and effectively defines the keywords relating to specific financial topics. The gradual extension of the International Subsidiary Banks Listening 100% Education  Programme also continued: this programme, which makes use of "Edutainment", aims to build  and spread awareness about the strategic importance of customer satisfaction. The programme  was introduced in AlexBank (Egypt) and Banka Koper (Slovenia) in 2010, and involved over  6,000 employees at all levels and roles within each bank. TRAINING A project of involvement and professional development  dedicated to the whole community of Banca dei Territoris  customer assistants. In 2010, over 12,000 employees  attended classroom training sessions designed to enhance  their role and strengthen their job skills. The project  adopted the aula+ training protocol, which surrounds  people with a variety of learning stimuli before, during and  after the classroom sessions, making the training support  offered to employees, an on-going one. From classroom  training to the on-line community, Trust customer service  assistants continues to provide listening areas between  branches, areas and regions as well as opportunities for  exchanges between employees coming from the same  professional background. An improvement and professional development initiative  focusing on specialised roles in the Banca dei Territori,  providing an opportunity to meet, share experiences  and best practices and improve the ability to support  branches and pick up on their needs to make a difference  at key moments. The initiative has also promoted  a complete understanding of each other's areas of  responsibility and tangible behaviours in everyday life.  1,800 employees were involved, including coordination  and specialist figures.    45 TRAINING FOR EXCELLENCE Integrated use was made of social media for an ever greater dissemination of informal learning.  The role of participants in the courses has been enhanced so that they could become protagonists  of their training courses. Listening has made it possible to devise training that does not react to  change, but rather anticipates it.  Knowing how to seek out the new as well as making it part of the learning experience: based on  this, activities were undertaken to encourage innovation in the company. There have been many  learning experiences that have broadened creativity techniques and rendered the conceptual  contribution of employees concrete, and even led to the transfer of methods and processes  to transform problems into solutions. Brainshops, multilevel, creative workshops as well as  seminars for interpreting future scenarios, have transversely involved managers, professionals  and specialists from the various departments of the Bank. Particular attention was also paid to the personalisation of educational initiatives focused  on innovation (e.g. the CIB Divisions Business Innovation Revolution, InnovAction Day and  Innovaz10ne).  A simple bank to be lived: training has actively contributed to the simplification processes  promoted within the Bank with dedicated initiatives and the creation of the Futurosemplice (Simple  Future) portal, which offers an informative area on simplification projects already underway whilst  representing a laboratory for generating new ideas, disseminating content and stimulating the  concept of simplicity. With the aim of enhancing trade skills and exchanging experiences among employees, permanent  training platforms have been set up for employees working with people (HR Academy), for anyone  involved in Compliance (Compliance Academy) and for those who work with IT Systems (IT  Academy) V. Investment in the development of professional role training continued, in particular, for employees  of the Banca dei Territori, with a series of modular programmes that alternate classroom training  with field tutoring focusing on developing technical and relational skills related to jobs carried out  in the branches V. Responsibility training: a strong commitment to CSR training was maintained with the launch of  the first session of the ISP Equator Principles Procedures course for those working in project  finance, to share the purpose of the Equator Principles rules (see "Environment" section V)  focusing on operational and application aspects, making use of specially designed cases. For  CSR Delegates, the Valore ai pensieri (Value for ideas) initiative, with its innovative "Thinkshop"  format, presents an area for thinking outside the box to learn how to ask questions and try  to understand things that push beyond habits and common ground. Through the "Research  Community", Delegates are constantly challenging themselves through listening, reflection and  dialogue on key issues of social and environmental responsibility. In October 2010 the initiative Dona una favola (Donate  a fairy tale) was launched: an on-line guided game of  collaborative writing for all Group employees. Participants  were asked to write a childrens story on the economy and,  more broadly, on the value of savings. The project revolves  around the theme of financial socialisation that is the  importance of having an active role in "social education"  for learning how to use money wisely. The most popular  fairy tales and the first five to be ranked will be turned  into books and DVDs, which will be distributed and sold  even to the public. The proceeds will go to charities in  support of projects for children. Thousands of employees  enthusiastically took part in the project. This initiative  will be part of a territory-wide event for the families of  employees with children aged 5-9 who will have a day  dedicated to them. Two workshops                               and                 have been created that, through the shared reading of  written and spoken communications, promote a "style"  common to all, brining partners closer together and giving  back time to people. Scrivosemplice has already involved  some 800 employees in the classroom, but has also  reached all the Groups employees through the "educards":  tailor-made postcards imparting ready-made advice and  making knowledge available to all.  46.SOCIAL REPORT—EMPLOYEES qUALITY OF LIFE COMMUNICATION: LISTENING AND PROXIMITY V Structured listening to employees is strategic to foster the  sharing of objectives and increase internal cohesion. In  2010 two climate surveys were conducted in Italy and one  at the Groups International Subsidiary Banks.  Internal communications was organised to be closer to the  needs of internal and territorial customers, with the launch  of the Italian Network of the Internal Communications  Delegates, operating in several of the Groups central and  territorial structures.  During their working life, many people need to be absent  from work for periods that vary from short to long-term.  The reasons are many: maternity, needing to care for a  relative, illness, etc.. The aim of the Per Mano project  is to provide employees who want to, the possibility of  staying in touch with their office, being kept up to date on  happenings, innovations and changes. And this is done  through IT support and the presence of a tutor. The tutor, whose listening skills are honed through training,  manages and coordinates periods of absence through  leave-related conversations and meetings in preparation  for the reintegration of the person returning to the workforce  and becoming a reference point throughout the period of  absence. In 2010 the project focused on improvements  for the tutor through training activities. The wellbeing of the people working for the Group is a strategic element of Intesa Sanpaolo's  identity. The corporate welfare system is integrated and offers traditional and innovative solutions  to meet the specific needs and interests of employees by making available services, activities and  projects to enhance their welfare and improve their quality of life and that of their families. This  original approach was rewarded under the Lombardy Regions Premio Famiglia Lavoro (Family  Work Award). CORPORATE wELFARE: THE GROUP HEALTH FUND Of particular importance among the dozens of agreements signed between the Bank and the  Trade Unions, is the agreement that led to the establishment of the Group Health Fund which, per  number of members and guaranteed medical coverage, will be the first private assistance fund in  Italy and one of the largest in Europe. The Fund will encompass the employees and pensioners  of 45 companies currently enrolled in 3 different healthcare services or recipients of more than  30 insurance policies with very different treatments. Starting from January 2011, the new Fund  will provide additional health benefits to the national health service for all hospital and specialist  treatments. More than 200,000 people in the whole group including active and retired employees,  as well as their families, will benefit from the services. The new Fund is based on the principles of solidarity, mutuality and sustainability, and represents  a great pact of solidarity between generations and between workers and retirees. CONCILIATION INITIATIvES Finding a balance between peoples work and private is another central issue. Part-time employment is quite common in the Group: 11.6% of the workforce in Italy works part- time against 0.6% abroad - numbers that have remained fairly consistent with those of 2009. Among the most significant reconciliation initiatives were those for infants. A company crche has  been operational at the Milan centre since 2005 caring for about 50 children aged between 12 and  36 months.  To this was added in 2010, the one in Florence in the new Novoli area with about  55 places for infants aged between 6 and 36 months, reserved in part under an agreement to  the City of Florence. In 2009 and 2010, the Bank signed an agreement with Consorzio PAN V  – recognising its high standards of quality on which the company crches are founded - to  reserve some places for children of Group employees in crches affiliated with the Consortium  throughout Italy. At this stage about 120 Pan crches signed the agreement for a total of 362  places. A further 70 places were made available by crches of the Organizzazioni Fondatrici  del Consorzio Pan (Organisation Founders of the PAN Consortium).    47 In company cafeterias which adhere to the Gusti Giusti  project, in collaboration with Slow Food and the Turin  CTO, the menus have been re-worked to impart a culture  among the staff of proper nutrition as a factor in promoting  health, safeguarding flavour and promoting informed food  choices that employees can pass on to their families. Another aim is to integrate elements of sustainability  in the management of the cafeteria supplies, aiming to  contain transport costs and associated emissions of CO2  and promoting the "short chain" of supplies. Because of the positive outcome of the test, the  programme has been continued: in the spring of 2011,  the programme has extended to the cafeteria of Florence  and, subsequently, will involve the Milan Bonola training  centre and all the other Group cafeterias.  Moreover, the project guidelines have also been  included in the tender invitation for the selection of  a new cafeteria management and form the basis of  the tender invitation for the selection of suppliers  of corporate refreshment products (food and drink,  vending machines) for which a project is expected  to be formulated to enhance quality and diversity by  providing food and beverages permitting calibrated and  healthy choices to be made. wELLBEING IN THE COMPANY  The search for finding original ways of creating wellbeing in the Group has been an important area  of reflections, stimuli and cultural education as well as of projects and initiatives. On the one hand, the multi-faceted approach to this issue has brought about initiatives that  are directly tied to the diffusion of psychological/physical wellbeing – for example in terms of  nutrition – on the other, it has led to activities to strengthen cohesion as a constitutive element of  wellbeing. The first Christmas concert dedicated to Group employees, which was held in Turin  and which was attended by more than 1,500 employees, was one such activity. Ethos - Spazi di pensiero sui temi delletica (Areas of thought about ethics) is a workshop aimed  at building a common conceptual and linguistic basis on issues regarding ethics and increase  awareness of the presence of ethical issues in almost all decisions related to the professional  sphere. The Stare Bene al Lavoro (Being well at work) workshop was intended to stimulate the adoption  of new behaviours aimed at achieving a sustainable style of working. To this end, participants  were provided with information and tools to react positively to challenges and acquire the ability to  use experiences, even negative ones, for building the future. Among the objectives: develop best  practices on the issue of wellbeing at work, through the exchange of experiences among peers to  drive the change. Four sessions were held involving around 80 managers of the Corporate and  Investment Banking Division. The workshops will continue throughout 2011.  48.SOCIAL REPORT—EMPLOYEES HEALTH AND SAFETY Investments in high-tech solutions continued to increase the level of safety and simplify and cut  back on management activities by branches employees. A significant commitment has allowed  the continuation of the implementation of the innovative Global Security System that operates  alongside traditional security devices in providing the possibility of remote monitoring. During the  year, the system was extended to 204 Group branches, and additional branches to be fitted out  in 2011 have also been identified. The Branch Entrance Control Steward Service launched in  2009, based on the use of non-armed security specialists was introduced at some 50 branches.  To improve the effectiveness of entry control, an innovative face recognition system was also  implemented to catch people trying to enter the bank wearing a mask. These systems have  been tested in some Group branches. To combat and prevent robberies, cooperation with the Police and collaboration with Prefectures  continued with the signing of a Memoranda of Understanding: in 2010, the Group signed 20  Memoranda at 20 Uffici Territoriali di Governo, taking part in various operational territorial  Round Tables with Police and leading bank representatives. With regard to protecting people, assets and property, the new territorial risk assessment model  has been applied for planning improvements in the provinces that have the highest robbery rate by  highlighting appropriate actions to be taken and their priority. The methodology used for this model  has been formalised and incorporated into the Groups Risk Assessment report. POST-ROBBERY SUPPORT Post-robbery support, provided by qualified physicians with the support of the University of Milan,  was on-going and involved over 100 branches that had been robbed (out of a total of 268 robberies  during the year in Italy, compared to 366 in 2009). The activities undertaken – made with the prior  and voluntary consent of those concerned – consisted of interviews, also on an individual basis,  and medical visits. A report on the last two years of this experience was drawn up, which showed  the total or partial remission of symptoms for the majority of the employees involved, and the  positive opinion of the majority of beneficiaries of the services who found the process useful and  effective, especially for mitigating the inevitable psychological after-effects. SAFETY TOGETHER Training regarding health and safety for all Group personnel  has been updated and developed. Activities were also  driven by ideas and suggestions collected in the creative  partnership meeting organised by the Trade Unions.  Particular attention was paid to the way in which legal and  behavioural contents are exchanged in the classroom  and remotely, especially since the starting point is the  conviction that health and safety in the workplace depend,  above all, on the involvement and active contribution of all  persons that work in the company.  Training and dissemination of a health and safety-oriented  culture continued. Classroom courses for various specific  figures, provided for by law (Workers' representatives  and operators in charge of safety) and new recruits were  updated as well as remote course for all employees.  Workshops were also held for those corporate staff  principally involved in implementing the legislation.    49 AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM OF qUALITY The Group adopts a management system with specific responsibilities, procedures and resources  to help implement its health and safety policy in compliance with the requirements defined by  leading standards (UNI EN ISO 9001 - UNI-INAIL ISPESL).  Certain practices and operations have been revised and updated with a view to increase  simplification and transparency. Of particular note is the new format of the Risk Assessment  Document (which also affects the assessment of certain special risks among which those having to  do with work-related stress) and the issuance of three specific operating guides relating to Health  and Safety Risk Assessment, Managing prevention and protection measures and Managing  medical surveillance. Moreover, the ISO 9001 certification was extended to include occupational  medicine. Over 1,300 inspection visits were carried out to assess and verify health and safety risks in various  work environments and to identify measures to mitigate or eliminate them. More than 4,000 medical  visits to safeguard the health of employees were carried out by the Groups health network, as a  result of which specific programmes to promote health are being developed. Thanks to the large  number of available data it was possible to update the guidelines for the Epidemiological report  and formulate a detailed analysis on the health of staff under medical surveillance. 91% of visits  resulted in being found suitable while those with the requirement of a 10-minute break every hour  of continuous use of a video terminal were around 8%. With the aim of improving the overall conditions in the work environments, a project involving  branch Managers was launched called on to provide input for a simple tool for collecting information  (on-line questionnaire) from which indicators about the environmental comfort are derived. The use  of a scientifically validated survey methodology enables the average level of the environmental and  microclimatic comfort/wellbeing to be monitored, identifying the most appropriate actions to be taken  in relation to subjective and specific activities with particular attention to staff with disabilities. The value of dialogue was also crucial for the realisation  of the on-line robbery training dashboard created so  that all the educational resources available about robbery  risks could be shared: classroom and remote courses, on- line lessons, TV training as well as documents, thematic  links and games to stimulate attention skills. INCREASE AwARENESS  On specific issues related to the physical safety, some  important measures have been taken to create greater  awareness in the Banca dei Territori. In the second half of the year, meetings were held with  all Regional Departments, with the aim of presenting the  results achieved, the most relevant initiatives underway  to gather useful information and elements to continuously  improve safety of the relevant area.  Particular attention was paid to robbery training in the  classroom which involved branch staff (about 3,100  employees trained in 2010). These meetings will be  repeated every six months.  50.SOCIAL REPORT—SHAREHOLDERS In 2010 the goal of sustainable growth continued to be at the core of our strategy and has proven to  be especially important in a macroeconomic scenario that is still unstable due to the persistence of  the crisis. Intesa Sanpaolos strategic decisions continued to leverage on solidity, liquidity and low  risk profile, strengthening and developing the relationship of trust with our stakeholders. In line with our schedule, the integration of the IT systems was completed and rationalisation  activities of the Group and its presence in the territory continued. SHAREHOLDERS    51 INTESA SANPAOLO SHARE PERFORMANCE: RETURNS  In 2010, the Intesa Sanpaolo share price recorded a trend linked to the banking sector indexes:  a fall in the first two months of the year, followed by a cyclical performance until mid-April and a  further fall until the beginning of June, when the low for the year was reached, and then a partial  recovery until early August, followed by a cyclical performance until the end of October and a  further decrease in the final two months of the year, bringing the price at year-end near the low  for the year and 35.1% below the level at the beginning of 2010. At the end of the year, the Intesa  Sanpaolo savings share recorded a 23.7% decline compared to the start of the year. The discount  on the ordinary share has been halved: from 25% at the start of the year to 12%. At the end of 2010  the total capitalisation of Intesa Sanpaolo amounted to 25.9 billion euro, compared to 39.5 billion  euro at the beginning of the year. DIvIDENDS On 10 May 2011 the Intesa Sanpaolo Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting resolved to allocate a  dividend of 0.080 euro per ordinary share and 0.091 euro per savings share from the 2010 net  income, with total dividends paid amounting to 1.033 billion euro. This corresponds to an average   dividend yield of 3.23% on ordinary shares and 4.63% on savings shares for the year. RELATIONS wITH SHAREHOLDERS AND THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY In 2010, in an economic scenario that remained extremely difficult, relations with the financial  community concentrated on sustainable profitability. We believe that the Banks capacity to  generate constant growth in profitability is also determined from high-level liquidity, low leverage,  the sound capital base and low risk profile. Based on these indicators, the Group represents a  solid reference for its investors and a reliable partner for businesses among the sector leaders at  international level. In 2010, to guarantee equal access to information, information was made available promptly,  easily and simply through a range of channels: Internet, conference calls via a toll-free number,  brochures and free distribution of financial statements on request. The Investor Relations section  of the Website V offers well-defined content to ensure that stakeholder access to information is  more extensive and systematic. In order to contribute to the creation of long-term sustainable value, regular and frequent meetings  were held with the financial community that consolidated lasting relationships based on mutual trust. CREDIT RATING The ratings assigned to Intesa Sanpaolo reflect good  profitability, adequate asset quality, a sound capital ratio  and good liquidity profile. INCLUSION IN ETHICAL INDEXES Ethical indexes are characterised by the criteria applied  in selecting the stocks they include. In addition to  financial performance, companies social responsibility  performance (environmental sustainability, rights of  company, supplier chain and distributor employees,  respect for human rights, relations with stakeholders and  anti-corruption policies) is also assessed. Intesa Sanpaolo has been listed in the indexes of  FTSE4Good, ASPI Eurozone and the Ethibel Investment  Register since 2007.

In 2010 the implementation of an integrated strategy, which increasingly includes criteria for  social and environmental responsibility throughout all stages of the purchase of goods or  services, continued. By adopting an approach inspired by conservative buying decisions and a sense of saving both of  resource and costs, the Bank has based its business model on two lines of action. The first regards its relationships with suppliers, hence attention to transparency, fairness and  integrity in the way these are managed, whilst ensuring equal opportunities for all the stakeholders  involved. The guiding principles in this area are found in our Code of Ethics, which suppliers are  required to view and adopt in the course of the selection process. The second area is the promotion of the suppliers social and environmental responsibility which  was launched in 2009 with the e-sourcing portal. A further strengthening derives from the adoption  of the principles of the Code of Ethics, which also address the protection and safeguarding of  human rights as established in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The gradual implementation of a centrally developed procurement policy by the Groups International  Subsidiary Banks has been given a strong boost, and almost all of the subsidiaries base their  procurement choices on such policy.     53 TRANSPARENCY IN PROCUREMENT PROCESSES AND THE SELECTION OF SUPPLIERS The Group has further consolidated its relationship with suppliers. Selections were based on the  principles of transparency and fairness as well as considering the closeness of local outsourcers. The Parent Companys e-sourcing portal, which makes use of a Web-based negotiating system  and which in 2010 was even further broadened, ensures transparency in relations with suppliers.  In fact, those who apply are required to register online, where, if invited to take part in a bid, they  can follow all the stages of the process. During the year, the product categories used remained essentially the same among the Groups  Italian companies, and online interactions were recorded with about 2,000 suppliers. The new management process of invoices, launched in 2010, will be developed in the coming year.  As a result of the practices adopted to date, monitoring activities have been improved, allowing for  greater traceability of documents, combined with more precise supervision of the various processing  stages, ultimately leading to improved compliance with payment terms. PROMOTING SOCIAL AND ENvIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Intesa Sanpaolos e-procurement tool is a model of sustainable consumption, which makes it  possible to eliminate, or reduce to a minimum, warehouses and inventories. Suppliers are selected on the basis of a comprehensive assessment which also includes sustainability  criteria. The questionnaire included in the online registration process includes a section devoted  to this issue, which the candidates, who are also asked to consult the Organisation, Management  and Control Model (Legislative Decree 231/2001) and the Groups Internal Code of Conduct, are  required to complete and declare their compliance with the principles laid down in the Code of  Ethics. Actions or behaviour contrary to these principles may result in termination of the contract.  The information provided in the questionnaires will help to establish a Social responsibility rating  which is an integral part of the project outlined on the side. Of 2,000 suppliers registered on the portal, 827 have implemented a Quality Management System,  268 an Environmental Management System, 1,003 have implemented a Health and Safety  Management System and 424 satisfy the requirements set out for SA 8000 certification. For the purchase of certain types of goods, such as technology materials, see the section on the  Environment V. The International Subsidiary Banks Division's Procurement Policy aims to create and disseminate  a model, guidelines and a set of indicators to include criteria of quality and social and environmental  responsibility in procurement processes. In 2010 the policy, the implementation process of which was  launched in 2009, was also adopted by Pravex Bank, Alexbank, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Romania,  Banca Intesa Russia, Banka Koper, Privredna Banka Zagreb, CIB Bank and Intesa Sanpaolo Bank  Albania. Upon completion of the project, the effectiveness of the model and its consistency with the  principles of the Group will be assessed. E-SOURCING PORTAL After e-sourcing the pilot period began in 2009, the definitive  e-sourcing portal project got underway in 2010. In addition  to the centralised Suppliers List, this module-based platform  will include an area dedicated to online purchases, an area  for communications with suppliers as well as a document  archiving module. Such features will provide a global overview  of the purchasing process: from the start of the requirement  to the issuance of the purchase order. Upon completion of  the project, regular suppliers will be classified on the basis of  economic, financial and technical parameters as well as on  environmental and social responsibility.

SOCIAL REPORT—ENvIRONMENT The challenges posed by climate change are increasingly apparent and urgent: safeguarding the  environment is no longer a niche issue, but a strategic part of the decisions taken by all players,  and therefore, also for financial institutions.  Intesa Sanpaolo adheres to the Financial Institutions UNEP (United Nations Environment  Programme), has joined the UN Global Compact initiative and develops its plans in accordance  with the Environmental Policy approved by the Management Board in 2007. The strategy focuses  on controlling and managing direct and indirect environmental impacts.  Regarding direct impacts - generated by the Bank's transactions – the Group is involved in monitoring  and implementing initiatives to improve the management of energy, waste, green purchasing and  maintenance of buildings and facilities, to make its ecological footprint lighter. In terms of indirect impacts, generated by its customers and suppliers, Intesa Sanpaolo can have a  positive influence by promoting the adoption of environmentally friendly choices. On this front, the  Bank is engaged in: offering products and services that foster the enhancement of energy efficiency and a diversification    of energy sources for customers;  integration of social-environmental criteria in risk assessment models for granting credit to    businesses and, by adhering to the Equator Principles and their progressive implementation, to  project finance.  gradual integration of social-environmental criteria in the selection of our suppliers.     The Group is a partner of the Carbon Disclosure Project V through which the Bank reports its  carbon dioxide emissions, the identification of risks, opportunities and strategies implemented in  the fight against climate change. Finally, Intesa Sanpaolo was the first bank in Europe to become partner in the European  Commissions campaign Sustainable Energy Europe; the Bank has signed a collaboration  agreement with the Ministry of the Environment to further strengthen cooperation in terms of  energy saving and the promotion of renewable energy in Italy. ENvIRONMENT     55 Direct impacts are monitored by the Environmental Sustainability Office of the CSR Unit coordinated  by the Groups Energy Manager, having the following duties: periodically, thoroughly monitor the most significant direct environmental impacts, especially    related to energy, identifying and suggesting improvements in line with the best practices; drive optimisation activities, in particular in terms of purchases and management, to ensure the    reduction of energy consumption and raw materials and the containment and proper disposal of  waste;  pursue an increase in eco-efficiency, promoting the use of technologies, solutions and products    with lower environmental impact, based on cost-benefit analysis. Issues related to mobility are handled by the Mobility Manager who coordinates the initiatives and  best solutions for the needs of corporate and personal mobility.  In 2010 Intesa Sanpaolo concluded its three-year plan for environmental improvement, which  was primarily focused on reducing energy consumption. A plan which, for the period 2011-2013,  will continue with interventions aimed at having a positive impact on all areas of environmental  sustainability. ENvIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (SGAE) In 2010, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group was the first bank in Italy to integrate the ISO 14001 certified  Environmental Management System with the Energy Management System in 180 sites. The UNI  EN 16001 standard defines technical characteristics and guides companies in understanding and  measuring different types of energy consumption by type of user. The process starts from an initial  energy analysis to highlight areas for improvement, and a definition of qualitative and quantitative  objectives to be achieved through the application of the best technology, lighting and air conditioning  solutions available on the market. Through the analysis of the most significant environmental  and energy issues – polluting emissions, paper consumption, waste, harmful substances, water  and maintenance, which are the core elements of our Environmental Policy – the same issues  are managed with integrated procedures of excellence. The certified branches and buildings  represent a geographically significant sample through which the Bank monitors and measures their  performances and that they match the targets that have been set by means of specific procedures  and regular audits. Progressive improvement measures are implemented at the sites, flanked by  specific training for the delegates at the certified sites. NEw TURIN HEADqUARTERS Environmental sustainability criteria and energy efficiency  for the entire life cycle of the building were adopted in the  planning of the New Turin Headquarters, a 166 m high  tower that will house 2,000 employees. The design and management features will allow the building  to be classified according to the Sustainable Building  Council protocol, with a score of 3.5 on a scale ranging  from -1 to 5, where 3 corresponds to the best available  building practice as provided for by applicable law. With the start of works, the Bank extended its commitment  and responsibility towards the environment to the General  Contractor responsible for the construction of the tower. The  complex process of running the site and the construction  work is now subject to the Environmental Management  System, certified according to the international UNI EN  ISO 14001 standard and the European EMAS standard. CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT SHAREHOLDERS SUPPLIERS DIRECT IMPACTS  56. SOCIAL REPORT—ENvIRONMENT RENEwABLE SOURCES  For many years, the Group has been using electricity produced from renewable sources wherever  possible. In Italy this type of supply, mainly generated by hydroelectric plants, exceeded 92% of  electricity consumption (over 211,000 tons of annual CO2 emissions avoided), which are flanked by  RECS1 certified supplies and a limited self-production from co-generation. The self-production of  energy from renewable sources, such as photovoltaic, appears to be limited by the type of property:  most branches are located on the ground floors of apartment buildings and have no exposure to the  south; often branches and buildings, especially the larger ones, have technical and architectural  constraints since they are situated in historical centres.  However, innovative sample solutions have been developed. A photovoltaic tracker was built  at a branch in Turin with a capacity of approximately 12 kWp, characterised by a liquid cooling  system of the photovoltaic cells which allows for an annual production that is about 30% higher  than traditional plants and contributes to providing part of the energy needs of that branch. An LCD  display positioned inside the branch shows the energy output in real-time thanks to software which,  in addition to displaying information about the performance of the plant, also converts it into the  amount of CO2 emissions saved. Customers and visitors can see the real performance of this type  of plants. Innovative initiatives have also been launched abroad: Banka Koper in Slovenia has built  two 44 kWp photovoltaic plants in the branches of Koper and Seana. ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY As well as being the result of better management, the reduction of energy consumption is brought  about by being knowledgeable about the different areas where it is used such as lighting, air  conditioning and office equipment. The in-depth analyses, carried out with on-site measurements  in collaboration with Universities, have made it possible to refine the estimates of consumption  of these items. These analyses revealed that office equipment has a consumption percentage  incidence equal to that of the electrical system and air conditioning. In order to minimise the environmental impact, the Group has launched monitoring, rationalisation  and innovation initiatives in these areas. Such monitoring is carried out with the latest innovative  technologies that measure the energy consumption and temperatures of premises even via web.  This allows for easier and more accurate identification of critical issues and an assessment of  the effectiveness of improvements carried out. These initiatives will be strengthened with the  Sustainable Energy Action Plan for the 2011-2013 period. In 2010, overall energy consumption decreased by more than 6%, corresponding to about 11,000  toe, of which 3.3% for electricity consumption and 21.2% for heat consumption. Particularly in Italy,  electricity consumption savings in 2010 was almost equal to 35 GWh compared to 20082, thanks to  improvements in the management of technological systems. As for heat consumption, part of the  savings are due to the growing use of electric heat pumps to replace traditional boilers, as well as  the optimisation of spaces. The measures to reduce energy consumption also involved all the International Subsidiary Banks:  in particular, Intesa Sanpaolo Banka Bosna i Hercegovina replaced its heating systems and office  AN 800 w COMPANY To briefly characterise a companys energy consumption,  it is customary to divide its annual energy consumption  (in kWh) by 8,760 hours of the year and the number of  employees working for the company. That is how the  pro capita index representing the average power use  (W) is calculated. In Italy the parameter for the banking  sector is close to 1,000 W (source Terna 2009); in Italy,  our Group is on average, an 800 W company thanks  also in part to the reduction of energy consumption (in  2009 it was an 820 W company). Energy management  measures planned for the coming years aim at having  the Group become a 700 W company in 2015.

NOTE     57 equipment with more energy-efficient options.   Great attention was paid to new branches and those where restructuring was carried out. To limit  energy consumption, extensive use was made of double glazing, high performance condensing  boilers, refrigeration units and heat pumps with HFC, etc. The quality of these installations is  attested by energy Certifications under Italian Legislative Decree 192/05. For example, with the  restructuring of the Group's largest service centre in Moncalieri, near Turin, the two buildings have  passed from energy certification class E to class C. In the same vein, the Slovak VUB Banka,  which has carried out interventions on its properties, has equipped them with more efficient lighting  systems, heating insulation and thermostatic valves to control the heating. The gradual replacement of office equipment with lower consumption models shows significant  results, with savings of between 20 and 40% over previous models. Totally, savings were  approximately 10 GWh compared to 2008. Other actions included the replacement of illuminated  signs with major use of LED signage: about 97% of 5,000 signs replaced in 2010 are LED. This  operation, as well as guaranteeing energy savings of about 70% compared to fluorescent lamps,  also contributes significantly to the reduction of light pollution. MOBILITY The Mobility Management unit coordinated all aspects related to the movement of persons, proposing  the most efficient solutions and integrating different mobility tools. The main initiative implemented in 2010 is the Mobility Office, an application available on the Intranet  providing access to information and services directly from workstations: public transport; trains; and bus  passes, bike sharing (service active in Florence, Turin and Milan); corporate bike sharing (130 corporate  bicycles), in Milan, Turin, Padua and Parma, which can be used both for work-related purposes and  in ones spare time; integrated sharing allowing all employees to rent cars, motorcycles and bicycles  for personal travel to the work place for whatever length of time they need (tests in Milan); car pooling,  a group mobility option to manage work-related journeys between the Milan Bisceglie and Turin  Moncalieri headquarters; shuttle system to support local public transport in Vicenza, Venice - Mestre,  Turin, Padua, Milan, Naples and Bologna. The collaboration with the Public Administrations, stimulated  by the presentation of home-work commuting plans, found a first implementation in Turin, where an  integrated system managed directly by the local public transport company to connect the city to the  business complex of Moncalieri started in June. The home-work commuting plans project, which began  in 2009, started from a preliminary study in cities with the highest concentration of employees. In 2010  with listening initiatives involving some 3,000 directly affected employees, the project was extended to  Padua, Florence, Venice and Bologna. Over 2,000 questionnaires were drawn up and the findings from  these, along with the needs as gathered from focus groups which were attended by about 100 people -  leading to numerous proposals which were shared with the Public Administrations.  To further reduce the environmental impact, from the end of 2010, the mobility analysis is conducted  on a quarterly basis, thus facilitating more precise control and more incisive interventions on CO2  emissions according to type of carrier (rail, plane, corporate fleet vehicles and personal cars used on  company business).

SOCIAL REPORT—ENvIRONMENT MOBILITY AND CO2 EMISSIONS The monitoring project of the emissions from corporate  mobility started in 2008 and involved 89% of Italian employees  whose data are handled by the Mobility Manager. In 2010,  the analysis covered all Italy through the projection of data  and related CO2 emissions by type of carrier. Also in 2010  monitoring systems, with assessment of the actual fleet  consumption drawn from the fuel card data with each vehicle,  were fine-tuned. On the basis of the analysis the parameters  for the conversion of fleet emissions were updated: the  reduction in emissions of about 9% is attributable for about  21% to the change in coefficients which have become more  accurate than the previous year. To reduce mobility, the use of videoconferences was heavily  promoted: in 2010 8,844 multi-conferences were centrally  monitored. As regards the International Subsidiary Banks, of particular note is the activation of the pilot project  of a company bike sharing initiative by the Hungarian CIB and the Slovenian Koper, and the  gradual renewal by the Ukrainian Pravex and the Russian Banca Intesa of their fleets with more  environmentally friendly cars. THE REDUCTION OF ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIONS  In 2010 there was a further, significant reduction in CO2 emissions by 26.5% in electricity and heat  consumption. 15% of this reduction can be traced back to the update of processing factors following  the evolution of energy production systems. In this sense, complex research and development  were carried out on the most recent publications, taking into account, in addition to greenhouse  gases which have a direct impact (carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4),  hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), properly traced  in CO2 equivalent, even the most significant gases involved in an indirect manner: sulphur dioxide  (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX).  With regard to emissions related to corporate mobility, there was a measurable increase in emission  in the order of +2,242 t of CO2 compared to 2009. This figure is misleading (see box): comparing  the data with constant parameters there is a reduction of 2% due to better use being made of  vehicles. Activities undertaken have helped to reduce direct emissions by 24.7% (Scope1: heating and  company fleet) and indirect emissions by 26% (Scope2: building heating and electricity). Emissions  for Scope3 (mobility and other indirect emissions) have, on the other hand, increased by 13%: with  constant data, they have decreased by 1%.

In 2011, along with the Ministry of the Environment,  the project for the experimental use of Blue Angel and EU Ecolabel-certified recycled paper was  started for operating points dedicated to Individual customers. In Italy, overall paper consumption  was reduced by 0.5%, also due to the reduction in size of the banking transparency leaflets sent  to customers. At Group level consumption is stable, even if some International Subsidiary Banks,  such as Banca Intesa Beograd and Intesa Sanpaolo Banka Bosna i Hercegovina, have launched  pilot projects to reduce consumption.  The long term plan regarding outsourced customer communication services for reducing  consumption through the dematerialisation of documents, continued. This activity cut consumption  of paper by 650 tonnes in Italy, avoiding over 1,500 tons of CO2 emissions. wATER In the Intesa Sanpaolo Group water is usually only used for sanitary purposes. Consumption per  unit of the Group is of 38 cubic meters per employee. In Italy, consumption per employee is about  45 cubic meters.

SOCIAL REPORT—ENvIRONMENT wASTE Awareness programmes that had been started in previous years to reduce waste, as well as a  more correct use of waste collection, led to a reduction of 15% in the amount of waste produced  compared to 2009. The result is mainly due to the full implementation of a toner collection and  replacement service. Moreover, there is a considerable reduction in hazardous waste due both to  the gradual replacement of cathode tube monitors with LCD monitors and the purchase of products  that do not generate hazardous waste. Although there is a slight increase in the disposal of office  equipment, linked to their gradual replacement aimed at energy savings, there is a reduction in the  total volume of waste generated. The abroad segment is substantially stable, the slight increase  being attributable to a heightened sensitivity to the differentiated collection and disposal of waste  and improved monitoring systems. ENvIRONMENT-RELATED EXPENSES AND INvESTMENTS 2010 also saw an increase in expenses for environmental protection, mainly due to plants  maintenance, waste management, certification and training systems. Abroad, this increase is  related to the progressive implementation of procedures for environmental protection. With regard  to compliance with environmental laws, there were no reports of environmental damage, nor  significant penalties relating to these events.  2010 AwARDS The earnestness of the activities undertaken to reduce the ecological footprint enabled the Group  to obtain a number of prestigious national and international awards: Intesa Sanpaolo was the first  bank in Europe to become partner in the European Commissions campaign Sustainable Energy  Europe and the Bank has signed a collaboration agreement with the Ministry of the Environment  to make cooperation in energy saving and promotion of renewable energy in Italy continually more  concrete and intense. The Bank also gained 13th place in the ranking of the 25 most sustainable  companies in the world by Newsweek; the first Italian company and third bank in the world to do  so, and in 2010, won, among other honours, the Demetra Prize for the best sustainable industrial  project for the 2020 Energy Award for Il Sole 24 Ore and Energia 24, the Special Direct Impact  Prize at the 2010 Green Globe Banking Awards and a number of honourable mentions in various  national competitions, including the Green Public Procurement and Premio Impresa Ambiente  (Environment Enterprise Award). COMPLETE TONER SERvICE As from 2009, used toner cartridges are recycled in Italy  by the external photocopier and printer maintenance  company. In 2010 the service was extended significantly  within the Group, as can be seen from the following data:  over 107,000 kg compared to over 14,000 kg in 2009.

The Bank acts towards environmental  sustainability through: the range of products for individuals, businesses and public entities wishing to invest in    energy efficiency and renewable energy; project financing for the production of electricity from renewable sources;      strategic investments in leading Italian companies in the renewable energy industry.    At the same time, the environmental impacts of our corporate customers and projects are carefully  evaluated in terms of creditworthiness, especially for sensitive industries.  In 2010, of the total funds allocated, almost 1% was for financing the sectors of renewable energy,  agriculture and environmental protection. The amount comes to approximately 3.4 billion euro.  GREEN PRODUCTS AND FUNDING  Intesa Sanpaolo offers a wide range of financing and advisory services to support investments in  the sectors of energy from renewable sources, energy efficiency and the environment. Particular  attention is constantly paid to the photovoltaic industry, supporting the design, production and  installation of plants producing electricity from photovoltaic panels. This financing provides for the  assignment of credit accepted by the Gestore Servizi Energetici with the subsequent granting of  the incentives established by law.  As for private and family loans, in 2010 the Bank granted nearly 9,000 loans amounting to  approximately 172 million euro to finance the installation of photovoltaic panels and the purchase of  ecological cars, new generation boilers, environmentally friendly appliances and thermal insulation.  The introduction of floating-rates, which allowed customers to take advantage of favourable market  conditions, the reduction of the fixed rate and the development of national and local partnerships  with installers of photovoltaic systems, resulted in a considerable increase in financing compared  to the 7 million disbursed in 2009. Overall, production companies receive just under a billion euro from the Group for energy efficiency  and renewable energy. Specifically, 236 loans were disbursed, for a total of approximately 37  million euro, to small businesses and professionals. In 2010 the first financing operations of Energy  Service Companies - ESCOs for various interventions in the energy field (photovoltaic, solar heating,  energy efficiency measures), with particular attention paid to public sector, were carried out.  With regard to businesses, in 2010 loans amounting to some 688 million euro were granted to  support projects related to the use of photovoltaic panels, biomass and hydroelectric plants and  INDIRECT IMPACTS FOSTERING  INNOvATIvE  GREEN  TECHNOLOGIES Technological innovation plays a key role in sustainable  energy: new energy sources, increasingly more efficient  and inexpensive energy production systems, devices and  processes aimed at reducing end-use consumption are  just some examples that show how the industry is deeply  affected by continuous evolution.  Even in this field, Intesa Sanpaolo Group is on the side of the  entrepreneurs employing skills and financial tools to support  the costs of research and development. Specifically, the  launch of the Intesa Sanpaolo Start-Up Initiative, a training and  promotion programme for emerging high-tech companies.  Through this initiative, the Bank facilitates the meeting  between start-ups and potential investors (including venture  capital, business angels, corporations and private investors).  Start-Up Initiative events specialise in technology and one of  the main focuses is Clean Tech: renewable energy, energy  efficiency, water and environment. The process involves  several selection and training steps for start-ups, culminating  in a number of opportunities to meet investors, both in Italy  and at the premises of the International Subsidiary Banks.  62. SOCIAL REPORT—ENvIRONMENT INTESA SANPAOLO EURODESK  Intesa Sanpaolo Eurodesk provides assistance and  advisory services to companies wishing to access  European Union financing opportunities, with a particular  focus on research and technological innovation. The  company acts as a partner in the projects financed by  the European Commission, thus facilitating interaction  between the financial, business and academic world. Through Intesa Sanpaolo Eurodesk, we adhered to the  Energy Efficient Buildings European Initiative. E2B EI is  an association consisting of public and private entities  launched by the European Commission to promote  the development of new technologies in the energy  efficiency of buildings.  Intesa Sanpaolo Eurodesk is a partner in three major  transnational research projects co-financed by the  European Commission in renewable sources and energy  efficiency (FC-DISTRICT, E-HUB and Euro-China Clean  Energy Centre). In particular, the FC DISTRICT project, launched in 2010  and led by the Polish construction company Mostostal  Warszawa, aims to develop an innovative concept of  producing and distributing energy enabling the creation  of districts that are self-sufficient energy-wise. This  aim will be pursued through the study and integration  of innovative technologies such as decentralised  cogeneration achieved through micro fuel cells located  at the end users premises, power distribution intelligent  networks, heat storage in buildings and districts, high  thermal insulation efficiency systems and development  of biodigesters for the production of biomass from local  waste. The role of Intesa Sanpaolo Eurodesk in the project  is that of business modelling and the dissemination of the  results. energy efficiency measures. To support entrepreneurs who planned investments in renewable  energy, Mediocredito Italiano Energy Desk continues to be active by providing a comprehensive  service that ranges from credit to advice on the new technologies in new energy.  A significant number of financing was granted for plants for the production of energy from renewable  sources through Leasint, the Groups company dedicated to lease transactions. In 2010 these  financings were increased greatly in support of the development of systems for the production of  energy from renewable sources. In 2010, 417 contracts were signed for a total of approximately  1,208 million euro. The Bank also supports its customers through commercial agreements with leading companies in  the renewable energy industry, including Enel.si and Schco Italia. The agreement with Schco  includes the opportunity for the provider to offer customers a free energy check-up carried out by  installers selected by Schco International (a plants manufacturer) in the interested area, while the  agreement with Enel.si includes favourable conditions for small businesses customers who install   a photovoltaic plant.  The Groups International Subsidiary Banks are also very active in their offerings of green products.  Banca Intesa Beograd has signed an agreement with the European Bank of Reconstruction and  Development (EBRD) to finance corporate projects aiming to increase energy efficiency and  produce energy from renewable sources. Banka Koper offers financing for photovoltaic plants  and has signed a cooperation agreement with the Slovenian Environmental Public Fund under  which the Bank finances environmental investments (households and companies) on behalf of  the fund. The Slovak VUB bank offers co-financing for the development of renewable energy in  cooperation with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and EBRD, as well as financing for energy  efficiency in buildings. The Croatian PBZ offers co-financing in the environmental field for SMEs  and municipalities in collaboration with development banks such as EIB, EBRD and Croatian Bank  for Reconstruction and Development. Lastly, Intesa Sanpaolo supports the food farming, agro-industrial and agro-energy industries with  Agriventure, a specialized body providing advisory services to businesses in the field along the  entire chain. Often the Bank's financing operations integrate EU funds aimed at the promotion and  development of rural areas.     63 PROjECT FINANCING AND ADOPTION OF THE EqUATOR PRINCIPLES The Group adopted the Equator Principles V in 2006. The Principles, that protect natural resources,  health and human rights, cultural property and biodiversity, are applicable to the financing of  projects with a capital cost equal to or greater than 10 million U.S. dollars. An inter-departmental  working group was set up, coordinated by the Corporate Social Responsibility Unit and made up of  representatives from the departments most involved in project financing operations and supported  by an external partner. In 2010 the working group developed an internal policy that provides  operational guidelines for the correct application of the Principles. The classification of projects  based on three levels of risk and the choice of a specific path, according to the assigned category,  requires transparent and immediate involvement of our customers, to whom we offer ample support  to mitigate the identified risks. The policy, incorporated in the Groups regulations, was subsequently made available in the foreign  offices of Banca IMI (London, New York and Hong Kong hubs) and published in their Intranet  section. To facilitate the implementation of the policy in all its parts, a training course has been  conceived, which includes operational modules dedicated to the specialists in Project Finance,  Advisory and Export Finance in Italy and abroad. The first session was held in 2010.  The commitment in implementing the Principles is an important step in the sustainability strategy  of the Bank's credit activities and translates in thoroughly disseminating a greater sensitivity on  the issue and in reducing the risks associated with social and environmental impacts. Proof of this  lies in increasingly more frequent consultations with the CSR Unit to assess the reputational risks  associated with activities that are currently outside the scope of the Principles. DEAL OF THE YEAR 2010 – GANHEKOU wIND FARM The Ganhekou Wind Farm No 8 project is the first wind  farm financed with project financing in China with the  participation, among other international banks (among  which Intesa Sanpaolo), of the World Banks International  Finance Corporation (IFC). The project, with a total value  of about 249 million US dollars, includes the planning,  construction and management of a wind farm in the Gobi  desert (Gansu province) that will have a capacity of 201  MW. Planning was carried out by China Wind Power under  a 25 year concession plan with the local representatives of  Chinas National Development and Reform Commission. Ganhekou No 8 is part of a larger wind power project  (Jiuquan wind power project), which, upon completion,  will have a capacity of 10 GW. It is considered the largest  wind power project in the world. In addition to having  won the 2010 Deal of the Year award, the project was  also registered in the list of CDM (Clean Development  Mechanism, one of the Kyoto Protocol instruments). Its  reduction of CO2 emissions was estimated at 412,000  tonnes per year.

SOCIAL REPORT—ENvIRONMENT DEvELOPMENT OF RENEwABLE ENERGY AND THE EMISSION MARKET  Of particular interest in the environmental field is the activity carried out by Equiter, the Intesa  Sanpaolo Groups company investing its capital in the utilities, infrastructures, public property and  environmental sectors and in companies and projects aimed at developing the eco-sustainable  growth of the country. Equiter participates in two joint ventures, Enerpoint Energy and Gica,  respectively active in the dissemination of renewable energy and combating climate change.  Equiter is also a major shareholder in Enerpoint, a leading Italian company active in the photovoltaic  industry downstream (distribution, sales and installation) and is a member of the Ambienta fund, a  leading Italian investor in the areas of renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste treatment and  waste water. Building on its long experience, in 2010 Enerpoint installed and sold panels for a total capacity of  about 100 MWp, holding a significant share of the domestic market. Among its major projects are  the completion of the first stage of the C.A.S.E. project, which included the installation of 4.7 MWp  of photovoltaic panels on the roofs of the new anti-seismic houses in Aquila and the building of  a large fully integrated photovoltaic greenhouse with a capacity of over 4 MWp in Sardinia. The  electricity produced by the plants installed by the company so far has avoided the emission of over  127,000 tonnes of CO2. With regard to the activity carried out in the carbon asset market (subject to the Kyoto protocol  commitments), Gica, the company set up with leading industrial players to create and trade emission  credits, continue to manage its portfolio of CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) projects which  had been set up in previous years, resulting in the delivery at the end of the year of the first 150,000  certificates (Certified Emission Reduction). As part of its advisory activities, in 2010 Equiter conducted a study to analyse the feasibility of a  public-private fund for setting up projects for the use of renewable sources in North Africa. The study  was commissioned and funded by REEEP (Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Partnership),  an NGO that supports the development and dissemination of renewable energy in developing  countries.  Finally, also in 2010, Equiter maintained its membership in the Associazione Produttori di Energia  da Fonti Rinnovabili (APER), a reference point for operators in the field and an efficient tool to  disseminate the culture of environmental sustainability.  THE STUDI E RICERCHE  PER IL MEZZOGIORNO (SRM)  ASSOCIATION FOR  ENERGY AND THE ENvIRONMENT SRM (Study and Research for the South of Italy) is  an economic research centre of excellence based in  Naples, whose members are Intesa Sanpaolo, Banco di  Napoli, BIIS, IMI Investimenti, Istituto Banco di Napoli -  Fondazione, Banca di Credito Sardo. As part of its research  in analysing the southern part of Italy (with a European  and Mediterranean outlook), SRM has carried out several  undertakings on issues dealing with energy and the  environment. In the past, the Association published three  research papers looking at water resources, which won  awards at international events. In 2010, the Energy and  Territory research paper, presented in Rome under the  patronage of the Italian Senate and the representatives in  Italy of the European Commission, focused attention on  issues of energy efficiency and renewable energy.  SRM also presented two papers on the same topic at  the annual meeting of SIEP - Italian Society of Public  Economics: The intervention of private capital for  financing of energy investments in the South; Energy  sector and public development policies: the state of the  art for Southern Italy. The latter was nominated for the  SIEP 2010 AWARDS. The SRM papers can be found on the Internet at V.                                         65 2010 saw the launch of the Ambientiamo training project for all employees - a multimedia course  in stages, the contents of which are integrated through all available remote tools: video, e-learning,  web TV, radio and company magazines, edu-card and mail. Ambientiamo has four key objectives:  strengthen the environmental culture of Group employees, broaden their understanding of  the effects that daily actions have on the environment, support activities of the Environmental  Sustainability group, establish a starting point for the implementation of additional, future projects  on issues regarding the environment. Related to Ambientiamo, an online area has also been formed  (Ecopost) where links, experiences, knowledge and ideas can be shared to spread best practices  and suggestions for the entire group.  In 2010, Intesa Sanpaolo took part in the sixth energy saving day under the M'illumino di meno  campaign. ATM monitors displayed a message inviting users to turn off their lights at home or limit  their use. In line with the request to turn on lights powered by renewable sources, two branches  in Milan, one in Turin and one in Rome were lit for a few hours after closing time. Furthermore,  in corporate training areas, some important initiatives were carried out to raise employees  awareness: not to use the lift, to refrain from using computers during training sessions and to limit  the use of lights. The Hungarian CIB Bank adhered to Earth Hour: for this event, the lights of the  four largest buildings in Budapest were turned off for one hour and, on the same day, an internal  campaign to raise awareness on environmental issues was launched. For the World Environment  Day, Intesa Sanpaolo and the Russian Banca Intesa launched a series of initiatives to increase  awareness among both customers and employees. Awareness activities and internal campaigns  were also undertaken at the Bank of Alexandria, VUB Banka and the Albania Intesa Sanpaolo  Bank. Moreover, in Italy, agreements have been made for employees to purchase environmentally  friendly products, such as ecological scooters, solar battery chargers, LED lit appliances, devices  to eliminate stand-by modes and so on. Intesa Sanpaolo sponsored the Biodiversity Week, an international event held in Rome in April for  the International Year of Biodiversity, and adhered to the European Sustainable Energy Week by  organising two conferences on energy saving and renewable energy. At the same time, the Mobility Management Intranet site was enriched with new content and a new  intranet site on Environmental Sustainability was launched summarising all issue-related activities.  ENvIRONMENTAL CULTURE 22–26 March  66.SOCIAL REPORT—COMMUNITY Intesa Sanpaolo operates with the aim of serving the needs of its stakeholders in the best possible  way, even beyond aspects that are strictly financial, both in its social and cultural relations with the  territories in which it is active and in the field of international cooperation. This commitment has  not failed in a period marked by the economic crisis that especially continues to affect the weaker  segments of the population.  In making its contribution to overcoming these hard times, Intesa Sanpaolo strengthened its tools  and initiatives aimed at people experiencing economic hardships as well as third sector enterprises,  which are called on to perform increasingly broader social tasks. Through its local units, the Banca  dei Territori has initiated several projects, among which those related to micro-finance and to combat  usury, still a plague in our society. Banca Prossima – the only Italian banking service dedicated to  social and third sector enterprises – has further strengthened its commitment. Looking beyond the European borders, attention has been focused on those communities in  developing countries which have hardly benefited from the advancements made in the last years,  and still live in poverty, in conditions that pose a severe risk to health and survival. In particular, in  the field of international cooperation, Intesa Sanpaolo, in collaboration with Fondazione Cariplo,  focused its interventions on Malawi – one of the poorest countries in the world – to offer an extremely  high level of service in the field of AIDS prevention in the medical, healthcare, assistance and  information areas, through experienced partners and non-governmental organisations (NGO). This  project is integrated by microfinance initiatives and activities in support of orphans and the affected  communities and families. In addition to social solidarity initiatives, Intesa Sanpaolo also supports activities to safeguard  the artistic and cultural heritage that has always represented one of Italys main assets, through  sponsorships and donations. In so doing, it makes a substantial contribution to promoting cultural  development, especially among the younger generations to bring them closer to the great  masterpieces of the past. And it is precisely because of this attention to culture that Intesa Sanpaolo  has long continued to open up its art collections to the public both in its two museums and by  participating or organising cultural events. Different initiatives in different fields, but driven by a common goal: contributing to the development  of territories and people, not only from an economic standpoint, and be an active part of the process  of social development. COMMUNITY    67 Micro-finance continues to be the main opportunity that farmers and small traders in poor  countries of the world have to set up their own businesses. In recent years, it has also gained  popularity in more advanced economies in support of the new poor (emarginated people living  in poverty who face serious difficulties when confronted with even a small, unexpected expense),  and micro-enterprises and craftsmen who cannot access traditional financing channels due to the  inadequacy or absence of collateral. Even in these situations, micro-finance can be an important  tool for economic development and an effective weapon to combat usury. Intesa Sanpaolo, along with the shareholders' Foundations and local non-profit associations has  launched several initiatives in this area by providing around 1.8 million euro in financing. The  interventions have helped small businesses to emerge and families to overcome times of hardship1. Cassa di Risparmio del Veneto continued its Microcredito Sociale Caritas project together  with the Fondazione Cariparo and the Diocese of Padua, Rovigo and Chioggia which involves  granting credit to private entities who have no access to banks, thanks to the risk guarantee  fund specifically set up by the partners taking part in the initiative. In 2010 the fund was  increased by 100,000 euro and covered insolvencies on credit granted in previous years. This  initiative was flanked by the Microcredito Antiusura project, which, in addition to the entities  already active in the Microcredito Sociale project, avails itself of the collaboration of the  Fondazione Beato Tovini of Verona, the only manager in the Veneto region of anti-usury funds  granted by the State in support of individuals. Thanks to this agreement, the classic guarantee  fund, equal to 50% of the loan, is accompanied by the guarantee offered by the risk fund set up by  the Diocese of Padua, Rovigo and Chioggia and the Fondazione Cariparo, thereby covering 100%  of the insolvency risk and making it easier to grant credit even in the most complex cases. In some  provinces of the Veneto region, the initiative is the only facilitated micro-finance tool for people who  have poor requirements in terms of access to banks. A total of 106 loans for over 379,000 euro  were granted. Cassa di Risparmio di Venezia continued to pursue the micro-finance programmes which began  a few years ago to address the financial problems faced by individuals and families most in need.  Under the Microcredito Sociale S. Matteo, in collaboration with Caritas, 25 loans were granted for  65,000 euro and the process was started for 21 applications for 55,000 euro.  Cassa di Risparmio del Friuli Venezia Giulia is a partner of Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio  di Gorizia and Caritas for the Progetto di microcredito sociale e culturale (Social and cultural  micro-finance project). In addition to the initial amount of 100,000 euro contributed in 2008 by the  Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Gorizia and managed by Caritas, in 2010 a further 100,000 euro  MICRO-FINANCE  AND THE FIGHT AGAINST USURY FINANCING OF SOCIAL INITIATIvES  In 2010, in Italy, Intesa Sanpaolo disbursed over 3 billion  euro – nearly 1% of total financing in Italy – for social utility  initiatives (micro-credit and anti-usury projects, products  for sensitive social groups, public utility services), credit  to the Third Sector and guaranteed financing from Confidi.  Abroad, the Groups Banks have financed over 133 million  euro in micro-finance activities. vO.B.I.S. – vOLONTARI BANCARI PER  LE INIZIATIvE NEL SOCIALE In July 2009 VO.B.I.S., Volontari Bancari per le iniziative  nel sociale, was set up as a national non-profit association  formed from former bank employees (the first to sign up  being former employees of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group). The voluntary workers are a pool of top quality skills,  experience and operational potential. The professional  skills acquired during their time at the Bank are made  available to households and non-profit organisations that  find it difficult to gain access to credit, especially during  an economic crisis. Under the Prestito della Speranza programme, volunteers  (currently about 230), grouped in 11 territorial Units, serve  as tutors for families, supporting them in managing the  loan and acting as the first assessors of their applications  to the Banks of the Group. CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT SHAREHOLDERS SUPPLIERS see also the Chapter Customers - Financial Inclusion  1.  V. NOTE   68.SOCIAL REPORT—COMMUNITY were allocated in equal shares by Fondazione and Cassa di Risparmio del Friuli Venezia Giulia.  The initiative is developed in the territory of the Diocese of Gorizia and is managed by Caritas  Diocesana. A total of 42 loans for over 96,000 euro were granted. Most of the loans were requested  to pay overdue utility bills, the purchases of cars, rent payment and medical expenses. In Tuscany in 2009, the Cassa di Risparmio di Pistoia e Pescia, in collaboration with the Fondazione  Cassa di Risparmio Pistoia e Pescia, Fondazione Unraggiodiluce Onlus and Arciconfraternita della  Misericordia of Pistoia, launched a project aimed at private entities, social cooperatives and small  female enterprises, to take on 50% of the global risk divided among the three participating bodies.  A total of 62 loans for 279,000 euro were granted in 2010. Intesa Sanpaolo is part of the Prestito della Speranza, an initiative launched in 2009 by the Italian  Episcopal Conference (CEI) in collaboration with the Italian Banking Association (ABI) to support  families in need, through micro-finance on concessional terms. In 2010, CEI simplified the selection  criteria whith respect to the start-up year in order to increase opportunities for access. The Bank  is part of the initiative both as a provider, through the Banche dei Territori, and as manager of the  Guarantee Fund (Banca Prossima). As a lender, the Group delivered about 60% of the existing  loans to date and is the largest banking partner of the initiative. In 2010 the Group launched several initiatives aimed at combating usury, in collaboration with  foundations active in this area, for a total of 422 loans and a total of almost 5 million euro. In addition to the activities of Fondazione Lombarda Antiusura, of note are: the partnership between Banco di Napoli and FINETICA Onlus, which set up a guarantee fund    to the State Anti-usury Fund. In addition to providing information and credit support services  to applicants (individuals and small businesses), the non-profit organisation completes the  preparatory stage. A total of 282,000 euro loans were granted in 2010; Banca CR Firenze's project, in collaboration with the Fondazione Toscana per la Prevenzione    dellUsura for individuals and small businesses. The project involves assumption of 50% of the  risk by the Fondazione, backed by a special guarantee fund. As at the end of the year, 16 loans  had been granted for a total of 196,000 euro. FONDAZIONE LOMBARDA ANTIUSURA The Fondazione Lombarda Antiusura Onlus (Lombardy  Anti-Usury Foundation), founded in 1997 by Cariplo Spa  in collaboration with Fondazione Cariplo and Caritas  Ambrosiana, operates in defence of individuals and small  businesses at risk of usury through a guarantee fund to  cover the credit granted. The process of listening to and  selecting the applications is performed through sector  experts, employees or retired members of the Intesa  Sanpaolo Group, who intervene not only from a technical  point of view, but also act as a listening and guidance  centre in identifying the funding required to remedy critical  situations. Since it was set up, the Foundation – acting as guarantor  or to cover interest – has enabled 394 entities to gain  access to Bank loans for a total of almost 6 million euro.  The Foundation is also the Banks partner in two other  projects: Anticipazione Sociale and PR.IM.I. - Progetto  Imprenditori Immigrati.    69 BANCA PROSSIMA Banca Prossima is the Intesa Sanpaolo Group Bank dedicated to lay and religious non-profit  organisations, designed to better meet the needs of Third sector enterprises. Three years after its start- up, Banca Prossima has 11,500 customers and over 3.5 billion euro in deposits and loans with excellent  credit quality (a 0.4% deterioration in credit quality compared to the national average of 5.5%). Banca Prossima actively operates through a special risk fund that allows action to be taken for  entities and projects that would otherwise have no access to credit: the Fund for the Development  of Social Enterprise. As at 31 December 2010, a total of 677 accounts were hedged by the Fund,  for a total commitment of over 51 million euro with 508 counterparties. In order to effectively meet the financial needs of the social enterprises, Banca Prossima worked  to open medium-long term financing from the European Investment Bank (EIB). In the agreement  between EIB and Intesa Sanpaolo, worth up to 470 million euro, part of the lines have been  earmarked for the Third sector and, in 2010, thanks to this particular type of financing, Banca  Prossima was able to provide financing to social enterprises for a total of 35 million euro, of which  20 covered by the above-mentioned agreement. In 2010 the number of employees increased from 198 to 271 (+35%). Most of the new entries  comprise young people with university degrees and university masters in the Third sector.  Substantial effort went in to training employees with a total of 3,720 days of training. Credit advances were granted for organisations making use of the 5 per mille (five per  thousand) income tax allocations; a lending offer which, since its launch in 2008, was enriched  with new products: Tutto 5x1.000 - Scelte, overdraft facilities for organisations that know the  number of donors but not the amount, Tutto 5x1.000 - Campagna, loans for organisations  that in the past raised resources through the 5x1.000 and wish to produce a marketing and  communication campaign to raise funds in 2011. During 2010 some 3.2 million euro in contributions  were advanced. As part of the Group's participation in the Prestito della Speranza initiative, Banca Prossima  was selected as Guarantee Fund manager: it manages access to the Fund guarantees for loans  made by the entire banking system, assists the participating banks, informs and advises the Italian  Episcopal Conference on the status of the loans and their development, provides the IT system on  which participating banks exchange loan information. SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL ENTERPRISE THE COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL ENTERPRISES  EvALUATION MODEL  At the start of the Banca Prossima project there was an  obvious lack of access to credit by non-profit organisations  and an equally apparent lack of data available to the  banking system to evaluate it. By starting to gather the relevant information, the Bank  began to assess customers based on sustainability of  their debt and their social project, which would also take  into account the peculiarities of the non-profit world and  its specific intangible assets: this is how the Community  and Social Enterprises Evaluation Model came into  being. Subsequently, Banca Prossima implemented a new registry  to better identify Third Sector customers and reclassify its  financial data in collaboration with the Centrale Bilanci.  This in turn enabled the Risk Management Department to  develop an Evaluation Model which is even more effective  in terms of statistics and performance. The model serves a dual purpose: it allows significant  aspects that are barely considered in traditional rating  models to be captured, and it plays an educational role for  the customers who learn to count and recount the social  value of their work. To fully exploit the opportunities that this model offers, in  2010 Banca Prossima (in some pilot areas, with planned  expansion in 2011 to the whole country) has become the  only company of Banca dei Territori Division appointed to  assign a rating and to give credit to a counterparty from  the non-profit sector.  70.SOCIAL REPORT—COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP wITH THE THIRD SECTOR Today, the Third sector is an important player in Italy with a complementary and subsidiary role with  regard to public institutions. Thanks to the freedom of initiative and the close ties with the territory,  it helps meet the demand for social services which often remains unmet. The Third sector organisations are now recognised as being able to create social capital and  relational assets, try out innovative services, carry out real prevention as regards risks to the  hardships and degradation of our communities. In addition to having a Group Bank dedicated to this field (Banca Prossima), Intesa Sanpaolo has,  over time, developed a close collaboration with social enterprises working in the welfare field, to  launch projects to support families in areas only partially covered by the public sector: care for  children, the disabled and the elderly. The first project, launched in 2004, was Progetto Asili Nidi (PAN) (Crche Project), which, through  close collaboration with the leading Italian social enterprise networks, sought to facilitate the creation  of childcare facilities, combining quality and sustainable costs. A significant project, especially in  a country like Italy, which is still far from achieving the Lisbon objective on crches: 33 places per  100 children by 2010. With similar methods to those of the Consorzio PAN, the Banks commitment was widened to other  social areas: the elderly, the disabled and education, which gave rise to projects such as: Fondazione Talenti for the development of welfare services;   AL.FA – Unaltra famiglia dopo di noi sheltered communities for people with disabilities    and financial solutions for their families; Welfare Lecco to build the first social guarantee consortium in Italy.   PAN - PROGETTO ASILI NIDO CRCHE PROjECT V The Consorzio PAN – Crche project was established with  the largest networks of social entrepreneurship (CGM,  DROM - Legacoop, FISM, Con-Opera) to meet the needs  of high quality services for children and help women  return to work after maternity leave. PAN aims to facilitate  the establishment of new crches and childcare facilities  with a dual purpose: support social enterprises financially and in the planning    and operational management of the crches; ensure high quality standards to families – regularly    assessed by a technical-scientific committee – with  the option to apply for financing at special rates to pay  crche fees. To date, 416 crches have become affiliated with PAN,  caring for over 12,000 children and employing about 3,000  individuals, almost exclusively young people with relevant  qualifications, with the creation of 1,000 new jobs. Over 6 million euro were disbursed to finance start-ups  and to purchase furniture. The PAN experience shows that  developing quality services for children through social  enterprises is possible and virtuous, with employment  and social benefits for the communities.    71 DONATIONS Donations from Intesa Sanpaolos Fund for charitable social and cultural contributions were spread  across the traditional areas: social, environmental, cultural and religious. The annual plan, approved  by the Supervisory Board, outlined areas of intervention combining projects that focus on people,  especially those most socially vulnerable, on solidarity and support to the community, always  favouring the social impact of the supported initiatives. The Bank is committed to only supporting  projects and initiatives, and not the ordinary business of applying bodies. The intervention is aimed  at projects which entail totally free services. The Fund sought to meet the needs that are not  covered by large Foundations, with particular attention to small and medium size organisations and  localised projects for specific social needs. In the social area, interventions were mainly aimed at: scientific research in the health field, especially to enhance the quality of life and the development    of people; participation in the challenge against social exclusion, through training programmes and inclusion    in the labour market; family support, with particular attention to programmes for people in need;   development of projects to face delicate situations concerning elderly and disabled people in    difficult condition, by supporting families in providing care and assistance. In the cultural field, contributions were granted for projects regarding: specialised preparation of professionals, according to criteria of international excellence, to continually    add new lustre to the traditions of theatre, opera, ballet and music; dissemination of art, music and theatre both to disadvantaged people and in schools in favour of    children and young talents who do not have sufficient financial means. In the religious field, resources were allocated to initiatives of solidarity and charity. At the national level, support for projects related to the 150th anniversary of the Unification of Italy and  to local communities of the Abruzzo region were particularly relevant. Internationally, Project Malawi  was flanked by interventions in favour of developing countries. Even the Banks of the Group, both in  Italy and abroad, have continued to support the local communities in which they operate, contributing  to a number of initiatives V.  Approximately 22 million euro was disbursed in 2010, 15.2 million of which by Group Companies  in Italy and 6.8 million euro by International Subsidiary Banks (as an example: Intesa Sanpaolo  Bank Albania donated 85,000 euro for buying food for families in the province of Shkodra hit by  floods in January 2010). REBUILDING SCHOOLS IN ABRUZZO Through the Fondazione Intesa Sanpaolo Onlus, Intesa  Sanpaolo made a one million euro contribution to support  the population affected by the April 2009 earthquake in  LAquila. The sum, which was added to the donations of  some 11,000 employees for a total of 1,500,000 euro, will  be used to build 10 new classrooms at the Istituto Tecnico  Rendina school, to restore the gym and locker rooms of  the Istituto Professionale Leonardo da Vinci school and to  complete the gym at the High School Andrea Bafile. MILAN MUNICIPALITY PROjECT TO  SUPPORT CO-DEvELOPMENT AND  SAFEGUARD BIODIvERSITY In the 2008-2010 period, Intesa Sanpaolo contributed  over one million euro to the city of Milans of international  solidarity and cooperation activities, undertaken with the  Foundations and the citys main banking institutions. This  enabled the launch of 108 projects in Africa, Latin America,  Europe and Asia, selected through public bids targeted at  food safety, education, defence and increase in biodiversity  and the fight against malnutrition. 7.3% Local initiatives 4.3% 10.5% Other 23.4% 8.2% Health sopport  and research 3.9% 6.7% Support for  families 5.2% 7.4% Training university  research and  study grants 45.8% 22.6% Cultural heritage 4.3% 37.3% National and  international  solidarity initiatives  13.1% DONATION DISTRIBUTED [%] ITALY 2010  ABROAD 2010  72.SOCIAL REPORT—COMMUNITY PROjECT MALAwI Project Malawi is a humanitarian initiative launched in 2005 by Intesa Sanpaolo and Fondazione  Cariplo to achieve two objectives: fighting AIDS, starting from prevention of transmission from  mother to child and contributing to the development of Malawi, one of the 20 poorest countries  in the world, through well-defined actions to improve living conditions. The integrated approach will include the involvement of four partners in various fields: healthcare  (Comunit di SantEgidio with the Dream protocol), care for orphans and vulnerable children (Save  the Children), education and prevention (Malawi Magga and Sam Scouts) and local development  and micro-finance (Cisp). Intesa Sanpaolo and Fondazione Cariplos total contribution for the  second three-year period of activity (2008-2011) amounted to 9 million euro. 2010 saw the achievement of important results. In the healthcare sector the activity of four  laboratories, nine clinical centres and the five related maternity units continued: over 13,000  patients started antiretroviral therapy, 3,800 HIV-positive pregnant women were referred to  vertical prevention programme and about 3,000 children were born healthy through the use of  tri-therapy. Since the project started, around 300,000 medical visits and 155,000 laboratory tests  have been carried out. Training of over 700 local health operators on the use of the DREAM  protocol continued. Each month 42 tons of food were distributed to patients and their families. Sixty-two day care centres run by local community members (selected, trained and brought  together in management committees) are home to about 4,000 orphans and vulnerable children  aged between 3-6 every year, while meetings providing support and prevention and leisure  activities were organised with volunteer educators trained in psychosocial support and early  childhood development for around 2,500 vulnerable children aged between 7 and 13. 1,600  chronically ill adults and children and their families have received home care by volunteers of  the communities involved. Training and refresher courses for SMEs were organised and about 280 of them were assisted  in the presentation of project plans to micro-finance institutions. 95 income-generating activities  were set up, involving about 1,800 families and 62 informal groups of savings and credit were  established in rural areas, with over 1,150 direct beneficiaries. Scout units are active in 158 schools and over 21,300 young people are involved in activities to  raise awareness about the risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and in sex education.  Over 1,900 young people benefited from free HIV testing and counselling service at the Scout  Centre in Blantyre. HIv PREvENTION The focus of the DREAM (Drug Resource Enhancement  against Aids and Malnutrition) healthcare intervention by  the Community of Sant'Egidio is the use of tri-therapy for  the prevention of HIV transmission from mother to child.  The rate of vertical transmission measured at 12 months  in the DREAM centres is 2.2% compared with 10-12%  reported when only monotherapy protocols are used.  Currently more than 50% of all pregnant women in Malawi  undergoing tri-therapy are treated at the DREAM centres.  The Government is considering adopting tri-therapy at  the national level, thereby adhering to the new guidelines  of the World Health Organization launched in 2010. NUTRITION AS EDUCATION Project Malawi, through Save the Children, supports  communities in facing the problem of child nutrition  through education and supplying resources to farmers,  and involving communities to contribute in the preparation  of meals. The supply of seeds and fertilizers to community  groups is a nutritional support and provides a motive for  children and their parents to go to the reception centres.  In the first two years of the second phase of the project,  nutritional training and resources have been provided:  much emphasis was placed on the engagement of the  community in order to allow the same communities to take  on responsibility for the activity, directly contributing to the  production and preparation of meals for children in the  centres.    73 SPONSORSHIPS Attention to the community and proximity to the territory are also reflected in partnerships and  sponsorships of initiatives aimed at civil, social, as well as economic development. There were  several areas of intervention that aimed to: promote and support the dissemination of culture, art and music as a common heritage and    to promote their use to an increasingly wider audience, especially among young people. The  commitment is infused in the support of major cultural activities and institutions of excellence in  exhibitions, festivals and events aimed at sensitising the public on wide-ranging topics through  meetings, debates and talks; make business/financial issues better known especially to young people, to help them become    informed citizens, to support initiatives of scientific information for the cultural growth of the  younger generations and help to educate children, so that they develop the skills needed to  become part of an increasingly multicultural society; support research to promote new opportunities for economic and social development;   prove its commitment towards responsibility, establishing ties with society and participating in    activities with high ethical and social value; promote sport as a social and ethical value and promote social and educational values for young    people through sport; work closely with organisations and associations operating in the Italian economic scenario for    the definition of strategic guidelines; strengthen the tie between the Bank and the communities in which it operates, alongside local    territorial entities. The commitment was made concrete in these areas with activities planned and implemented both  independently and directly, and through partnerships and sponsorships in support of projects  designed and promoted by third parties. Agreements and activities with the various partners are  targeted towards long-term sustainability, in order to develop a plural relationship, a common growth,  effective in promoting initiatives that give concrete form to the values which inspire the Bank. The Banks of the Group, in Italy and abroad, support projects to promote excellence in specific  aspects of the communities in which they operate through sponsorships V.  In 2010, 38.5 million euro were granted as sponsorships, of which 33.5 by Group Companies  operating in Italy and 5 million from the International Subsidiary Banks. I LUOGHI DEL CUORE, FAI – INTESA SANPAOLO The biennial census of places that are of particular importance  to Italians, promoted by the Fondo Ambiente Italiano (Italian  Environmental Fund) in collaboration with Intesa Sanpaolo,  aims to raise awareness of the value of art, monuments and  natural heritage and the importance of safeguarding it by  engaging authorities and local and national institutions. The theme of the fifth national census was: lItalia del  tuo cuore, in view of the celebrations of 150 years of the  Unification of Italy.  In addition to the financial support, the Bank adhered  to the initiative by providing its widespread and deeply  rooted presence throughout the territory. The project was a huge success: 460,000 reports were  made in this edition, over 800,000 in total. Thanks to the reports, FAI was able to take concrete  actions at some sites and conduct an awareness  campaign targeted at regions, municipalities and Heritage  offices. In many cases, partnerships were created with public  authorities that have set in motion plans for the recovery of  places that were the object of the reports. Three more interventions have been added to the works  carried out in recent years: recovery and new use of the  Castello della Colombaia (Trapani), works on the electrical  cabin in the square of the Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta  in Breme (Pavia) and recovery of the water-meadow of  Parco Agricolo Sud (Southern Agricultural Park) at Albairate  (Milan).

To this end, the drafting of guidelines for  the systematic definition of a reference framework for the entire Group in the area of cultural initiatives  is underway. THE BANKS ARTISTIC HERITAGE V Intesa Sanpaolos artistic heritage is marked by richness and variety: from Attic and Magna Graecia  pottery to Russian icons, from the Zecca di Milano (Milan Mint) coins to paintings and sculptures from  the 15th to 18th centuries (including Caravaggio's Martyrdom of St. Ursula and views of Eighteenth- Century Venice), from 19th century paintings to the collection of works from the 20th century. The project to protect, preserve and enhance this heritage is based on the awareness that the  conservation of works of art cannot be separated from historical-critical study and analysis: 2010  saw the restoration of many works (e.g. at the Centro Conservazione e Restauro La Venaria Reale  the ten large canvases already housed in the ancient Oratorio della Compagnia di San Paolo in  Turin) and the cataloguing of approximately 1,300 works belonging to Sanpaolo IMI continued.  The publication of the catalogue raisonn of the 20th century collection of works was begun and is  scheduled to conclude in 2011. During the year, the Bank participated in many temporary Italian and international exhibitions of  works from the collections of the Bank, which promotes their being accessible to the public also  by directly organising exhibitions. Thanks to its participation in the FAI and Touring Club initiatives  in the Invito a Palazzo (Invitation to Palazzo) open days, promoted by the ABI, Intesa Sanpaolo  was able to open its most beautiful bank buildings to the public (2,600 people visited Palazzo delle  Colonne in via Verdi in Milan and the exhibition on the history of its construction). A similar initiative  was undertaken by the Hungarian CIB Bank which, during the annual Cultural Heritage Day in  September, opened the doors of its offices in Szabadsg Square - one of the most interesting  buildings in the Hungarian neo-Renaissance style - to the public.  EDITORIAL AND MUSICAL INITIATIvES V Dissemination, protection, public access and education: these are the objectives that Intesa  Sanpaolo is pursuing with the projects promoted in the editorial and musical fields. In addition to the two editorial series in which the Bank has been engaged for years (Vox Imago and  Musei e Gallerie di Milano), 2010 saw the launch of many initiatives. INTESA SANPAOLO MUSEUMS  The Banks heritage has long been considered private,  being displayed to guests and scholars only occasionally.  Intesa Sanpaolo, with its two museums, Palazzo Leoni  Montanari in Vicenza and Palazzo Zevallos in Naples,  wishes to help bring art to the public, especially young  people. The museum in Vicenza exhibits its collection of Russian  icons and 18th century Venetian paintings as well as  offering a rich programme of events: classical music and  jazz, dance, theatre workshops, poetry readings and  conferences; educational workshops for young people and  music initiatives. The Gallery of Palazzo Zevallos is home to Caravaggios  masterpiece (The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula) and to  important 18th and 19th century views of the city of Naples  and the Campania region by Gaspar van Wittel and Anton  Sminck Van Pitloo. RESTITUZIONI PROjECT Restituzioni - the restoration programme which sees Intesa  Sanpaolo committed to safeguarding and enhancing the  heritage of the country, reached its 20th year of activity and  celebrated this important milestone alongside the Italian  Cultural Heritage Ministry to return to the community one  of the most important masterpieces from the Italian 14th  century: frescoes by Stefano Fiorentino, a pupil of Giotto,  at the Abbey of Chiaravalle Milanese. In 2010, its activities  continued, involving works housed in museums and  churches in Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, Puglia, Florence,  Rome and the Vatican City. In awaiting the 2011 exhibitions  in Florence, Palazzo Pitti and San Marco museum, and  Vicenza, Gallerie di Palazzo Leoni Montanari, the long list  of restorations carried out (over 600 since 1989) has been  enriched by masterpieces such as the glazed terracotta  frieze commissioned by Lorenzo the Magnificent to the Villa  Medicea at Poggio a Caiano, and the Linaioli Tabernacle  by Fra Angelico.     75 A series of mini-guides on Intesa Sanpaolos historical sites, buildings of great historical and artistic  value has been planned for publication, and in 2010 the C de Sass and Palazzo delle Colonne guides  were published. As part of the historical and economic series devoted to IMI, the final publication of  Lindustria chimica italiana e lIMI by Vera Zamagni was edited, which addresses the economic  history of Italy between the late 60s and early 80s. The collaboration with associations and bodies of high cultural and educational standing, including  the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, Fondazione Feltrinelli and the Italian Banking Association, continued:  Intesa Sanpaolo took part in the touring exhibition I nuovi mecenati, sponsored by 21 Italian banks  in collaboration with ABI in over 50 locations around the world, to document the close relationship  between banks and culture in Italy and abroad. A monthly cultural calendar, available on the intranet and, in the near future, on the Internet, aims to  foster knowledge regarding the cultural activities promoted by the Bank and that are open to the public.  Of particular significance were the activities undertaken in the dissemination of musical knowledge,  through the support of some key organisations, such as Associazione Alessandro Scarlatti, Festival  Pianistico Internazionale of Brescia and Bergamo, Societ del Quartetto of Milan and Milano Musica -  Associazione per la Musica Contemporanea. THE DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE V In 2010, the Historical Archive launched an extensive programme of initiatives to protect the more  than twenty archives located throughout the country. With the creation of the historical map, a true  genealogic tree of the Group, the history of the over 250 pre-existing banks and their aggregation  into Intesa Sanpaolo Group was rebuilt. New inventories of the archives are available on the internet;  in particular, the source of the valuable papers of the 1925-1945 period by Raffaele Mattioli was  opened to public consultation.  The main objective of the Media Relation Service activity is to communicate with maximum  transparency the initiatives of the Group that are strategic or important from an operational viewpoint  to all stakeholders. Information is available in the dedicated section of our website V. By subscribing  to the mailing list, users can receive press releases and information on major events by e-mail and/or  mobile phone texts. It is also possible to request that documents be delivered at home.  Intesa Sanpaolo adheres to UPA (Utenti Pubblicit Associati) and Codice di Autodisciplina  Pubblicitaria (Publicity Governance Code), promoted by the Istituto di Autodisciplina Pubblicitaria  (IAP) to ensure that publicity is transparent, true and correct. The close collaboration with these  Associations through ongoing dialogue and exchange of information, ensures that any updates or  amendments in the regulations to which we have adhered are immediately put into effect. As for  advertisements of investment products, the scripts are always submitted to the Legal Affairs Department  and to the Compliance Department and when necessary, communicated to Consob to examine their  compliance to laws and their adherence to the principles of truthfulness and transparency. vOX IMAGO The 2010 edition of the multimedia Vox Imago series,  whose production also includes a selection of editorial  and musical contributions, has been enriched by a  new publication dedicated to the analysis of L'Orfeo by  Claudio Monteverdi, continuing a collaboration begun in  2004 with Teatro alla Scala, Mondadori Electa, Musicom. it, Rai Trade, Philip Gossett and Ipotesi Cinema. To further  spread the dissemination of music and drama through  the performances of internationally famous artists and  historical and philological study of the works of great  composers, the two traditional box and digipack sets were  used for Christmas greetings to customers and employees  in the Intesa Sanpaolo Group in Italy and abroad. MUSEI E GALLERIE DI MILANO More devoted to scientific and protection purpores, the  Musei e Gallerie di Milano series, a publishing project of  cataloguing the collections in the museums of Milan, is a  systematic exploration of local art heritage. With the publication of the 6th volume Collezioni Settala  e Litta Modignani. Arti applicate da donazioni diverse.  Numismatica, the series dedicated to the Pinacoteca  Ambrosiana was completed. In addition to catologuing  applied arts from various donations (weapons, items, Far  Eastern art, Islamic art, jewellery, glass and furniture), the  coin collections, archaeological objects and paintings, the  collections donated by historical Milan families have been  analysed. Among these, the rich collection Settala, under  the category of collections known as Wunderkammer  and the Litta Modignani collection, which consists of  142 pieces of valuable pre-Columbian art and terracotta  pieces from ancient Peruvian civilisations.

At the same time, the best in class principle is applied, which combines the two criteria to reveal those companies  which, while operating in sectors at risk (such as the petro-chemical sector), stand out for their positive achievements in socio-environmental areas.

The publication is rounded out with works by the painter Maya Di Giulio and the designer Francesco Civelli. The artistic work, conceived and directed by Ettore Lariani, involves three steps: selection of important 20th century works from images that have been selected and downloaded from the web,    based on symbolic and metaphorical relevance to the section titles and paragraphs of the 2010 Social Report; paintings by Maya Di Giulio who subjectively interprets each work in watercolours, removing and/or changing    colours and subjects. She therefore does not make copies, but transfers shapes and colours that the original  paintings (or rather their web-simulacra) transmit to her;  digital processing by Francesco Civelli: once the new paintings are scanned, the IT artist processes them    exploiting the potential of the digital world through non-replicable processes, therefore turning them into other  objects as opposed to paintings/interpretations of web-simulacra. The two-step approach is a metaphor for the artistic and technical processes of our time, where a sensorial  technique – to create with hands, brushes and paints – is moved towards immaterial technical reproduction every  time it is reproduced in print or online.
