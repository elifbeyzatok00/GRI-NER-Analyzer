Our Contribution            - To Social, Environmental & Economic Sustainability    Our Time                   2011 Corporate Social Responsibility Report   2    Table of Contents      Message from the CEO ........................................ 3  About GLOBAL CSR ............................................. 4  Our Vision ......................................................... 5  Social Sustainability ............................................ 7  Environmental Sustainability ............................... 14  Economic Sustainability ...................................... 16  Challenges and Future CSR Work ........................ 17             3    MESSAGE FROM THE CEO  Our purpose is to promote sustainable development,  whilst increasing financial returns to our owners. CSR  is our business. We act in accordance  with the principles, we advise clients to apply. We  believe that internationally agreed principles for  sustainable development add needed quality to the  field. The Principles-Based Approach to CSR enables  us to address our impact on essential areas for  sustainable social, environmental and economic  development. It enables a cost-efficient approach to  best manage such impacts. 2011 was, to use the  words of Prof. Ruggie, the end of the beginning.  The UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights and  Business (UNGPs) were unanimously passed by the  UN. With this unique and pragmatic global reference  point, we have adopted a new heading to our  strategy: Our time.        Based on Prof. Ruggies remarkable achievements it is my  pleasure to present our second CSR report describing our  CSR efforts in 2011. GLOBAL CSR was established as a  consultancy more that 15 years ago. As one of the first  professional advisors on CSR worldwide we continuously  seek to optimise our social, environmental and economic  impact. The report describes our priorities for action and  provides a snapshot of our performance in 2011. Our prime  objectives for the future are also described. It is vital for  GLOBAL CSR that we continuously contribute, while  avoiding  becoming  a  barrier,  to  sustainable  social,  environmental and economic development. We will continue  to support the UN Global Compact as the framework and  the UNGPs for implementation of CSR principals. Aside from  being relevant for us and our clients, both of these  initiatives provide a globally consistent, comparable and  transparent framework for CSR performance and reporting.   We  acknowledge  the  importance  of  the  UN  in  mainstreaming  CSR  based  on  internationally  agreed  principles, and strongly support the ASEAN and EU policy  commitments to enhance such development. To put the  principles into practice, we rely on the enthusiasm,  creativity and inspiration of our employees and partners in  inspiring businesses to adopt profitable sustainability  strategies.         4    We look forward to continuing our work on CSR in 2012,  and aim to improve our performance in areas of key  importance to the future of our planet.                Sune Skadegaard Thorsen, CEO    ABOUT GLOBAL CSR    GLOBAL CSR is a privately owned consultancy firm located  in Copenhagen, Denmark.  As a leading Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR) consultancy firm, we specialise in  creating sustainable solutions for private companies, public  authorities and organisations in a range of countries and  industries. Since 1996, GLOBAL CSR has carried out  assignments in all parts of the world.  Our key asset is knowledge. In an effort to contribute to  sustainable development, we share our knowledge by  advising organisations and initiatives that are key players in  the continued development of CSR. These efforts include  both paid and pro bono work for organisations such as The  Danish Government Centre for CSR, United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC), CSR Europe, the Global Business  Initiative on Human Rights, the Institute for Business &  Human Rights, the UN Special Representative of the  Secretary General on Business & Human Rights, the newly  established UN Working Group, the European Bars and  Lawyers Association, the Danish Industrialisation Fund for  Developing  Countries  and  a  range  of  civil  society  organisations.    Integrity is integral to the way we do business. We provide  advice that leads to both short and long term benefits for  our clients and for sustainability. We support CSR activities,  which we consider will actually contribute to sustainable  development.     OUR WORK    GLOBAL CSR assists and advises corporations in developing  and implementing strategies in line with the triple bottom  line  concept based  on  an  internationally  recognised  Principles-Based Approach to CSR. With more than 15   5    years experience in CSR and an extensive network of  domestic and international partners, we are able to provide  the most qualified, up-to-date and experienced advice.   We are continuously developing innovative models and  products  addressing  sustainability,  whilst  enabling  differentiation  and  cost-efficiency.  GLOBAL  CSR  is  experienced in the full cycle of CSR implementation from  assessments, risk & opportunity analysis, vision statements,  strategies, policies, over training to action planning, project  design, implementation and evaluation. In addition, our  team has vast experience in evaluating both corporate and  public programmes and in performing social impact  assessments. In setting overall objectives for the work on  CSR, we have experienced that our clients are best served  by  adopting  the  Principles-Based  Approach.  The  Stakeholder-Based  Approach  serves  well  in  risk- identification processes and for identifying key enablers or  critics when optimising our clients implementation of  objectives. We see stakeholder engagement as a tool rather  than an end in itself.   A deep understanding of the necessities of business as well  as a tailored approach to each of our clients enables us  to create  socially,  environmentally,  and  economically  sustainable CSR solutions.  OUR VISION  We envisage a world of diverse social, environmental and  economic abundance and sustainability, in which all human  beings enjoy the full realisation of their human rights. A  world where businesses live by the principles essential for  becoming key players in the co-creation of a brighter future  for our planet, humanity â€“ and not least business itself.   GLOBAL CSR is a catalyst for such development. We  are recognised  as  a  preferred  partner,  advising  corporations, governments, multilateral organisations and  non-governmental organisations on how to make the  international principles of CSR operational and profitable. As  leaders in business and human rights for 15 years we have  developed unique competences and tools in this field.        6    OUR MISSION  GLOBAL CSR will run a profitable business by:     Promoting sustainable development through a focus on  international principles covering the Triple Bottom Line.  We apply the principles from the UNGC as our  framework for strategic CSR, and the UNGPs for  implementing compliance.       Inspiring and assisting corporations, governments and  organisations in developing and implementing CSR  activities and thereby creating value.      Delivering innovative and simple solutions, which create  value for corporations. The "business case for CSR is  essential for the way we run our business, while  maintaining the highest professional integrity.     The 10 UN Global Compact principles             HUMAN RIGHTS  PRINCIPLE 1: Businesses should support and respect the  protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and  PRINCIPLE 2: make sure that they are not complicit in  human rights abuses   LABOUR STANDARDS  PRINCIPLE 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of  association and the effective recognition of the right to  collective bargaining;  PRINCIPLE 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and        compulsory labour;  PRINCIPLE 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and  PRINCIPLE 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of  employment and occupation.   ENVIRONMENT  PRINCIPLE 7: Businesses should support a precautionary  approach to environmental challenges;  PRINCIPLE 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater  environmental responsibility; and  PRINCIPLE 9: encourage the development and diffusion of  environmentally friendly technologies.   ANTI-CORRUPTION  PRINCIPLE 10: Businesses should work against corruption in  all its forms, including extortion and bribery.     7    SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY   Principles 1-6  Our primary social sustainability impact is through  the actions of the clients we advise     In all of our activities, GLOBAL CSR respects and is  committed to support human rights including the core  labour rights, which form the heart of social sustainability  and human dignity. The basic human rights principles are  essential for the wellbeing and development of all people.  They cover all basic needs for enhancing human dignity. We  continue to sharpen our unique skills and expertise in this  area, as it is through our consulting services that our main  contribution to sustainable development lies.     Our impact  We assist corporations that are both experienced and  leading within the field of CSR as well as corporations that  just begun working within the area. Our services span  across  borders, both  when we  provide  services to  international corporations and when we advise clients on  how to address CSR in all their relations; be it supply  chains, distribution chains or other relations. By assisting  our clients to contribute, while complying with the  internationally agreed principles for social sustainability, we  ensure their CSR efforts serve both society and their own  business objectives. Based on the principles for sustainable  development, we are experts in identifying both challenges  and opportunities in CSR.    GLOBAL CSR consultants are recognised as leading experts  on the application of the International Bill of Human Rights  and the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human  Rights as the basis of CSR activities in relation to social  sustainability. CEO, Sune Skadegaard Thorsen is serving in  a range of international professional bodies developing the  field of CSR.                8                                                  GLOBAL CSR regularly participates in the public debate on  business and human rights and the Principles-Based  Approach to CSR. We publish articles and participate in  national and international working groups related to the  UNGPs, the UNGC principles and CSR. We devote time to  engage debates both to promote our services, but primarily  because of the added value of this approach to businesses  and to society. Continuing to promote social sustainability is  thus an ongoing overall objective for GLOBAL CSR. And we  know we can make a difference.    Knowledge  We recognise that knowledge is our primary resource. The  success of our business depends on our knowledge,  competencies and our abilities to communicate this  knowledge. It is important for GLOBAL CSR to continuously  improve  our  competencies  on  CSR  and  sustainable  development in theory as well as in practice because it is a  key factor in the long-term success of our firm. It is also  important for us to share our knowledge, supporting the  development of the CSR field to find better, more cost- efficient and innovative ways to address global and local      UN Guiding Principles on business & human rights   GLOBAL CSR has since the appointment of the UN Special  Representative on business and human rights, Prof. John  Ruggie, actively supported his work. We are impressed with the  thoroughness and diligence of his work and, even more so, with  the results.   In 2008 the unanimously adopted Policy Framework resting on  the  three  pillars  of  State  Duty  to  Protect,  Corporate  Responsibility to Respect and Access to Remedy created an  unprecedented basis for advancing social sustainability. Most  stakeholders supported the Framework.   In June 2011 the UN Guiding Principles were unanimously  endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council.  In 2011 GLOBAL  CSR took a number of steps to help businesses understand and  implement the UN Guiding Principles. We have developed tools,  which companies can utilize in order to implement the guiding  principles in a consistent and cost efficient manner. In addition  we have produced ground-breaking work in applying the UNGPs  to both Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) and Responsible  Supply Chain Management (RSCM).     We believe that the globally endorsed UNGPs represent a key  milestone and provide important guidance for companies on how  to contribute to the development of a socially sustainable  business sector. And they work in practice.         9    challenges in relation to social sustainability. The Right to  Education frames our contributions to social sustainability.     Our Contributions  2011 marked a turning point for GLOBAL CSR. Not only  were the UNGPs endorsed, but several initiatives that had  been under planning and preparation for several years were  launched in 2011.    Our flagship strategic CSR project was launched in  December 2011 by a strategic donation. GLOBAL CSR  donated access to two e-learning modules for the UN Global  Compact titled: What is the UN Global Compact? and  Why use the UN Global Compact as the basis for your  organizations CSR efforts? The modules can be accessed  and used free of charge at http://www.learncsr.com, and  http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/tools_resour ces/general.html Our expertise in CSR combined with the  front-end expertise on digital learning of our partners  Area9, resulted in the creation of an innovative approach to  e-learning focussed on learning objectives, flexibility and  dynamic improvement.  Our donation to the UN Global  Compact will enable not only potential customers but  everybody to experience this ground-breaking learning  technology. We are developing generic modules on the  UNGPs,  human  rights,  labour  rights,  environmental  responsibility and anti-corruption that can be purchased  online. Customised modules were negotiated and sold in  2011 to two corporations operating globally; the subjects  cover anti-corruption and anti-discrimination. E-learning can  improve the pace of training considerably; which is a great  need in CSR. We have high expectations for expanding this  work to the market.    Our second objective fulfilled in 2011 was to create and  initiative principles-based CSR training for professionals  leading to a GLOBAL CSR diploma. The first round, of five  training sessions, was run as a test version in early autumn  2011. From November â€“ December the first run of the final  version was conducted with very positive feedback from  participants. The course has two elements - capacity  development  in  terms  of  CSR  including  a  firms  understanding of the UNGPs and their role, as well as an  opportunity for colleagues to develop innovative high quality  CSR initiatives.     Finally, GLOBAL CSR continued to provide knowledge  sharing in more conventional forms.     10    In 2011 GLOBAL CSR gave presentations and lectures at  range of national and international seminars, workshops  and conferences on CSR; introducing and teaching in the  application of the UNGPs. :      GLOBAL CSR conducted workshops for 70 per cent of  executives in Hitachi Europe at venues all over Europe.   GLOBAL CSR acted as an advisor to the Global Business  Initiative on Human Rights and presented at the bi- annual working group and outreach meetings in Sao  Paolo, Brazil, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.    GLOBAL CSR was part of an advisory group to AIM  Progress with WWF and the ILO. In October we  presented the profound impact of the UNGPs on  Responsible Supply Chain Management to a group of  major businesses in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods  Industry.   GLOBAL CSR presented in Kiev as key note speaker on  the Ukrainian Global Compact annual meeting.   GLOBAL CSR was part of the advisory group to Danish  Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU). We  participated in creating the criteria for a CSR award and  its presentation at the annual CSR award show.   CEO Sune Skadegaard Thorsen continued to function as  an external examiner at Roskilde University Centre for  Global Studies and as external professor at the  Copenhagen  Law  Faculty  teaching  Corporate  Governance. He also taught CSR at the Copenhagen  Business School (CBS), Riga Law Faculty and the law  faculty at Columbia University.   In 2011 GLOBAL CSR finalised a larger piece of research  for the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Responsible  Supply Chain Management with CBS, and organised a full  day conference in March to discuss the findings with  business and other stakeholders. The report is available  free of charge. ILO called for a meeting in November in  Geneva to discuss the findings that open for a new  approach to RSCM.     GLOBAL CSR conducted professional seminars at the  Danida Fellowship Centre and Mannaz on strategic CSR  and implementation. In addition several corporate clients  received corporate training on CSR also in relation to  RSCM.   GLOBAL CSR offered advice to the student-driven  sustainability  consultancy  180  Degrees  Consulting.  Besides offering strategic advice on the development of  the organisation, GLOBAL CSR conducted a training  session for their team of consultants on strategic CSR.   All in all an average of more than one presentation a  week in 2011.   11    We also published educational material, academic and non- academic articles and are often interviewed by the media.  In 2011 our consultant Signe Andreasen and CEO Sune  Skadegaard Thorsen finished their contribution to the book  The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights â€“  Foundations and Implementation. The book and our  contribution:  Remodelling  Responsible  Supply  Chain  Management: The Corporate Responsibility to Respect  Human Rights in Supply Chain Relations is published  January 2012 by Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.    GLOBAL CSRs most valuable assets are our peoples  knowledge and the know-how we manage to convert into  tools and thus actual practice for businesses.  We seek to  provide the best opportunities for development. Unlike  traditional consultancies we keep the minimum for required  billable hours relatively low and we take pride in enabling  our employees to leave the office after official working  hours. In this way we enable our employees to maintain  focus during working hours, develop skills and innovate. The  success of our team - and hence the firms success -  depends on the professional development of all employees.   In 2011 we managed to engage three interns and seven  student assistants.  They were all trained thoroughly in the  tools and principles that we utilise in our consultancy, in  order for them to make their own contributions to  sustainable development during their future careers.      We encourage our people to improve their performance and  invest in their knowledge and skills, by coaching and  mentoring on an ongoing basis to ensure their long-term  employability, growth and personal development.      Employee satisfaction and productivity    We acknowledge that our responsibility extends to providing  our people with a stimulating workplace in full respect of all  their human rights, including safe & healthy working  conditions. GLOBAL CSR strives to create a team spirit that  is  based  on  mutual  appreciation  and  partnership,  stimulating our employees to achieve their full potential.     Diversity in the workforce is an essential topic in GLOBAL  CSR. We believe that diversity enables the organisation to  improve its ability to innovate. 70 per cent of our knowledge  is tacit, i.e. resting with our employees. 70 per cent of an  individuals knowledge lies with his/her network. In sum,  the more diversity we manage to establish, the more   12    knowledge we can access and the better decisions we can  make.    We also appreciate that all people need to reduce  complexity, establish stereotypes and thus occasionally will  act with prejudice. Working in Denmark represents an  increased challenge in this respect as the Danish education  system has very little focus on creating competences in this  area. GLOBAL CSR will in 2012 continue training for our  employees to understand and counter both individual and  structural discrimination.     In addition a business that actively supports diversity can  improve employee satisfaction, productivity, and retention.  Furthermore a diverse workforce is better equipped to  understand the global marketplace which we serve.      Handling stress is a known challenge in consultancy firms.  The uncertainty of future assignments, the need for optimal  performance every day and the need to stay on top of the  tasks, makes the work of a consultant challenging. GLOBAL  CSR is very much aware of our challenges and in 2011 we  improved our focus on the causes for stress, and our  general employee satisfaction level. In 2012, this issue  remains on our agenda.   In general, GLOBAL CSR strives to keep working hours at  the agreed 37 hours a week. We also allow for flexible hours  and occasionally that employees can work from home when  needed and appropriate.     In addition our employees health is important and we  ensure access to healthy food, exercise and fresh air  thereby energising and motivating our employees. GLOBAL  CSR provides a healthy lunch and fresh fruit every day.  GLOBAL CSR takes a proactive approach to ergonomics as  we spend many hours behind a computer. Proper ergonomic  design is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries.  Ergonomic chairs, tables and office equipment along with a  yoga pillow for backaches improve the right to a safe and  healthy working environment.     Employees can take a run or go for a walk during working  hours and are encouraged and advised to take internal  meetings during a stroll in the neighbourhood when  possible.          13    Our Internal CSR Commitment     We recognise the importance of complying with all basic human rights, and we seek to contribute to  the human rights principles well beyond compliance.       We endeavour to minimise our environmental impact and where possible enhance our positive environmental  impact.      We apply a zero tolerance approach to corruption, while seeking to enhance our positive economic impact.     14    ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY   Principles 7-9  We endeavour to minimise our negative  environmental impact and where possible enhance  our positive impact    GLOBAL  CSR  supports  and  strives  to  demonstrate  environmental responsibility through our work and internally  in our business. Our external contribution to environmental  sustainability stems from assisting businesses in minimising  their negative  and possibly  improving their positive  environmental impacts on the planet.   Our impact  In 2011, GLOBAL CSR assessed and advised Danish and  international clients on incorporating principles 7-9 of the  UNGC into their core business operations. These three  principles serve to support precautionary approaches to  environmental challenges, to undertake new initiatives on  environmental  responsibility  and  to  encourage  the  development and diffusion of environmentally friendly  technologies.   We work in cooperation with our strategic partners that are  leading experts on environmental sustainability. We have,  advised  clients  to  perform  environmental  impact  assessments, carbon and water footprint assessments and  establish sustainable supply chain solutions.    It is our goal for 2012 to contribute positively to the  development of corporate environmentally responsible  profiles and practices for businesses as an integrated and  strategic way of doing business.    Our efforts   At GLOBAL CSR, we continuously seek to reduce our  environmental impacts by promoting and always seeking to  use the best forms of transportation when possible, such as  bicycling, using public transportation and carpooling.      15        In 2010 GLOBAL CSR reduced the companys CO2 emission  by moving our offices to central Copenhagen, thereby  significantly reducing emissions from employees commuting  back and forth. Our new location has also decreased travel  time to clients offices. Where clients are not located  nearby, employees commute by train making travel time  faster as well as more environmentally friendly and  productive, since employees can use the travel time for  preparation.      To minimise our use of air travel we seek to hold meetings  through video and teleconferences when possible. During  2011 we held several meetings through teleconferences  with clients both in Asia, South America and Scandinavia.  Using online technology to meet with clients brings both  economic and environmental benefits and contributes  positively to our employees work-life balance.    However, being a consultancy that serves clients around the  world, we cannot eliminate air travel. The personal presence  is often needed as part of our work. Ensuring high quality  service in our line work often requires onsite presence.  Assessments,  change  management  and  capacity  development are essential components of our work and  require presence and interpersonal skills. Furthermore, we  seek to maintain our position as frontrunners in the field of  CSR. This requires that we take part in the debate on the  development of the field which often involves speaking at  international conferences and meetings. The bulk of our CO2  emissions therefore mainly stems from international air  travel.              In 2012, GLOBAL CSR will allocate funds to offset all 2010  and 2011 emissions, if our income permits. Although this is  an imperfect solution, it will support principle 8 of the UNGC  in a pragmatic manner until the technological development  and our financial capacity enables us to eliminate our  negative impact. In the long run, it is GLOBAL CSRs goal to  eventually become CO2 neutral in our operations and  increasingly generate a positive impact on the environment  beyond our indirect contributions through the actions of our  clients.      Environmental Impact      2011   CO2-emissions from air travel in tons    8.37     Electricity in KWh    1156    Paper (sheets)     2500  -      -   16    In 2011, GLOBAL CSR continued implementation of its  environmental action plan developed in 2010, which  promotes green purchasing options e.g. new energy  efficient  office  supplies  and  an  improved  waste  disposal/recycling system. As an example we use recycled  paper, reusable printer cartridges and strive to print only  when strictly necessary.   ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY    PRINCIPLE 10  Our mission is to run a profitable business through  promoting sustainable development   GLOBAL CSR applies a zero tolerance policy in relation to  corruption. In line with principal 10, we work against  corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery,  and we are committed to compliance with international  recognised principles, such as the UN Global Compact, as  well as local anti-corruption and bribery laws. Whereas  corporate economic responsibility initiatives need to address  the international principles on anti-corruption, we also  advise our clients in relation to tax payments, financial  gearing, and good corporate governance.   Our impact   Through our work we contribute to the elimination of  corruption, as we advise clients on corporate economic  responsibilities and opportunities. In cooperation with our  strategic partners we help our clients implement the 10th  principle of the UNGC strategically into their businesses.     Our efforts   In 2011 we advised several businesses on anti-corruption  and  economic  sustainability.  Examples  include  the  establishment of Speak Up lines in more than 14 countries  and identifying opportunities for turning anti-corruption  challenges into opportunities.    As consultants we were still confronted with the realities of  the economic downturn that made most corporations very  hesitant to spend resources on external consultants. We  have however, experienced that businesses, governments  and organisations increasingly realise the importance of,  and opportunities in, addressing CSR diligently. With the  endorsement of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and  Human Rights and their incorporation into OECD and EU  frameworks, our expertise is widely requested. We expect  that this interest will increase dramatically in 2012; the     17    indications from the market and all our international  partners point in the same direction. Thus, principles-based  CSR in the private and the public sector will most likely  amplify in 2012 leading to greater results for our business  as well as for sustainability. By every hours advice sold,  GLOBAL  CSR  makes  a  contribution  to  sustainable  development through the impressive actions of our clients.   CHALLENGES AND FUTURE CSR  WORK     People   For consultants with clients around the world, the right to  rest, leisure and paid holidays remains a challenge that may  well impact the right to a safe and healthy working  environment. GLOBAL CSR takes pride in ensuring that  employees are well above international standards. 37 hours  work week, six week vacation and encouragement from  management to ensure a good work/life balance are  appreciated elements.          Planet   In 2010 and 2011, GLOBAL CSR improved its environmental  impact. However, we will continue this development in  2012.   Profit   Part of the GLOBAL CSR business model rests on our  integrity. Using GLOBAL CSR should be a hallmark for  genuine strategic CSR work. We have received recognition  from our peers, civil society and international experts and  the results of many of our clients speak for themselves. Our  role vis--vis business is not to act as watch dogs, but to  assist  them  in  improving  performance.  Nonetheless,  maintaining a high level of integrity is paramount to  GLOBAL CSR and we will continue to apply our integrity  measures when evaluating clients, specific tasks and the  advice we give them.    In continuation of our strategic CSR focus GLOBAL CSR in  2012 will commence an affordable learning- and advisory  process for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) that  provides participants with a unique opportunity to fully  exploit the benefits of CSR, in addition to creating a forum  to promote their efforts and share experiences. The   18    initiative supports both EU and the Danish Government's  objectives to promote CSR among SMEs.   In 2011 GLOBAL CSR took its first step in the launching of  their  eLearning  tool  LearnCSR  available  at  www.learnCSR.com . GLOBAL CSR contributes CSR content  through our vast expertise with technical assistance  developed by learning technology experts, Area9. Several  corporate clients are already using learnCSR eLearning  modules on various CSR topics. More modules are in the  pipeline for 2012. We expect high ROI from this product  since our CSR e-learning caters to many needs: cost-time- efficiency; the ability to train many employees; recurrent  training; dynamic improvements; capturing learning effects  etc.  It  enables  cost  efficient  training,  continuous  improvements, based on experience, and keeping exact  measures of performance.    In addition our focus on the right to education has resulted  in two projects that were also developed in 2011. We have  held two workshop series named GLOBAL CSR Talent and  Innovation Lab during 2011, and will continue to offer  these in 2012 along with our SMEs combined learning and  planning initiative.   We look forward to an exciting year of cooperation with our  clients, peers and stakeholders.
