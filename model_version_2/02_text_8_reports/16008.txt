COMPANY / CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY       SAS 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report   An enduring commitment to employees, environment and communities   The SAS 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report was developed using the Global Reporting Initiative  (GRI) sustainability reporting guidelines. This years report is based on the calendar year from Jan. 1 to Dec.  31, 2010, just as our previous three reports are based on the calendar year. All data and information pertains to  SAS Institute Inc., the US-based parent company for SAS, unless otherwise stated. The report is self-declared  at application level C.   Content covers our commitment and performance related to governance, employees, environment, and  education and community. This year, we have exported some CSR-related content to the static pages of our  website while featuring information related only to 2010 in the CSR report itself.   As in last years report, we used SAS for Sustainability Management to provide the facts and figures regarding  our environmental footprint. All content has been reviewed by executive leaders and other internal  stakeholders.   SAS welcomes your comments and questions regarding this report and our corporate responsibility efforts. For  questions about this report or its contents, please email globalreporting@sas.com.     From the CEO   The economic experience of the past few years has tested the fortitude of business leaders. In the midst of this  crisis, what has strengthened is an understanding that a sustainable business strategy is compatible with  profitability.   Resource efficiency, innovation of products and services, employee engagement, and improved compliance  are all hallmarks of sustainable strategies and of business success.   At SAS, our employees are the lifeline of our success. This year, we ranked No. 1 on the Fortune Best  Companies to Work For list in the US.   We are continuing our investments in energy-efficient buildings and renewable energy portfolios. In 2010, we  more than doubled the capacity of the solar farms at our Cary, NC, headquarters from 1 megawatt to 2.2  megawatts. The combined electricity generation produces enough power for more than 325 average-size  homes. The Cary campus also has solar thermal hot water systems, regenerative drive elevators, water and  waste conservation projects, active employee engagement efforts, and two newly completed sustainably  constructed buildings designed to attain high-level LEED certification. Realizing we operate in a global  community, we have continued our commitment to collaborate and participate in various international and  national initiatives. This year, SAS joined the Partnership Against Corruption Initiative to fight bribery and  corruption, and Change the Equation, a national initiative with the goal of increasing literacy in science,  technology, engineering and math. Next year, SAS will join the UN Global Compact and the World Economic  Forum Workplace Wellness Alliance, a consortium dedicated to measuring the link between employee  wellness, engagement and productivity.   This 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report reflects our approach and performance on our broader  economic, social and environmental risks to enable all stakeholders to assess our achievements. We will  continue to measure our performance while striving for innovation and improvements in our operations.   Jim Goodnight, CEO of SAS     Governance and Management  Solid management, performance and compliance for a sustainable enterprise  Overview  Corporate responsibility is an integral aspect of our business. While there is no specific department for  corporate responsibility, the Executive Sustainability Council has been operating for three years and a  Corporate Social Responsibility Task Force was created in 2009.   These teams work closely with all aspects of the business engaging with various departments, including  Facilities, IT, Community Relations, Corporate Communications, Human Resources and Legal, to ensure  policies and efforts on social and environmental issues are considered in the overall operations.

Fair Trade  Laws,  International  Peace Accords,  Anti- Aggression  Laws and  Sanctions, and  Anti-Boycott  Laws  Zero government fines  for exports of controlled  software, meaning SAS  delivered its software  only to permitted  destinations and users,  and zero fines for  responses to requests  for proposal from  countries at risk of  requesting participation  in prohibited boycotts  of US allies.  SAS processed and  exported 17,680  software orders and  received no government  fines.     SAS successfully  executed an anti-boycott  law compliance program  for all its offices in  countries where there is  a risk that customers  may seek to involve SAS  in boycotts prohibited by  the US government.  SAS properly reported  all boycott requests  received and declined to  participate in any  prohibited boycotts.   Maintain our zero  government fines record.     Revise our internal  processes to allow real- time, or near-real-time,  updates to our external  Export Commodity  Classification Number  chart to allow our  customers to more  quickly determine the  ECCNs of the products  licensed from SAS for  easy application to their  own export compliance  programs. This will help  SAS customers to more  easily comply with export  controls on software use  and delivery across  international borders.   Privacy  Protection  Laws  Advance awareness of  SAS privacy and  security practices  (internal and external  audiences). Develop  new mechanisms to  communicate these  policies and practices.

Stakeholder Engagement  We engage with a wide range of stakeholders across all parts of our operations. More detailed information  about our relationships with many stakeholder groups can be found throughout this report. They include:     Customers     Communities     Employees     Regulators and government     Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)     Industry organizations   We also belong to numerous membership organizations focused on a wide range of corporate responsibility  issues.

We also employ the highest ethical standards in our dealings with customers, suppliers and  competitors. As a result, we have a reputation of being a great place to work and a great company to do  business with.   The SAS Code of Business Ethics outlines the responsibilities each employee of SAS and its subsidiaries has  to comply with all laws, rules and regulations of the countries in which we do business to ensure legal and  ethical behavior. At SAS, we strive to employ the highest ethical standards, demonstrating honesty, fairness  and accountability in every decision and action.   Fair Trade and Anti-Aggression Laws  SAS supports the national security policies of the United States and the governments of other countries in  which we do business by its commitment to comply with each countrys applicable laws regulating the export  and importation of encryption by maintaining policies and procedures to identify and classify encryption  software products.     Governments restrict the export of encryption and regulate exports of software generally in order to maintain  international peace, discourage international aggression and encourage free trade among peaceful, law- abiding nations and their citizens. Our policies and procedures result in timely export classifications, thus  reducing our risk of an export violation, while minimizing delays in our product release cycles. SAS further  supports national security objectives by providing timely Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) to our  customers to facilitate their compliance with export and import regulations. Further, SAS complies with US laws  restricting US companies from participating in boycotts of countries allied with the US.   SAS employees are responsible for immediately communicating any concerns regarding suspected unethical  or illegal conduct to supervisors, to the Human Resources department or to the General Counsel. SAS will not   take retaliatory action against people who report suspected violations in good faith. All reports of misconduct  will be investigated as appropriate.   In order to maintain our high ethical standing, employee compliance and ethics training is provided on a regular  basis on issues such as anti-bribery, corruption, data protection, privacy and respect in the workplace. In 2010,  SAS produced an internal animated online video training course on encryption export regulations and released  it to headquarters development personnel. Encryption is highly regulated and has been an important factor in  many past wars, so governments want corporations to cooperate in their encryption exports to prevent  encryption from falling into the hands of persons who would use it do harm. SAS used a succinct animated  format to convey the message to developers that they can help SAS with encryption export law compliance,  and how they can do that.   SAS acquired two new entities and brought their people and operations into compliance with SAS Human  Resources and Ethics and Compliance policies and programs. SAS followed a thorough process to review all  potential compliance issues and communicated with government officials to ensure any past issues were  properly addressed. New employees were provided all applicable ethics and compliance training. We received  zero fines for noncompliance.   Anti-Corruption  SAS strives to maintain compliance with the US and international anti-corruption laws at the local, state and  federal level in all its operations. SAS operates at a zero tolerance – zero fines level in its compliance with  anti-corruption laws, while maintaining an efficient compliance system that allows for robust corporate growth.  SAS engages with other business partners and stakeholders around the world to encourage a global  community culture that works to end corruption.   This year, SAS joined the World Economic Forums Partnership Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) to fight  bribery and corruption. PACI is based on chief executive officer (CEO) commitments to the PACI Principles for  Countering Bribery, which call for the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy on corruption and the implementation  of an anti-corruption program guiding the behavior of employees, agents, suppliers, contractors and joint  venture partners.   SAS also implemented new enhanced contract language requiring anti-corruption law compliance by all  subcontractors and partners. This language requires subcontractors and partners to verify they are not part of  any government and are not engaging in undue influence on any governmental entities.   In relation to suppliers, we introduced a pilot program of enhanced due diligence screening for subcontractors  and partners as well as an ongoing screening and monitoring process for suppliers to protect against anti- corruption risks.   Privacy  Privacy has become part of mainstream business culture as companies respond to emerging state, federal and  international privacy and data protection legislation; rapid changes in technology and security; and growing  consumer and employee concern about the collection, storage, use and sharing of personal information.  Corporatewide privacy compliance is managed by the SAS Legal Department.   SAS' Privacy Statement is global and applies not only to SAS US, but to foreign subsidiaries and other  business units.   SAS strives to maintain compliance with the US and international privacy and information security laws at the  local, state and federal level in all its operations. SAS tries to operate at a zero tolerance – zero fines level in  its compliance with privacy and information security laws, while maintaining an efficient compliance system that  allows for robust corporate growth. SAS engages with other business partners and stakeholders around the  world to encourage a global community culture that works to end privacy abuse and information security  breaches.

Education    At SAS we believe that education is the engine of economic growth. As a high-tech company, SAS depends on  a strong educational system for its long-term success. By supporting efforts that prepare more graduates for  college, work and success in the 21st century, SAS continues to play a vital role in the global community. SAS  maintains a keen focus on education initiatives in the statewide community of our world headquarters in North  Carolina. The company also participates in select international efforts to improve education, particularly in the  fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). This philosophy of thinking globally while acting  regionally generates support for strategic education initiatives that benefit the worldwide community. While SAS  supports dozens of projects and initiatives, here are a few highlights from this year:   Algebra Readiness/Triangle High Five   Triangle High Five started as a partnership known as High Five in 2003 with one of the main goals to support  the development and sustainability of Professional Learning Communities within the Triangle Region and  across the state.   Its vision is that all students will graduate with a high school diploma, well prepared to pursue higher education  and a career of their choice. In 2009, SAS launched the Algebra Readiness Initiative (ARI) with the goal to  increase the number of students who are prepared to be successful in middle school Algebra I. To further this  goal, in 2010, SAS facilitated a summit. Recognizing the increased need for professional development for  instructional leaders and math teachers, the districts planned an Algebra Readiness Summit on Aug. 12, 2010,  hosted on the SAS campus. School teams consisted of 400 math teachers and principals who heard nationally  recognized presenters discussing critical topics and research-based instructional strategies related to algebra  readiness. Space was provided for more than 25 concurrent training sessions/talks. Plans are underway for a  2nd Annual Algebra Readiness Summit in August 2011.   Change the Equation   SAS CEO Jim Goodnight joined 110 other CEOs in supporting Change the Equation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan  CEO-led initiative to solve Americas innovation problem. The initiative aims to improve science, technology,  engineering and math (STEM) education for every child, with a particular focus on girls and students of color,  who have long been underrepresented in STEM fields.   Change the Equation works toward three goals:     Great Teaching. Improve STEM teaching at all grade levels, with a larger and more diverse cadre of highly  capable and inspirational STEM teachers.     Inspired Learners. Inspire student appreciation and excitement for STEM programs and careers to increase  success and achievement in school and opportunities for a collegiate education, especially among  underrepresented populations.     A Committed Nation. Achieve a sustained commitment to improving STEM education from business leaders,  government officials, STEM educators and other stakeholders through innovation, communication,  collaboration and data-based decision making.   Through its network of more than 110 CEOs, Change the Equation pledges to create widespread literacy in  science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) as an investment in our nation that empowers us all.

North Carolina 1:1 Learning Technology Initiative (NCLTI)   In 2007, SAS was a founding partner in the NCLTI, a public-private partnership providing laptops, professional  development and critical support to schools in rural areas of the state. These schools benefit directly from the  availability of the online content in SAS Curriculum Pathways, which provides an excellent starting point for  teachers as they learn to infuse technology into their instruction. SAS also provides SAS Curriculum Pathways  professional development for any NCLTI site. The NCLTI program is designed to address:     Equity, providing all students access to 21st century teaching, learning, and technology.      Engagement, involving students in active learning and thereby improving student achievement and reducing  dropout rates.     Economic development, providing all students with workplace skills such as communication, problem solving  and collaboration, along with content expertise, to make each region of the state more attractive to businesses.   The final outcome of this pilot program is a series of tools and resources – a Framework for Planning –  describing a comprehensive and systematic approach to planning learning technology initiatives. This  framework puts forth a blueprint for building capacity to support large-scale technology-enabled learning efforts.  The framework outlines a set of tools that assist schools and district teams as they plan.   DonorsChoose.org   SAS employees support specific education areas in their community through DonorsChoose.org, a national  nonprofit organization that connects employees with classrooms in need. The site enables public school  teachers to submit wish lists for materials that will help their students learn. SAS began matching funds in  December 2008.   In 2010, SAS matched 62 employee contributions of nearly $20,000, which provided almost $40,000 toward  resources for the classroom.   North Carolina Science Festival   Launched in 2010, the North Carolina Science Festival is a statewide, multi-day celebration showcasing  science and technology. As the first statewide science festival in the US, the NC Science Festival included a  series of events across North Carolina and highlighted the educational, cultural and financial impact of science  in the state. Through hands-on activities, science talks, lab tours, nature experiences, exhibits and  performances, the Festival engaged a wide range of public audiences while inspiring the next generation of  scientists. SAS was a major sponsor of this event and will continue to support the next one in 2012.   Community Engagement   While most of SAS community engagement is education based, we also engage on the environmental level,  encourage volunteering in all areas and support humanitarian efforts.   Donations   2010 Highlights  Donations  Amount  Cash including community grants:  $1,202,213   In-kind donations:       Software, hardware and services   $4,030,038  Value in-kind of training for students and educators  $7,057,085   Surplus equipment/furniture/hardware:   $166,000   Total   $12,455,336    Volunteering   In 2010, SAS employees volunteered more than 22,700 hours largely focused on education programs, netting  $86,500 for schools through the Employee Volunteer Fund. The fund is a special volunteer program that  provides a cash contribution to education-based nonprofit organizations where an employee has provided at  least 50 hours of volunteer support in three out of four quarters over a 12-month period.    SAS and The Umstead Hotel & Spa employees teamed up to support public television by volunteering their  time taking pledges during the annual fundraising drive. SAS Night was the most successful night during the  drive, yielding $129,200 (SAS provided $60,000 in support) with 47 volunteers.   Empowering Others   SAS technology is used in various ways to benefit communities and assist in humanitarian efforts.   This year, SAS helped create a system for managing disaster relief and relief distribution in Pakistan after the  devastating floods. SAS helped the International Organization for Migration (IOM) apply analytics to enhance  efforts to help millions left homeless by the worst floods in Pakistan's history. The system helped IOM better  manage and share data with partner agencies in providing emergency shelter. The public-private partnership  between SAS and IOM will in the future explore additional uses of analytics and develop tools to aid in  humanitarian disaster response worldwide.   SAS technology was also used for Womens Microfinance Initiative (WMI). WMI extends interest-bearing loans  of $50 to $250 to women in eastern Uganda, helping them finance their own enterprises to generate revenue to  support their families. In 24 months since its launch in 2008, WMI has issued more than 700 loans to Ugandan  women.   A team of WMI student volunteers employs JMP (SAS technology) to visually depict data so that foundations  and corporations that want to support the initiative can easily understand the organizations successes and the  loan recipients challenges.   Philanthropy   SAS-Supported Programs   SAS support is directed toward sustainable programs that help teens succeed in the classroom and graduate  from high school. In particular, SAS supports programs that focus on the integration of technology that will  strengthen the education system and increase the number of students entering careers in science, technology,  engineering and math. Programs must also show that their efforts have a long-term impact and affect  significant numbers of people, without discrimination. Examples include:     Change the Equation, a program with a network of more than 110 CEOs that pledge to create widespread  literacy in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) as an investment in the US.     Communities in Schools, the nation's largest dropout prevention organization.     Common Core Standards, an effort to define common curriculum standards for all states.     DonorsChoose.org, "the eBay of online charitable giving," is a national nonprofit that connects employees  with classrooms in need. Each year, SAS matches employee contributions to the cause.     In-Kind Donations for nonprofit organizations that need computer equipment or software. SAS gives hundreds  of thousands of dollars in surplus computer hardware, office equipment and other tangible items to community  groups that can benefit from the donation.     National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, a program that advances the quality of teaching and  learning by developing professional standards.     NC Center for International Understanding, a program to ensure that North Carolina is the most globally  engaged state in the nation.

SAS is committed to providing a professional and safe work environment where everyone is treated with dignity  and respect. SAS does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment, by  managers, employees or any third parties. SAS strictly prohibits discriminatory practices, including sexual  harassment. Harassment, whether verbal, written, physical or environmental, is unacceptable and will not be  tolerated, whether it occurs in the workplace or at outside company or client-sponsored activities.   Internal diversity initiatives   Embracing global cultures: Established in 1995, SAS International Connection (SASIC) originated from a group  of innovative SAS employees who collected their international talents to promote the various cultures  represented at SAS, as well as serve as a cultural resource. SASIC is a group of SAS employees dedicated to  fostering, supporting and promoting international issues at SAS. Its members strive to share their knowledge  and expertise with fellow SAS employees and customers. SASIC provides international knowledge and  expertise in a wide variety of areas, including languages and customs, etiquette and ethnicity. Its members  work to foster mutual concern and understanding among people of different cultural backgrounds. In addition,  each year SASIC organizes various interesting, educational and fun events to promote and educate its  members about different cultures, languages, customs and more from around the world, such as:     Monthly luncheons at Triangle restaurants that offer various international or ethnic dishes.     Movies and videos.     Picnics.     Trips.     Holiday luncheons, where members bring dishes and/or wear traditional garments from their native country.     Foreign language groups that meet regularly to learn and practice.     Theme luncheons to discuss topics covering diverse customs, traditions and cultures in different countries.   Any complaint brought forward will be investigated and resolved appropriately. All employees are obligated to  report all perceived incidents of harassment or discrimination, regardless of the position of the alleged offender.  In 2010, there were zero reports or incidents of harassment or discrimination.   SAS draws strength from the unique talents and abilities of a diverse workforce and commits to creating a safe  environment where the best workers do their best work. It is SAS policy to foster an environment characterized  Gen X (32-44)  63   45   84   Boomers (45-63)  54   40   77   Matures (64 and up)  13   10   13   By gender              Female  54   53   99   Male  90  59  101   by respect for lifestyle, cultural and ethnic differences. This policy is put into action through a variety of internal  initiatives, community outreach programs and scholarship opportunities.   SAS values diversity, not because it is legally required, but because it makes good business sense. The best  products and services come from a workplace where varying viewpoints are welcomed and encouraged.   The Womens Initiative Network (WIN), launched in January 2010, is a community of SAS employees who  empower, encourage and inspire women to pursue excellence in their careers and fulfillment in their personal  lives. The mission of WIN is to foster a global community across SAS to:     Develop leadership capabilities among women workers.     Expand and strengthen internal and external professional networks and affiliation.     Showcase SAS thought leaders and expose participants to external visionaries.     Contribute to community efforts to attract young women to careers in science and technology.   By sharing time, expertise and passion with those beyond the walls of SAS, they act as ambassadors for the  corporation and for careers in science and technology.   The Cary headquarters location has a membership of approximately 60 members, and the online membership,  which includes regional and global participation, is more than 400 members. The groups activities have  included:     Lunch-n-learns with SAS leaders: Agile Career Development and What Does Innovation Look Like?     Industry thought leader events: How to Perform Like a Rock Star by Orna Drawas.     Networking events: "Building Relationships Across SAS" – an event in SAS new state of the art building to  network with both SAS peers and executives.     Community events – partnering with The Science House at North Carolina State University to promote science  and math to middle school and high school female students; group participation in the Race for the Cure.  Training and employment for individuals with autism: SAS food service operations employs six autistic  employees.     F.A.S.T. (Food And Service Training): Students from Wake Tech and Wake County Schools. These students  receive credit for their Occupational Course of Study for graduation. Fifty-five students from nine schools  participated in 2010.     SUCCEED: Adult students with developmental disabilities from the Compensatory Education Program through  Wake Tech. These students need work experience that will help them find a full-time job. SAS employed eight  students in 2010.     TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication related handicapped Children) is an  employment supported program through the University of North Carolina to help individuals with autism. SAS  employed seven employees in this program in 2010.   In 2008, SAS initiated the R3 program, which exemplifies our commitment to Recognize, Recruit and Retain  women and minorities in various professional arenas. Affirmative outreach has proven to be an invaluable tool  in creating an inclusive environment and helps us prepare the future workforce. In additional to developing core  technical skills, we hope to provide our students with the richest experience possible and also provide personal  and professional development. Students work with mentors and are able to work on challenging projects that  provide the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in a global marketplace. The goal of the program is  to create a career pathway leading to employment with SAS for the successful student.   Students in the R3 program receive not only core skills training, but professional development and mentorship  as well. In May 2010, the program had 17 returning students and four new students.   Skills Development   Ongoing training and professional development enables employees to succeed at their current jobs and to  branch out and apply their talents in new ways. SAS has a variety of organizations dedicated to training  employees in various areas, such as:     Leadership development.     Sales training.     Technical training.     Interpersonal development.   Offerings include instructor-led classroom training, self-directed e-learning, Live Web training, coaching and  other employee-focused offerings. These options help employees meet their work-related challenges and  career-progression goals and prepare for future organizational needs. The company also offers ethics courses  to help employees understand applicable rules and regulations to preserve the company's integrity, reputation,  and the trust and confidence of customers, suppliers, business partners and the public. Other professional  development opportunities are less structured, such as words@SAS, a recurring series of SAS Wide Web  (intranet) articles focused on how to improve terminology management at SAS.   61 percent of full- and part-time employees took some type of professional training.   Of the full-time employees who took training, the average time spent in training was 23 hours. Part-time  employees who took training spent an average of nine hours in training.   Counting all employees, the average number of hours of training per employee is 14 for full-time and five for  part-time.   The total professional training hours for 2010 was over 82,000.       SAS takes a three-tier approach to developing our leaders – both current and emerging. In 2010, there were 30  offerings with 992 participants.   Management Fundamentals Program (MFP)  This program is designed for our new managers or those managers who would like to refresh themselves on  the basics of management. MFP is a blended learning and development opportunity that provides managers  with the critical knowledge and abilities essential to handle the normal day-to-day function of being a people  manager. Employees practice new behaviors and skills, establish and build peer relationships while  constructing a new mindset for being, and developing as, a manager. The result is an improved ability to  navigate across the business toward cross-functional and more strategic goals.   The Leadership Challenge (TLC)  This program is for our general SAS leadership population. TLC is a two-day experiential workshop focusing on  how SAS leaders motivate others to want to get extraordinary things done. Our goal is to teach leaders about  Training Highlights  Training  Breakdown  Classroom  87%   Webcast and video 8%   E-learning  4%   Reading material  1%    five practices to transform values into actions, visions into realities, obstacles into innovations, separateness  into solidarity, and risks into rewards.   Leadership and Energy for Performance (LE4P)  This program is targeted to higher-level leaders and teaches leaders how to enhance/manage their physical,  emotional, mental and purposeful energy to more effectively lead themselves and others. This 90-day program  begins with five days of facilitated coursework, discussion, feedback and introspection combining two research- based programs: the Corporate Athlete Course and The Leadership Challenge. The reminder of the 90 days is  spent in biweekly classes, seminars, participant-led discussion groups and/or exercise classes in order to focus  on expanding and managing personal energy and increasing the frequency of specific leadership behaviors.  Our goal is to provide our leaders with a habit-forming model that can be used for repeatable results,  continuous personal growth and consistent leadership enhancement.   SAS Global Career Framework  In 2010, SAS began the development and implementation of a comprehensive career development program  called the SAS Global Career Framework. The framework was created in response to employees desire to  have greater visibility to career paths and opportunities for development. It provides a structured approach to  career development.   The Global Career Framework is comprised of three components:     Infrastructure provides the basic foundation – transparency in the levels of jobs at SAS and consistency  internationally and across business units. Central to the infrastructure are career ladders, which help  employees understand what job opportunities exist within the company and what path is necessary for them to  take in order to get there.     Assessment provides support to SAS managers in understanding their organizations current skills and  competencies, as well as how individuals and their organization are performing. It can also help highlight gaps  and help managers better understand how to meet the current and future needs of business.     Development provides the tools and resources that support managers in developing skills and competencies in  individuals and teams. SAS provides user-friendly tools that employees and managers can use to chart career  aspirations.     Health and Safety  The health and safety of our employees is paramount to our success. SAS seeks to provide a safe workplace  environment for its employees. It complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws regarding safe work  practices and working environment. The Security and Safety departments investigate any incidents that pose a  danger to company employees or third parties and take measures to reduce or eliminate these hazards. The  Risk Management Department provides additional training and resources to help identify and prevent similar  incidents from causing injury or damage to individuals or property and also seeks reimbursement for loss or  damage whenever possible.   To prevent work-related injuries, SAS educates employees about how to fit the tools and equipment at each  work site to the needs of the employee.   Ergonomic staff (through the Risk Management Department) are trained to make individual work site analyses  and provide specific suggestions for improving an employees work environment.   Health Care Center staff are equipped to evaluate and treat specific complaints whether or not they are work- related.   The Safe Work Skills Program addresses "labor-intensive" employee groups in the workplace (i.e., employees  who frequently lift and bend as a requirement of their jobs). Annual attendance is required and includes an   educational class on safe lifting, a healthy-back class where these skills are practiced safely in the actual work  areas, and an ergo-safety site survey with subsequent meetings between employees and management to  surface concerns.       Injuries/Lost Days  2010  2009  Employee numbers  5,804   5,566   Compensation claims 18 = .003 percent  33 = .006 percent   Lost working days  407   314   In 2010, US operations had 18 workers compensation claims following injury-related incidences. The rate of  compensation claims was 18 out of 5,804 US employees, or .003 percent. Among those claims, eight resulted  in a total of 407 lost days  Surveys  SAS conducted two surveys, one gauging employees feelings on internal communications resulting in 85  percent of those surveyed agreeing that executives communicate openly. This is up from 69 percent from 2009.  The second survey, related to several questions around employee satisfaction in areas such as trust,  camaraderie and respect. Scores were 91 percent and above in all areas, contributing to SAS being No. 1 on  the Fortune Best Companies to Work For list in the US.   SAS joins WEF Workplace Wellness Alliance  At the end of 2010, SAS announced its intention to join the World Economic Forum (WEF) Workplace Wellness  Alliance, a consortium of global CEOs dedicated to measuring the link between employee wellness,  engagement and productivity. The Alliance will standardize a set of common metrics and launch an online  knowledge-sharing platform. It will enable employees to achieve their full potential while making optimum  contributions to business growth and success. SAS is a long-standing WEF partner, and SAS CEO Jim  Goodnight an active contributor to WEF debates.       Environment   Stewardship for today, preservation for tomorrow   Overview   2010 Solar Farms Renewable Energy Generation   SAS strives to be a leader in environmental sustainability. From U.S. headquarters to our offices around the  world, SAS is committed to making a difference. This year saw the installation of new solar arrays, completion  of a new cloud computing facility designed to responsibly expand computing capacity and achieve high-level  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the US Green Building Council, and  continued efforts to manage water consumption, waste and energy efficiency intelligently.   Highlights from 2010 at Cary, NC world headquarters included:     Activation of Solar Farm II, a 1.2 megawatt addition to our solar farms.    Installation of building rooftop solar thermal hot water system.     Completion of reclaimed water line from the local utility to data center cooling towers.     Almost doubling the amount of operational waste diverted from landfills.    Diverting 81 percent of new construction and major renovation waste from landfills.    Registration of three buildings striving for LEED certification.    Addition of numerous environmentally-friendly and energy efficient technologies in new and existing buildings.  In addition to employing various sustainability measures at the Cary world headquarters and global operations,  SAS takes pride in supporting environmental education and awareness efforts. We regularly engage  employees and the communities where we operate with active dialogue about the environment. In 2010, SAS  supported numerous environmental speaking engagements, visits to the SAS solar farms, companywide Earth  Day celebrations, featured articles posted on the internal green website, published white papers and webcasts.  By engaging with customers, employees, industry leaders and world leaders, SAS seeks to extend the reach of  our sustainability initiatives.   SAS did not receive any sanctions or fines in 2010 for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations  in the United States.   Green Buildings   This year, SAS completed a new 38,660-square-foot cloud computing facility at our Cary, NC world  headquarters. The building was designed with highly efficient mechanical and electrical systems, including a  cooling system that will use reclaimed water and water-side economizers that allow for heat removal without  utilizing the building chillers.   Over the past decade, the challenge of delivering timely information in support of enterprise analytics has  increased exponentially. The deployment of additional computing and storage solutions, combined with IT  globalization at corporate headquarters, has increased demand for energy and data center space. Existing  facilities were reaching capacity and could not be efficiently expanded to maintain the high-level support  expected by our customers. The solution was to design and construct a dedicated computing facility,  emphasizing efficiency, flexibility and sustainability. Collaboration with industry-recognized engineering experts  has put us on a successful path to achieve LEED certification. Cary headquarters highlights from 2010  included:     Expected energy consumption reduction of 32.8 percent.     When fully utilized, annual savings of 6.8 million kilowatt hours are anticipated.     Expected 30 percent water reduction from high-efficiency mechanical systems and 40.2 percent reduction in  ancillary use from low-flow technologies.     20.9 percent of the buildings materials have been manufactured from recycled content.     Flywheel system eliminates battery replacement and yields lower cost of ownership compared to UPS battery  systems.    Construction of facility achieved 75.2 percent waste diversion from landfill.     Old-growth trees adjacent to building were saved by making use of soil nailing system that allowed  embankment cuts without excessive disruption to environment.    Annual energy savings are equivalent to a reduction of 3,600 CO2e tonnes.   The new data center provides opportunities to use robust measurements to make proactive IT selection  decisions – minimizing IT inefficiencies. With the completion of the new facility, we were able to retire an older,  less efficient data center and utilize this space to meet demand for additional employee offices. We were also  able to consolidate IT equipment in other locations and ultimately retire 20 percent of our IT assets.   The construction of a new office building, also designed to achieve LEED certification, will house an Executive  Briefing Center to be completed in early 2011. This building is designed to help conserve water and energy, by  employing features such as a rainwater capture system that provides water for restrooms, thermal slab floor   cooling, radiant floor heating, regenerative drive elevators and solar-generated hot water and electricity. With  approximately 280,000 square feet, this building will house 690 offices, two auditoria, meeting rooms and a full- service cafeteria. Through December, 82 percent of construction waste was diverted from landfill and recycled.   We replaced the roof on our largest building at Cary, NC world headquarters (386,225 square feet) with a white  reflective membrane. White rooftops reflect sunlight, which reduces heat transfer to the building and minimizes  cooling load. The new roof has greater insulation, which will help to reduce energy consumption for the  building. The roof replacement generated 4.92 tons of debris, of which 79 percent was recycled.   SAS is also embracing LEED guidelines for remodeling and retrofit of existing buildings. Since LEED design is  currently recognized only in the US and Canada, SAS offices in other countries are working to incorporate  country-specific best practices and pursue equivalent certifications for new construction projects and  maintenance of existing buildings.   2010 Highlights  2010 Goals  Performance Highlights   2011 Goals  Continue to apply LEED best  practices on construction of  Building C and cloud  computing facility in 2010.     Achieve LEED certification  for the two new SAS  buildings, under construction,  by 2011.     Maintain Q1 2011 completion  date for environmentally- friendly constructed office  building.   Completed construction of 38,660-square  foot cloud computing facility:     Construction of facility achieved 75 percent  waste diversion from landfill.     Expected energy consumption reduction of  32.8 percent.     Expected 30 percent water reduction from  high-efficiency mechanical systems and  40.2 percent reduction in ancillary use from  low-flow technologies.     20.9 percent of the buildings materials  have been manufactured from recycled  content.   Continued on-target construction schedule  for 280,000-square-foot office building,  which will provide employee offices,  cafeteria and Executive Briefing Center  space. To date, 82 percent of waste from  Building C has been diverted from landfill.   Achieve LEED New  Construction  certification for  cloud computing  facility.    Achieve LEED New  Construction  certification  Building C.   Review the Strategic US  Headquarters Plan annually  and continue to incorporate  LEED principals to  operational procedures   SAS continues to proactively maintain,  repair and retrofit existing facilities to best  practice guidelines recommended by the  US Green Building Council. (See goals for  existing building LEED certifications)      Baseline at least one existing  building for consideration of  LEED certification.     Register existing building for  LEED Existing Building:  Operations and Maintenance  (EBOM) certification   SAS completed evaluation of existing  building at US headquarters and is  pursuing LEED Existing Building:  Operations and Maintenance (EBOM)  certification.    Registered existing building for EBOM  certification.   Register five owned  facilities for EBOM  certification.    Register two non- US offices for  EBOM certification.        Water   SAS' 900-acre campus in Cary used 117,763 cubic meters of municipal water and approximately 51,292 cubic  meters of ground water from 15 wells in 2010. For 13 other owned facilities worldwide, SAS used 53,381 cubic  meters of municipal water in 2010.   2010 Highlights  2010 Goals  Performance Highlights   2011 Goals  Implement a Strategic  Campus Plan  directive for  retrofitting existing  bathrooms with low- flow plumbing.

Renovated nine bathrooms with low-flow plumbing technologies.     Installed rainwater capture system in new building at Cary campus headquarters. The system uses two 20,000- gallon cisterns to collect rainwater from the building roof. Rainwater capture is UV disinfected and used to  supply non-potable water to the low-flow bathroom flushing fixtures.   Using reclaimed water and rain water reduces our impact on local reservoirs and minimizes the amount of  energy needed by the water utility to treat waste water to potable quality.       Energy and Emissions   SAS continues to be innovative in energy efficiency. This year, we installed thermal slab floor cooling and  radiant floor heating in the new Executive Briefing Center, which will open in 2011. Thermal slab floor cooling  uses water cooled in off-peak hours by building chillers to help maximize air conditioning efficiencies. The  cooled water runs through pipes in concrete slabs to help cool the building during the day and minimize  electricity use when rates are highest. The radiant flood heating system is situated in a building with large  atrium space to maintain heat near occupants at the floor and reduce heat loss through the roof. This system  maintains occupant comfort and minimizes heating required in open areas.   SAS continues to implement LEED guidelines and best practices in the pursuit of formal certification for new  and existing buildings, as well as leased and owned office renovations. SAS has expanded use of energy- efficient lighting technologies such as LED, fluorescent and metal halides.   This year also saw the completion of our second solar farm on the companys campus. Solar Farm II – situated  on approximately seven acres adjacent to the first five-acre farm – has a 1.2-MW capacity and will produce an  estimated 1.9 million kWh each year. It comprises 5,236 ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) panels. The system  incorporates a RayTracker tracking system that rotates the assembly for maximum sun exposure, increasing  energy capture by up to 25 percent over fixed systems and reducing acreage requirements. No trees were cut  down to build the farm, and we eliminated the need for concrete support by driving steel posts into compacted  soil. To maintain the grass under the panels, sheep inhabit the 12 acres to keep them manicured and fertilized.      2010 Highlights  2010 Goals  Performance Highlights   2011 Goals  Install an additional  1.2 megawatts of  solar photovoltaic  capacity to the  existing solar farm.   Activated a 1.2-megawatt capacity  solar array at world headquarters (Solar  Farm II/August 2010) that produces an  additional 1.9 million kilowatt-hours  (kWh) of renewable energy.
