Pomeroys Corporate Responsibility &  Environmental Sustainability Plan Committed to fulfilling our social responsibilities and  striking the right balance between development and  preservation to sustain our environment!   This Corporate Responsibility and Environmental Sustainability Plan (Plan) has been developed by Pomeroy for purposes of articulating the companys commitment to fulfilling its responsibilities as a corporate citizen in the global marketplace. More specifically, with regard to the domestic and international markets that the company transacts business in, Pomeroy recognizes the importance of more formally identifying its specific corporate responsibilities, establishing initiatives to control corporate operations that intersect with these responsibilities, and, if or as appropriate, implementing a voluntary management system to measuring the companys progress accordingly. Introduction Pomeroy Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan  Confidential & Proprietary Information - 2011 2 Therefore, this Plan: 1) identifies and defines Pomeroys social and environmental responsibilities; 2) describes the controls, goals, standards or objectives that the company has established in furtherance of meeting such responsibilities; and, 3) documents the voluntary management system the company has implemented to measures its progress and/or achievement of positive results against the controls, goals or objectives.  POMEROYS CORE VALUES  AND BUSINESS PRACTICES ARE FOUNDED ON THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES: Forced or Involuntary Labor. Pomeroy will not use forced or involuntary labor of any type (e.g., forced, bonded, indentured or involuntary prison labor); employment is voluntary. Child Labor. Pomeroy will not use child labor. The term child refers to any person employed under the age of 15 (or 14 where the law of the country permits), or under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest. We support the use of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programs which comply with all laws and regulations applicable to such apprenticeship programs. Wages and Benefits. Pomeroy will, at a minimum, comply with all applicable wage and hour laws and regulations, including those relating to minimum wages, overtime hours, piece rates and other elements of compensation, and provide legally mandated benefits. Working Hours. Pomeroy will not exceed prevailing local work hours and will appropriately compensate overtime. Pomeroy will not require its employees to work more than sixty (60) hours per week, including overtime, except in extraordinary business circumstances with their consent. In countries where the work week is less, that standard will apply. Pomeroy employees should be allowed at least one (1) day off per seven-day week. Nondiscrimination. Pomeroy will not discriminate in hiring and employment practices on grounds of race, religion, age, nationality, social or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, pregnancy, political affiliation, or disability.

Pomeroy has the right to establish favorable employment conditions and to maintain effective employee communications programs as a means of promoting positive employee relations that make employees view third-party representation as unnecessary. Health and Safety. Pomeroy will provide employees with a safe and healthy workplace in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Consistent with these obligations, supplier must have and implement effective programs that encompass life safety, incident investigation, chemical safety, ergonomics, etc., and provide the same standard of health and safety in any housing that is provided to employees.

Pomeroy explores new and improved ways to transact business in a more ecologically friendly manner by  ADVOCATING, IMPLEMENTING & ADVANCING GREEN initiatives in our corporate environment that are founded on the following core principles:  CONSERVATION UTILIZATION OF ALTERNATIVE/RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES and RECYCLING. PART I: Environmental Sustainability POMEROY  Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan  Confidential & Proprietary Information - 2011 4  Environmental Sustainability Shared Responsibilities Pomeroy is aware of the impact that the company and its employees have on the environment. Pomeroy employees are expected to adhere to any directions, processes, procedures or policies that Pomeroy may provide, adopt or implement in furtherance of the corporate commitment to fostering a sustainable environment. Pomeroy strongly encourages its employees to undertake efforts to do any and all of the following in the ordinary course of their employment:  minimize waste;    restrict printing of documents where possible, using  double-sided format where available;  use e-mail rather than paper correspondence;  turn off computers and lights when leaving the office;  make use of all recycling facilities; and  bring to the attention of an appropriate person any   water leaks or dripping taps. POMEROY  Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan  Confidential & Proprietary Information - 2011 PRODUCE USE RECYCLE Philosophy & Methodology Establish an accurate baseline for the following environmental aspects that are common to Pomeroys business: Waste Management and Recycling on Pomeroys Corporate Campus  Energy Consumption on Pomeroys Corporate Campus Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions on Pomeroys Corporate Campus Set voluntary goals to achieve positive results associated with these environmental aspects of the business that Pomeroy conducts on its corporate campus. Implement initiatives, standard practices or procedures accordingly to meet such goals Conduct self-assessments or internal audits to measure the companys progress against its stated goals for the environmental aspects identified above. 5  Waste Management & Recycling POMEROY  Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan  Confidential & Proprietary Information - 2011 Pomeroy uses post-consumer recycled content products, including paper and plastic products, in its business operations. Pomeroy also recycles cardboard boxes, paper products, plastics and aluminum cans. Pomeroy established a baseline for its recycling program results in 2009 and has since implemented additional programs and practices to increase recycling activity on the companys corporate campus. In 2010, Pomeroy added three (3) cardboard compactors to its recycling program, which increased the tonnage of cardboard boxes being recycled on Pomeroys corporate campus and helped Pomeroy achieve its voluntary goals accordingly. Pomeroy also facilitates the collection of plastic, aluminum cans and glass throughout its corporate campus. These recyclable products are processed for reuse by a contracted third party. The results yielded from Pomeroys self-assessment of its recycling initiatives are provided in the graphs on the right side of this page. 6  Energy Consumption POMEROY  Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan  Confidential & Proprietary Information - 2011 In 2009, Pomeroy established a baseline for the energy consumption on its campus. Thereafter, the company implemented initiatives to reduce consumption rates. More specifically, in 2010, began upgrading the lighting on its corporate campus to improve overall energy efficiency. The upgrade project, which included Pomeroys 170,000 square feet Logistics Center, effectively replaced 400w high bay fixtures with 250 T-8 lights and directly reduced the companys recurrent energy usage and associated expenses. Pomeroy similarly upgraded its 50,000+ square feet corporate office by replacing all T-12 lighting with T-8 lighting. According to generally accepted lighting industry statistics, T-8 lighting uses one-third of the energy that T-12 lighting uses, which served as the basis for Pomeroy to undertake this environmentally friendly and fiscally responsible initiative. Pomeroy put motion sensors on lighting throughout the companys corporate campus, which allowed Pomeroy to conserve energy usage in unoccupied or underutilized spaces throughout its corporate campus. Pomeroy also installed certain new and improved thermostats, equipment, and other controls for its HVAC systems on the corporate campus in 2010, which resulted in more efficiencies and an overall reduction in energy consumption. The results yielded from Pomeroys self-assessment of its energy efficiency initiatives are provided in the graphs on the right side of this page. 7  Energy Consumption  Pomeroy has voluntarily identified future efficiency upgrades for the high energy consumption equipment and systems on the companys corporate headquarters, along with the estimated or targeted date for such upgrades, in order to ensure that Pomeroy is continuously pursuing opportunities to reduce the companys energy consumption.

The average age of the vehicles, which were comprised of various makes and models, was 8-10 years. Over the course of the last three (3) years, Pomeroy has effectively reduced and updated its fleet of vehicles. Pomeroy currently owns and operates approximately 12 motor vehicles – five (5) of which are less than two (2) years old – in the ordinary course of its business. As a result of the overall reduction in the size and age of Pomeroys motor vehicles, the company has effectively reduced its Scope 1 GHG emissions. The graph on the right depicts the marked improvement in Pomeroys Scope 1 GHG scores from 2009 through 2011. The higher the Scope 1 Greenhouse Gas Score the better! Pomeroys score improved by 2.0 points over a 24 months period, which means that the companys motor vehicle fleet is now more environmentally friendly. POMEROY  Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan  Confidential & Proprietary Information - 2011  Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions  12 POMEROY  Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan  Confidential & Proprietary Information - 2011 Greenhouse gas emissions are emitted when fossil fuels are combusted to generate electricity. Therefore, any greenhouse gas emissions, which result from Pomeroys procurement of electricity to operate its business, are indirect in nature. Pomeroys has calculated certain of its electricity usage data in order to quantify and measure the equivalent indirect GHG emissions. Overall, the data collected reflects a downward trend in electricity consumption and associated CO2 equivalent emissions. The company has employed consistent efforts to be more energy conscious and efficient. Some conservation actions include the installation of more efficient lighting and upgrading some HVAC systems. Plans for future improvements include implementing more advanced HVAC controls and more efficient HVAC systems. Additional reductions in energy consumption – and resulting Scope 2 GHG emissions – may come from continued efforts to educate employees on energy conservation measures. The graph below depicts the companys reduction in the companys total CO2 equivalent emissions. The CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions used in this calculation are estimated using methodology provided in Climate Leaders Greenhouse Gas Inventory Protocol.  Pomeroy performs asset recovery services for its clients in the ordinary course of business. As technology and businesses continue to change, IT upgrades, replacements, or consolidations are inevitable. Now, more than ever, clients rely on Pomeroy to perform necessary end-of-live services relative to their IT assets. By managing all assets through a single process and ensuring data wipes are conducted appropriately, Pomeroy can reduce liability associated with handling data protection and destruction.
