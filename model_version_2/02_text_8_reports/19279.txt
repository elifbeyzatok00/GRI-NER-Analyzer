In 2011, our businesses continued  to develop roadmaps and action plans  in an effort to achieve our strategic  sustainability  targets. These  plans  consider the technology, investment and  operational decisions we will need to  meet our longer-term targets. With plans  in place, we are prepared to achieve our  goals. This is one way to ensure that  sustainability is a shared value throughout  the Company. I am happy to report that we made good  progress on our sustainability agenda in  2011, with continuous support from our  stakeholders. Our strategy is unchanged.  Our  core  focus  is  on  delivering  shareholder  value  from  significant  structural opportunities and in building  our capability in support services. We  are now well into the sustainable and  disciplined growth.  Corporate Responsibility underpins the  responsible and sustainable delivery  of our key business drivers; as such it is  an integral part of achieving our overall  strategy. The Board believes that the  integration of Corporate Responsibility  across the Group, and the inclusion of  broader social and environmental issues  into our decision making, will help us  achieve our business goals. At the same  time, it acts as a building block for growth  in shareholder value while also bene tting  the communities in which we operate. As  such, the Board remains fully committed  to this important direction. Workplace As an employer who is committed to  career development, we spent more than  RM800 on each employee for various  training and development programmes.  The total internal and external training  programmes conducted during the  year have exceeded 200 sessions.  Our Career Ladder Programme rewards  and recognises our employees for  their achievements. Looking at our  nature of operations, safety can never  be compromised. We strive to prevent  occupational injuries while ensuring  a comfortable and safe workplace. In  order to be quali ed, all site workers are  required to attend two levels of mandatory  safety training; a Construction Industry  Development Boards (CIDB) Green Card  course conducted by CIDB personnel and  the MRCB safety Induction programme.  MRCB is committed to ensuring a safe  and healthy working environment for  all its employees and others involved in  its operations. The Company considers  statutory requirements; relevant national  and international standards and code of  practices. We continue  to develop strategic  action plans - this is  our way to ensure  that sustainability  is a shared value  throughout  the Company.  /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /   11   The MRCB contigent at the Federal Day parade Marketplace Our supply chain processes with suppliers and  customers is smooth and provides high quality  deliverables. Project delivery is managed,  monitored and reported using a variety of  management tools. Our myCRM software is  developed in-house by the Group to monitor  every stage of our product lifecycle. In 2011,  our customer satisfaction results increased  signi cantly in comparison with the previous  year. In addition, winning the Conglomerate  Awards at the BrandLaureate Awards this year  is testament to our commitment to delivering  quality products and services. These awards  were conceptualised by the Asia Paci c Brands  Foundation of which Y.Bhg Tun Dr Mahathir  Mohamad was a patron.  Community As a responsible urban developer, we are also  committed to contributing monetary or in kind  Corporate Social Responsibility assistance and  affordable housing to the needy within our  areas of operations.  We are happy to play our role in developing  affordable  homes  in  support  of  the  Governments effort to ensure all Malaysians  are able to purchase their own homes with our  contribution to the PR1MA Scheme.  The Brick elds blind community is located  very close to our iconic Kuala Lumpur Sentral  Central Business District (CBD) development.  A stakeholder communications session was  held with the Malaysian Association for the  Blind (MAB) in March 2011 to discuss ways to  help the blind navigate their way around during  the upgrading works in Brick elds.  Through our contributions to Promoting  Intelligence, Nurturing Talent and Advocating  Responsibility (PINTAR) programme, we  continue to support educational necessities for  children and families in need. We hope to ease  the economic challenges facing these families  by improving educational opportunities and  an enhanced learning experience to their  children. We also spent on building a futsal  court for residents at Kampung Bakar Batu and  the pupils of SK Tebrau Bakar Batu, an MRCB   12   /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /  PINTAR school. With the opening of this futsal  court, MRCBs PINTAR students are encouraged  to not only excel in academic performance  but also be actively involved in co-curriculum  activities. I am pleased to see an improvement  in the examination results of these children in  all schools in 2011. We are also actively contributing to other  philanthropic, cultural and heritage activities.  These initiatives can be found in the Community  section of this Report. Our commitment to  developing the community was recognised  through earning a double Distinguished  Honouree medal at the 2011 International  Business Awards in two categories on 13 October 2011, at an award ceremony at Abu  Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The winning  entries are the MRCBs PINTAR programme,  which was accorded a Distinguished Honouree in  the Corporate Social Responsibility Programme  of the Year in Asia (Asia, Australia and New  Zealand) while the Green Building Initiative was  also nominated as a Distinguished Honouree in  the Environmental Responsibility Programme  of the Year (Asia, Australia and New Zealand).  Honourees were selected from more than  1,700 entries received from organisations and  individuals in more than 40 countries where  honourees were determined through two  rounds of judging by professionals worldwide.  Environment As a construction company, MRCB has an  obligation to help create awareness on global  warming. We have decided to adopt a more pro- active approach by incorporating sustainable  elements in our property development. Since  2009, MRCB has incorporated green building  requirements into our Kuala Lumpur Sentral  development, utilising international green  building certi cation standards, notably, the US- based Leadership in Energy and Environmental  Design (LEED), Singapores BCA Green Mark  and Malaysias Green Building Index (GBI)  for all its new development in Kuala Lumpur  Sentral (Nu Sentral, Kuala Lumpur Sentral Park  and 348 Sentral). Moreover, we also encourage  our clients and partners in going green with  Datuk Mohamed Razeek Hussain, the CEO of MRCB receiving The Brandlaureate Awards 2010-2011 A MESSAGE FROM  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER   /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /   13   The atrium at Platinum Sentral  14   /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /  their developments, and these have resulted in several of them  adopting green certi cations. These include Platinum Sentral  (BCA Green Mark Platinum) CIMB Of ce Tower (BCA Green Mark  Gold); Perdana Sentral Of ce Tower (Leed Silver); and St. Regis  Hotel and Residences (GBI Gold). In addition to our internal environmental initiatives to minimise  environmental impacts such as noise, waste, water and  emissions, we also contributed to the greening of Greater Kuala  Lumpur development plan by contributing RM1 million to the  creation of Taman Botani Perdana. The 122-year-old  Taman  Botani Perdana was upgraded and rebranded to establish a  premier botanical garden in the heart of the city. Our Commitment to Sustainable Reporting Our commitment to transparent disclosure was once again  recognised when we were named as one of the 27  nalists at  the StarBiz-ICR Malaysian Awards, held at Intercontinental  Hotel, Kuala Lumpur on 29 March 2011. This time, MRCB was  amongst the runner-ups, for the market category, af rming  MRCBs commitment to operating in an economically, socially  and environmentally sustainable manner while balancing  the interest of diverse stakeholders. Our achievement was  recognised by the StarBiz-ICR Committee for demonstrating  outstanding CR practices that go beyond community and  philanthropic activities.  We were also named as one of the 20 shortlisted companies  recognised for excellent corporate sustainability performance  by the Association of Chartered Certi ed Accountants (ACCA) at the prize giving ceremony of Malaysia Sustainability  Reporting Awards (MaSRA) 2011, held on 4 October 2011 at  Shangri-La Hotel, Kuala Lumpur. Our Sustainability Report  was selected from a total of 43 reports submitted, with the  judging criteria based on completeness, credibility and  communications. We continue to improve our disclosure and the dissemination  of transparent, credible and accurate information to our  stakeholders. This transparency helps us quantify and ensure  our sustainability efforts are real. In realising this commitment,  this year we have engaged SIRIM QAS International Sdn Bhd,  an internationally-recognised body in sustainability veri cation  and assurance to ensure the credibility of our disclosure. We  believe that this transparent and bias-free engagement will add  value to this Report.  Continuing our Support of the 10 UNGC principles MRCB continues to be represented as a committee member of  the Malaysian Chapter of the United Nations Global Compact  (UNGC) in keeping with our aim of adopting international  standards for our CSR programmes and vision.

MRCB Board Structure The MRCB Board comprises eight members,  ve of whom are  Independent Directors, two Non-Independent Non-Executive  Directors and one Non-Independent Executive Director.

Renewable Energy (RE) is  derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly.  RE includes electricity and heat generated from solar, wind,  ocean, hydropower, biomass and geothermal resources.  It also includes biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable  resources. RE is seen as a growth sector that will help propel  the country into a high-income economy. RE plays a major  role in meeting a countrys energy needs, enabling businesses  to reap energy cost savings and revenue while combating  global warming. Malaysias commercial demand for energy  is projected to increase. MRCB is looking forward to working  with the Government to develop RE in Malaysia and is keen to  explore the opportunities ahead in RE.  MRCB has entrenched its commitment to Malaysias Green  Objectives in support of the Governments green agenda.  To date, we are proud to lead Malaysias green building initiative  by committing to abide by Malaysias Green Building Index for  all its current and future development. In addition, MRCB continues to participate in the Earth hour  movement by turning off all non-essential lights in our key  development each year. In our operations as a major developer,  we believe we should be concerned with the dramatic climate  change by making a positive contribution to climate change by  participating in green awareness programmes including the  monitoring of our energy usage during construction.

In 2011, MRCB continued to support this cause by  contributing a total of RM397,237.20 to nine schools. This includes  all the programmes we sponsor for PINTAR schools including  motivational, tuition, and the sponsorship of school bags, shoes  and uniforms. MRCB donated school supplies to help alleviate  the economic burden of these underprivileged childrens parents  and their transition to school. MRCB also provides motivational,  educational and academic assistance in the form of educational  materials, tutoring and monetary incentives for high achievers.  On 23 November 2011, a futsal court was built at SK Tebrau Bakar  Batu, Johor Bahru to encourage students to excel academically  and be actively involved in co-curriculum activities. In the same  year, two students received the Anugerah Tokoh Cemerlang  MRCB 2011 for their academic excellence while two other  students were honoured with the Tokoh Ko-Kurikulum for extra-curricular achievement. Each student received a Voucher  Cenderahati Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN) amounting to  RM150 as an incentive to encourage greater academic and extra- curricular achievements. The event was attended by 300 people  including more than 100 students and teachers from SK Tebrau  Bakar Batu, MRCB employees and of cials from the Ministry of  Education. The PINTAR programme covers a wide range of activities aimed  at providing tuition or additional classes to weaker and  nancially  disadvantaged students. The objective of the programme is  to improve academic performance and provide a better study  experience. We also donated school supplies to these students  to ease the parents burden on school item expenses. In 2011, we  continued our sponsorship of English Newspapers, DIDIK, to all  schools. With the motivation from the Government to encourage  the use of English in learning, these newspapers have become a  useful tool in improving students English language skills.

The teachers and pupils were very excited to have  learning processes outside the school organised by MRCB.  In addition, MRCBs contributions to buy workbooks were  a great help for the school, students and parents. Manisah Binti Wanthan, Senior Assistant, SK Serandu,  Pahang  44   /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /  COMMUNITY Improving Connectivity at Kuala Lumpur Sentral and its vicinity  With the community at heart, MRCB makes a point of  providing convenience and comfort to the public. Currently,  we have embarked on building connectivity within our iconic  development Kuala Lumpur Sentral and its immediate vicinity.  The LRT-Monorail integration project at SSKL is made available  by a 410m walkway which was completed in August 2010. The  work on the pedestrian crossing linking Jalan Tun Sambanthan  and the Nu Sentral Complex began in October 2011 and is  scheduled to be completed in July 2012. Once completed, the  pedestrian crossing will connect the monorail with SSKL.  The Kuala Lumpur Sentral Monorail integration works with  SSKL, forms one of the three LRT and monorail integration  project started in March 2010 which includes the monorail  stations at Titiwangsa, Masjid Jamek and Kuala Lumpur Sentral. MRCB welcomes the Governments vision of boosting public  transportation usage by improving transport connectivity with  SSKL as it is already the main transport for the Klang Valley. Upgrading Mosques Quarters MRCB spent RM3 million for the re-construction of workers  quarters and other facilities at Masjid Jamek Pasir Pelangi via  its subsidiary, MRCB Lingkaran Selatan Sdn Bhd (MLSSB). The  completed quarters was handed over to the Imam of the mosque  on 23 August 2011. The reconstruction involves eight units of houses in the more  than a century old royal mosque, Masjid DiRaja. The building had  never been upgraded, other than the repair and maintenance  work which was borne by the state government, since the  quarters were built in the 1980s. MLSSB reconstructed the quarters and added more parking lots  in the mosque compound raising the number from 50 to 180.  RM150,000 was also spent on building a futsal court for residents  at Kampung Bakar Batu and the pupils of SK Tebrau Bakar Batu.  This court is now being used by local residents.

The dialogue  was attended by MRCB, DBKL and MABs  committee members. We realised that  our Brick elds construction project might  cause inconvenience for the blind with  unfamiliar obstacles blocking their way.  The dialogue was successfully concluded  with MRCB and DBKL gaining a better  understanding of the needs of the blind  community in Brick elds. Following this,  suggestions and requests from MAB were  implemented at all road works sites within  the Brick elds area. On a separate occasion, MRCB contributed  RM50,000 to MAB on 14 December  2011. This contribution has helped MAB  develop programmes for the visually  impaired to improve their livelihoods  and create a sustainable income for their  futures.  MRCB participates in PR1MA Scheme The 1Malaysia Housing Programme  (PR1MA) is speci cally for moderate- income Malaysians earning RM6,000  or less per month regardless of whether  they work with the Government, the  private sector or are self-employed. This  scheme assists the moderate-income  group who cannot afford to purchase  high-priced houses and are not eligible  to be considered for the existing low-cost  public housing programmes. MRCB participated in the of cial launch  of the PRIMA launch at Putrajaya which  was of ciated by the Prime Minister  YAB  Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak on 4 July 2011.  MRCB has identi ed Seremban which is  one of 20 sites targeted for development.  42,000 houses are expected to be built  on these 20 sites. MRCB believes it is  important to develop affordable homes  in support of the Governments effort  to ensuring all Malaysian are able to  purchase their own homes.

Direct and Indirect Impact of  Operations on Communities We recognise the signi cant impacts that our operations  have brought to our communities. Brick elds is the home  of one of our signi cant local stakeholder groups, due to its  close proximity to our  agship operation in the Kuala Lumpur  Sentral development. Our online community portal is dedicated  to the local community. This portal provides up-to-date  information on ongoing projects, a forum for communication  and networking between us and the residents of Brick elds. MRCB has committed to contributing RM1.6 million for the  beauti cation and maintenance of Brick elds. This contribution  was used mainly for the upkeep and maintenance of the Little  India Fountain, one of the tallest fountains in the country. As one of the largest property development and investment  companies, public infrastructure is given careful attention on all  our projects. This includes the building of roads, bus stops, civil  works and other aspects of community infrastructure. These  developments have resulted in positive externalities to our  local communities. We respond to the needs of people living  in the communities by conducting stakeholder assessment as  part of our project planning process.  48   /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /  COMMUNITY Investor Relations At MRCB, Investor Relations (IR) is an area of communications  which speci cally targets the investment and  nancial  community such as shareholders, institutional investors, fund  managers, analysts, bankers as well as research and stock  broking houses and the investing public. MRCB holds regular investor and analyst brie ngs as part of its  IR initiatives in integrating two-way communication with the  Community and other constituencies. The main objective of this  approach is to inform and update potential investors and current  stakeholders of MRCBs position in the current economic market  and to gain further con dence in the Companys management.  We aim to achieve a fair evaluation at our IR sessions. Our  team comprises Corporate Finance members and Senior  Management who present business updates and business  operational strategies. A total of 44 IR sessions were held in  2011 locally and internationally. This has resulted in an overall  positive positioning for MRCB with its brand being recognised at  the BrandLaureate Awards in 2011. Our IR Teams responsibilities include:    Creating awareness of the Groups potential, fundamental  and  nancial strength to the investment community.    Educating the investment community on the Groups core  business activities, strategy, vision and core values.    Communicating updates on the Groups new developments.

The following communications media were actively used in 2011  to serve our IR stakeholders including shareholders; foreign and  local fund managers; research and investment analysts;  nancial  and business media; Government regulators and the  nancial  community. Public Policy Development and Lobbying As a GLC, MRCB supports the governments efforts on social  and national development. The Silver Book - Achieving Value  through Social Responsibility which has been adopted since 2007 outlines guidelines and principles for GLCs to contribute to society and manage their social obligations. This methodology is in line with our commitment to supporting  public policy development. In addition, we have made no  signi cant contributions to or maintained any links with political organisations during the reporting period. We also received  no signi cant contributions from the Government. Our ad-hoc  engagement activities include entertainment such as luncheon  and dinners; visits to relevant ministry or government agencies;  sponsorships and donations; events and direct mailing letters.

We are committed to eliminating fraud and corruption  by ensuring all activities are conducted ethically, honestly and  to the highest possible standards of transparency, openness  and accountability.  Employees or any parties found to have participated in  fraudulent acts are subject to disciplinary action, up to and  including termination, pursuant to the Groups Human  Resources policies and procedures. Similarly, Directors are  also subjected to action as applicable under the law and  Companies Act provisions. Our Code of Ethics states how we  are expected to conduct ourselves and speci cally requires  offers of gifts, hospitality and any items that could give rise to  potential con icts of interest to be declared.  Employees are forbidden from accepting kickbacks, lavish gifts  or gratuities in any form. Employees are also not allowed to  give gifts, loans or other bene ts to a customer. Business deals  within MRCB are based on the best interests of the Company  and must not be motivated by personal considerations or relationships. Relationships with prospective or existing  suppliers, competitors or regulators must not affect the  independence and sound judgement of MRCB. A declaration must be made to the management in a situation  that may be, or appear to be, a con ict of interest. MRCB  employees are prevented from receiving payment for services  from any competitors, customers, distributors or suppliers.  Bribes or kickbacks are strictly prohibited.  MRCB does not permit con icts of interest on behalf of its  employees. Employees must not become involved in a con ict  of interest and must report such a con ict should it come  to their attention. Employees or their family members are  forbidden from accepting gifts, loans, business deals, or other  special preferences. Small gift items may be accepted and the  occasional meals.  We conducted a survey in early 2012 to gauge employees  knowledge of MRCBs anti-corruption and bribery policy and  other ethical guidelines in the code of Business Ethics. Only  13.77% of employees felt that there was inadequate information  provided on this area during induction training. Compliance We are pleased to report that there were no incidents or penalties  for violations involving anti-competitive, anti-trust and monopoly  practices at any time in the history of our operations.

As part of our responsibility to our  employees, we conducted a survey in early 2012 to understand if  our employees believe we had the right balance between family  and work life within MRCB. We discovered that only 11.38% of  respondents were dissatis ed with this.  Supporting Local Talents Being a GLC, MRCB participated at the GLC Open Day which was  held at the KL Convention Centre from 24 to 26 June 2011. During  the event, we demonstrated how the Company developed  the nations largest transportation hub, Stesen Sentral Kuala  Lumpur (SSKL), which connects local and international  travellers and commuters. We also participated in the inaugural  Barisan Nasional (BN) Youth Job Fair 2011 which was held from  25 to 27 March and 18 to 20 November 2011. Between 400,000  to 500,000 job-seekers including school leavers and fresh  graduates attended the three-day job fair. MRCB also supported  the second Barisan Nasional (BN) Youth Job Fair which was  held from 18 to 20 November 2011. The job fair road tour helped  us to reach out and provided access to talents nationwide. These  job fairs targeted Malaysians. A total of 11,350 job applications  were received from the three events. Bene ts  In addition to the basic salary, we offer a comprehensive  attractive bene ts package. The health of our employees is of  paramount importance and we provide a comprehensive medical  package to employees. This medical coverage also extends  to the employees family members and includes outpatient  treatment, specialist care, ward entitlement and hospitalisation.  All employees are also entitled to dental treatment. An employee is entitled to sick leave on producing a medical  certi cate from the Companys panel clinics or during an  emergency by any registered medical practitioner. An employee  is granted sick leave without hospitalisation up to a maximum  of 28 working days per calendar year. An employee who is  hospitalised will be granted sick leave up to a maximum of 60  days per calendar year provided hospitalisation is recommended  by the Companys panel of doctors. WORKPLACE MRCB booth at the GLC Open Day  /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /   53   We believe that a balance between  work and life, leads to a happy,  healthy and  productive work  environment. Three days of leave is given to employees at their time of  marriage. Maternity leave is given to women who have children  and two days paternity leave is also given to fathers working at  MRCB.

This is subject to approval depending  on the relevance of the course to their current job scope.  An overseas clothing allowance is given every three years to  help employees travelling abroad to purchase clothes they  would otherwise have no need for. We will also reimburse  management and executive employees up to RM50 per month  to help with internet subscription fees.  We allow eligible employees to take one pilgrimage leave of 40  days in a lifetime. Employees who have served the Company for  more than  ve years are permitted to opt for the early withdrawal  of their retirement bene ts to help  nance the Haj.  A festival subsidy is given to all employees celebrating the  various festivals to enhance the good relationship between  MRCB and its employees and to join in the joy of the festival.  Each employee is entitled to one subsidy per year from the  following list of festivals: 1. Hari Raya Puasa - for Muslim employees  2. Chinese New Year - for Chinese employees  3. Deepavali - for Indian employees  4.  Christmas - for employees who celebrate Christmas Employees are given a voucher worth RM50 which is redeemable  at selected Departmental stores. As part of our impact assessment of these programmes we  conducted a formal survey of employee responses of those  entitled to various bene ts during 2012. 67.66% of employees  were satis ed with the medical bene ts they received. 62.87%  and 60.48% of employees were happy with the level of additional  care and group insurance policy bene ts respectively.  57.33% of those eligible were happy with the availability and  duration of examination leave and only 4.00% were unhappy.   64.07% of employees were generally happy with their jobs in  MRCB and its subsidiaries. Overall, we are pleased that our  employees are enjoying our bene ts. We hope to review our  bene ts programmes in-line with our employees expectations.  All MRCBs pension liabilities are covered through the EPF  scheme. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) is a Malaysian government  agency under the Ministry of Finance. EPF manages the  compulsory savings plan and retirement planning for employed  workers in Malaysia. The EPF is intended to help employees  save a proportion of their salary in a lifetime banking scheme  which can be used in the event that the employee is temporarily  or no longer  t to work.  MRCB contributes 12% of employees salary to EPF savings  as required by law. MRCB also provides additional, unfunded  retirement bene ts to permanent employees who joined before  1 September 2002 and have been in the service for a continuous  period of at least ten years.  54   /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /  WORKPLACE Fair Pay and Equal Opportunities MRCB is committed to compensating all employees at a level  that is at least equivalent to the industry average for both  construction and property management sectors. The Group also  regularly reviews employees salaries and bene t packages as  the need arises. Employees Grievances Our grievances policy and procedures are important to ensure  that any one person does not arbitrarily make decisions which  will be prejudicial to the interests of the employees and MRCB.  These procedures allow employees to voice their problems or  complaints to higher levels of management. The purpose of the  procedure is to settle grievances as close as possible to the root  cause. In any event, an employee is encouraged to discuss his  or her grievance with the immediate superior  rst. If he fails  to get a satisfactory response, he may make use of the appeal  procedures. Collective Bargaining Agreements It has not been considered bene cial for us to have a Group- wide union with the relatively low number of non-executive  staff throughout the Group. However, we continue to respect  employees rights to join unions or organisations of their choice.  Being a responsible employer, the Group Human Resources  Manual has codi ed procedures and processes available for all  employees to engage collectively to protect their rights. Notice Period for Operational Change Any restructuring of operations is done after consultations  with managerial and supervisory employees. The impact of the  changes is also assessed when appropriate. If the Company  makes any operational changes which potentially affect our  employees, we have a policy of giving a minimum of two weeks  notice to the relevant staff. The more signi cant the operational  change, the longer the given notice period. In promoting a two-way communication with our employees,  we regularly communicate our activities, updates, proposed  programmes and other updates via our intranet which is the  main channel of communication with all employees. Human Rights Our Human Resources Policy covers a wide range of human  rights related topics. This Policy is also incorporated in our  Investment and Procurement practices, with human rights  screening as an added value given during suppliers and  contractors screening. There have been no incidents of  discrimination reported during the year. We are pleased to  report that there have been no incidents of discrimination or  risks to freedom of association and collective bargaining. Our  operations are mainly in areas of urban development which do  not affect the rights and lives of our indigenous community.  There were no incidents of violations involving discrimination,  child labour, forced or compulsory labour risks. Training MRCB continues to grow while placing emphasis on attracting  and retaining talent within the Company. We believe that  our employees are our greatest assets and crucial to our  continued success as a developer. Our workplace practices  and policies re ect this and we are committed to investing in  our employees training and career development.  The budget allocated for training in 2011 was RM827 per  employee. The average hours of training received per  employee is seven hours. We conduct internal training programmes and team building  activities for our employees. These programmes were  designed to develop individual initiatives, interpersonal skills  and the technical competence of employees.  As part of our responsibility to our employees, we conducted  a survey to gauge employee job satisfaction and the level to  which their training and career development programmes  ful l their needs. This survey was anonymously carried out by  independent consultants during early 2012.  Career Development for Employees  /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /   55   64.75% of surveyed employees believed the team building  programme had helped them feel a sense of company  pride and loyalty. 76.23% considered their people skills had  improved as a result of the programme. 68.03% considered  these exercises have helped MRCB develop a new working  culture.  MRCB employees are also encouraged to go for formal  certi cation such as diploma or degree to foster the next  generation of leaders. Currently, we are yet to design training  programmes for retirees. There were 76 internal training  programmes and 139 external training programmes held  in 2011. Some topics covered during these programmes are  highlighted below. Recognising our people as the most important asset, we  constantly put every effort into helping employees gain  maximum job satisfaction through challenging career  growth and development. An employee, who positively and  consistently demonstrates his or her ability and readiness for  higher responsibility, will be given the opportunity to rise in the  Company subject to the normal organisational constraints.  Promotions may not be within the same function. Progression  may present itself in other functions within the Corporation. At  times, such opportunities may even present itself in the form  of positions outside this country. There are those who excel  as being self-contributors. For these employees their ultimate  potential may be realised through other non-supervisory  positions. It is for this group of employees that the Career  Ladder Programme is introduced.

Employees  are encouraged to give suggestions on various topics including  methods or processes to enhance daily working and tools  to expedite the work. All views on improving any aspect of  safety, health and of ce environment are welcomed. We also  like to hear about products and services offered by other  companies and ways to improve of ce operations. We welcome  tips on improving self-motivational, leadership, effective  communications skills and general working conditions. Sensible  suggestions will be implemented provided they are practical,  implementable,  nancially viable and not for personal interest.    Performance Appraisal At MRCB, we conduct a performance appraisal on a yearly basis  in addition to informal periodic and ad hoc reviews. This is to  ensure that regular feedback is given, thereby motivating the  strong performers and discovering performance gaps. During  the appraisal reviews, the overall performance rating that  has been determined based on the periods performance is  discussed. Emphasis is given to the individuals competencies,  achievements, training and development needs. We acknowledge  the importance of this review especially for:   Setting work standards.    Assessing the employees actual performance relative to  these standards.    Providing feedback to the employee with the aim of  motivating that person to eliminate performance de ciencies  or to continue to perform above average. At MRCB, performance management is an on-going, year round  interactive process between managers or supervisors and  their employees. We believe that if performance management  is properly managed, employees will perform in the most  effective ways to produce the desired results. Our performance  management system also helps managers and supervisors  assess individuals performance and build effective working  relationships with their employees through:    Assessing people on both their results, their competencies  and management practices     Encouraging ongoing coaching, counselling, development  and on-the-job training   Openly discussing career opportunities Step One - Distribution and  Completion of the PDR Forms The Performance Development  Review (PDR) forms are  distributed to the respective Head  of Companies / Head of Divisions  by the 1st week of October  together with the set guidelines.  The immediate superior will  arrange for a suitable time for the  Performance Review interview  with individual employees. Step Two - Veri cation and  Checking Human Resources checks for  completeness and accuracy of the  PDR forms before tabulating the   nal report. The above process is  completed within two weeks. Step Three - Review Committee Human Resource discusses with  individual Company/Division on  the justi cation of the grading  for each Executive at the levels  stated above if the ratings do not  follow the set guidelines.  /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /   57   Career Ladder Programme Unlike promotions to vocational, supervisory or managerial  positions, Career Ladder progressions are based on individual  competency and contributions. Progression through the Career  Ladder is based on the level of experience, skills demonstrated,  performance level and potential for growth. The higher the level  of each of the above criteria demonstrated by the employee, the  faster will be his or her rate of progression within the Career  Ladder and MRCB. As our operations become more complex,  the classi cations can be further enhanced.  We recognise the importance of understanding our employees  needs. As part of our employees career management framework,  we continue to conduct our formal appraisal system for full-time  employees twice a year. This evaluation also acts as guidance  for our remuneration system which is used in pay increment,  promotion and bonus decisions. In 2011, 100% of our employees  received a formal performance evaluation at least once during  the year.

MRCB practices decentralised  management for its projects, each project is managed by  a site manager including all health and safety aspects. This  decentralised approach results in all occupational safety data  such as accidents being compiled for each site independently.  Our Health and Safety Manual covers all employees including  subcontractors at construction sites.  In order to be quali ed, all site workers are required to attend  three levels of mandatory safety training, including Construction  Industry Development Board (CIDB) Green Card course, which  is carried out by CIDB personnel. In accordance with formal  requirements, we liaise with CIDB to organise a Green Card  course for every 35 newly employed site workers.

We also consider statutory requirements; relevant  national and international standards; and Code of Practice.  The effectiveness and implementation of the Safety and Health  Policy is our line managers` responsibility together with the  support and involvement of all employees. We continue to  ensure that suf cient and adequate training and resources are  made available to achieve this. It is hoped that the appropriate  practices and sharing of OSH approach and common values will  inculcate safety and health working culture for MRCB and its  group of companies. The Safety and Health initiatives are regularly reviewed to ensure  continuous improvement is made to the Policy and how it is  implemented. This policy is monitored to ensure the achievement  of our objectives and will be reviewed in light of legislative or  organisational changes.

Annual Disaster Drill at Stesen Sentral Stesen Sentral Kuala Lumpur (SSKL) conducted an annual crisis  and disaster drill on 24 June 2011, designated as Ex Sentral  11 for the 11th consecutive year. This annual drill prepares  employees for emergency situations. This years event simulated  an armed robbery at the Transit Concourse, Level 1, Stesen  Sentral Kuala Lumpur. The exercise was conducted to minimise  risk and ensure the emergency response plan is executed  effectively in the event of an emergency. The public at Level 1, 2, 3 and 4 was requested to evacuate the  building and were led out before gathering at an identi ed open  area nearby. The simulation was conducted after operational  hours, so not to affect the trains and other public transport  services.  Semasa Sentral Sdn Bhd performed the successful operation  with the help of external parties. These include The Department  of Railways, National Security Council, Polis Diraja Malaysia,  Jabatan Bomba dan Penyelamat Malaysia, Emergency  Department University Malaya Medical Centre, Keretapi Tanah  Melayu Berhad, Ekspress Rail Link Sdn Bhd and Rangkaian  Pengangkutan Aliran Deras. Training for Contractors and Sub-Contractors MRCB recognises the need for environmental awareness  training for contractors and sub-contractors who are involved in  the construction phase of our projects. Environmental training is  conducted at the start of each project which involves awareness  of the Environmental Management Plan and best management  practice on site. The training exercise involves both theoretical  and practical techniques. Some of the training exercises that  have been covered include Emergency Response Plan (ERP)  training and induction; and Occupational First Aid.  62   /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /  OUR PROMISE TO  SUSTAINABLE MARKETPLACE  PRACTICES Ou Ou Ou Ou Ou Ou Ou Ou Ou Ou Ou Ou O r r ma ma ma ma ma ma m rk rk rk rkk rkk rket etpl p ac ace  e co co co co comm mm mm mm mm mm mmitititititme me me me me me me meent nt nt nt nt ntt ntt nt ntt ens ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns nss ns ns nsur ur urr ur ur ur ur ur ur ur ur ur ur urres es es es es es es es es es es es es a smo mo mo m ot ot ot o h su su su su su su su su su supp pp pp ppp ppply ly ly ly ly ly ly ly-c -c -c -cc -c -cc -cc - ha ha ha ha h in i cyc ycc yccle l inv nv nvv l ol ol ol ol ol ol ol ol o i vi vi vi vi vi vi ving ng ng ngg rel el elat at at at a io ions ns nshi hi hips ps ps wititith ou ou ou ou ou ou ou ou ouu ou ou ou ou ouu ou ou ou ouu our r cu cu cu cu cu cu cu cu cu cu cu cu cu cu cu cu c t st st st st s om m om om mer e s s an ann annd su su supp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp ppp pplilililililililililililililililil er er er er er er er er er er ers.s We co cont nt ntin in inuo uo uoo uo uo uo uoous us uss us us us us usly ly ly ly ly ly ly  en en enga ga gage ge ge wititititith th t es ese stakehol ol ol oll oll ol oll ol o de de de de de de de de de de de de de dee dee deers rs rs rss rs rs rss rs rs r to un un un un un un un un unn un unndee de de de de de de de dee de de de de d rs rs rs rs rs rs rs rs rs rss rs rs rs rss rs rs rsta ta ta ta ta ta ta taa ta taa ta ta ta ta d ndd nd nd ndd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd  th thhei ei ei ei ei eir r r ne ne ne ne ne ne ne ne nee ne ne need ed ed ed ed ed ed ed ed ed ed ed eds s s s too too achh chhie i ve the he hee he he he hee he he he he he he hee hee hig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ighe he he he he hee he he he he h st st st st st st st st st st st st st st st s sat at a isisfa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa faa f t ct ct ct ct ct ct c io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io io ion an an an an an an an an an an an an an and mo mo mo mo m st st ef f f f fcientt del eliver er er er er er er er e y.y.y.y.y    /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /   63    64   /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /  MARKETPLACE MRCBs procurement decisions are made based solely on  MRCBs best interests. A proper agreement is documented which  clearly identi es the services or products to be provided. It also  included the basis for payment and the applicable rate or fee. The  amount of payment must be commensurate with the services  or products provided. All vendors are treated equally and are  accorded the same information at the same time. MRCB tries to  ensure there are no leaks of information during the procurement  process.  To ensure a fair procurement practice, a tender process is  encouraged at all times in the Company. Policies and processes  involved in our tendering aim to promote transparency and  prevent any con ict of interest. The brief process is outlined  below:    For a closed tender exercise, at least  ve prospective  subcontractors shall be shortlisted and called.    For open tenders, a tender notice shall be advertised in the  mainstream newspapers for at least three consecutive days.    The tender process shall be conducted in a timely and  transparent manner. The Tender Evaluation Report (TER) shall  serve as the basis for obtaining and evaluating tenders.    Information submitted by the subcontractors shall be kept  strictly con dential.    The cost quoted by selected subcontractors shall not vary  more or less than 15% from tender estimate. Should this  occur, an explanation is to be recorded in the TER.  Locally Based Supply Chain We conduct our major construction works entirely through  subcontractors. This is part of our effort to contribute to local  social and economic development. We allocate all subcontract  work to local suppliers in all signi cant locations and have a  common practice to source all materials locally before sourcing  them elsewhere. Operating contractors and suppliers must adhere to our safety  standards and speci cations. Project delivery is managed,  monitored and reported using a number of management tools.  Our myCRM software is developed in-house by the Group to  monitor every stage of our product lifecycle. The software is  continuously upgraded and improved to increase its coverage,  quality and security. The results of customers inspection on  their purchases are entered into myCRM software, which are  subsequently made available to the project and management  teams to help them rectify and monitor any defects on an  ongoing basis.  A Communication Policy Manual, a Property Manual, regular  customer satisfaction surveys and formal inspection processes  are also implemented at the pre-handling of all stages of each  project. The aim is to have adequate policies, procedures and  systems implemented to ensure safe and high quality delivery  to the highest level of customers expectations. Purchasing and Procurement Practices Quality Deliverable MRCBs proprietary procurement software MRCBs proprietary CRM software  /   MRCB sustainability report 2011   /   65   Customer Satisfaction Surveys We conduct our Customer Satisfaction Surveys (CSS) on our  residential and commercial properties that MRCB develops  and manages.

Construction projects that are undertaken from institutional  customers are also subject to similar procedures, excluding  the stage when the CRM team are involved. Engineering  and architecture checks apply to all MRCB projects. Upon  satisfaction of all parties, billing and post-purchase procedures  are followed. MARKETPLACE Provision of Information to Customers We continue to provide information to our customers and the  public on our residential and commercial properties through  brochures and booklets with speci cations of each unit.  Information included in each publication is based on checklists  which allow the potential purchaser to evaluate the unit against  speci cations. Repairs or replacement can be requested if  necessary before accepting delivery and up to 24 months after  delivery. Marketing and Communication Our advertising applies to advertisements in all forms of media  including television, radio, telephone, newspapers, magazines,  billboards, newsletter and the Internet. All communications by  MRCB comply with the cultural, legal and ethical standards of  the communities in which we work. We strengthened our internal  marketing approval process to ensure they are factual, clear and  properly communicated. It is a clear policy within the Group that  no misleading advertisements, promotions or sponsorship will  be tolerated in any way. The Communication Department has  established internal standards to regulate all communications  outside the Group. This applies across all companies in the  Group.  We ensure our sales personnel are well educated and  knowledgeable by providing weekly brie ngs and sales  kits to all our representatives. We also comply with the  Housing Development Act which states that all marketing  communications and advertisements in Malaysia must  rst  obtain approval and a license number from the Ministry of  Housing. We strive to protect customers from misleading  marketing messages. While these laws apply only to residential  properties, we have standardised the same regulations across  our portfolio of both residential and commercial properties.
