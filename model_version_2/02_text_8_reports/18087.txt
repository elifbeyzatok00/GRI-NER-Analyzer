In May 2011, Novelis announced a company-wide Sustainability Commitment to  significantly improve the life cycle impact of our aluminum products and meet an ambitious  set of targets for the year 2020. This, our second annual sustainability report, reviews our  progress and challenges at each life cycle stage of our business: sourcing, manufacturing,  customer use and end-of-life with consumers. It also includes context, case studies and  forward-looking goals and targets. We have aligned this report to conform to the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3.1 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and the GRI Mining and  Metals sector supplement at a GRI-checked A Application Level.

In early 2011, Novelis  put a first stake in the ground and adopted a new set   of sustainability targets, among them the strikingly  ambitious aim that 80% of our aluminum inputs will   be comprised of recycled content by the year 2020.  This, along with our other sustainability targets and  efforts, is part of our strategy to become the   low-carbon aluminum producer.  This strategic direction is based on what we think the world will look  like in 2020, which includes these conditions:   An increasingly urban population approaching 8 billion people.   Consumers who are demanding affordable "green" products and  who expect the companies, technologies and processes behind  those products to be entirely sustainable.   Hundreds of millions of tons of aluminum in use around the planet,  the vast majority of which are retrieved, recycled and employed in  the manufacture of new products.  We are embedding sustainability into our business and our way of life   how we make decisions and how we work to do the right thing for  our people, our customers, our communities and other stakeholders.   In only a year, we jumped from 33% to 39% recycled content, and we  will nearly double our recycling capacity through the strategic projects  we have already announced. This achievement brings into view our  interim goal of 50% by 2015. For example, we are investing about   $250 million at our plant in Nachterstedt, Germany, to build the worlds  largest integrated recycling system. This facility will make Novelis the  largest recycler – not just of beverage cans – but of all aluminum.  Importantly, from the perspective of our customers, our global  recycling network will create the potential for large-scale closed- loop manufacturing. Were working on this with our automotive,  beverage can and specialty customers. We melt, cast, and roll the  material; ship it to them; take back their scrap; then re-melt, cast and  roll it again. Our customers are keenly aware of the need to make  their products more sustainable – with a smaller carbon footprint  and the opportunity to close recycling loops. By engaging with our  customers and helping them meet their goals, we are transforming  these relationships. Rather than a transactional relationship, were  becoming thought partners with our customers, driven by a common  sustainability agenda. We envision a future where greater carbon constraints, rising energy  demands, depletion of natural resources, government regulation  and consumer preferences drive dramatically increased demand for  aluminum. Forging the path towards the future is going to require  Our customers are keenly  aware of the need to make their  products more sustainable. By  engaging with our customers  and helping them meet their  goals, we are transforming  these relationships. Rather than  a transactional relationship,  were becoming thought  partners, driven by a common  sustainability agenda. Phil Martens   President and Chief Executive Officer 39% In the last year, we   jumped from 33% to   39% recycled content.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 4 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability innovation to re-imagine our products and new technology to re- shape our manufacturing processes. And its going to require changes  to fundamental aspects of our industry that have been in place for  over a century. At Novelis, we call this disruptive innovation, and its  become a core value of the company. Thats why we are so excited about our new Global Research &  Technology Center near Atlanta. This state-of-the-art facility will  bring product and process innovation together to develop better  manufacturing and product specifications, as well as provide a forum  for partnering with customer companies. In addition, to underscore our commitment to being a positive force  in local and global communities, we signed up to the United Nations  Global Compact in 2012. We remain committed to the initiative, and we  are working to implement its 10 principles. We also face challenges. For example, while our overall safety record  compares well to the industry and is improving, as we shrink overall  incident rates, the percentage of severe accidents has increased. And  severe accidents, of course, are what we especially want to drive to  zero. This continues to be one of the top – if not the top – priorities in   the company.  We also still have much work to do on the consumer end of the  aluminum life cycle to help improve recovery rates for post-consumer  aluminum. Were collaborating with customers, governments,  regulators and other stakeholders to develop partnerships that  will result in higher levels of recycling. And, more broadly, we are  supporting dialogue and action to address climate change and to  facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Many companies state that their sustainability strategy is inextricably  entwined with their business strategy. With this report – and in our  future reports – we hope to demonstrate that this is truly the case for  Novelis. The truth is, this is uncharted territory for Novelis, and for most  companies. We are fortunate to have the benefit of invaluable insights  and advice from our world-class Sustainability Advisory Council.  Already, the Council's input is helping us learn about the perspectives of  sustainability thought-leaders, tap into the Councils thinking about the  future, and get their critical feedback. Novelis is both benefiting from  the sustainability movement and feeding it. Its where our attention, our  resources, our investments, and our brand are headed. We welcome  additional dialogue and partnership, and we hope to get your feedback  on our strategy and our report. Phil Martens   President and Chief Executive Officer Life Cycle Thinking Aluminum can be recycled to make  exactly the same product over  and over. Unlike other commonly  recycled materials, such as paper,  using recycled aluminum does not  affect the quality of the product. This  unique characteristic has become  a value driver in our business. We  aim to increase our use of recycled  material to 80% by 2020. Reaching  this goal requires changing the way  we conduct business in every stage  of aluminums life cycle.  See page 8 On a life cycle basis, recycled  aluminum avoids 95% of the  GHG emissions associated with  primary aluminum production,  and every recycled aluminum  metric ton saves 7.8 metric tons  of carbon dioxide equivalents  (CO2e) over the total aluminum  value chain.

Recycled aluminum is made from either pre- or post-consumer scrap,  which is shredded and de-coated, re-melted and cast into ingots.  Aluminum is infinitely recyclable, which means that, unlike most other  materials, the quality is not degraded through the recycling process.  Consequently, recycling has always been an important part of the  aluminum value chain.   Novelis is almost entirely an aluminum converter, rather than an  aluminum producer. When we use primary aluminum as our raw  material, we mainly buy aluminum ingots from producers, which we  then convert into flat rolled products (FRP). These are semi-finished  aluminum products used in the manufacture of finished goods such as  cars and packaging for beverages and food. More than 98% of what we  sell is FRP. For some customers, we produce more finished products  such as blanks or flexible tubing used by the automotive industry.  Novelis is also an aluminum recycler. We purchase used beverage  cans and other aluminum scrap, process it at our recycling facilities,  and then use the recycled aluminum in our production of new FRP.  In addition, we operate one small aluminum smelter in Brazil.

CONSUMER USE  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 9 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Our Industry  Over the last 25 years, demand for aluminum has grown by  approximately 5% per year, which is a considerably faster growth rate  than that of other comparable metals (such as steel, lead or copper).  While the historic growth in demand for aluminum has been relatively  strong, many predict it will be even stronger over the next five years.  Between 2011 and 2016, global demand for flat rolled aluminum is  expected to grow by 6.4 million metric tons, or 34%, reflecting rapidly  accelerating demand in some key sectors (see figure 4).    This strong growth in demand will be driven by three key mega trends: 1  Growth in Emerging Markets Emerging market countries, including China, India, Brazil and many  in Southeast Asia, are in the midst of a massive demographic shift.  Rapidly growing populations are increasingly migrating to urban  areas, with concurrent industrialization and accelerated economic  development. The result is an ascendant consumer class in these  markets, with the ability and desire to purchase a range of new  products – from automobiles, appliances and personal technology to  packaged foods and more. That, in turn, drives demand for aluminum;  two-thirds of the projected growth in demand over the next decade  will come from Asia alone.  1 2 3 Growth in  Demand for  Aluminum Proliferation of  Electronic Devices  and High-end  Specialties Growth in  Emerging  Markets MEGA TREND Sustainability as an  Enabler of Growth MEGA TREND MEGA TREND Beverage cans  4–5% Electronics & high- end specialties 6% 2011 2016 Automotive  25% FiGuRE 4: Long-term Global Aluminum  Demand (2011–2016 CAGR*). 2012 Aluminum is heavily  featured in the design of  many of the 2012 Olympic  Game sites, including the  Aquatic Centre and   the Velodrome. * CAGR= Compound Annual Growth Rate This growth is expected  to be due to global shifts  such as towards more  fuel-efficient cars driving  substitution with aluminum,  as well as widespread  urbanization. Source: Novelis estimates  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 10 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability 2  Proliferation of Electronic Devices and High-end Specialties Consumers in developed economies and, increasingly, in emerging  markets are dramatically increasing the number of electronic  devices they buy. In the USA, the average household owns 25  consumer electronic devices – a considerable increase over the last  three decades. Emerging markets look set to follow a similar – and  accelerated – trajectory. For example, by the middle of 2011, China had  approximately 900 million cell phone users – a nearly 25% increase  from two years prior. Burgeoning consumer demand for light, sleek,  portable electronic devices – many made with aluminum – promises to  be a significant contributor to increased demand for our products.    3 Sustainability as an Enabler of Growth Rising energy demands, greater carbon constraints, depletion of  natural resources and related government regulation, and consumer  preferences are all key factors driving demand for our products.  Aluminum is inherently strong, malleable, conductive, versatile,  infinitely recyclable and, most importantly amid energy and carbon  constraints, lightweight. As a result, aluminum offers unique potential  to help mitigate these sustainability challenges.  The recent and projected growth in demand for aluminum in the  automotive industry is one example. Driven by fuel economy  requirements, car manufacturers are increasingly turning to aluminum  to lightweight vehicles and, in turn, reduce emissions. Today,  aluminum sheet has a 2% to 3% share of the global automotive  structural and body metals market, but between 2011 and 2016, we  expect demand to increase by 25% (see page 53 for a more detailed  look at aluminum use in automobiles). The consumer electronics  sector is another example where sustainability issues are driving  demand for our products. Aluminum casings save weight, remove  heat and add to recyclability – especially important amidst expanding  product take-back legislation.   Aluminums sustainability properties are exceptional, but challenges  exist to maximizing the sustainability potential of aluminum. While  producers have made major efficiency improvements in recent years,  the production of primary aluminum still consumes large amounts of  energy and water, and creates waste. Recycling aluminum requires  95% less energy and results in 95% fewer greenhouse gases (GHGs),  compared to manufacturing primary aluminum. Novelis estimates that  the global aluminum recycling rate is approximately 70%. However,  the long life of many products that use aluminum – such as cars or  buildings – means that it can be as many as 50 years before that  aluminum makes its way back into the recycling stream. For products  with shorter life cycles, such as beverage cans, the challenge is  increasing recycling rates in locations where rates remain low.  Novelis estimates that  by 2020, global demand  for aluminum FRP could  be more than double the  amount produced in 2010.    Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 11 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Novelis estimates that by 2020, the global demand for aluminum flat rolled products  could be more than double the amount produced in 2010. Our sustainability- and  innovation-driven business strategy is designed to ensure our company capitalizes  on this strong market growth, effectively manages potential risks, and solidifies our  position as the undisputed leader in the aluminum rolled products industry.        Our Corporate Strategy  Novelis is aggressively positioning our company for rapid growth. In  2009, we initiated a process to transform our company and lay the  foundation for this growth. The process is well underway and has  touched on nearly every aspect of our business. It has required us to  make some difficult decisions and has already yielded measurable  impacts on our financial performance. Looking forward, we are  focused on executing our four-fold strategy for growth:      Growing our premium product portfolio. We are reshaping  our product portfolio to be more focused on the beverage can,  automotive, and high-end specialties market segments, and to be  more balanced across these markets. Given our particular skills and  expertise, these products provide Novelis a competitive advantage  and deliver higher value for our company, while at the same time  lowering life cycle carbon emissions. Novelis has already announced  investments of $1.7 billion to come online before 2015 to dramatically  expand our production capacity for these products, as well as our  research and development (R&D) capabilities and our recycling  capacity. While these investments will significantly grow our business  overall, we are also downsizing in some areas as we reshape our  portfolio to focus on higher-value, lower-carbon products.     Driving constant improvement in operations. An essential part of  our business transformation has been an effort called One Novelis.  The vision for One Novelis is to create a truly global organization  – in scale and practice – and to achieve it has meant a realignment  of our culture, customer interactions, processes and systems to  ensure a consistent approach across our operations. As part of  this effort, we are implementing a global business transformation  initiative, Novelis 2.0, that will enable us to operate as a globally  integrated company with consistent business practices and  systems (see page 28). In addition, we are strengthening and  standardizing the safety aspect of our Environment, Health &  Safety management system (see page 28). We are also enhancing  and harmonizing our global talent development programs   (see page 44), increasing our internal and external  Strategy and Management  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 12 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability New R&T Center Supports  Growth Plans and Sustainability  Commitments  In June 2012, Novelis opened a new,  state-of-the-art global research  and technology (R&T) center near  Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The nearly  15,000 square meter facility will  serve as the hub of Novelis R&D  activities worldwide and is designed  to expand our R&D program to  support our aggressive growth plans.  The center will offer unparalleled  R&D capabilities to help Novelis meet  the global long-term demand for  aluminum used for the automotive,  beverage can and specialties  markets. To meet the companys  sustainability commitments, a key  focus at the center will be to help  develop sustainable products and  increase the amount of recycled  metal input across our product  lines while meeting performance  requirements. With the new location  in Kennesaw, Georgia, USA, we  will enable our researchers to  interact more closely with our  global commercial, manufacturing  excellence, engineering, EHS,  leadership and strategic teams  headquartered in Atlanta.   R&T Spotlight communications, and undertaking a range of other efforts aimed at  ensuring that across all of our operations, we are using consistent,  world-class systems and processes that will enable us to deliver  world-class results.            Capturing growth in emerging markets. Emerging markets will  drive demand for aluminum in the coming decade, and Novelis is  positioning itself to capture that growth. We are already capable of  producing high-end rolled products on all four major industrialized  continents, and now we are expanding our existing production  and recycling capacity in Brazil and South Korea to better serve  the growing Asian and South American markets. In Asia, where  we expect demand for Novelis products to more than double by  2020, we are focusing, in particular, on serving the automotive and  can industry, which will be a major source of increased demand. In  April 2012, Novelis announced it is investing $100 million in its first  manufacturing facility in China. The Novelis-owned and operated  plant, set to open in 2014, will be the first facility in China dedicated  to the production of aluminum sheet for the automotive market.     Driving results through sustainability. Novelis is fundamentally  altering its business model to ensure we will capitalize on  aluminums potential – as a lightweight, infinitely recyclable metal  – to be a key part of solving the global sustainability challenge.  As one example, we have set an aggressive target to increase our  use of recycled aluminum to 80% of all input material by 2020.  To meet the target, we are building the worlds largest aluminum  recycling network and working with our customers to develop  new, more recyclable products and closed-loop recycling systems  (see Sourcing, page 21 for details on our recycling strategy). When  we reach 80%, we will not only eliminate 10 million metric tons of  GHGs from the aluminum production chain, but we will also help  ensure security of supply and, over the long term, lower the cost   of feedstock. Additionally, we will have a product portfolio that  is well positioned for future carbon tax measures. Through our  strategic investments to increase capacity serving the automotive,  beverage can and high-end specialty markets, we are also   actively positioning Novelis to capitalize on and help accelerate   the trend towards aluminum use that is being driven by energy   and carbon constraints.     By executing this strategy, we aim to approximately double our  profitability (adjusted EBITDA) between FY11 and FY16, and to  solidify our position as the undisputed leader of our industry.       Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 13 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Our Sustainability Strategy & Progress  Our sustainability strategy is directly linked to, and reinforces, our  overall corporate strategy. For example, sustainability is driving a  shift in our product mix towards higher-value, lower-carbon products  that enable our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives  through lightweighting, increased recycling and other benefits  of aluminum. Sustainability is also at the core of our approach to  manufacturing excellence and its emphasis on Environment, Health  and Safety (EHS) management and continuous improvement in  resource efficiency. It is behind our target to reach 80% recycled  input (see Sourcing, page 21, for details on our recycling strategy).  And it is heavily influencing our capital investments as we  dramatically expand recycling capacity and increase production  capabilities for lower-carbon products. Indeed, sustainability is  requiring us to re-think the basic science and technology behind our  products – and is fundamentally changing our very business model.

We believe participation in the  Global Compact is well aligned with  and supports Novelis sustainability  strategy. Our involvement will  enable us to continue to enhance  our understanding of and further  drive our performance on  sustainability. See page 68 for   our Global Compact index.

In practice, that means our strategy is designed  to address the cradle-to-cradle or cradle-to-grave impacts of  our products across the full aluminum mining, production, use and  recycling value chain – including those phases where Novelis does  not have direct operations, such as bauxite mining and alumina  refining or end-use by the consumer.  The life cycle approach reflects our awareness of the particular  sustainability attributes of aluminum. Namely, although primary  aluminum production is relatively energy- and carbon-intensive,  when viewed over the full product life cycle, aluminums sustainability  footprint improves considerably as a result of its inherently energy- saving, light-weight and corrosion-resistant nature. Aluminums  infinite recyclability is the other essential component of its  sustainability footprint, and recycling aluminum uses dramatically less  energy than manufacturing primary aluminum.  In light of this, we are using life cycle assessment (LCA) as a key  strategic tool to increasingly focus our business on those products  with more favorable life cycle attributes, including lower energy and  carbon intensity, higher levels of recycling, and greater profitability.  The life cycle approach is also driving our aggressive efforts to  expand our recycling business and dramatically increase our use of  recycled content.  Cutting our GHG Emissions in  Half: How Does 95% of 80%  Make 50%? In what on the surface seems a  paradox, implementing a life cycle  approach will actually increase  Novelis direct (Scope 1) GHG  emissions because as we grow  our recycling business (which  requires additional energy inputs),  our direct GHG emissions will also  grow. However, recycling cuts the  embedded carbon of aluminum  products by 95% compared to  primary aluminum, resulting in  reduced Scope 3 emissions. When  we reach our target of using 80%  recycled content, we will cut our  total life cycle GHG emissions by  nearly 50% despite considerable  growth in production, thereby  avoiding 10 million metric tons of  GHG emissions per year. For us,  this is a far more beneficial societal  outcome – and an outcome that  ultimately ensures the sustainability  of our whole industry – than simply  reducing our own direct emissions.

Using Materiality to Shape Our Sustainability Strategy  As part of our effort to develop a comprehensive sustainability  strategy, we conducted a materiality assessment to help us identify  and prioritize the sustainability issues that are most important for our  business and to our stakeholders. The assessment was conducted  via our ongoing engagement with external stakeholders and also  informed by Novelis planning and strategy development efforts.  Energy use and climate change are the most material issues related  to our operations and products – in particular, the upstream effects  of our sourcing of raw materials – and the central sustainability  challenge for our industry. At the same time, aluminums potential as  a solution in an increasingly carbon-constrained world is enormous. In  addition to energy and carbon reduction, our sustainability strategy  is focused on the issues that are most important to our company and  our stakeholders (see below).    Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 16 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability   Demonstrating Progress and Improving Performance In FY12, we made strong progress on many of our key targets,  including increasing our use of recycled input from 33% to 39% in just  one year and making steady progress towards our energy efficiency  goal. In some instances, however, our progress is not what we had  hoped. For example, although our recordable rates have improved,  we unfortunately experienced two fatalities in FY12. As a result, we  are taking steps to strengthen our safety management system – as  well as to address other performance setbacks – which we believe  will lead to improvements in the future.  Focusing on Internal Engagement on Sustainability  One of our key areas of focus in the past year has been on  communicating and engaging with our employees about Novelis  sustainability commitment. Our objective is to educate employees  about our approach to sustainability and how they can contribute  to our efforts. We have dramatically increased our internal  communications on sustainability using management briefings,  company publications, our intranet, and other vehicles. We also  created an employee-specific summary of our 2011 sustainability  report, translated into the local language at all Novelis operating sites,  and distributed to every employee, which outlined how sustainability  relates to all areas of our business and how employees could become  engaged. We will continue to regularly update our employees on our  sustainability initiatives.  We have also used forums, such as our annual Leadership Summit  and plant manager meetings, to communicate about and engage  employees on sustainability. While we have made good progress  building greater awareness of sustainability among our employees,  we still have more work to do to fully embed sustainability into our  culture. We will continue to hold workshops and other sessions  with all the different functions within Novelis to further educate and  engage them in the companys sustainability efforts.  Novelis employees gather at the end  of the annual Leadership Summit in  September 2011 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 17 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Sustainability Management & Governance At Novelis, we are working to take an integrated, cohesive approach  to managing sustainability issues alongside, and on par with,  our other financial and operational objectives. Indeed, because  sustainability is such an integral part of our corporate strategy, our  sustainability and business performance are increasingly interrelated.     Corporate Governance & Policy Framework   Management of our company starts with our strict adherence to  corporate governance principles. Novelis Board of Directors is  comprised of five directors, all of whom were appointed   by our sole shareholder, Hindalco Industries Limited, which is a  publicly-held company whose shares are listed for trading on the  Mumbai Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange of India and  the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Our Board oversees and provides  guidance on the overall direction of our company, while our executive  officers are responsible for the day-to-day management.    Novelis has a Code of Conduct for the Board of Directors and Senior  Managers that reflects our ethical principles and our core values.   This code is a key pillar of corporate governance practices and  complies with both the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations of  the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  This is supplemented by a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial  Officers, which reflects our commitment to financial integrity and to  full and accurate financial disclosure in compliance with applicable  accounting policies, laws and regulations. It sets out specific  principles to guide the companys senior financial officers in the  performance of their duties. Senior financial officers are, therefore,  bound by the requirements of both documents. Updated Employee Code of Conduct Novelis also has a Code of Conduct for all employees, which prohibits  conflicts of interest, political activity, kickbacks and anti-competitive  behavior, among other things. We have been updating the Code of  Conduct, which will be rolled out to all employees in FY13, supported  by communication and training programs.   Sustainability Management at Novelis  Novelis Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, who reports  to the companys CEO, is responsible for leading implementation  of the companys sustainability strategy. Because our sustainability  strategy is integrated into our corporate strategy and cuts across  all aspects of our business, implementation is by necessity cross- functional. All of Novelis senior executives have responsibility for  delivering on some aspect of the plan, and sustainability aspects are  integrated into a range of policies and systems we use to manage our  company (see page 28).   Our sustainability targets, alongside financial and operational ones,  essentially form our companys scorecard, which we use to monitor  our companys performance against our strategic objectives.    Of the estimated 900 million  tonnes of aluminum produced  since 1880, three-quarters is   still in productive use. Around  35% is located in buildings,  30% in electrical cables and  machinery and 30% within  transport applications.

Consistent with our life cycle approach, we are  committed to working to understand and be responsive to the   full range of stakeholders who are impacted across the aluminum   value chain.  Our key stakeholders include employees and employee  representatives, customers, suppliers, bond holders, our parent  company, regulators and policymakers, the communities in which  we live and work, and sustainability organizations (including non- governmental organizations concerned about the social, environmental  and climate impacts of the production and use of aluminum products).  We engage with our stakeholders on an ongoing basis and through  a variety of forums and communication channels. One way that we  are accomplishing this is through our community engagement, or  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), program. In FY12, we launched  an effort to begin implementing a more formalized process at each  of our facilities for engaging in dialogue with nongovernmental  organizations, local government officials, other companies, and other  interested community stakeholders through a training process for  our Novelis Neighbor site champions. Our objective is to obtain input  that enables us to better identify, understand and address the most  important issues in the communities where we operate. We have  established a target that 100% of our operations will have implemented  such a process by 2020 (see page 47).  Another way that we engage with stakeholders is through participation  in various industry associations and packaging organizations, such as  Automotive Industry Action Group, Curbside Value Partnership, Can  Manufacturers Institute, European Organization for Packaging and  the Environment (Europen), Metal Packaging Europe, the Aluminum  Association, European Aluminium Association, and others (see Public  Policy Engagement section on page 20).    The Candonga Consortium partners with  public and private entities to address the  needs of the community in Brazil (see  page 49). As the keynote speaker at AMM's  Aluminum Summit in June 2012, Phil  Martens described the bright future of  the aluminum industry and of Novelis.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 19 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability   Formation of our Sustainability Advisory Council  In FY12, we formed a Sustainability Advisory Council, which is  made up of well-respected experts in the sustainability field who  collectively offer Novelis a wealth of knowledge, experience and  perspectives. Members are:   Matt Arnold, Head of Environmental Affairs, JP Morgan Chase   Stuart Hart, S.C. Johnson Chair in Sustainable Global Enterprise,  Cornell University  Jeffrey Keefer, Former Executive Vice President, DuPont   Miguel Milano, Board Member Instituto LIFE, Fundao O Boticrio  de Proteo a Natureza   Jonathon Porritt, Founder, Forum for the Future The objective of the Council is to provide a regular channel for  Novelis to solicit external expertise, advice and critical analysis of our  sustainability goals, efforts, performance and reporting. We also ask  members of the Council to help Novelis identify and understand key  current and emerging sustainability issues and challenges, to share  their insights on evolving stakeholder expectations and to provide  examples of how other companies are demonstrating leadership in  sustainability. We urge Council members to genuinely challenge   and expand Novelis thinking as we work to achieve our   sustainability vision.   To ensure the Council has a direct line of communication to the   most senior decision-makers at the company, the Council also  includes Novelis CEO, Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer and   Chief Sustainability Officer. The Council has two formal meetings per year, and members are  engaged on an ad hoc basis between meetings.  With the rapid rise of China,  India, Brazil and other emerging  economies, it is becoming  increasingly clear that eco- efficiency – reducing negative  impact from current operations  – will not be sufficient. Instead,  we will need to move beyond  greening to reinvent industries  through regeneration, reuse,  and recycling. Novelis has set in  motion an audacious strategy  to reinvent the entire aluminum  industry – to effectively become  above-ground miners.  If they  are successful, not only will they  dramatically reduce greenhouse  gas emissions and put in place a  global aluminum cycle, but they  will also lower cost and increase  profitability in the process.   This captures the essence of  sustainability in action. Stuart Hart  S.C. Johnson Chair  in Sustainable  Global Enterprise,  Cornell university The Novelis Sustainability  Advisory Council.

Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 20 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability   Engaging with Our Customers on Sustainability Our customers have been one of the key stakeholder groups driving  demand for sustainability at Novelis. They are not only concerned  about Novelis own sustainability practices, but also are interested in  engaging with us to find shared solutions to common challenges. In  both FY11 and FY12, we met with key contacts across our customer  base to learn more about their companies sustainability goals  and how Novelis can help them achieve them. This has resulted in  increased collaboration and alignment with our customers, which  has helped both Novelis and our customers achieve our sustainability  goals (see Customers, page 50 and Awards, page 70).     Public Policy Engagement  Most of our advocacy on global and national public policy issues is  conducted through aluminum associations, rather than by directly  engaging with policymakers. At the local level, Novelis works directly  with public officials and government agencies on local issues and  policies that affect our business. Our primary objective is to track and understand the environmental  regulations and other policies that may affect our business and,  when we feel it is necessary, to seek to constructively advocate for  particular policies. Climate change is a key policy priority for Novelis, and we support  dialogue and action to address climate change and to facilitate the  transition to a low-carbon economy. We support policies that take  a holistic approach by factoring in overall life cycle impacts and  benefits, including recycling. End-of-life recycling is another key policy priority for Novelis,  and we are committed to collaborating with regulators and other  stakeholders in support of policies that encourage and facilitate  efficient recycling.   Novelis made no political contributions in FY12, either directly as a  company or through employee political action committee donations. In May 2012, executives from Rexam  visited Novelis new Global Research &  Technology Center in Kennesaw, Georgia,  USA, to discuss joint innovation projects,  objectives and priorities with Novelis  leaders.

As of 2012, recycling of post- consumer aluminum products  saves over 90 million tonnes of  CO2 and over 100,000 GWh of  electrical energy, equivalent to  the annual power consumption  of the Netherlands. Source: recycling.world-aluminium.org Did you know  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 21 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability The sourcing phase of our life cycle is important  because it is where the most significant environmental  impacts occur and where there are some key social  challenges. It is also an area where we are making  profound changes as we work to dramatically increase  our use of recycled metal input. Sourcing A Holistic Look   at Our Material Inputs As we move   towards our recycled  aluminum goal, we   are expanding our capacity  to collect and process  aluminum from a variety  of pre- and post-consumer  sources. We are also  developing a Supplier Code  of Conduct, which we   plan to implement   in FY13.  A   W h o l e   L i f e   C y c l e   A p p r o a c h   Baseline Performance Targets Our Targets FY07–FY09 Average FY12 FY20 2020 Operational Targets Recycled metal  content 80% by 2020 30% 39% 80%  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 22 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Novelis Global Recycling Strategy  During FY12, our percentage of recycled input increased from 33% to  39%, bringing us within sight of reaching 50% recycled input by mid- decade. We are also on course to meet our longer-term target of 80%  recycled aluminum input by 2020. Moving forward, many aspects  of our business will need to align in order to achieve our recycling  target. This section details our progress as we shift our sourcing  model towards recycling and manage the impacts this has on both  our supply chain and our companys entire business strategy. While our 80% recycled target is aggressive, it nonetheless recognizes  that we continue to require some primary aluminum in order to  manufacture our products (see case study on Why Not 100%?   page 25). Compared to recycled aluminum, creating aluminum from  bauxite uses significantly more energy and raw materials, and results  in more greenhouse gas emissions. For additional information about  how aluminum is made, please see our website.  At the most basic level, our recycling target is a sourcing issue.  Achieving it in practice, however, will mean taking steps at all stages  of the product life cycle. The following outlines the core pillars of our  recycling strategy and describes steps we are taking in each area.         Increase Recycling Capacity In order to process increased volumes and variable types of  aluminum scrap, we first need to significantly increase our global  recycling capacity. Over the past two years, we have announced  investments that will nearly double our global recycling capacity from  1.2 million metric tons to 2.1 million metric tons through either new  operations or expansions of our current facilities, as detailed in the  Manufacturing section of this report. A key project we have recently  made public is the Nachterstedt recycling facility, located in Germany,  which will come on line in late 2014 as the largest recycling center in  the world (see below). Nachterstedt: Future Direction of Novelis Plants When our Nachterstedt, Germany, recycling facility comes on line in late  2014, it will be the largest aluminum recycling center in the world – and  also one of the most sophisticated. Novelis will invest $250 million in the  400 metric kt per year facility, which incorporates cutting-edge processing  technology like advanced melting furnaces and high-speed sorting with  eddy-current, optical and other sensors. The plant will be capable of  recycling more than 18 different categories of scrap from consumers,  construction and industrial applications, helping to diversify our source of  raw materials. Technology employed at Nachterstedt will be replicated in  Novelis other new recycling facilities, providing a glimpse of the scale and  advanced technology we are developing for recycling.  25% Between 2011 and 2016,  Novelis expects to see  an approximately 25%  compound annual growth  rate (CAGR) in demand  for aluminum by the  automotive industry. Over  the same period, we expect  demand for aluminum in the  electronics and high-end  specialties sector to increase  by approximately 6% per  year, and by 4% to 5% per  year in the beverage   can sector.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 23 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Evolve Design Specifications  We are also collaborating with our customers to advance research  and development of products with greater recycled input that are  more easily recycled, such as a single-alloy can. These products offer  not only a lower carbon footprint, but also new sources of recycled  aluminum for Novelis to use. Examples of our collaborative work in  this area are provided in this section and the Customers section of  this report (see page 50).  Reshape Product Portfolio We are shifting our product portfolio to be more focused on  sustainable, higher-value products that offer the potential of greater  recyclability and recycled input, and hence lower embedded carbon.  As a result, we are reducing production of or divesting some product  lines like foil that are largely produced from primary aluminum   (see case study on site closures in Our People, page 44). Expand Scrap Purchasing System  Significantly expanding our purchases of scrap aluminum is driving  changes in how we source materials. We are diversifying the kinds  of recycled aluminum we can use, and our goal is to purchase half  of our scrap from applications other than used beverage cans by  2020. We estimate that while 65% of Novelis scrap purchases are  currently from cans, can scrap as a whole represents only 17% of the  scrap market. Although this means a large supply of alternative scrap  exists, other sources of scrap tend to be more variable than cans in  their size, shape and alloy composition, and can present technical  issues in collection, processing and manufacturing. Sources we are  exploring include:  End-of-life automobiles and auto manufacturing scrap.   Construction and industrial scrap.   Wire, foil, cable and extrusion scrap. To boost our supply of available aluminum inputs, we are also becoming  more systematic about taking back scrap our customers produce during  manufacturing processes. As much as possible, new Novelis contracts  in the beverage can and automotive segments, as well as some others,  now incorporate closed-loop provisions. In other words, we almost  always try to buy back aluminum scrap that our clients generate during  production  and we recycle it. This approach will double our pre- consumer scrap supply by FY20, providing approximately 25% of our  total recycled materials. Steps we are taking to increase our sourcing  from customers are discussed in the Customers section. Oswego Plant Forges   New Approach to Scrap Historically, Novelis Oswego, New  York, USA plant relied mainly on  used beverage cans for the recycled  aluminum supply it used to make  can products. More recently, to  expand and diversify its options  for using recycled materials, the  Oswego plant pioneered sourcing  of other types of scrap and their  use in other types of products.  To make this happen, Novelis  brought metallurgists together with  procurement and operations team  members to tackle the challenge  as a group through innovative new  approaches. As a result, Oswego  has developed expertise and  systems for recovering materials,  like car radiators, helping to shift  its material base towards large  volumes of scrap metal. Lessons  from the Oswego plant have been  shared with other plants across the   Novelis system.  Aluminum is infinitely recyclable  – it can be recycled to make  exactly the same product over  and over, and using recycled  aluminum does not affect the  quality of the product. Did you know  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 24 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Increase Post-Consumer Recycling  As we seek to expand our use of recycled aluminum, procuring  the needed supplies of scrap and used aluminum presents several  challenges. Historically, used beverage cans have been the preferred  source of recycled aluminum because they offer a uniform, high- quality material. However, the worldwide demand for used beverage  containers is growing faster than supply. Can-recycling rates vary  by country, but in most regions room for improvement exists. As a  result, we are collaborating with a range of stakeholders to provide  or support expanded post-consumer collection and recycling  infrastructure and to develop partnerships that facilitate efficient  recycling. We are also supporting and developing consumer  education and awareness programs (see Consumers, page 56). Vertically Integrating through  Scrap Collection in Brazil Brazil has very high recycling rates  and a fairly well developed recycling  infrastructure. However, there is  room for further improvement as the  market grows, and we have invested  in expanding post-consumer  recycling in Brazil by opening five  Novelis-owned and operated used  can collection centers. This new  on-the-ground presence has allowed  Novelis to develop relationships  with small collectors and scrap  yards, rather than purchase only  from commercial companies that  handle very large volumes. Through  these relationships, we are building  a closer-knit network in order to  secure sources of used aluminum  that Novelis previously could not  access due to logistical challenges.  The new collection centers can  process 700 metric tons of used  beverage cans a month. The new  centers are located throughout  Brazil in Florianopolis, Salvador,  Recife, Pindamonhangaba, and   Sao Paulo.

Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 25 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability   Why Not 100%? The Beverage Can as Object Lesson Our goal of 80% recycling is ambitious, but why not 100%? There are several  reasons, some of which are structural and are unlikely to change, and some  of which are technical and are a current focus for our innovation efforts.  Fundamentally, our ability to get to 100% recycled inputs (or any percentage,  for that matter), depends on our having a sufficient supply of scrap  aluminum. Aluminum often has a very long life cycle, which can slow down  its return to the recycling stream. While a recycled beverage container can  be back on the shelf in 60 days, aluminum in automobiles has a life span of  15 to 20 years, and aluminum in buildings lasts up to 50 years. In fact, of all  the aluminum that has been manufactured over the past 100 years, 75% is  still in use. Even if all aluminum that could be recycled were captured, the  significant growth in demand for aluminum products would continue to  require additional primary production. Another challenge, detailed in the Consumers section of this report, is  the need to increase rates of post-consumer recycling to ensure that all  recyclable scrap re-enters the aluminum life cycle. Finally, given current manufacturing processes, primary aluminum must often  be added to recycled scrap to ensure the appropriate alloy composition  during the production process. For example, the current aluminum can is  composed of two different types of alloy, one for the can body and one for  the can end and tab. Primary aluminum must be added to get the recycled  can material back to one or the other of those alloy types. Even if beverage  can recycling rates worldwide were 100%, we still would not be able to  efficiently produce a can sheet that is made of 100% recycled material  because of the two-alloy design. To address this barrier, Novelis is re-thinking the manufacturing process   itself. We are working with our customers on the next generation of  aluminum can, employing a single-alloy design for both can body and end  sheet (see graphic on page 24). This disruptive innovation has brought an  up to 100% recycled-content can within our reach  the ultimate sustainable  package. This is the model that preserves the highest value for the scrap and  delivers the highest environmental benefit. Ball welcomes Novelis working  with the industry to think about  innovative concepts to make  beverage cans even more  sustainable in the future than  they are today.  Novelis target to increase the  use of recycled aluminum to  80% is a bold initiative and  will require Novelis to make  considerable investment in  research and development, as  well as substantial changes in  how our industries support   post-consumer recycling. It  will also require the entire  supply chain to collaborate and  communicate more effectively. At Ball, we also want to better  understand environmental and  social impacts in our supply  chain – not only from our tier- one suppliers like Novelis, but  also further back in the chain. Bjrn Kulmann Director, Sustainability,   Ball Corporation In 2010, Americans recycled approximately 56 billion aluminum  cans, increasing the recycling rate to 58% – saving the energy  equivalent of 17 million barrels of crude oil, or nearly two days of   all US oil imports.

As a first step, we are gathering more information from our suppliers,  such as which certifications they have achieved (e.g., ISO 14001)   and data regarding their EHS policies. The specific type and amount  of information we are asking for varies depending on the level of   the supplier.   In addition, we are working to develop a new Supplier Code of  Conduct to ensure that the standards set out in our internal Code of  Conduct are also observed by our business partners. The Supplier  Code will be rolled out to our current suppliers, who will be asked to  confirm their commitment to adhere to it, and it will be part of the  process of contracting with new suppliers. The Supplier Code will  apply to suppliers of both metal and non-metal products. To support  the release of the Supplier Code, we are developing an informative  portal that highlights the importance of sustainability in our overall  procurement program and relationships. In addition, in October 2011 we signed the United Nations Global  Compact. With this commitment, we agreed to abide by and report  on our implementation of 10 principles in the areas of human  rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. Among these  commitments are eliminating forced or child labor and upholding  collective bargaining rights. 75% While a recycled beverage  container can be back   on the shelf in 60 days,  aluminum in automobiles   has a life span of 15 to 20  years. In fact, of all the  aluminum that has been  manufactured over the past  100 years, 75% is still in use.

We are implementing One Novelis through initiatives such  as standardizing our global manufacturing processes to ensure that  high-quality products are delivered across the globe. Through both  people and processes, One Novelis leads to manufacturing excellence. We rely on our people to continuously improve our operations by  initiating lean principles and developing new ways to maximize use  of our plants, increasing both productivity and customer service.  Our people are also the key to creating a culture that ensures  that everyone remains safe by embracing the aspects of our EHS  Together We Are Safe global program (see sidebar page 41).  Another way Novelis is improving processes is through its investment  in a new data management system called Novelis 2.0. The system  will allow us to operate as a truly globally integrated company with  consistent business practices and information systems. Novelis 2.0  will improve tracking of our Environment, Health & Safety (EHS)  data as well as retrieve human resources, financial, manufacturing,  commercial and other business data at the global level.  Environment, Health & Safety  Management Systems Achieving EHS manufacturing excellence requires rigorous, consistent  management systems. Because of this, all Novelis manufacturing sites  are required to obtain registration to two internationally recognized  management systems:    The ISO 14001 environmental management standard, which provides  a framework for continuous improvement of our environmental  performance, and    The OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety Specification,  which serves as the foundation of our management approach to  employee health and safety. Additionally, all of our manufacturing facilities are certified to ISO  quality standards. These certifications are one element of our push to standardize our  business systems, processes and procedures across all our operations  to achieve consistent, high levels of performance.

Investing in Global Expansion Novelis is in the midst of a significant global expansion. Since  the start of FY11, we have announced major investments totaling  approximately $1.4 billion into expanding our rolling, finishing and  recycling capacity. Our global recycling strategy calls for Novelis to  achieve recycling capacity of over 4 million metric tons of scrap by  2020. During FY12, we announced expansions that will double our  recycling capacity from 1.2 million to 2.1 million metric tons by 2015. In  November 2011, we completed construction of new recycling capacity  in the Alunorf facility near Dusseldorf in Germany, the world's largest  aluminum rolling complex. The expansion adds 50,000 metric tons  per year of aluminum scrap recycling capacity, for a total recycled  scrap capacity at Alunorf of 100,000 metric tons per year.  The following table details the major investments we have made since  April 2010 to expand our production capacity: Oswego, USA Yeongju, Korea  Pindamonhangaba, Brazil  In addition to these investments, in FY12 Novelis increased its share  of ownership of Novelis Korea Ltd from 68% to over 99%.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 31 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability   We are taking a life cycle approach to our  environmental strategy. We recognize that increasing  our use of recycled material will also increase Novelis  energy and water use  even though over the life cycle  of our products less energy and other resources will   be used. That is why we have set targets to improve  our efficiency and cut our impacts across key  environmental performance areas as we are working   to achieve our sustainability goals.   Energy Use and Greenhouse   Gas Emissions Energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the most  significant environmental issues related to our operations and  products. Within our own operations, the most substantial portions of  our GHG emissions are CO2 and NOx emissions related to energy use  (the remainder are perfluorocarbon (PFC) and anode consumption  CO2 emissions related to our single primary aluminum facility). Taking a life cycle view, the vast majority of energy use and GHG  emissions associated with our products occur upstream in our  supply chain (see figure 8 on page 32), which is also where our  biggest opportunities for contributing to climate change solutions  occur. Recycling cuts the embedded carbon of aluminum products  by 95% compared to primary aluminum. This means that the overall  life cycle GHG emissions related to our products will decrease  dramatically (by nearly 50%) as we increase our use of recycled  inputs (see page 21). However, recycling requires more energy use  in our facilities because of the additional de-coating, shredding and  re-melting steps in the process. That is why weve committed to  increasing the efficiency of our own operations, while also shifting to  significantly higher use of recycled aluminum.

Plant  managers decided to replace an  obsolete warehouse roof with one  that incorporates an integrated solar  photovoltaic electricity generation  system and uses aluminum  extensively in its structure. The  156 solar panels, which have a  capacity of 37.4 KW, generate about  36,000 KWh per year and prevent  16 metric tons of CO2 emissions.  The investment will be repaid in six  years and the panels are expected  to last more than 20 years.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 32 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability We developed this approach based on a review of the risks and  opportunities associated with GHG emissions and climate change  issues. We expect the public interest in this area to grow and carbon  legislation to be enacted in more countries and regions (e.g., beyond  the Emission Trading Scheme in Europe as well as Korea). This situation  will impact Novelis in a number of areas, from our energy procurement  operations to our key markets. The recognition of these risks and  opportunities has been a significant driver of our sustainability  strategy, a chief objective of which is to reduce the carbon footprint of  Novelis and our customers. We see supplying sustainable low-carbon  products that benefit society as fundamental to our long-term growth.  The companys most senior governance bodies have endorsed this  strategy and the adoption of our GHG-reduction targets. We have  supported dialogue to reduce GHG emissions, and we engage on the  climate change issue with stakeholders, including customers, suppliers,  government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).

Source: www.world-aluminium.org Did you know  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 33 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Sustainable Energy Use                We use several sources of energy in the production and delivery of  our aluminum products. The majority of energy usage in our facilities  occurs at our recycling casting centers, at our smelter in South America  and during the process of hot and cold rolling aluminum.  Natural gas used directly at our facilities (particularly for melting) and  purchased electricity (particularly for rolling) are the most important  sources of energy for Novelis, supplying 88% of our total energy needs  by cost (see figures 10 and 12). We also use fuel oil, transport fuel  and other energy sources. Our South American segment has its own  hydroelectric facilities providing power to the Ouro Preto smelter, which  meet approximately 60% of its electricity requirements and account for  11% of the companys overall direct electricity usage. Outside of South  America, we purchase electricity from third-party suppliers. Of the  energy we purchase, about 33% comes from renewable sources and  20% from nuclear power (see figure 10). In FY11, Novelis appointed a new Global Energy Efficiency Manager  to coordinate activities and facilitate the development and sharing  of best practices. We are currently evaluating adoption of the  new ISO 50001 standard, which specifies requirements for an  energy management system and enables an organization to take  a systematic approach to the continual improvement of energy  efficiency and energy performance. Our energy platform focuses on the key pillars for success in improving  energy efficiency. Our plants are working to increase monitoring of  energy use, identify the most promising targets for energy reductions  and implement energy efficiency improvements for both our indirect  and direct energy use.   Direct energy efficiency improvements We implemented several equipment upgrades that reduce direct energy  use, including the following:  In Warren, Ohio, USA, the incinerator of the coating line stack was exhausting  approximately 600F air directly to the atmosphere. By installing an additional  heat exchanger on the incinerator to pre-heat the make-up air, the plant cut its  entire natural gas use by 25%, equivalent to 48,000 gigajoules (GJ).   In Sierre, Switzerland, several process experts worked with pre-heating,  loading, melting and alloying operators to improve operating practices,  resulting in a 15% increase in re-melt energy efficiency. The plant also  standardized and optimized operational procedures including the number   of metal pre-heaters that should be used.   In Norf, Germany, five new high-efficiency annealers have been installed to  meet the growing demand for aluminum. Equipment was selected to ensure  an optimum life cycle cost with low maintenance and energy costs. The  annealers were designed with state-of-the-art insulation, furnace control and  heat recovery solutions, which have resulted in savings of 30% in gas, 50%  on power and 70% of nitrogen emissions compared to the annealers used  previously. The yearly energy saving is more than 112,000 GJ.  Reducing Energy Use   Through Lighting Efficiency In FY12 we implemented extensive  lighting efficiency projects at 10 of  our facilities (Warren, Berea, Terre  Haute, Toronto, Oswego, Ohle,  Bresso, Gttingen, Pieve, and Ulsan).  These projects not only provide  better quality light in our facilities  from a health and safety perspective,  but also reduce our electricity use. 5% Novelis' overall energy  intensity improved 5% in just  one year (from FY11 to FY12)  – and has improved by 19%  from our baseline.  indirect   31%  Direct   69% FiGuRE 9: Novelis Energy Use FY12:   Direct and Indirect (GJ).  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 34 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Our overall energy intensity (measured in gigajoules per metric ton  of product) has improved by 19% from our baseline (average of FY07  to FY09) and 5% from FY11 to FY12. Our direct energy intensity has  improved by 9% and our indirect energy intensity has improved by  35% compared to the baseline. In FY12, the largest contributing factor  to the reduction in our overall energy use was the closure of our  aluminum smelter in Aratu, Brazil. In line with our strategy, the closing  of the smelter and our Bridgnorth foil packaging plant reflect our  commitment to align our portfolio to favor sustainable products. The  energy reductions due to the restructuring were slightly offset by an  increase in energy intensity at our other operations due to declines  in production between FY11 and FY12. In general, our manufacturing  processes run most efficiently when they operate at close to capacity.  Global Energy Policy In 2011, Novelis created a new Global  Energy Policy. The policys goals  are aligned with those of our overall  39% energy reduction target. It also  covers decision making, planned  maintenance, developing our people  and evaluating our processes.  Note: The amount of our indirect energy  use and breakdown by source have not  changed significantly since FY07. FiGuRE 10: Novelis Indirect Energy   Use FY12 (%).

The goal of  this voluntary agreement is to cut  the emissions of the participating  organizations by 16.5% by 2016  compared to 2008. As part of  this initiative to reduce our air  emissions, in FY12 our Korean plants  invested in equipment to be able to  use natural gas instead of heavy fuel  oil for their operations.  Since our baseline, we have reduced our absolute GHG emissions  (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 7% (see figure 13), while our GHG emissions  per metric ton have declined in a similar fashion. We take a life  cycle view and account for the Scope 3 emissions  those related  to our purchase of primary aluminum, which is made using energy- intensive processes, and emissions related to the transportation of  our products.  In addition, our use of recycled aluminum as a raw material avoids life  cycle GHG emissions compared to primary aluminum production. We  estimate these avoided emissions at 9.66 million metric tons of CO2e  in FY12. We also estimate that we avoided 34,049 metric tons of GHG  emissions by implementing energy efficiency projects.

Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 36 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability As we move towards our 80% recycled aluminum input target, we  project that both the GHG intensity and total amount of emissions  from our own operations (Scopes 1 and 2) will increase, while  emissions in our supply chain (Scope 3) will decrease dramatically.  Figure 14 shows the trends in these Scope 3 emissions, which also  illustrates the magnitude of our Scope 3 emissions compared to our  Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Between FY11 and FY12, Novelis achieved a 3.3% reduction in   absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions. About two-thirds of the  total reduction can be attributed to a reduction in Scope 3 emissions  resulting from our increased purchases of recycled aluminum (and  reduced purchases of primary aluminum), which is also in line with  our recycling strategy. Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased for  three main reasons: Overall production declined, we reduced our  emissions when we closed our smelting operation in Aratu, Brazil,   and we increased our use of hydropower for our Ouro Preto plant.  Moving forward, we expect continued reductions overall to be largely  due to the reduction in our Scope 3 emissions as we increase our  recycled input.   Water Use Water conservation and water quality management are important to  Novelis own operations and to our contribution to addressing global  water issues. Since 2002, Novelis has been measuring and managing  the amount of water used at its facilities and has set a series of  targets to use water more efficiently. Much of our focus in FY12 was to improve our understanding of our  water requirements and how water is used in our operations. We  measure our overall water withdrawal globally, but we are working to  enhance the way we account for internal water recirculation, recycling,  and the subsequent volume and quality of the water discharged.   As we increase the amount of recycled content in our products, we  also increase the recycling operations at our plants. One step in the  recycling process  the casting of ingots after re-melting the recycled  materials  uses cooling water. At locations that cast ingots, the  trend towards using more scrap aluminum requires more water for  processing. As we continue to expand our recycling operations, the  additional water requirements will make meeting our water intensity  goal challenging. Hot mill in Norf, Germany. Every recycled aluminum metric  ton saves 7.8 metric tons of  carbon dioxide equivalents  (CO2e) over the total aluminum  value chain.

From FY11 to FY12, our overall water usage decreased about  1%, primarily due to the decrease in production volume. Water use  intensity, however, increased about 4%. This increase is largely due  to an increase in recycling, variation in product mixes and baseline  demands at a lower production volume. In FY12, we conducted an initial survey of our water recycling and  reuse efforts. Based on this survey, we found that water usage is  reduced by over 90% by using recirculated cooling water systems  and over 2% of Novelis water demand is satisfied by recycling  wastewater back into different process requirements.  Our water recycling efforts have focused on product lines that  offered significant water savings.  FiGuRE 15: Water Withdrawal (m3). FiGuRE 16: Water Use Intensity   (m3/metric ton FRP Sales).

Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 38 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Water Conservation Projects In FY12, we pursued water conservation projects including these: ulsan Our Ulsan facility in South Korea uses significant amounts of cooling water  for the aluminum casting process and equipment cooling. The facility utilizes  cooling towers to reduce the temperature of the water so that it can be  reused repeatedly. The cooling towers pass ambient air across the water  stream to reduce its temperature. In FY12, the Ulsan facility upgraded two  cooling towers by replacing many of the internal parts. This increased the  heat transfer of the cooling tower, resulting in a water use reduction of  approximately 14,000 m3 per year.  Yeongju  Our Yeongju facility in South Korea uses water for metal cooling during  its can-coating operation. In FY12, the plant installed piping that allowed  coating-line wastewater to be transferred to another operation for reuse.   The project reduced water usage by an estimated 10,000 m3 per year.  Logan  Our Logan joint venture in Russellville, Kentucky, USA, filters large volumes  of fresh water daily to ensure the necessary water quality for production  operations. During the filtering process, a partial stream of the raw water   did not pass the filters and was traditionally discharged to the facilitys  storm-water settling ponds. In FY12, Logan upgraded equipment that now  allows nearly all the discharged water from the filters to be treated with  existing equipment and reused, reducing water usage by an estimated  56,000 m3 per year.   Latchford Our Latchford facility in the United Kingdom reduced the amount of water  required for process cooling by improving its cooling tower equipment and  practices. Improvements included: 	 Recirculating process water for pump cooling. 	 Expanding allowable cooling water chemistry requirements. 	 Changing cooling water chemical additives. The resulting water reduction is estimated to be 4,000 m3 per year.  Water is used for chilling molten  aluminum during the ingot casting  process in our recycling facilities.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 39 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Waste About two-thirds of all our waste is generated during our re-melt  recycling and casting processes, and over three-quarters of the  operational waste we generated in FY12 was recycled (see figure 17).  Most of our locations have improvement programs aimed at reducing  waste generation and reducing waste sent to landfill. More than 60%  of Novelis landfilled waste is generated from the recycling of dross.  Dross forms from impurities that float on molten aluminum during  melting or reprocessing. Most dross generated by Novelis is sent  off-site to be recycled by specialized processing companies. These  companies recover the aluminum (comprising approximately 50% in  dross). We track and account for the dross managed for us by third  parties. In some regions, the dross waste remaining after aluminum is  extracted is used in road construction and other applications. Novelis recycling and casting facilities use large amounts of refractory  material (i.e., insulating bricks) to ensure that their furnaces are energy  efficient when melting aluminum. Periodically, the refractory material  deteriorates to the point that it must be replaced. Traditionally, our  facilities in North America have disposed of this material in non- hazardous landfills. In FY12, Novelis North America, working with several  processing companies, was able to recycle 1 million kg of refractory  material. After processing, the refractory material was used as input in  the production of steel and cement. Our plants outside North America  also reuse refractory material as input for steel and cement.  Our target of zero landfill disposal of waste by 2020 includes dross  managed by third-party recyclers. Reaching our target will require  us to expand the recycling of dross by-products, refractory brick and  other wastes, and to find new ways to handle materials that are not  currently recyclable.  Although the total amount of waste Novelis generates has increased  since our baseline, when we look at the breakdown of the waste  stream, the amount recycled has increased by 22% while landfilling  has declined by 18% since our FY07–09 average. Between FY11 and  FY12, the amount of waste landfilled declined by 6%, mostly due to  lower production volumes globally and enhanced processing prior to  recycling offsite. Additionally, the amount recycled has increased by  11% due to significant improvements in dross recycling. As shown in  figure 16, incineration has remained low across our global operations  relative to the amount we landfill and recycle. Zero Landfill Waste Progress  Waste reduction hinges on the  participation and support of all of our  employees. We are working to make  recycling a part of our culture at the  plant as well as in our communities.  Whether in the plant or in the offices  and lunch areas, we need buy-in from  everyone to make it truly happen.  Most things we throw in the garbage  are actually recyclable. From filter  media generated at the mill, to  organics in the cafeteria, finding  suppliers across our global network  to take the different waste products  and recycle them will be one of our  biggest challenges. The following plants are moving  close to zero waste with less than   5 kg of waste for every metric ton  of product produced:  Burnaby  Dudelange  Kingston  Kingston Technical Center  Ludenscheid  Nachterstedt  Novelis PAE  Pieve  Sierre  Terre Haute  FiGuRE 17: Waste by Process Method (%).  incinerated   1  Landfilled   23  Recycled   76  Hydro   Power   28.1  Coal   30.7  Rened  Petroleum  Products   2.3  Natural Gas   12.7  Oil 0.9  Other Fossil 0.1  Others 0.3  Nuclear   21.1  Biomass   2.9  Wind   0.1  Others   1.9    Renewable   32.9  Non- Renewable   67.1 Total  8,704,130  GJ Total  8,704,130  GJ Total 8,704,130 GJ FIGURE XX: Waste by Process Method (%)  Incinerated   1  Landlled   23  Recycled   76  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 40 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Non-GHG Air Emissions Novelis total air emissions have declined over the past few years due  to the reduction in smelter operations. Particulate matter and fluoride  emissions, which comprise the majority of the emissions coming from  our smelter operations, were reduced significantly with the closure of  our Aratu plant.   Within our flat rolled product operations, we saw a slight reduction  in air emissions due to our reduction in production volumes. Moving  forward, we expect to see a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions  as we continue to increase our fuel efficiency. We also expect an  even greater reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions as we upgrade  our equipment to operate on natural gas instead of the heavier  petroleum-based fuels. As mentioned on page 35, as an effort to  reduce not only our costs but also our CO2 and SO2 emissions, our  Korean plants converted from heavy fuels to natural gas in FY12.  We anticipate that volatile organic compounds (VOCs), NOx and  SO2 emissions will become increasingly challenging to reduce as we  increase our recycling operations.   Biodiversity Novelis operates in many locations across the globe and is keenly  aware that conserving diverse ecosystems is important to the  communities in which we operate and to our overall mission to  reduce our impact on the environment. The most significant and  recognized biodiversity impacts occur during the primary aluminum  production phase of the life cycle of our products. Bauxite mining  results in land disturbances, and alumina refining may require red  mud lakes. Additionally, the use of hydroelectric power plants to  provide electricity for the energy-intensive aluminum production  process can impact biodiversity. It is difficult to express the value of biodiversity consistently across  the various regions, land features and cultures in which we operate.  We recognize the need to improve our understanding in this area   and are currently seeking input from experts in this area and   other stakeholders.  None of our currently operational and our newly announced sites  exist within the boundaries of a United Nations Biosphere Reserve,  Ramsar Wetland, or UNESCO World Heritage Site. Thus, at this time,  none of our facilities have been identified as within the boundaries  of protected or high biodiversity areas. However, as we look to  broaden our understanding and characterization of areas with high  biodiversity value, this assessment could evolve. Note: Figures represent estimates of  pollutants tracked from stack emissions  only. Novelis has not developed emission  estimates for persistent organic pollutants.

And ensuring we attract, retain  and develop employees with the right skills and  experience is critical to achieving our companys  aggressive growth plans.       Our Health and Safety Performance  Management of safety issues is integrated into our overall  Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) management system (see page  28). We have safety processes in place at all of our operations, and  we collect and track global safety data for our employees and project  contractors using the Novelis Injury and Illness Record keeping  System (NIRS). As part of our One Novelis effort, however, we  identified an opportunity to take a more consistent and standardized  approach to safety management globally (see sidebar).  During FY12, Novelis continued to improve our recordable case rate,  which is an aggregate measure of injuries, illnesses and fatalities. In  FY12, our recordable case rate was 0.59 cases per 200,000 hours  worked, down from 0.76 in FY11 (see figure 19). While we are proud  of our progress, we will not be satisfied until we reach our ultimate  goal of zero. Very regrettably, during FY12 two Novelis employees lost  their lives working for the company (see case study on page 42).

Together  We Are Safe includes training for  all plant employees and increased  quality and consistency of EHS  communications across all of our  facilities. In 2012, Novelis also  hired a new Vice President of EHS  to lead our overall EHS program  and strategy, including our safety  management standardization effort,  as well as efforts to strengthen our  overall safety culture.

The first occurred  on October 4, 2011, at our Oswego, New York, facility when a cold mill  employee, Ed Carvey, was working with the mill crew to restart the cold mill  after a maintenance day. Mr. Carvey was connecting oil mist hoses behind the  mill. Another crew member was not aware that Mr. Carvey had gone behind  the mill and activated some large hydraulic equipment. The equipment  movement trapped and crushed Mr. Carvey, who died the following day.  The second fatal accident occurred on November 11, 2011, at our Yeongju,  South Korea, facility. A cold mill operator, DongSup Shin, was in the cold mill  preparation station coil conveyor area talking to a crane operator. Mr. Shin  noticed that there was a coil in the conveyor that still had banding around  it. He did not tell the preparation station operator that he was going to help  by removing the banding. Mr. Shin stood between two of the coils to cut the  banding. At that moment the coil conveyor moved one of the coils, and   Mr. Shin was caught between the coils. He died from internal injuries to the  chest area. As is our practice following any injury or fatality, Novelis conducted in-depth  investigations to determine the root causes and implemented corrective  actions to help prevent similar events in the future. For example, in Oswego,  the connection point for oil mist hoses was moved to place the employee  outside the pinch point area. At Yeongju, barriers were installed to prevent  personnel from entering the coil conveyor system when it is in operation.   Additionally, across Novelis we are working to implement a more risk-based  approach that focuses on effectively identifying and controlling the potential  hazards that pose the greatest risk of a serious injury. These tragic accidents  serve as an important reminder of the need to be continually vigilant about  building and maintaining a strong safety culture.   Novelis is committed to  achieving world-class safety  levels – and to building the  culture required to do so. Its  important to have an honest  culture, one where employees  perform their tasks according  to the safety procedures even  when no one is watching. It  also requires an interdependent  mindset, where employees not  only look out for themselves,  but for their colleagues too.  David Johnson  Novelis new Vice President,  Environment, Health & Safety  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 43 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Aligning Our Culture to Support Growth Novelis is in the midst of transforming our company to lay the  foundation for aggressive growth (see Our Corporate Strategy,  page 11). Essential to this foundation is a more aligned culture, built  on a shared vision of what kind of company we want to be. We are  striving to create a culture where every employee across our global  operations feels invested in helping Novelis achieve its goals – and  where they get the support and development they need to be  satisfied and productive in their jobs.  Employee Engagement Our most recent employee survey in 2008 found a relatively strong  sense of pride among our employees, but indicated that we needed  to do a better job communicating and engaging with them. We knew  that this would also be an essential step in realigning our culture. In  response, we have dramatically increased our internal communications  efforts, expanding or launching new ways to encourage two-way  communication between management and our employees. These  include regular interactive webcasts conducted by our CEO, additional  plant visits by regional presidents and other senior leaders, an  enhanced intranet that enables employees to make comments and  raise questions, a new magazine sent to every employee, and more.  The efforts are all designed to improve employee engagement and  strengthen our culture. We will conduct our next employee survey  before the end of FY13 to assess the results.    In addition to these efforts, Novelis is committed to maintaining   our good record of open communication and dialogue with both   our unionized and non-unionized employees. In FY12, approximately  58% of our employees were represented by labor unions, and   their employment conditions were governed by collective   bargaining agreements.   The Novelis Culture Map The Novelis Culture Map is a  visual tool we use to engage and  communicate with our employees  as part of our culture change effort.  There is no significance to the  color or the direction of the words.  However, there is significance  to the relative size of the words.  Importantly, One Novelis is the  largest because that is the single  most important call-to-action for  our company at this time. The  second largest word is safe: This  is a core value for Novelis, and  everyone in the company must be  focused on it if we are to reach our  ultimate goal of zero injuries.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 44 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Employee Evaluations A key part of creating a growth culture is ensuring that employees  understand their roles and how they can contribute to the companys  success, that they receive regular feedback about their performance,  and that they have an opportunity to have discussions with their line  managers about how they can advance their careers.  Novelis has a consistent, centralized performance management  system for our managers. At the plant level, however, performance  management has been decentralized and variable in terms of the  processes used and how many employees receive regular evaluations.  In FY12, approximately 38% of our employees worldwide received  annual performance reviews both through our centralized system and  local performance reviews, the same percentage as the prior year.   Of the employees currently in our centralized system, more than   85% are receiving annual performance reviews. We plan to expand  this centralized program globally over the next several years. During FY11, we established a corporate-wide sustainability target  that 100% of eligible employees will receive annual performance  feedback by 2020. We recognize that this reflects a considerable  shift from our current level and that it will require time and effort to  reach our target. To help us do so, we are including a performance  management component in Novelis 2.0, the integrated, global data  management system we are building.                    Training and Development Novelis has a range of training programs designed to ensure our  employees have the skills and capabilities they need to do their jobs  well, from on-boarding sessions for all new hires to job-specific  technical training programs. As we look to the future, we know that  ensuring we have a strong pool of talent in the leadership pipeline  will be especially critical to our companys long-term success.  Thats why, in FY11, we launched a major effort to develop a world- class leadership development program and, in FY12, we have  continued to expand the program. Our goal is that our program  will be benchmarked by 2020 within the top 10% of world-class  companies that have development programs.  Changes in Our   Operational Footprint As we have reshaped our portfolio  to focus more on the beverage can,  automotive, electronics and high- end specialties market segments,  our organizational footprint has  changed. While we are investing  to significantly grow our business,  reshaping our portfolio has also  resulted in the sale or closure of  some plants and, in some cases,   job losses.  In March 2012, we announced  that we planned to sell three of  our European foil manufacturing  operations to American Industrial  Acquisition Corporation. The sale,  completed in June 2012, included  our operations in Rugles, France;  Dudelange, Luxembourg; and  Berlin, Germany. The transaction  included the Foil Innovation Centre  in Belvaux, Luxembourg. The sale  was driven by the need to align our  operations with our growth strategy.  Approximately 850 individuals work  at these facilities. These changes  to our manufacturing footprint  were also a result of the challenges  involved in incorporating significant  levels of recycled content into the  products made at these facilities.   In April 2012, Novelis announced  that we will close our Saguenay  Works facility in Jonquire,   Quebec, Canada. Closure occurred  in August 2012. This very difficult  decision was driven by the need  to right-size production capacity  in North America, along with the  increasing logistics costs and  structural challenges facing the  location. A total of 157 people were  employed at the site. As a result  of the closure of these operations,  Novelis has been taking steps to  assist the affected employees  through severance packages, as well  as outplacement and re-training  support to aid them in finding  future employment.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 45 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Novelis now offers six levels of leadership development programs, each  geared to participants experience. Through these programs, managers  develop their leadership and management skills in managing conflict,  leading across global cultures, identifying and developing personal and  team strengths, and more. Some of the programs engage participants in  business cases; others have participants partake in a project to identify  solutions to real challenges our company is facing. In FY12, we also  expanded the curriculum for four of our leadership programs to include  a hands-on community engagement component. Novelis goal is to make  our employees leaders both in our company and in the communities  where we operate (see Engaging with Our Communities, page 46).   We also recognize that having qualified engineers is vital to   our business, and our Engineering Development Program is   intended specifically for new graduates and early career engineers  (see sidebar).  While not all of these programs are available to all employees at  every level, we do have some form of professional development or  training program at the local level for all employees. In addition, in the  coming years, formal development opportunities will be offered on an  ongoing basis to the different functional areas within Novelis, specific  to their role.  In FY12, approximately 331 engineers, first-line leaders, managers  and executives participated in these six leadership development  programs. Since their inception, 521 employees have participated in  these programs.   Employee Code of Conduct and Human Rights Protection of human rights and nondiscrimination are imperatives  to Novelis and are reflected in our employee Code of Conduct.  Additionally, we are in the process of updating the Code to  strengthen the companys commitment to acting with integrity, good  faith and in accordance with good corporate governance. We also  want to more clearly affirm Novelis commitment to human rights and  sustainability. In addition, we are introducing a new ethics hotline for  confidential reporting of incidents or violations of the Code. The new  Code will be rolled out, and the hotline will go live, in FY13.  As part of the rollout, every employee will receive a copy of the  Code and training on it and use of the hotline. The Code will also  be incorporated into orientation sessions for new employees, and  all employees will undergo an annual acknowledgement process to  ensure their understanding of, and intent to comply with, the Code.  In 2012, Novelis further affirmed and strengthened our commitment  to protecting human rights by becoming a signatory of the United  Nations Global Compact. As a signatory, Novelis commits to align our  operations and strategies with universally accepted principles in the  areas of human and labor rights, as well as the environment and anti- corruption (see page 68). Developing the Next Generation  of Engineers There is intense competition  for qualified employees among  companies like Novelis that require  engineering and technical skills.  That is why, as part of our overall  leadership development effort, we  launched the Novelis Engineering  Development Program in FY11.  The two-year program, which is  geared towards recent engineering  graduates or early career engineers,  includes technical, professional  and leadership training in one of  our plants around the world. It also  includes classroom coursework,  work-based assignments, coaching,  on-the-job projects and other  developmental opportunities. The  goal is to attract the best and  brightest young engineers into  Novelis – and to put them on a  career track that keeps them there.  In FY12, 66 engineers participated in  the program.   EDP class of 2012.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 46 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability   With facilities in dozens of communities on four  continents, we like to say that Novelis is a global  company with a local presence. While we focus many  of our community engagement programs near our  manufacturing facilities, we also contribute in a variety  of ways in the communities where our employees and  business partners live and work, and where our  products are used. Aligning Community Engagement   with Company Strategy  Our goal is to always be a good neighbor. All of Novelis operating  sites have community programs in place, which we call Novelis  Neighbor. Through the programs, our employees are able to connect  with the people who live in the communities where Novelis operates  and, in the process, put a human face on our company.  Over the past year, as part of our broader effort to fully integrate  sustainability across our business, we saw an opportunity to better  align our community efforts with our business strategy and to take  a more coordinated, global approach, while also recognizing local  issues or needs. In addition, we recognized the need to better focus  our charitable investments and to more formally measure our impact.  By doing so, we believe we can increase our positive impacts in the  community, while also strengthening employee engagement and  further embedding Novelis Neighbor into our company culture. As a first step in this direction, we developed themes for charitable  investment and volunteering aligned with our companys strategy.  Specifically, the Novelis Neighbor program seeks to meet  community needs through three areas of focus: Engaging with Our Communities Using Community Engagement  to Build Leadership Skills Novelis believes that an essential  quality for a leader is a commitment  to give back to the community.  We also believe that participating  in community engagement efforts  provides employees with an  opportunity to develop valuable  skills and experience that can be  applied not only in the community,  but also in their work at Novelis.  As a result, we have expanded the  curriculum for four of our leadership  development training programs  to include a hands-on community  engagement component.  For example, in 2011, members  of the Engineering Development  Program built prosthetic hands to  help children who have lost limbs  to landmines. Also during the year,  participants in Novelis Accelerated  Leadership Program visited the  companys Yeongju plant in Seoul,  South Korea, and took part in  the plants Sharing Briquettes of  Love program. The program is a  Novelis Neighbor initiative, which  the company has supported since  1999, that provides charcoal to  local residents for heating and  cooking purposes. Additionally,  participants in the Global Leadership  Program visited the Primavera  Group in Campinas, Brazil, which  offers educational guidance, a safe  haven, and hope for youth in a  neighborhood historically plagued  with drug trafficking and prostitution.

Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 47 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability In practice, this means we are increasingly targeting our charitable  investments to organizations and initiatives focused in our three areas  of safety, math and science education, and recycling. At the same  time, we are still working to meet the unique needs of the diverse  communities where we operate. For example, in Ouro Preto, Brazil,  we have been a long-time supporter of a program that provides  educational materials for elementary school children to learn about  environmental conservation and recycling. In the USA we partner  with organizations, including Rebuilding Together, to help repair  and safeguard the homes of the elderly and disabled, allowing these  homeowners to maintain their independence.  Strengthening Our Community  Engagement Processes While we have engaged with local stakeholders in a variety of  ways as long as we have been in operation, the process has been  largely informal and has varied across our different locations. That  is why, in FY11, we adopted a corporate-wide sustainability target  to implement community engagement processes at 100% of our  operations. Building on the Novelis Neighbor community investment  programs already in place at all of our major locations, we are now  implementing a more formalized process for routinely and proactively  engaging in dialogue with neighbors, nongovernmental organizations,  local government officials, other companies and community  stakeholders. Our objective is to receive input that enables us to  better identify, understand and address the most important issues in  the communities where we operate.  To help us achieve our target, in FY12 we conducted training for  all of our Novelis Neighbor site champions – individuals who are  responsible for managing and tracking the community programs  at each facility. During this training, the site champions learned  how to implement our newly formalized process of dialogue and  engagement with members of their local communities. Additionally,  the training included information on how to better measure the  impacts of our community programs. We will report on our progress  implementing the process in future sustainability reports.   Novelis Continues Support of  the Make-A-Wish Foundation In FY12, Novelis continued its  support of the Make-A-Wish  Foundation, an organization  that works to grant the wishes  of children with life-threatening  illnesses, with a donation of  $275,000. This donation to the  Georgia and Alabama chapter was  the largest in its history. Novelis   has supported Make-A-Wish  since 2009 and, over that time,  has granted more than 65 wishes  through its contributions.  Novelis is proud to work with Make-  A-Wish and, over the last few years,  our partnership has also inspired our  employees to get involved in local  events, including the Walk for Wishes  and the Tournament of Wishes.  Additionally, we have worked with  Make-A-Wish on can recycling in  Atlanta schools, and many Novelis  employees also volunteer for the  organization year-round.  Supporting Habitat   for Humanity  In FY12, Novelis supported Habitat  for Humanity through contributions  of $170,000 and volunteer hours. In  the USA, Novelis donated funds and  employees volunteered time to make  homes move-in ready for up to three  families. The donation from Novelis  will help support Habitats Global  Mission Fund, which is used to  assist communities that are most in  need across the globe, and will help  fund Habitats IndiaBUILD initiative.  Also during the year, Novelis Asia  donated funds and nearly 900  volunteer hours to Habitat for  Humanity. This contribution allowed  for one home to be built for a family  in the suburb of Seoul.   Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 48 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Using Community Engagement to Attract   and Develop Employees In addition to bringing benefits to the community, it is clear that  effectively engaging with, and contributing to, the communities  where we operate has a number of direct benefits for Novelis.  Companies that build strong relationships with their local  communities are better positioned to attract and retain employees  who live there. As a result, we view our community engagement  efforts as one of the ways our overall sustainability platform is  becoming an additional factor in our companys acquisition of   new talent.  We also believe that community engagement is a responsibility  of leaders at Novelis. To this end, we have incorporated Novelis  Neighbor service projects into our leadership development programs  (see case study on page 46). Whether through these programs or our  Novelis Neighbor volunteer opportunities, we believe that when our  employees engage in service projects, they learn valuable skills that  develop them as leaders both in their communities and at Novelis.     Community Giving and Volunteerism:   By the Numbers In FY12, Novelis charitable giving through the Novelis Neighbor  program totaled just over $1.8 million, including company matches to  employee donations. Together with donations given by employees  through the Novelis matching gift program and other workplace  giving campaigns, the total impact of donations made by Novelis and  its employees reached approximately $2.1 million.  Through Novelis Neighbor, we also encourage and facilitate  employee volunteerism by helping to identify and organize volunteer  opportunities in the communities in which we operate. In FY12, our  employees volunteered for approximately 3,500 hours of Novelis  Neighbor and community service projects.  Recycle a Smile Raises Money  for Community Groups in Brazil Since 2006, Novelis South America  has conducted an annual Recycle  a Smile program that educates  the public about the importance of  recycling while also raising money  for nongovernmental organizations  working to address the needs of  communities in Brazil. Through the  program, can collection bins are  placed in shopping malls near our  facilities. Novelis then recycles the  cans and turns them into smiles  by donating the proceeds to   local organizations.  Beginning in 2011, all money  raised from the Recycle a Smile  program has been donated to the  Ao Criana Foundation, a group  fighting malnutrition and helping  more than 700 Brazilian children  each year. Since its inception in  2003, the program has collected  over 3.7 million cans, which  generated approximately R$118,000  (over $57,000) in donations.   Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 49 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability   Candonga Consortium Continues to Implement Resettlement  Agreement in Brazil  In 2012, the Candonga Consortium (a joint venture between Novelis and  Vale) continued its efforts to implement social, environmental and economic  development programs in Ouro Preto, Brazil. The Consortium was formed in  2003 to construct a hydroelectric power plant to supply energy to Novelis  primary aluminum smelter in Ouro Preto. The power plant, which became  operational in 2004, required the flooding of a river valley and the relocation  of 137 families. Those affected were consulted regarding resettlement and,  in collaboration with the state government, the Consortium committed to  a variety of actions to compensate and provide future support to those  affected. Nonetheless, the resettlement agreement was challenged by some  members of the community and is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit.  During the year, the Consortium held workshops with community members  to help develop strategies to foster economic development and raise  awareness about environmental issues. The program focuses on income  generation projects, vocational training and initiatives to facilitate the  inclusion of the affected individuals in the labor market. It also works on  projects to reduce the environmental impact of the power plant on the   local ecosystem. Currently, nearly 70% of the economically active   population that was resettled participates in the Consortiums economic  development programs.  In recognition of its environmental awareness efforts, the Vale do Piranga  Municipalities Association gave the Consortium its Merito Regional   2012 Award.  Oswego Cans for the Community In 2010, Novelis Oswego, New York, facility started a program called Cans  for the Community to give grants to local schools and nonprofits. Through  the program, Novelis collects cans through our own internal recycling efforts  and in partnership with businesses and nonprofits such as the Oswego  Speedway, Harborfest, Tri-Oswego and Oswego City Schools. The value  of the cans is then donated to local organizations. In FY12, Cans for the  Community collected more than 140,000 cans valued at more than $12,500;  the money was used to provide grants and matching donations to schools  and other organizations. The money funds music and library equipment,  classroom supplies, field trips and other programs to encourage education. Novelis Plant Manager  Recognized for Quick Company- Wide Response to Flooding In late 2011 and early 2012, heavy  rains caused major flooding and  landslides in the area surrounding  Novelis facility in Ouro Preto,  Brazil. As he saw the emergency  unfolding, Novelis plant manager,  Eli Murilo, realized that Novelis had  equipment and trained personnel  that could help. He assembled a  team and worked with the mayor  and other local officials on the  overall emergency response. Eli and  his team marshaled the equipment  and donated the resources needed  to clear roads and help stabilize  local infrastructure. In addition to  personal donations from Novelis  South America employees, Novelis  contributed $17,000 to support  these relief efforts. In April 2012, in recognition  of Novelis assistance to the  community during the disaster, Eli  was presented with the Medalha da  Inconfidncia, the highest civilian  award in the Minas Gerais state by  the states mayor, Angelo Oswaldo.  Mr. Oswaldo also cited Novelis  strong track record of engaging  with the local community to  understand and meet local needs.

One interest they have in common is a growing focus  on purchasing sustainable products. We are taking a  collaborative approach, working with customers to  improve design and recyclability over the products   life cycle.  Delivering Value to   Our Customers  Our customers   care as much about   the life cycle impacts   of our products as we do.  Together we are designing  solutions that exceed  customer demands   and improve the  environmental footprint   of their products   – and ours. A   W h o l e   L i f e   C y c l e   A p p r o a c h  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 51 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Value of Aluminum to Our Customers Our customers choose to work with us because we provide high- quality aluminum, work with them to meet their needs and are  systematically improving the sustainability of aluminum products.  Aluminum offers many benefits: It is strong, malleable, versatile,  corrosion-resistant and lightweight. It is also long-lived, and as it is  infinitely recyclable, it offers significant low-carbon benefits when it  is recycled. Different markets value these characteristics differently.  Increasingly, many customers and end consumers are appreciating  that aluminum use reduces weight and results in direct savings to their  bottom line and a better environmental footprint for their product.  The inherent properties of aluminum, along with growing economies  and populations, are driving growth in demand for aluminum. As we  expand to meet this demand, we are also implementing our recycling  strategy. This requires close collaboration with our customers.   Evolving Design Specifications  A key area of innovation for Novelis is using our research and  development capabilities to target particular products that are less  easily recycled, often because of the nature of the alloys they are  made of. By redesigning alloys for specific uses, it will be easier for  Novelis to incorporate them back into products in a closed loop,  to separate them, or to recycle them with other types of aluminum  scrap. As new products are developed, we will work with customers  to ensure that we continue to meet their needs. Meeting Customer Needs through Innovation Our new Novelis Global Research & Technology Center (see page 12 in the  Strategy section), which opened in June 2012, is the focal point for Novelis  own research as well as collaborative efforts with customers to develop new  products and applications.  These are some of the areas Novelis researchers are exploring: 	 	 Development of new sustainable products. 	 	 Improved rolling process technologies. 	  Techniques that take advantage of the value of alloy ingredients derived  from mixed streams of scrap aluminum. To be able to use these alloys,   we must create new casting and fabrication processing methods.  	 	 Alloy optimization for improved properties, including strength,   formability and corrosion resistance. 	 	 Molten metal and advanced solidification technology. 	 	Advanced surface treatment and coating technologies. 	 	 Modeling of forming processes for applications such as automotive   and can products (e.g., on lightweighting optimization). With a world-class team and  equipment available in the  new R&T center, our customers  are already taking note. We  have had great feedback  from customers who have  visited and multiple requests  from others to come see the  center. This center and the  creation of a Global Research  and Technology team further  show Novelis commitment  to leading the industry in  innovation and technology. Jack Clark,   VP and Chief Technical Officer   Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 52 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Delivering on Customers Needs Collaborating with customers to accelerate research and  development of sustainable products is another element of our  approach. We are working with customers in each of our core  markets to meet their needs by delivering sustainable products.  First, we take the time to understand customer specifications.  Customers products require a range of alloy mixtures (metal  composition), tempers (hardness), gauges (thickness) and widths,  as well as various coatings and finishes. To make the product more  sustainable, we do several things. One is that we work with customers  to design for increased recycled input in the alloy mixture. We also  research ways to substitute aluminum for other components in the  product by adjusting alloy combinations to ensure an equivalent  strength to the component it is replacing, as well as to reduce the  weight of the product. Additionally, we work with customers to  optimize product designs to lightweight as much as is possible.  Finally, we work with customers to create processes to take  manufacturing (pre-consumer) scrap or post-consumer material back  at its end of life so we can recycle it. Our beverage can customers are very interested in the carbon  footprint of their products. We are working with them to provide  baseline data on their carbon footprint, to increase recycling, and to  improve performance in relation to other packaging materials. The  growing use of aluminum containers for craft beer has shown that the  sustainability aspects of using aluminum are becoming more widely  recognized (see "Why Not 100%" case study on page 25). Manufacturers of consumer electronics are impressed with  aluminums stylish look and feel. Beyond appearance, these  manufacturers appreciate the light weight, recyclability, and heat  conduction properties of aluminum. Novelis has helped electronics  producers increase the recyclability of their products while providing  superior performance. Aluminum use also reduces weight and  disperses heat, which allows for a simpler, more streamlined and  flatter design of screen-based devices.  Working towards a more  sustainable business is at the  heart of Rexams vision to be  the best in our industry. This  means doing more to keep  our cans in a closed material  loop, preventing cans from  going to landfill. Some markets  require long-term support  to establish and enhance  collection mechanisms and to  create a recycling culture. We  are delighted to be working in  partnership with Novelis on a  number of such sustainability  projects that will reduce the  carbon footprint of the can and  grow the market opportunities  for our products.

Automakers must  continually innovate to provide their customers with ever-increasing levels  of fuel efficiency, safety, convenience, performance and style. Some of these  imperatives are driven by regulation and others by customer preferences. A number of factors are now converging to make aluminum a key ingredient  in the future of auto-making. Fuel economy requirements are rising rapidly.  In the USA, for example, the fuel economy standard for passenger cars  flat-lined at 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg) for two decades between 1990  and 2010. But driven by concerns about energy security, climate change  and fuel cost volatility, standards have increased so that by 2016, cars and  trucks together will need to achieve around 35.5 mpg. Those standards are  expected to increase further to 54 mpg by 2025. Government agencies in  the European Union, China, Japan and other major markets are demanding  similar increases in fuel economy. Reducing the weight of a vehicle is one of the key methods an automaker can  use to improve fuel economy. Lightweighting an automobile also sets off a  virtuous cycle: With less weight to pull, the engine can be downsized, further  improving fuel economy. Lightweight design will be particularly important as  the market for electric vehicles develops over the next 10 to 20 years: Using  aluminum to design electric vehicles from the ground up will allow either  smaller battery packs or improved range. And use of aluminum in certain  vehicle applications can enhance safety and performance. In addition, as the middle class grows in countries like China, India and Brazil,  rates of car ownership and growth in auto sales are projected to soar.

Novelis was chosen to supply 120  metric tons of anodizing quality  aluminum from its Nachterstedt,  Germany, plant to create the 3,000  3-D aluminum panels covering the  faade of the Titanic Belfast. The  panels were crafted by forming  Novelis aluminum sheets into  complicated asymmetrical shapes.  The use of aluminum brings a  modern dimension to the 100-year- old story. Builders appreciate that  the aluminum will age gracefully  against salt-spray since it is located  in a Northern Ireland harbor where  the Titanic was built.   Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 54 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability   continued >> Already, Novelis aluminum is used in 117 vehicle models around the world.  To further expand in the automotive market, we are partnering with our  customers to develop tailored applications and entirely new alloys. Material  specifications for automobile parts are very demanding, and were often  charting new territory when substituting aluminum for other materials.   Thats why we work very closely with our customers engineers and   designers to develop innovative solutions, including these examples:   Our Novelis Fusion material has been used in the BMW 5 and 7 series  one-piece aluminum doors and window frames, which are 25% lighter than  a similar steel design and maintain the same performance. The multi-layer  technology provides a unique combination of core properties and surface  characteristics that make possible a design that couldnt be achieved with  conventional aluminum sheet. This application garnered Novelis the BMW  Supplier Innovation Award in November 2011.   Mercedes has collaborated with Novelis to develop a new alloy,   Anticorodal-300, which is being used in doors, hoods and various structural  applications. The new alloy reduces weight and also provides enhanced  crash safety and strength.    The Land Rover Evoque features an aluminum hood, roof and structural  parts made with Novelis automotive sheet. The advanced roof design is   the first production application of Novelis new high-strength aluminum  alloy Anticorodal-600 PX. Our scientists developed this alloy specifically  for automotive use. It is about 20% stronger than typical aluminum  automotive sheet yet offers improved formability over other high-strength  alloys. The increased strength also provides the opportunity to reduce the  thickness of the sheet by as much as 15%, making it ideal for applications  such as hoods, fenders, roofs and doors. The vast majority of a vehicles greenhouse gas emissions occur during the use  phase of the life cycle, where the light weight of aluminum offers immediate  fuel economy benefits. But sustainability-minded automakers are also looking  upstream in the life cycle, where the use of recycled aluminum reduces the  embedded carbon in the material by 95% compared to primary aluminum.  Novelis is working with automakers to increase the recycled input of the  aluminum used in cars. Because the alloys have been designed for very specific  uses, a key to increasing recycled input is recovering scrap from those uses for  closed-loop recycling back into the same alloy. Jaguar Land Rovers REALCAR  program is an exciting example of this approach (see case study on page 55). To meet the rapid growth in demand for automotive aluminum, Novelis  is expanding existing facilities and building new ones dedicated to the  automobile market. In April 2012, Novelis announced plans to build our  first automotive sheet manufacturing facility in China. The wholly owned,  $100-million plant will have a capacity of 120,000 metric tons per year and  is expected to be ready for operation in late 2014. This project is in addition  to a $200 million expansion of finishing at our Oswego, New York, facility  announced in mid-2011. This expansion will result in a capacity increase of  200,000 metric tons per year, five times Novelis current capacity for aluminum  sheet in North America. It will begin operations in the summer of 2013. Customers have frankly been  staggered by how challenging  our targets are, yet at the same  time they are excited about  the opportunity we have to  create the products that society  needs and wants for the future.  Sustainability touches every part  of our business. Its the right  thing to do  and doing the  right thing has always been   part of Novelis DNA.  Erwin Mayr  Senior VP and Chief Strategy   and Commercial Officer, Novelis The use of lightweight  aluminum components in a  vehicle can save 6 to 12 times  the energy compared to that  used in the production of the  primary aluminum used in its  construction (using recycled  aluminum saves even more).  Up to 8% fuel savings can be  realized for every 10% reduction  in weight.

This is not  a new practice, but as we strive to secure new sources and types of  scrap aluminum, we are institutionalizing the practice. Beginning in  FY12, we changed our sales process so that, as a matter of course,  our contracts include an agreement to buy back our customers  aluminum scrap as much as possible.  Real Progress through REALCAR REALCAR (REcycled ALuminium CAR) is a project led by Jaguar Land Rover  to explore ways to increase the use of recycled aluminum in automobile  manufacturing. The three-year project is partly funded by the UK Government  Technology Strategy Board, and Novelis is a key partner. The overall goal of the  project is to develop technologies and processes that will enable lightweight  automotive body structures to be built using aluminum sheet derived from  lower-cost, energy-efficient, recycled sources, in line with Jaguar Land  Rover's Environmental Innovation (EI) strategy to reduce the CO2 footprint of  manufacturing premium cars. REALCAR is targeting 75% recycled content for  automotive aluminum sheet, including about 50% from manufacturing scrap  and 25% from various post-consumer sources.  Project partners are investigating innovative high-recycled sheet aluminum  developments by evaluating production processes at Novelis and continuous  casting at Brunel University. REALCAR addresses the sourcing of aluminum  scrap by exploring infrastructure and recycling approaches at the  manufacturing facilities of Jaguar Land Rover and its Tier 1 suppliers. The  project aims to drive progress towards a streamlined logistics/supply chain   to facilitate closed-loop returns of aluminum scrap, which not only reduces   the carbon footprint of the material but also provides a low-cost source.   The project has also investigated potential scrap sources from non-automotive  sources and end-of-life vehicle waste; this investigation has identified a  number of future opportunities. REALCAR evaluated over 20 different sheet  chemistries and processes, and developed two compositions based on  commercially available aluminum scrap sources, with a view to replacing   the sheet grade that accounts for the majority of aluminum structural sheet  used in Jaguar Land Rover body construction in the next generation of   Jaguar Land Rover products. Working with Novelis and  other REALCAR project  partners, were pushing the  boundaries of current levels  of recycled aluminum use in  the automotive industry. The  REALCAR project addresses  the full range of questions  involved in expanding  recycled aluminum use, from  the composition of alloys to  where and how we will secure  suppliers of scrap aluminum.  Novelis sustainability goals  are well aligned with those of  Jaguar Land Rover. Novelis  has been a thought partner  at every step of the project,  helping to tackle the technical  issues and also think through  how to create value through  new models of sourcing   and manufacturing. Adrian Tautscher REALCAR Project Leader, Materials  Engineering Technical Services (ETS) Jaguar Land Rover   Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 56 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Novelis estimates that the average American touches  our aluminum 15 to 20 times per day in everything  from their car, to a beverage container, cell phone or  television. Consumers are not only the end users of a  wide range of aluminum products, they are also a  critical linchpin in closing the loop of the aluminum  life cycle. Their actions are a key determinant of how  much aluminum makes it back into the recycling  stream – and how much ends up in a landfill. Novelis is  committed both to providing consumers with safe,  innovative and high-quality aluminum products and to  helping ensure they have a convenient and effective  way to recycle them.        Helping Consumers Recycle We are working   on a global scale   to help support and   develop recycling  infrastructure and influence  consumer behavior to   meet our 2020 recycled  aluminum goal. A   W h o l e   L i f e   C y c l e   A p p r o a c h  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 57 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Shifting the Post-Consumer   Recycling Landscape Post-consumer recycled aluminum currently accounts for  approximately 25% of our overall aluminum inputs. We will need  to source over 4 million tons of scrap by 2020 to meet our 80%  recycling goal. Therefore, increasing recycling at the consumer level is  very important to us and a big challenge in moving forward.   Novelis is keen to work with brandholders, retailers, municipalities  and other stakeholders to increase end-of-life recycling and influence  consumers. Novelis would like to make recycling aluminum products  as easy to do as throwing them away. The hurdle is that consumer  behavior and recycling infrastructure vary widely in different global  locations. For example, differences exist in local and municipal  recycling collection and processing infrastructure and in recycling  public policy frameworks. Nonetheless, Novelis believes we can  make an important contribution towards shifting the post-consumer  recycling landscape by collaborating with others in the supply chain,  and we are working to do so in three main ways:   Further engaging stakeholder partners to expand collection  infrastructure.   Encouraging – and in some cases, directly creating – both can   and non-can recycling infrastructure.   Supporting and developing consumer education and awareness  efforts in both mature and emerging markets. Supporting Collection and   Recycling Infrastructure The infrastructure for collecting and recycling aluminum products  varies considerably around the world. In some locations, there are  well developed, integrated, large-scale systems for collecting, sorting  and processing a wide variety of aluminum scrap, while in other  locations, the systems are less developed, more fragmented or more  limited in the type of scrap they can process. Recycling services are  provided by government agencies in some places and by the private  sector or public–private partnerships in others.  Given the variability, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to  developing and expanding the aluminum collection and recycling  infrastructure. As a result, Novelis is developing tailored strategies to  address gaps in key locations. While the specific tactics may vary, our  objective across the board is to expand the supply of aluminum scrap  – both in terms of volume and type – that we can use as an input for  our products.

CVPs goal  is to launch and study education  programs designed to increase  participation in US curbside  recycling programs, while making  the programs more profitable and  sustainable. Novelis has been a  sponsor of CVP for seven years,  and Novelis David Gill currently  chairs the Board of Directors. CVP  is the only US program engaging all  recycling stakeholders to identify  solutions to improve curbside  recycling programs. CVP has worked  with 27 communities in four states.  In these communities, results have  included an average 23% increase in  recycling volume and 18% increase in  the number of locations that recycle.  www.recyclecurbside.org Metal Packaging Europe Novelis is proud to be a part  of the Metal Packaging Europe  group. This umbrella organization  brings together European and  national industry associations to  use a unified voice to ensure the  benefits of rigid metal packaging  are understood and promoted. The  organization uses communication  tools, policy papers and results  from technical studies on areas  like life cycle inventories to share  knowledge about these concepts: 	 	The value of responsible metal  resource management in meeting  sustainability objectives, and 	 	The importance of metal recycling  to increase resource efficiency. This partnership is a great example  of a program that helps Novelis  reach its goal of promoting  aluminum recycling.  www.everycancounts.co.uk cancrusade.com www.thinkcans.net In Brazil, for example, we have opened five scrap collection centers  to enable us to connect with small scrap yards to increase our supply  of material for recycling (see page 24 in Sourcing). In the United  Kingdom, we have helped develop a program called Every Can  Counts that helps people recycle outside the home and provides  information and resources about why recycling is important (see  sidebar, page 59). In the USA, we are continuing to support nation- wide programs that fund recycling programs both at the home, such  as Curbside Value Partnership (see sidebar), as well as away from the  home, such as the Can Crusade, a national awareness campaign that  toured NFL games to encourage recycling when tailgating. Globally we support efficient recycling policy and infrastructure  development appropriate to local needs.  Educating Consumers about Recycling Finding ways to encourage consumers to recycle aluminum is  as important as ensuring the infrastructure exists to process it.  Consumer attitudes and behavior towards recycling vary widely  across countries. For example, 98% of used beverage containers  are recycled in Brazil (as of 2009), compared with about 58% in  the USA (as of 2010). Recycling rates in Scandinavian countries are  greater than 90%, while Austria and France have lower recycling  rates, bringing the European average to approximately 64%. Novelis  is taking a regionally specific approach to supporting consumer  recycling efforts, helping to influence consumer behavior and helping  to develop recycling infrastructure.  We organize and support a broad range of consumer education and  awareness efforts around the world, particularly in locations with lower  recycling rates. For example, Novelis recycling program ThinkCans in  the United Kingdom has established a consumer education campaign  that has promoted awareness about recycling at work, home, school  and in charities over the last eight years. In another approach, through  one of our FY12 Novelis Neighbor community engagement program  initiatives in the USA, Novelis employees go directly to schools to   give presentations to educate schoolchildren about recycling. As of  April 2012, employees from our corporate office presented programs   at over 25 schools across metropolitan Atlanta, reaching nearly   1,500 students. We plan to expand this program in future   years, so all Novelis employees can make presentations   in their local communities. (See Engaging with   Our Communities on page 46.)   Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 59 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability Every Can Counts In Europe, 30% of beverage  containers are used outside of  the home. Every Can Counts, a  beverage can recycling program  sponsored by Novelis, helped collect  51 million additional used beverage  cans from workplaces and on the  go locations such as colleges,  outdoor locations and tourist  attractions in 2011. Since its inception,  Every Can Counts has added nearly  5,000 recycling collection points in  the United Kingdom and partnered  with more than 800 organizations to  promote recycling.  Through this program, Novelis  has partnered with beverage can  manufacturers, as well as aluminum  and steel packaging companies  and recyclers to provide branded  recycling bins, stickers, assistance  in finding a suitable collection  center and recycling information.  The program was also a part of the  2012 Olympic Games. Specifically,  20 Every Can Counts-branded  can crushers were installed at  Weymouth and Portland at sports  locations, tourist sites and in areas  that do not currently benefit from  on-street recycling facilities.     Given its success, the program  is being expanded elsewhere in  Europe, including Austria, France  and Eastern Europe.      Product Safety and Health Most of our products are further processed by our customers before  they are used by consumers, but Novelis works with our customers  to ensure we meet their safety needs. For some food, beverage and  pharmaceutical applications, we certify that we meet demanding  regulatory consumer safety requirements. We also comply with the  rigorous safety requirements of our automotive customers. Aluminum forms 8% of the Earths crust, making it the most common  metallic element. It is present in various chemical forms in rocks, soil  and vegetation, and is found naturally in most water supplies. As a  result, humans regularly ingest aluminum: The average European  adults diet typically includes 2.5 mg–13 mg per day, although  people taking medication containing aluminum may consume much  more. There is no known biological role for aluminum: Though it is  present in small amounts in the lungs, soft tissues and bones, the  vast majority of aluminum ingested is excreted. The body has highly  effective barriers to exclude aluminum and similar metals. Only a very  small fraction of aluminum in the diet is taken up from the gut, and in  healthy individuals, the kidneys quickly excrete most of this absorbed  aluminum. Patients with severe kidney problems, including those  on dialysis treatment, often face problems, including the inability to  excrete absorbed aluminum. The use of modern aluminum-free dialysate solutions now prevents  dialysis dementia. Acute "dialysis dementia" described in the early  days of renal dialysis has no connection with Alzheimer's disease. In  dialysis dementia, there are neither neurofibrillary tangles nor senile  plaques, and the dementia can be reversed by treatment with drugs  to remove aluminum. In 1997, a Task Group under the auspices of  the World Health Organization and the United Nations Environment  Programme published what is the latest comprehensive report. It  concluded no evidence exists to support the premise that aluminum  causes, exacerbates or accelerates Alzheimers disease. Bisphenol-A (BPA) Epoxy-based coatings that include BPA are found in almost all  aluminum and steel beverage cans. Regulatory agencies in the USA,  Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand have stated that  scientific evidence has consistently shown that these coatings are  safe. In March 2012, the US Food & Drug Administration said that  no compelling scientific evidence exists to justify new restrictions  on BPA. However, Novelis recognizes that some consumers are  concerned with BPA. As a result, Novelis is working with its  customers on innovations in non-epoxy-based coatings.  Overview Strategy Sourcing Manufacturing Customers Consumers About This Report 60 NOVELIS Sustainability Report 2012 www.novelis.com/sustainability This is Novelis second sustainability report, published in the summer of 2012.   Our first sustainability report was issued in November 2011.  Scope and Boundaries  This report was prepared in accordance with the principles of  materiality (see page 15), as well as completeness, balance,  comparability, accuracy, reliability, timeliness and clarity. We applied  quality principles to its data collection and reporting process, and  used Global Reporting Initiative reporting principles (see page 61)   in compiling this data. The report focuses on our most material impacts and opportunities  – those that are of most importance to our company and our  stakeholders. These issues are either currently affecting, or will affect,  our business activities, and Novelis has some level of indirect or direct  influence over them (see page 15 for discussion of how we identified  our material issues). This report covers all Novelis Inc. divisions, subsidiaries and legal  entities in the 11 countries in which we are present. It includes our  joint ventures. We have included 50% of the Alunorf joint venture  in Germany where we have 50% of plant output, and 55% of the  Logan facility in the USA, where we own 40% of outstanding  common shares, but receive 55% of plant output due to equipment  investments. For the operations in Korea and Malaysia, we report  operational data at 100%. In Korea, we hold a 99% equity interest  in the Ulsan and Yeongju plants, up from 68% in FY. We hold a 59%  equity interest in the Aluminum Company of Malaysia Berhad, a  publicly traded company that operates from Bukit Raja, Selangor,  Malaysia. Unlike our production-sharing joint ventures at Norf,  Germany, and Logan, USA, we market 100% of the Korean and  Malaysian plants output.
