and sustainability 2010  Renewable  Recyclable  Biodegradable Trees and plants are  essential to a stable  climate. They help  remove heat-trapping  carbon dioxide gas from  the air by storing carbon  in their leaves, wood,  roots and soils. In Sappis plantations,  logging is balanced with  re-growth and twigs and  stumps are left behind,  leading to continuous  enrichment of the soil. The roots also absorb water and minerals from the ground and send them  up through the trunk and out through the branches. Approximately 50% of  the weight of a tree is water and this is used in the manufacturing process. During the process  of photosynthesis,  leaves use energy  from the sun to  convert carbon  dioxide into organic  compounds,  especially sugars.  The water absorbed  through the roots  transports these  nutrients throughout  the tree. As the  leaves store carbon,  they give off oxygen. Wood is produced  in the trunk of a tree.  Tree trunks are made up of  45% cellulose,  30% hemicellulose,  20% lignin and  5% extractives.  The lignins are  removed before  making coated  ne  paper and resultant  black liquor, a source  of renewable energy  in integrated  pulp mills. There is no solution to climate change  without responsible commercial forestry  1  2010 sustainability report Contents Our mission statement  fulfils this aspiration Delivering on sustainability by: Our vision To embed the 3Ps of Prosperity,  People and Planet into our  everyday business processes to  add value to all stakeholders, and  to help achieve our goal to be,  on a sustainable basis, the most  pro table company in paper, pulp  and chemical cellulose solutions.

In focusing on innovation, our main objective is to ensure that our business stays relevant for stakeholders through appropriate technology, ongoing product  development, as well as listening to our customers needs.  3  2010 sustainability report 2010 highlights  Each of our businesses generated positive profit for the year and in the final quarter, the group achieved its  highest quarterly operating profit (excluding special items) since 2002.  A Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) transaction was concluded which saw 30% of  Sappis South African business becoming empowered.  The interactive eQ tool launched by Sappi Fine Paper North America is aimed at educating our stakeholders  on our North American business environmental footprint.  We significantly increased the procurement of our certified wood fibre from 51% to 61% in North America,  from 70% to 82% in South Africa, while in Europe it remained unchanged at approximately 75%.  Under the heading of Code of Ethics: are we walking the walk? we conducted a survey on the updated  Sappi Code of Ethics. Over 90% of respondents from North America believed that the Code was being  followed by their managers and colleagues versus 77% and 75% in Europe and South Africa respectively.  Almost all employees correctly identified all three of Sappis core values: Excellence, Integrity and Respect.  4 Sustainability has moved from the fringes of business into the mainstream  and we are determined not to relegate sustainability to being a checklist  exercise. We believe that the essence of sustainability is to protect and to create  stakeholder value over the long-term. This will be achieved by being  responsive to the changing trends of dynamic marketplaces, considerate  of the expectations and needs of our stakeholders and sensitive to  the fact that we operate in an industry which has a high potential  environmental impact.  The further we integrate sustainability into our everyday business  processes, the more we understand the interdependent nature of the  3Ps of Prosperity, People and Planet. Energy is a case in point. Our operations are energy intensive. Our long- term strategic plan involves the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs)  and a concerted focus on the use of renewable and self-generated  energy. By reducing our carbon footprint we generate cost savings as  well as achieving greater control on this key input in terms ofself- sufficiency. Having the ability to generate our own energy is important  economically and from an environmental perspective.  In terms of Prosperity, to drive our return to profitability, management  actions over the last year have included closure of under performing  operations (Kangas Mill in Finland and Usutu Mill in Swaziland), the  consolidation of our paper division in South Africa into Sappi Paper and  Paper Packaging South Africa, the re-engineering of our customer  processes and service offerings in Europe and various well-received  marketing campaigns dealing with new products and with the sustainable  nature of our products. The structural changes in South Africa are  aimed at meeting customer requirements and developing new business  opportunities.  Globally we continue to explore technical innovation opportunities  delivering variable cost reduction and improvement in procurement,  Ralph Bottger Message  from the chief  executive officer We manage both financial and  non-financial risks and impacts  in order to achieve real business  benefits and value add for our  stakeholders. We manage both financial and  non-financial risks and impacts  in order to achieve real business  benefits and value add for our  stakeholders.  5  2010 sustainability report Safety is an ongoing challenge. We have worked very hard to create a  culture which prioritises safety at all times and incorporates contractors  into this culture. While our safety performance improved further in the  year under review, I deeply regret having to report that there were four  fatalities – one in Europe and three in our South African operations. We  will continue to focus on entrenching a strong safety culture with the  ultimate target of zero harm. In working to achieve our goal of treading more lightly on the Planet, we  are now producing the average sheet of fine paper with less fossil- based energy and water and with less impact on landfill than we did  three years ago. Going forward we will focus on continuous improvement  through our pursuit of best practice forest management standards,  efficient manufacturing practices, renewable energy generation, fibre  recovery and responsible use of all resources.  Shifting stakeholder expectations together with new knowledge and  innovations in technology are constantly challenging us to make choices  in the way our operations, products, services, and activities impact on  our financial viability, on our stakeholders and on the earth.  I would like to thank those who have worked hard in the past year to  leverage the opportunities and deal with the challenges of this dynamic  environment. The sustainability journey is often unpredictable, sometimes  difficult, but always stimulating and I look forward to taking on the  challenges that await us in the year ahead.  Ralph Bottger Chief executive officer Sappi Limited waste manage ment and capital expenditure. We also concentrate on  growth areas of our business, developing relationships at all levels with  our customer base and launching a range of innovative products to  meet their specific needs. We view Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) as a  key requirement for sustainable growth and social development in  South Africa and we have long been committed to participating in the  countrys transformation and development through our South African  forestry and manufacturing operations. During the past financial year we concluded a BBBEE transaction  which has enabled us to meet our BBBEE equity targets. Effectively,  30% of the equity in our South African business is now in the hands of  all South African employees below middle-management level (62.5%),  our black managers (15%), the communities in which our South African  business is economically active (12.5%) and a strategic empowerment  partner group (10%).  In terms of People, the abovementioned transaction was aimed at  creating wealth on a broad basis for our employees and black managers  who, in the majority, do not participate in other company share incentive  schemes and at attracting and retaining core skills. Communities, in particular those located near our operations, are key  stakeholders and as such we believed it appropriate to include them in  the equity package. We will continue to promote their advancement  through our corporate social investment projects, particularly through  educational and entrepreneurial initiatives. The transaction has also elevated our South African business to a Level  Three Contributor which means that 110% of the value of all purchases  from Sappis South African business qualifies as preferential procurement  spend by our South African customers and gives our products a  competitive advantage in this region.   6 Sustainable organisation Scope of this report Message from group head: legal and sustainability Balancing the economic, social and environmental aspects of the  business within a transparent, ethical corporate governance framework  underpins our approach to sustainable development. The Sappi Code of Ethics is the foundation of this approach. In the year  under review, we rolled out a global survey to assess our employees  awareness and understanding of the Code, including whether they  see it as adding value to the organisation and the extent to which they  abide by it.  The survey indicated a high awareness of Sappis core values of  Excellence, Integrity and Respect. The majority of employees would  report fraud or unethical behaviour to their line managers, with the  Sappi Hotlines being the second line of recourse.  Key developments A key development in the year under review was the elevation of the  executive sustainability committee into a board committee which  continues to be chaired by Jock McKenzie, an independent non- executive director Rudolf Thummer a non-executive director, was  appointed during the year to the sustainability board committee. The  committee agrees sustainability objectives and monitors targets  quarterly. The latter are set out on page 19, with the annual data  reflecting that we have achieved some, but not all, of our goals during  the year.  Governance was strengthened further by formalising our approach to  sustainability-related issues in the form of global group policies. This  has given everyone within our geographically diverse group a common  blueprint for engaging with stakeholders and has enhanced  understanding of our stance on certain key issues.  Annually our mills in the European Union are certi ed under the Eco- Management Audit System (EMAS) which involves external auditing of  (1)  LignoTech SA produces lignosulphanate, which is based on the binding agent of wood, and a co-product of pulp production. Lignin-based products are used as  dispersing agents in concrete, textile dyes, pesticides and ceramics and as binding agents in briquetting, animal feed and dust suppression. (2)  The King Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa was published in 2009. It followed a 1994 report commonly known as King I, and a 2002 report commonly  known as King II. From June 2010, companies listed on South Africas JSE Limited must comply with King III. This report is aligned with our annual report and covers the period  28 September 2009 to 26 September 2010. In terms of joint ventures,  we have a 34% stake in our joint venture in Jiangxi Chenming Mill in the  Peoples Republic of China and only have an indirect influence. Hence  this mill is not covered in our report. LignoTech South Africa, our 50:50  joint venture with Borregard at Saiccor Mill is also excluded as we do  not manage the operation.(1) We report on a regional and global basis,  wherever possible presenting data over five years to make the  information relevant, accessible and comparable. About this report As Sappi Limited is headquartered in South Africa and has its primary  listing on the JSE, we abide by the King III Code on Corporate  Governance (King III).(2)  We have once again reported in terms of our 16 Sustainability Charter  commitments in terms of the performance against objectives grid  which we introduced last year – an approach which provides a very  clear link between sustainability and strategy and meets King IIIs  recommendation for integrated reporting. We report in accordance with  the GRI G3 indicators and this year, have declared ourselves as a level  A reporter.  The printed report is aimed at giving the reader a broad overview of  our triple bottom line performance. Our online report (http://sappi. investoreports.com/sappi_sdr_2010) follows the same structure, but  incorporates more details. Our compliance with the UN Global Compact,  to which we are a signatory, is also detailed in the online report. The information presented has been determined on the basis of our  ongoing engagement – formal and informal – with our stakeholders  and has been assessed against the backdrop of current business  operations, as well as prevailing trends in our industry and the global  economy.  our environmental data from those mills. The issue of having our  sustainability information assured in some way has been under  consideration for a period of time. Our intention is therefore to involve  our internal audit department in conducting an assessment of certain  social and environmental performance indicators during 2011. We will  report back on progress made in next years report. Ria Sanz Group head: legal and sustainability Sappi Limited Sappi Limited Board Board Sustainability Committee Group Sustainable Development Council Regional Sustainable Development Councils North America Europe South Africa  7  2010 sustainability report 7 Sustainable fibre We use independent, internationally accredited forest certification  systems like the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification  (PEFC) the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), and the Sustainable  Forestry Initiative (SFI). These internationally recognised, independent  auditing procedures mean that it is possible to trace our virgin fibre from  source to end product. Globally, approximately 75% of the fibre we procure is certified, with the  rest being procured from known and controlled sources. We do not  source from old-growth or endangered forests anywhere in the world.  Our wood fibre is a renewable resource, grown in sustainably managed  forests (North America and Europe) and plantations (South Africa). All manufacturing activities have some impact on the Planet and ours is  no exception. However, we are treading increasingly lightly. We now  produce the average sheet of fine paper with less energy and less water  than we did three years ago. In addition, the solid waste we sent to  landfill decreased. Globally, we use over 49% renewable energy  to manufacture our papers – and were working on increasing this  percentage. All of this, together with the fact that our papers are recyclable and  biodegrade without leaving harmful residue in either the soil, the air or  the water when they do degrade, offers a truly planet-friendly solution. Our papers are produced using labour drawn from local communities,  and the services of small and medium enterprises situated in the areas  around plantations and production facilities. We also have a best- practice training programme and, through our corporate social  responsibility programme, are investing in the socio-economic  development of the communities in which our workers live. Fibre origin and species One of the greatest benefits of paper and  paper packaging and chemical cellulose  is that the wood fibre they are derived  from is a sustainable, renewable resource. Pine Maple Birch Eucalyptus Poplar    South Africa Focus of Tweedie research centre: Maximisation of pulp yield and  modification of fibres to enhance characteristics for end products.  Species grown: All timber in SA is sourced from plantations (planted  forests of exotic trees) of softwoods and hardwoods. The soft woods  are all pine species including Pinus patula, Pinus elliottii, Pinus taeda  and some hybrids. The hardwoods consist of eucalypts including  Eucalyptus grandis, Eucalyptus dunnii, Eucalyptus nitens, Eucalyptus  smithii and a range of hybrids, and the wattle, Acacia mearnsii. Propagation: Seeds and cuttings come from Sappis own seed  orchards where the parent trees have been specially selected for their  growth qualities and desirable timber characteristics.  Seedlings are grown in Sappis own nurseries in the provinces of  Mpumalanga and KwaZulu Natal.  All seedlings leaving the nurseries are assessed in terms of the Sappi  Plant Quality Index (PQI). Developed in-house to assess the quality of  seedlings and cuttings, thus ensures that they meet certain physical  and physiological specifications and that acceptable survival and  growth is achieved.    Europe No owned plantations or land. Wood fibre sourced from forests close to  each mill. Softwood and hardwood pulp is sourced from Europe and  the Americas. Tree species used: Spruce (used for mechanical pulp and softwood  chemical pulp) and beech (used for hardwood pulp). Lanaken Mill can  also process significant amounts of poplar.    North America  No owned forest plantations or land. Wood sourced from landowners  and commercial loggers. Wood procured from temperate forests in  Maine, New Hampshire, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin and from  the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario.  Tree species used: Maple, poplar, aspen, beech and birch (hardwoods)  and spruce, pine and fir (softwoods). Sustainable fibre continued >  8 Sustainable  bre continued GROWING HARVESTING   Every tree that is harvested is replaced with new growing stock.   The growth rate of trees in our plantations is approximately three  times faster than that of similar trees in the northern hemisphere.    Hardwood (eucalypts) harvested at ten years, softwood (pines) at  18 years.    Harvesting: 58% mechanical, 42% manual.   When biomass is harvested and used to generate energy, the  carbon it contains is released as carbon dioxide (CO2) into the  atmosphere. This process is considered to be carbon neutral  as the carbon dioxide generated is the same amount that was  bound from the atmosphere by the process of photosynthesis  during the growth of the trees. Forests only contribute to net carbon  emissions when biomass is harvested faster than it grows back.  A sustainably managed forest landscape is considered to be a net  carbon sequester despite the removal of biomass during harvesting.  At Sappi, logging is balanced with re-growth and twigs and stumps  are left behind, leading to continuous enrichment of the soil.  Safety and forests Forestry can be a hazardous activity which means safety management  is a core commitment. Having most of our forestry operations  contracted out makes safety management more complex and difficult.  Over the last two years we have developed a Contractor Safety  Management System which has now become fully operational  and has resulted in significant improvements in the safety performance  of our contractors, so much so that we have achieved record safety  performance indices. Employment   The forestry industry is a significant employer in rural areas.    Sappi employs about 12,000 contractor employees during planting,  growing and harvesting, all of which are outsourced.    We support approximately 10,000 emerging timber farmers under  the Project Grow scheme. Planting   Softwood and hardwood planted in roughly equal proportions to a  density average of 1,667 trees per hectare.    Tree species are matched with the soil type and climatic conditions.    Watercourses are carefully delineated to ensure our trees do not use  water stored in these systems. Water use   The trees in our plantations are not irrigated. Commercial forestry  plantations account for a little less than 3% of total water use  in South Africa while irrigation for agriculture accounts for  approximately 60% of all water used in the country.  Photosynthesis During the process of photosynthesis, trees use energy from the  sunlight to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic compounds  (foods) essential for their growth storing carbon and releasing oxygen  in the process. Plantations and natural forests thus help to mitigate  the impacts of global warming. Maintenance   Silvicultural practices to maintain stands of trees include periodic  weeding, as well as protection from fire, pests and diseases.    Biocontrol methods used to combat infestation by wood wasp  in the pine-growing regions of Mpumalanga. South Africa Biodiversity   Approximately 30% of land is managed for biodiversity  conservation, 5% is used for infrastructure and 65% is forested.    Over 450 bird species have been recorded on Sappi land (over  half the species recorded in South Africa, including the critically  endangered species: the Cape Parrot, the Wattled Crane and the  Blue Swallow). A wide range of rare and endangered animals and  plants has been recorded and is conserved.  Many millions of tree seedlings are grown in Sappis tree nurseries  each year  9  2010 sustainability report 9 CERTIFICATION TRANSPORT ISSUES    South Africa Limits on land for planting  We aim to expand our landholdings to  increase our wood  bre base. We achieved  this in 2010 by purchasing the 14,500ha  Sjonajona plantation in Mpumalanga. Drought  We have permanent sample plots measured  annually (eucalypts) or bi-annually (pines)  todetermine the effect of drought on  currentannual increment as an input to  long-term planning. We have implemented  extensive planting of more drought-tolerant  eucalypt species. Maximising fibre yield  Over 15 years, our research efforts have  resulted in a 60% improvement in eucalypt  plantation yield. We have implemented  extensive planting of more drought-resistant  eucalypt species. Pest control Ongoing research and collaboration with  industry and tertiary institutions to develop  biocontrol measures and breed genetically  more resistant planting stock.  Fires  Extensive risk mitigation between planted  stands of trees as well as in open areas and  under the tree canopies in vulnerable areas.     Europe and  North America  Fibre supply  In both Europe and North America, we are  able to mitigate fibre supply risk through  acombination of approaches which include  both short- and long-term wood supply  agreements and shareholdings in wood  sourcing co-operatives.  >    North America   61% of fibre procured is third-party certified.    Our involvement in initiatives to promote  third party forest certification include:  –  A partnership with Time Inc, Hearst  Corporation and two of our competitors  to help small- and medium-sized  landowners in Maine achieve third-party  forest certification.   –  The Sustainable Forestry Programme.  Operating from Skowhegan, Maine.  Theprogramme is comprised of a team  of highly-trained forest professionals,  including licenced foresters, dedicated  to assisting woodlot owners in the state  of Maine develop and manage their  woodlots. Certified as an FSC group  management scheme. Origin of non-certified fibre In terms of non-certified fibre, wood/pulp  is sourced from known and trusted  suppliers close to each mill, regularly visited  by our buyers. FSC-controlled wood and  PEFC non-controversial sources  requirements are incorporated into our  purchasing specifications and contracts  and in line with our ISO 14001-accredited  purchasing policy. Environmental- and  forestry-related information (including wood  sources) is obtained from every pulp  supplier on a regular basis and this data is  then evaluated by a team of experts.    South Africa Sappis lands are 100% FSC certified and are  also ISO 14001 certified. In this region, 82%  of the fibre we procure is certified.

Sappi was the first forestry  company in South Africa to benefit from  the use of these vehicles on a  commercial basis.     North America   In 2009, Sappi Fine Paper North America  joined the US Environmental Protection  Agencys (EPA) SmartWaySM Transport  Partnership, an innovative collaboration  between the EPA and companies that  provide and hire freight delivery services,  and is designed to increase energy  efficiency while significantly reducing  greenhouse gases and air pollution.     In FY2010, we continued to communicate  the benefits of the SmartWaySM  programme to our carriers and merchant  partners, and built upon the trend of  increasing the number of certified carriers  in our network moving our products.    Europe  10 Sustainable manufacturing INPUTS Pigments, fillers, binders, additives.  Necessary to enhance the  performance properties of paper.  Purchased electricity, steam, gas, coal, heavy fuel oil,  biomass.  Pulp and paper operations are energy-intensive and in  some regions, purchased power is our major energy  source. In certain regions, electricity generation is mainly  coal-based and this has obvious carbon implications.  Globally, around 49% of the energy we use comes from  renewable sources (waste products from our production  processes, black liquor, bark and sludges, as well as  purchased biomass). Energy, chemicals and water are recycled throughout the process Lime mud Lime mud, a  by-product of the  pulping process, is  used by farmers to  control soil pH. Lignosulphanate A joint venture in South Africa and a wholly- owned subsidiary in Europe produces  lignosulphanate which is based on the binding  agent of wood and is a co-product of pulp  production. Lignin-based products are used as  dispersing agents in concrete, textile dyes,  pesticides, ceramics and as binding agents in  briquetting, animal feed and dust suppression. Ash The ash created by burning bark,  branches and other biomass from  trees in some form of our mill  boilers, can be used as fertiliser  and a soil additive. Tall oil At some mills, tall oil from organic soaps is sold to  a convertor and used to make lubricants, detergents  and paint additives.

Globally,  theamount of solid waste we send to landfill  shows a steady decline, in line with our move  away from coal-fired boilers to gas- and  biomass fired boilers (Gratkorn and Tugela  Mills). Since 2006, specific solid waste sent  tolandfill has dropped by 4.6%. This shows our five top categories of waste.  Boiler ashes are the most significant waste  category, resulting from the use of coal. Solid waste – all mills  12   Description and typical uses Demand trends Woodfree  paper made  from pulp  produced in  a chemical  process Coated: Higher level of smoothness than uncoated paper achieved by applying  a coating on the surface of the paper. As a result, higher reprographic quality  and printability is achieved. Uses include marketing promotions and brochures,  catalogues, corporate communications materials, direct mail, textbooks  and magazines. Demand for coated woodfree paper is  expected to continue to grow on a global  level, but the impact of electronic media is  likely to result in a gradual decline in paper  consumption in developed economies  over the long-term. Advertising, retail  sales, and consumer demand for printed  products are primary drivers of demand. Uncoated: Uses include business forms, business stationery, tissue and  photocopy paper as well as cut-size, preprint and of ce paper. Certain brands  are used for books, brochures and magazines. Over the last few years, strong demand  in the cut-size business has helped the  uncoated of ce markets. There is a  growing trend to print some brochures  and magazines on uncoated grades  such as Tauro. Speciality: Can be either coated or uncoated. Uses include bags, labels,  exible  and rigid packaging and release paper for casting innovative surface textures  (eg, arti cial leather, decorative laminates) for use in the textile, automotive,  furniture and engineering  lm markets. Flexible paper packaging driven by  steady consumption growth in the healthy  food and drink markets. Paper based  packaging is highly regarded as  a sustainable solution. Release paper  demand is expected to grow along with  the textile and automotive industry, as well  as in new and innovative applications. Mechanical  paper made  from pulp  produced  in a  mechanical  process Coated: A coated mechanical  bre-based paper, primarily used for magazines,  catalogues and advertising material.  Magazines, one of the main end-uses  related to this product group, doing  marginally better than last year mainly  due to growing consumption in special  interest magazines. As with CWF,  advertising expenditure is a key  demand driver. Uncoated: Mechanical  bre-based printing paper used primarily for the printing  of books, and advertising inserts. As woodfree grades become more  expensive, the demand for improved  newsprint and mechanical uncoated  grades increases. Newsprint: Uses include advertising inserts and newspapers.  Demand is highly dependent on  newspaper circulation and retail  advertising. Electronic media has led  to newsprint demand declines in most  markets across the globe. Packaging  products Packaging paper: Heavy and lightweight grades of paper and board used for  primary and secondary packaging of fast moving consumer goods, agricultural  and industrial products. Products include containerboard (corrugated shipping  containers), sack kraft (multi walled shipping sacks) and machine glazed kraft  (grocery bags). Can be coated to enhance barrier and aesthetics properties. Packaging demand is driven by  population growth, higher standards  of living, urbanisation and globalisation.  Paper packaging is seen as playing  an increasingly important role in an  environmentally-conscious world. Pulp Paper pulp: Main raw material used in production of printing, writing and  packaging paper. Pulp is the generic term that describes the cellulose  bre  derived from wood. These cellulose  bres may be separated by mechanical,  thermo mechanical or chemical processes. The chemical processes involve  removing the glues (lignins) which bind the wood  bres, to leave cellulose  bres.  Paper made from chemical pulp is generally termed woodfree. Uses include  paper, paperboard and tissue. With gradually improving global demand  for paper products, demand for paper  pulp is expected to continue to recover. Chemical cellulose: Manufactured by a similar process to paper grade pulp,  but puri ed further to leave virtually pure cellulose  bres. Chemical cellulose is  used in the manufacture of a variety of cellulose textile and non-woven  bre  products, including viscose staple  bre (rayon), solvent spun  bre (lyocell) and   lament. It is also used in various other cellulose-based applications in the  food,  lm, cigarette, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. These include the  manufacture of acetate  ake, microcrystalline cellulose, cellophane, ethers and  moulding powders.  Chemical cellulose has a wide range  of applications, demand for many of  which is expected to continue growing  at good rates. The textile uses in particular  are predicted to show increasing levels  of growth as the growth in the supply of  cotton becomes increasingly constrained. Timber  products Sawn timber for construction and furniture manufacturing purposes. As consumer and housing markets  recover in South Africa, demand for  timber products is expected to recover. Sustainable products Sustainable products and marketplace  13  2010 sustainability report Share of sales Our market in 2010 51% Demand is still recovering from the low  levels of 2009 (as the economy improves),  although at a slower pace than in  2010. Magazine advertising pages and  increased mailing of catalogues have  helped the demand recovery. 7% After a slow start in the  rst few months,  the uncoated market in Europe  rebounded strongly throughout 2010. 7% Strong recovery versus 2009 in the  packaging and labelling markets. The  release market also had a good recovery,  particularly in terms of Asian demand. 13% Demand still below 2008 levels, but a  strong recovery from the low levels of  2009, particularly in the second half of   nancial 2010.  7% The changing school curriculum in  South Africa is resulting in increased  demand for book printing grades. Some recovery in demand in South Africa  for newsprint, but pagination is still low. After a weak start to 2010, global  packaging markets and our primary  market in South Africa started to recover  as economic conditions improved. 14% The global pulp market was characterised  by increasing demand, rapidly increasing  prices and some supply shocks in 2010. The global chemical cellulose market  remained strong throughout 2010 and  demand in many cases exceeded supply. 1% The South African timber market was  weak in 2010 with lower demand and an  excess of supply.

Examples of Sappis product brands  14 The economy and demand for our products  Key issues The issues set out below are sustainability-related challenges that we believe may have a material impact  on our viability as a business either by directly impacting our ability to operate profitably or by affecting our  reputation and the trust stakeholders have in Sappi.  For example, in South Africa, a leading grocery retailer now offers not  only paper grocery bags, but also a variety of paper-based packaging  throughout the store. All bakery products as well as all fresh produce  are packaged in paper bags. The delicatessen will also make use of a  range of paper-based packaging made from our innovative Resilio  range of papers, which are not only strong and greaseproof, but also  fully recyclable. The new paper grocery bags have been carefully  engineered to ensure that the switch to more eco-friendly options does  not compromise on convenience. The new bags, which are also being  tested at other pilot sites, offer shoppers a fully-recyclable and fully- biodegradable option. In addition, they hold up to 10kgs in weight, and  have reinforced handles and a square bottom to ensure excellent  carrying capacity and convenience. Our own and other industry campaigns educate consumers that paper  is a natural, renewable, biodegradeable resource. As these campaigns  gather momentum, we believe that educated consumers will increasingly  turn to paper and paper packaging, particularly in light of consumer  concerns about the high use of fossil fuels and ocean debris that  characterise many of the alternatives.  Similarly, chemical cellulose is a renewable resource with a multitude  of uses, from textile fibres, cigarette filters, plastics alternatives,  pharmaceutical binders, food thickeners and almost certainly more  to come. Viscose fibre producers are our largest customers. Viscose  fibres, either alone or in blends with oil-based fibres are important in the  overall textile mix because they are absorbent and therefore comfortable  to wear. Consequently, they are an excellent substitute for cotton,  which has long-term supply limitations. Hence increasing use of viscose  and cellulosic fibre is expected to drive growth in textile fibres. Fibre supply   Breeding for specific pulping characteristics which reduces wastage;   Breeding for disease resistance;    Selecting eucalypt hybrid crosses for cold tolerance; and     Ongoing research, including collaboration with industry and various  research institutes to improve silvicultural practice, develop bio- control measures and breed genetically more resistant planting stock. In Europe and North America, fibre is sourced from forest owners  close to each operation, with whom we have long-standing relationships.  In these regions, we mitigate fibre supply risk through a combination of  approaches which include both short- and long-term wood supply  agreements and shareholdings in wood sourcing co-operatives.  The implications of a constrained fibre source would have  dramatic consequences for our business.  Both South Africa and North America sell as much or a little more pulp  than we need to buy, giving us a high degree of pulp self-sufficiency.  Many of our mills in Europe source pulp from South America which, like  South Africa, is expected to feel the impact of climatic changes and  water shortage in the short- to medium-term. Our position: In Southern Africa, we own, manage and lease 555,000ha of land, so  have a certain level of control over our fibre sources. In this region, we  continue to invest in developing our low cost fibre base and are  mitigating fibre supply risk by:     Expanding our land holdings when an opportunity is presented – in  2010, we bought the 14,500 Sjonajona plantation in Mpumalanga  from Mondi;    Rehabilitating our 20,500 hectares of fire-damaged plantations in  Swaziland;     Getting more from each tree – over 15 years, we have increased the  fibre yield of eucalyptus plantations by 60%; The downturn in the global economy has accelerated the  decline of paper use in the developed world as consumers  turn to electronic media to access news and to e-readers  for books and magazines.  While the plethora of devices such as e-readers has impacted on paper  use in the developed world, paper use in the developing world, where  electronic media is often inaccessible and unaffordable, is growing.  In addition, paper plays a key role in promoting literacy throughout the  developing world and many researchers contend that printed materials  are more conducive to an in-depth reading experience than electronic  media.  Our position: Going forward, we believe that digital media will not necessarily  overtake print. This is highlighted by the fact that as the line between  print and digital continues to blur, new technologies are underlining the  relationship between the two. Quick Response (QR) codes are a good  example – theyre new technology that uses a cell phone to scan  information from print – including magazines, billboards, even t-shirts.  Once the QR code is scanned, it opens up a world of information,  whether its a discount or offer, a video, or even a direct link to a website.  We are only just beginning to see the promise and synergistic opportunities  of combining print with new mobile and web technologies. Sappi is countering the trends away from paper in the developed world  by moving into more specialised paper solutions, including intelligent  packaging, security papers, label and food-safe papers and papers  designed to meet specific customer needs.   15  2010 sustainability report Energy In addition to renewable energy from the production of black liquor in  some of our European mills, we also use renewable energy which  originates from the production of biogas in the anaerobic digestion of  sludge. Since July 2007, Gratkorn Mill in Europe has operated a  Combined Heat and Power Generation Plant (CHP). This arrangement  has resulted in the exchange of over 50% of the coal used with natural  gas. Because of the increase in efficiency in the arrangement, fossil- based CO2 emissions have dropped by approximately 10%. The  project also incorporates the option of switching between different fuels  in the fluidised bed boiler. This means different fuels can be used  according to variations in fuel prices.   Biorefining We continue to explore biorefining projects in all regions to reduce  exposure to future energy price increases and provide a stable supply  of energy. Further, bioenergy projects may represent important new  revenue streams. Our position: Our high use of renewable energy and high levels of energy self- sufficiency help cushion us from proposed carbon taxes as well as  energy supply constraints such as those experienced in South Africa  in 2006 because of inadequate supply by Eskom. Our progress in becoming more energy efficient is highlighted by the  fact that between 2005 and 2010, the amount of specific (ie per ton of  pulp produced) purchased energy decreased by 32% and from 2000  – the year we started measuring GHG emissions – specific fossil-based  carbon dioxide emissions reduced by 30%. Competitive analysis of our environmental performance in North  America, for example, has shown that Sappi Fine Paper North America  has the lowest carbon footprint, based on energy use, of the major US  coated free sheet suppliers. This would put us at a competitive cost  advantage should a carbon tax or cap and trade system be  implemented. In addition, print buyers need to purchase fewer carbon  offsets for Sappi products versus our North American competitors  products.  We will continue to identify and evaluate renewable energy, co- generation and biorefining opportunities related to current and/or  anticipated regulatory requirements. Opportunities are being reviewed  for achieving the required payback hurdles as the electricity supply  industry, electricity price, and regulatory environment change in each  region where we operate. As pulp and paper production is highly energy intensive, the  cost and availability of energy is a key consideration for Sappi.  Energy costs as a percentage of operating costs have been rising for  several years and currently account for just under 11% of operating  costs. We mitigate this risk by focusing on increasing renewable energy,  promoting cogeneration and investigating biofuel opportunities.   Renewable energy  We have a major advantage over other industrial companies in our high  use of renewable energy, derived from black liquor, sludges and  biomass. This results in a high degree of energy self-sufficiency and  lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and helps  cushion us from proposed carbon taxes, emission caps or other limits  on fossil fuel use. In North America, more than 88% of all energy used  is derived from renewable resources (black liquor, bark, sludges and  purchased biomass). The percentage of energy derived from renewable  resources for South Africa is 35% and for Europe is 34%, with Sappis  global figure standing at 49%.  In integrated mills, the black liquor created during the pulping process  is a primary source of renewable energy. The reason for the much  higher percentages of renewable energy in Sappis mills in North  America and South Africa than in Europe is that a much greater  proportion of our product originates from kraft-type integrated pulp and  paper mills which typically have a higher degree of energy self- sufficiency than non-integrated mills.  In Europe and North America, one of the key issues we face is  competition for biomass as feedstock for energy. Regulations related to  the promotion of biomass for energy in Europe and North America  could have a negative impact on wood fibre supply. In both regions, it  has been demonstrated that wood fibre delivers far more value to the  economy when used for the pulp and paper industry than for energy.  A CEPI study (A bio-solution to climate change) estimates that wood,  when used for papermaking, delivers eight times more added value and  creates 13 times more jobs than if used for energy.   Combined heat and power  Combined heat and power generation is a very efficient method to  convert energy. Conventional (condensation) power plants generate  just power and dispose of their waste heat by means of river cooling  water or cooling towers. The efficiency ratio of condensing power  plants is well below 40%. In other words only 35 to 45% of the energy  content of the primary fuel is converted into usable energy.    Combined heat and power generation converts a much higher share of  the primary fuel at levels of 75 – 90% into usable energy. Heat and  Power can be converted from any fuel type biogenic or fossil. In Europe  we operate combined heat and power (CHP) plants at all of our mills.  When natural gas is used, the most attractive state of the art method is  the combination with a gas turbine (a stationary jet-engine) that drives a  power-generator. The hot off gases of the gas turbine are used as inlet  air for a steam boiler and the subsequent steam produced is used to  generate power again using a steam turbine and using the extracted  steam  in our production. This technology of  gas-steam combined heat and power generation plant  is in operation at our Gratkorn, Lanaken, Maastricht and Nijmegen mills. During the year in South Africa we entered into an agreement to supply  renewable energy to the state power utility Eskom, from Saiccor Mill.  We are in discussions to sell Eskom the additional power we are able to  generate from our Ngodwana Mill. North America (mainly Westbrook  Mill) exported and sold 13.3% of power used while Europe sold 16.9%  of total power used (Alfeld, Ehingen, Gratkorn, Maastricht and  Stockstadt Mills). Going forward, cogeneration opportunities will remain  a key focus in all regions. Fibre in Europe and North America is supplied by large and small  scale tree owners  16 Key issues continued Environmental legislation  Environmental legislation in the regions where we operate  is potentially making compliance more burdensome and  requiring increased capital expenditure.  South Africa The primary South African environmental laws affecting our operations  include the National Water Act, which govern our forestry operations  and mills through water licences, and the National Environmental  Management: Air Quality Act. Our mills are in the process of receiving  air registration certificates from the authorities which will clarify the  impact the latter will have on our business. The requirements under  these statutes, predominantly with respect to air emissions from our  mills, will result in additional capital and operating expenditures, some  of which may be signi cant.  Europe Our European facilities are subject to extensive environmental regulation  in the various countries in which we operate, including the Integrated  Pollution Prevention and Control directive (IPPC) which regulates air  emissions, water discharges and defines permit requirements and best  available techniques (BAT) for pollution control. While the EU Chemicals  Regulation REACH (1907/2006/EC) is not directly applicable to pulp  and paper, it does apply to a number of raw materials that we source.  The countries within which we operate in Europe have all ratified the  Kyoto Protocol and we have developed a strategy to comply with  applicable GHG restrictions and to manage emission reductions costs  effectively. The EU is considering introducing specific carbon limits per  mill for the pulp and paper industry. This could prove challenging.    North America Sappi Fine Paper North America is subject to stringent environmental  laws. Although the United States has not yet adopted a Federal  programme for controlling GHG emissions, Congress is considering  comprehensive Federal legislation regarding climate change. In addition,  the United States Environmental Protection Agency has enacted or  proposed several rules relating to emissions reporting and reductions.  One such proposal, issued in June 2010 would require industrial,  commercial and institutional boilers and heaters to use maximum  achievable control technology to reduce harmful emissions that erode  air quality and pose a public health risk. According to the Industrial  Energy Consumers of America, (IECA), an industry group that  represents companies with 750,000 employees and US$800 billion in  sales, the proposed Boiler MACT, standards are so stringent that not  even the best performing sources could meet them. Signi cant capital  expenditures could be required for emissions control equipment at our  mills in order to comply with the Boiler MACT and/or other proposed  rates regulating GHGs. We are currently awaiting issuance of the final  rule in January 2011. Our position: In South Africa, we are in frequent contact with regulatory authorities  during the phasing in of new legislation, in an attempt to manage the  transition period. As we are based in a developing country which has  ratified the Kyoto Protocol, we are in a position to utilise the Clean  Development Mechanism for energy-related projects and we are  continuing to explore opportunities in this regard.  In Europe, we have long been subject to the EU Emissions Trading  Scheme (EU ETS). Reductions in carbon limits for the third phase of the  EU ETS are still being determined. Subject to the enactment of these  limits, our expenditures related to GHG compliance in Europe are not  expected to be material.  In North America the environmental laws will continue to engage with  industry associations and regulators to reach agreement regarding  various emissions control requirements. In terms of climate change  legislation, the nature, scope and timing of such legislation is highly  uncertain and, currently, we do not know what effect, if any, such  legislation will have on our financial condition and operations. In our European mills we only use a small amount of permitted water abstraction limits  17  2010 sustainability report Water  Climate change is expected to have a profound impact on  the worlds rainfall patterns, river flows and freshwater  reserves. Any decrease in available water supplies could  significantly affect our fibre supply and production processes. Water shortages in the regions from which we source fibre  could significantly affect fibre supply and our production  processes. Trees require water in order to grow and water is  essential in papermaking to produce the fibre that becomes  the sheet of paper and is an integral part of the steam  systems which generate energy.  The World Resources Institute (WRI), classifies water stress as meaning  that per capita water supply is less than 1,700 m/year. In these terms,  South Africa is a water-stressed country and is facing supply/demand  shortages in the short- to medium-term. Despite common perceptions that Europe has an abundance of water,  the continents use of water is unsustainable, the European Environment  Agency (EAA), the European Unions environmental advisory body, has  warned. (Water resources across Europe – confronting water scarcity  and drought). In North America, water is unevenly distributed, with the states in the  south-west suffering from water shortages and states in the Great  Lakes region having an abundance of water.  South Africa  Abstraction of water, discharge of effluent and management of forests  are all regulated under a licence system in which first allocations go to,  among other things, human consumption, before allocations are made  to agriculture, industry and forestry. All water use is subject to a charge. The plantations from which we source fibre are not irrigated but use  rainwater and groundwater. Contrary to popular belief, forestry only  uses 3% of available water, while agriculture uses approximately 62%.  In addition, agriculture impacts heavily on the quality of water resources,  typically through the diffused runoff of salts and fertilizers (nutrient  enrichment). In this we have a competitive advantage over other crops,  in that we only use a small amount of fertilizer once in each rotation.  The majority of our mills are situated on rivers from which they draw  water, the exceptions being Adamas and Enstra Mills which use 70%  and 50% recycled sewage water respectively. While pulp and paper  manufacturing does use large quantities of water, we return approximately  90% of the water we draw back to the environment. Europe In terms of quantity, the surface and ground water supply to our European  mills has proven abundant even in very dry summers. We currently use  only a small amount of permitted water abstraction limits. Alfeld, Ehingen and Gratkorn Mills waste water treatment plants have  anaerobic reactors which reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD)  of the effluent and increase the production of biogas. During the  anaerobic biological process, special micro-organisms transform the  organic load in the wastewater into biogas. The process has both  environmental and economic value, as the biogas is used for heat and  power generation and sludge disposal costs are reduced. North America None of our operations are situated in areas where water shortages  might have an impact.  Our position: In South Africa, our businesses are already experiencing water  problems following two years of below-average rainfall. The possibility  of increased water tariffs in South Africa and Europe could have a  negative impact on our profitability/pricing. Reducing water usage  within our mills and improving water quality continues to be a key area  of focus. Between 2008 and 2010, globally specific water use decreased by  9.1%. Over the same period, total suspended solids (TSS) and  chemical oxygen demand (COD) – a measure of effluent quality –  dropped by 16.0% and 24.9% respectively.  As with energy, it makes economic sense to intensively manage our  water usage. Each of our operations may be likened to a very large heat  exchanger with the input water being heated in various ways and  locations in each operation due to the combustion of fuels to produce  steam and heat. If the effluent is simply allowed to run off (with  appropriate treatment) then a huge amount of heat is lost. For this  reason one of the most effective ways of retaining heat in an operation,  and hence using less energy (fuels) and thus generating less fossil GHG  emissions (for the fuels that are fossil based), is to maximise water  recirculation and minimise effluent. In 2009, the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI), to which Sappi belongs, joined the European Water Partnership (EWP) as  their first federation member. The EWPs aim is to put water on the mainstream political and media agenda and to develop an awareness of  water challenges among policy makers and business. CEPI has also joined the Water Footprint Network which aims to develop a water  footprint for the pulp and paper industry which will measure direct and indirect impacts.  The Water Footprint Network has suggested the following ways of classifying water: Blue footprint The blue water footprint is the volume of freshwater that has evaporated from global blue water resources  (surface water and ground water) to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual or  community.  Green footprint  The green water footprint is the volume of water evaporated from global green water resources (rainwater  stored in the soil as soil moisture).  Grey footprint  The grey water footprint is the volume of polluted water associated with the production of all goods and  services. The latter can be estimated as the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to such an  extent that the quality of the water remains at or above agreed water quality standards. The water footprint of a business consists of two components: the direct water use by  the producer (for producing/manufacturing or for supporting activities) and the indirect  water use (in the producers supply chain).  18 Climate change As our major raw material input, wood fibre, is a renewable  natural resource, climate change could affect Sappi.  The physical risks of climate change are similar to those for  the agricultural sector. South Africa The Southern African landscape is prone to, and ecologically adapted to,  frequent fires. Under normal conditions this risk can be managed through  comprehensive fire prevention and protection plans. In 2007 and 2008,  South Africa experienced a number of extreme weather events which  resulted in disastrous plantation fires across vast areas of eastern South  Africa and Swaziland, affecting 14,000 hectares and 26,000 hectares  respectively, of our plantations. The risk of plantation fires is always present during the dry winter  months. Since the devastating fires of 2008, we have implemented an  extensive fire protection strategy. This deals with increased community  participation in fire prevention to reduce the incidents of fires through  regional and district Fire Protection Associations. In addition, significant  investment has improved detection, while fire crew training and  improved equipment have significantly improved response times to fires  that occur. Thirdly, fuel load management within plantations helps  contain fires where they occur and has prevented major losses. Fire  losses in 2009 and 2010 were minimal. Our exposure to climate change related risk in Southern Africa is  moderated by the diversity of commercial species and hybrids which  we currently deploy across a wide range of climatic conditions. We  anticipate that certain species or hybrids will become more dominant  than others under changing climatic regimes. This will help to mitigate  any increased threat from pests and disease or from drought.  Europe Climate change could well alter the suitability of whole regions in Europe  for certain forest types, forcing a shift in natural species distribution and  leading to changes in growth of existing stands. In addition, extreme  events (storms, forest fires, droughts and heat waves) are expected to  become much more common and/or severe. (CEPI: Protecting Europes  forests against climate change).  North America The mountain pine beetle is endemic to the western forests of North  America. A decade of warmer temperatures has caused the beetle to  proliferate at an unprecedented rate, devastating over 16 million hectares  of Canadian pine forest between 2000 and 2009. As our operations in  North America source some of their fibre from Canada. The impact of  the pine beetle could affect long-term supply of softwood fibre if the  dead wood is not harvested and the land reforested appropriately. Our position: In South Africa we continue to mitigate risk associated with climate  change through an intensive focus on species and hybrid development  that will be adapted to changing climatic regimes and to minimise  losses due to pest, disease or drought. In addition, we conduct  extensive research into pest control and disease prevention and have a  fire prevention strategy based on community co-operation, rapid  response time and fuel load management. In North America the risk is not as immediate as it is in South Africa  and is more likely to affect us in the long-term. Europes non-integrated  mills which source fibre from South America could be affected by  climatic change. In Europe and North America  bre is sourced from forest owners close to each of our operations Key issues continued  19  2010 sustainability report Report back on targets and Charter commitments Prosperity – improving the profitability of our business SA and NA – Generating revenue from new products/services (less than fi ve years old) SA   slower than expected time-to-market for new fine paper products resulted in the target of 20% not being achieved. NA   target of generating 25% of revenue from new products and services was exceeded (41% achieved) although this target is becoming  increasingly challenging for the core business. New products from the speciality business and product modifications from our core  business will maintain customer satisfaction. Europe – M-real integration We achieved the successful integration of M-reals graphic paper business acquired at the end of December 2008. We exceeded the target set  of 120 million in the three year timeframe. The synergies achieved include procurement benefits, sales and administration cost reductions, asset  optimisation, product recipe changes and manufacturing efficiencies. People –  gaining competitive advantage through our people and positively adding value  to communities SA, NA and Europe – Skills and leadership training SA   exceeded the 45 hours per employee target by achieving 85 training hours per employee, influenced by Saiccor training and specific  regional initiatives. NA  records indicate that this regions training totalled 46 hours per employee thus exceeded the 40 hours per employee target. Europe did not achieve the required 30 hours training per employee. SA, NA and Europe – Corporate Social Responsibility The group exceeded its target of spending 1% of its Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) during the year. A total of US$2.1 million which represents 3.2%  of the groups NPAT was allocated to educational, environmental and cultural projects. Planet – reducing fossil fuels/GHG emissions, water and waste SA, Europe and NA – Fossil fuels/GHG emissions SA   the target of 15% reduction in the use of fossil fuels in our operation by 2015 was partially achieved by 6% this year through small  reductions in each mill. This region exceeded the target in relation to purchased electricity by reducing this element by 16% versus a  target of 10%. NA    achieved 50.3% reduction in GHG emissions across all sites versus a target of 40%. Europe  significantly exceeded its target of 1% reduction of specific direct fossil CO2 emissions and purchased power, reducing these  by 5.8% and 9.7% respectively. SA and Europe – Water SA   the foundation for achieving the target of reducing its total specific fresh water use by the year 2015 of 10%, were well established with  a reduction of 2.8% in the year under review. Europe  this region reduced specific water use (m3/t production and cooling water) by 6.7%. NA – Waste The target of reducing organic content of solid waste by 50% across all sites by 2012 was reached during this year (61%).    Despite differing environments, assets and markets our businesses  are faced with similar challenges. Consequently we have established  overarching goals which are refined regionally to apply to local  circumstances. Our goals are reported through the regional targets  reflected below and through our performance grid based on our 18  Charter commitments which follow hereon.  Regional targets were established in 2008 and are internally  reported on quarterly. In order to manage our sustainability profile  we have chosen to concentrate on three global targets which are  fundamental to all our businesses: Improving the profitability of our business underpins the viability of  our organisation. Financial success creates employment, stimulates  the growth of regional economies and allows for reinvestment into  all stages of the business cycle. In a world and in an industry where skills are in short supply, gaining  competitive advantage through our people makes sound business  sense and adding value to the communities in which our operations  are situated further integrates Sappi into the life of these communities.  Reducing fossil fuel use/GHG emissions and water together with  adding value to waste streams, has environmental as well as  economic bene ts. Given the highly energy intensive nature of our  processes and concerns over global warming, improvements in  these areas will continue to be investigated by our R&D centres.  20 In 2010, Sappi Fine Paper Europe published Whats Next magazine, aimed at educating and informing readers about issues shaping the print  industry. The cover of the  rst edition is featured here Report back: Prosperity   2010 sustainability report 21 Prosperity Streamlining our operational efficiency Sappi Fine Paper Europe launched an internal project, known as  Project Breakthrough, with the objective of becoming more profitable  and offering superior services to make Sappi the preferred supplier in  the market. One major outcome of Breakthrough is the simplification of  the sheet product range. This will mean less complexity, not only in  production but also along the entire supply chain, with customers  getting the same product quality, but much better service. A simplified  pricing and ordering system together with good value propositions  have also been developed. The result of all of this has been an  organisational alignment and better resource allocation.

Sappi Fine  Paper South Africa and Sappi Kraft have merged to become Sappi  Paper and Paper Packaging South Africa. Code of Ethics A survey of the three-year old Sappi Code of Ethics under the heading  of Are we walking the walk? was conducted in September 2010.  Although more than 85% of respondents were familiar with the Code,  the need for ongoing communication and strengthened visibility of the  Code came across strongly from all regions. cti ctions ns ons Cod Cod Co e o e o e of E f E f E f E f thi thi thi thiics cs cs cs A s A s A ssurv urv urv urv urvey  ey  ey  ey of  of  of  of  of the the the the he th  th  th three ree ree ree r -ye -ye -ye -year  ar  ar  ar old old old old Sa  Sa  Sa S ppi ppi ppi pp  Co  Co  Co Co Code  de  de  de of  of  of  of Eth Eth Eth Eth E ics ics icics un  un  un  un u der der der der th  th  th the h e h e h e ead ead eading ing ng  of  of  of  of Ar Ar Ar Are w e w e w e w  we w e w e w e walk alk alk alalking ing ng ing ing th  th th  thhe w e w e w e w e walk alk alk alk alk?  ?  ?  ? was was was was co  co co  condu ndu ndu nducte cte cteed i d i d iin S n S n S n Sept ept ept eptemb emb ember  er  er er 201 201 201 20 0.  0.

Parade Prima Advanced is a one-sided coated label paper which allows for easier, faster runability and  can be laminated for the perfect visual image. Sappi also developed Parade Prima High Performance which has  25% higher bulk and 50% more stiffness than a traditional, standard label paper. What this means in real terms  is that a 70g/m2 of Parade Prima High Performance can be used instead of a 80g/m2 label paper resulting in  higher yields of labels per ton of paper. In South Africa, we launched Masuga, a text grade made from 90% bagasse (sugar cane waste) sourced from  emerging farmers. Going digital Personalised communication is one of the trump cards of modern marketing. Digital print is extremely flexible as  it allows printers to personalise and update brochures, changing text and pictures for individual readers, while  producing adequate quality at much lower cost for relatively small jobs. It is customisable with small stocks, fast  changes and fast delivery. The market is showing rapid growth, particularly in the on-demand direct mail and  book segments. Sappi Fine Paper Europe launched TOP, a new digital toner paper range at the IPEX fair in Birmingham at the end  of May 2010. The range combines the best image reproduction with the specific digital functionalities needed for  optimum performance. The Sappi quality guarantee is backed by third party testing and the paper will be shortly  approved for use on the HP Indigo, Kodak NexPress and Canon imagePress systems. It will also be thoroughly  tested on Xerox systems. A new product, Jaz, which forms the basis of Sappi Fine Paper Europes inkjet product range, is currently in a  trial phase. Bling wins award at Asia Pacific Leather Fair  In March 2010, the Sappi Fine Paper North America Release Papers business received the Best Man-Made  Material Innovation Award at the Asia Pacific Leather Fair (APLF) – Materials, Manufacturing & Technology Trade  Show for our newest texture, Bling. This eye-catching, geometric texture brings dynamic movement to any  application. As one of the only five winners for this award category, this was a tremendous honour for Sappi given  that there were over 1,000 exhibitors from 48 countries and regions. North America – global winners of the Technical Innovation Awards Through a partnership with Kronospan, one of the worlds largest laminate flooring manufacturers, the North  American Release Papers business jointly invented and commercialised a revolutionary process to manufacture  a new decorative flooring product. The companies are jointly patenting the invention. Together, they turned a six- step process into a two-step process that now features an Ultracast component to produce a printed surface  with superior properties that is more environmentally-friendly at significantly lower costs. This innovation in turn  led to a new technical innovation (which Sappi has also patented) that allows us to manufacture textured films.  The substantial volume that we have secured with the flooring manufacturer is expected to result in an annual  business improvement of US$1.8 million. The Sappi team from manufacturing, R&D and sales were the global  winners of the internal Technical Innovation (TIA) Awards, aimed at stimulating, recognising and rewarding  innovation. Improving tree breeding efficiency Sappis tree improvement programmes in South Africa need to keep track of thousands of individual trees over  long generation cycles of between 8 to 15 years and through the many steps of tree breeding activities.  Mislabelling of individuals means that incorrect individuals are used for crosses, or are carried through into the  next generation of breeding or are used in seed orchards for operational seed production. The impact of this  mislabelling is dilution of genetic gain which can translate into less timber yield at harvest than predicted in original  breeding trials. In collaboration with the University of Pretoria, Sappis tree breeders at the Tweedie Research  Centre developed a reliable DNA fingerprinting tool to improve breeding efficiency. This project was the regional  winner of the annual TIA awards. 23  2010 sustainability report 23  24 Opus – satisfying customers  Opus helps us deliver great results and still stay within budget.

In 2010, Ogilvy Amsterdam won the prestigious award for its IBM Roi Rapido  campaign, designed to change perceptions of IBM as an expensive and  complex organisation. With a limited budget of 50,000, Ogilvy Amsterdam  employed direct mail and created the character of Roi Rapido, the incarnation  of result driven action. The Roi Rapido concept proved to be a fantastic way to open a new market,  achieving over 10% of new business leads from a mailing list of 400 IT  managers. The original revenue target was exceeded by more than 100% –  from 3,300,000 to 6,972,000 – and IBMs core message of cost efficiency  was reinforced, demonstrating that a limited budget combined with a clever  paper-based strategy can deliver exceptional results.

As a  company headquartered in South Africa, with significant assets and  people, BEE is an important component of our reputation and licence  to trade. In the first half of 2010, the shareholders of Sappi Limited approved a  BBBEE equity transaction involving the issuing of approximately 4,5%  (24,3 million shares) of the groups issued share capital, which translates  into the empowerment of 30% of Sappis South African business. The  total value of the transaction was ZAR814 million. The transaction recognises the contribution made to the company by  our South African employees; will help attract and retain staff and in  particular highly skilled black managers; and reinforces Sappis position  as a responsible corporate citizen within the communities where we  operate. Furthermore, the transaction accommodates the key principles  of BBBEE and maximises the ownership component in terms of the  Forest Sector Charter with Sappi moving from a Level Six Contributor  to a Level Three Contributor on the Charter scorecard. Sappi will  continue to focus on improving performance with regard to the other  scorecard criteria.  As many of our employees were first-time share owners, we rolled out  a communications campaign to educate them about the benefits of  share ownership in general as well as the specific details of the Sappi  scheme, known internally as Sefate (meaning to grow). The booklet  was made available in English, Xhosa, Zulu, Siswati and Tswana.

Report back: Prosperity continued   2010 sustainability report 27 Adding value to people and to the economy The pulp and paper industry contributes positively to increased wealth  and well being particularly in rural areas, both by contributing to forest  management and via its presence in the countryside. It directly supports  vital employment in rural areas which indirectly leads to the establishment  of infrastructure and services in these regions. South Africa The forestry sector directly employs 170,000 people and the pulp and  paper subsector provides approximately 13,200 direct and 10,700  indirect employment opportunities. Taking a conservative view of the  dependency ratio in rural areas, this means that the forestry sector  supports over 860,000 people1. Annually, forestry and forest products  contribute about 1.27% to GDP, with the value of forest products  exports increasing from ZAR9.5 billion in 2001 to ZAR14.8 billion  in 2008.2 Europe The industry provides direct employment for about 245,000 people, and  indirect employment to some 1.8 million people, 63% in rural areas.  The European pulp and paper industry has an annual turnover of  79 billion and a value add of 25 billion. It invests 4.7 billion per year,  with more than 10% specifically dedicated to direct environmental  protection.3  North America The industry accounts for approximately five percent of US manufac- turing GDP; is among the top 10 manufacturing employers in 48 states;  and employs nearly 900,000 people earning US$50 billion annually. In  addition, industry companies produce US$175 billion in products  annually.4  In the state of Maine, where our Westbrook and Somerset Mills are  situated, the paper industry is the backbone of Maines economy. In  2009, the industry contributed nearly US$900 million to Maines  economy. In total, the pulp and paper industry accounts for 22 percent  of all manufacturing wages in the state. In some communities, paper  mills represent 60 – 80 percent of total tax revenues.5  Value added statement for the year ended September 2010 One measure of wealth created is the amount of value added to the  cost of materials and services purchased.

Taking into account non-permanent  contractors, this means that the mill supports over 33,000  people (including own employees, contractors and dependants).6   28 Sappis integrated  mills use wood chips  to make the pulp  used in our  papermaking Report back: People  29  2010 sustainability report People Adding value to our people Global training spend in 2010 was US$9.8 million (2009: US$9.1 million), amounting to 12.7% of total employee costs. We recognise that there is a direct link between our people and our sustained business performance. Accordingly, our aim is to add value to our human  capital base by developing our employees skills and abilities and by providing them with opportunities to learn and develop. To determine the annual training and development agenda, a needs analysis is undertaken, underpinned by the performance management process.  Our approach to training and development is decentralised with each mill, function, business unit and region taking responsibility for training. Training  is broad and includes: Training spend (US$) and hours by category per employee per region  Management and  leadership development Comprises all training that  is associated with  management, supervisory  and leadership development Knowledge and capacity  building Comprises training that  enhances individuals   skills for current or future  positions for a best practice  organisation Skills programmes and  individual development Comprises formal  programmes/self-study   that have both practical and  theoretical components that  may lead to educational  qualifications Sappi World of Work   Comprises training that is  mandatory for legal, safety,  health, environment and  quality compliance n South Africa  3.7 hours  US$90 27.3 hours  US$164 41.8 hours  US$346 12.4 hours  US$147 n Europe  3.2 hours  US$85 14 hours  US$339 2.5 hours  US$55 5.5 hours  US$95 n North America  3.7 hours  US$32 10.6 hours  US$92 1.4 hours  US$12 30.3 hours  US$262 Performance indicators Objectives FY2010 Actual performance FY2010 Objectives FY2011   Targets set on training  hours and spend per  employee   Classify and report on training  in global categories   Each region has classified and  reported its training spend in terms  ofthe agreed training framework   Increased safety training and Adult  Basic Education and Training (ABET)   in SA   Continue to report globally in  terms of established  framework   Intensity focus on ABET   Sappi Leadership  Academy   Sappi Fine Paper North America  250 managers participated  inLeadership Excellence and  Development at Sappi (LEADS)  programme and the region also  conducted extensive sustainability  training of the sales force based  on the new eQ tool   Fifth SFPE 250 Leadership Academy  management and manufacturing  trainee programme started in April with  13 participants    In SA, nine conversations introduced  as supplementary leadership tool   We successfully continue to run a  situational leadership training module  across Europe, aimed at enabling  managers to adjust their leadership  style to the task   Support completion of 2-year  LEADS programme in NA   Roll out nine conversations  to lower level teams   Talent and succession  planning review   Report on talent pipeline   Talent reviews co-ordinated annually  and succession planning and talent  reviews bi-annually to the board   Improve the quality of the  talent review and succession  planning process Provide training and development opportunities  30 Valuing diversity As a global company, we employ a diverse workforce. We value this diversity, believing that it contributes to innovative thinking and our ability to service  diverse global markets. We strive to create a workplace free from discrimination and harassment, acknowledging and accepting differences among our  people with respect to age, class, ethnicity, gender, physical ability, race, sexual orientation, and spiritual practice.

The  survey identified certain areas of concern which we addressed in the  following ways: South Africa After analysing the data and focus group discussions, participants  designed their own action plans to adress their respective three top  areas of concern. A dipstick survey was conducted to measure  progress and impact of action plans. In addition, the region designed  and launched My Sappi attributes and behaviours in a branded  employee value proposition followed by a book containing stories  written by employees about their Sappi working experience. North America The region launched a two-year LEADS training programme and  conducted targeted site and departmental engagement activities. Europe Europe continued to invest in a high performance culture through re- vitalisation of the performance management process and training for  managers in performance management; leadership training for all  levels; and core communication and feedback skills for first line  managers. In addition, each of the mills defined three action steps they  will take to especially address the relatively lower levels of discretionary  effort for blue-collar workers. A toolkit was developed to explain in a  simpler way the purpose of the survey to the HR team, as well as how  to analyse the results, how to get to the root-cause as well as a library  of recommended action steps. Promoting wellbeing Globally, the Employee Wellbeing Programme includes various initiatives  and awareness programmes, eg substance abuse, cancer awareness  days, weight-loss programmes and awareness programmes related to  testing cholesterol, blood glucose, body mass index, blood pressure and,  in South Africa, HIV/AIDS. Focused interventions differ in each region. South Africa Using the statistics from our in-house medical aid scheme, we are able  to establish on an annual basis the health and wellbeing risks experienced  by employees and this helps develop our annual agenda. In addition to  fulfilling various awareness programmes, employee wellbeing practitioners  provided focused attention on the financial upskilling of employees to  address their financial wellbeing. Further effort was made in better  managing the reintegration of temporary and permanently disabled  employees in their return to work. Europe  Employee wellbeing in Europe is decentralised with each mill determining  their annual calendar activities based on their needs. Activities range from flu vaccinations and counselling for employees  whose wellbeing is affected by work or external factors, support of  employee sports and social activities to consultations with a dietician.  North America In 2010, the region rolled out a health risk assessment to obtain Sappi-  specific health risk data that is critical to the development of a  comprehensive wellness programme. Participation in wellness  programmes is shown to control the trend of medical plan utilisation,  thereby reducing the annual premium increases in the future. Survey  results received to date identified several key wellness risk areas  for Sappi employees and families. They are: weight, blood pressure,  stress and lack of physical activity. The two areas that we will focus on  in 2011 are weight loss and stress management initiatives.

Through key HIV prevention messages, the DoH   also encourages people to take proactive steps towards a healthy  lifestyle, irrespective of their HIV (or TB) status. In 2010, Sappi  participated in the campaign and partnerships were formed with the  DoH to encourage employees, contractors and partners to ensure they  know their HIV  status.  At Sappi on average more than 50% of the employees participated in  the campaigns with the participation at one mill being more than 90% for  the third year in a row. Special focus is given to the identification of the  external risks that could lead to an increase in the prevalence of HIV in  the company. One of the key internal risks is non-compliance with  medical protocols. In the past year, employee wellbeing layworkers  helped to promote compliance with medication. The initiatives described  here had a positive effect on the mortality rate of Sappi employees,  which, at 0.36% is the lowest in 12 years.

Nevertheless, we remain committed to the goals  of eliminating fatalities and lost time injuries and achieving constant  front of mind safety awareness for all employees and contractors. To  that end we have reviewed and requested improvements to our safety  management systems, including developing safety dashboards.    North America: There were no fatalities reported in FY2010. The  Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) however, increased due  mainly to minor strains and sprains. Renewed programmes have  been put in place to reduce such incidents. The strict policy on  contractor safety resulted in there being no contractor lost time  injuries for the year.   South Africa: The contractor LTIFR was the lowest ever recorded in  South Africa. Unfortunately, there were two fatalities in Sappi Forests  and one at Saiccor Mill.     In 2010 we instituted a web-based facility in Sappi Forests, the  Hannington Quality Management Software (HQMS) solution for  identifying and addressing the root causes of injuries. HQMS is  an integrated web-based SHEQ management system which is  inexpensive for contractors and has been well received and utilised,   allowing the the region to identify areas for improvement.    Europe: Safety performance improved for both contractors and  employees. Sadly, a Sappi Kirkniemi employee was fatally wounded.    Last year, we reported that our safety systems at Biberist, Kirkniemi  and Stockstadt Mills needed re-energising and that we would  engage with external consultants to strengthen safety programmes  at these mills. We progressed this at each mill:   –  Biberist Mill: external insurance consultants completed safety  audit, people with managerial responsibility from top management  Safety As a major manufacturing company,  safety is our number one priority. We are committed to creating a safe  workplace for employees and  contractors. down to machine operators were trained by the insurance  consultants on aspects such as safety understanding, risk analysis  and responsibilities. These consultants are tracking the integrated  safety programme on an ongoing basis.    –   Kirkniemi Mill: workplace risk assessments were conducted and  a culture of zero accidents was reinforced through safety talks  bysupervisors, the Global Safety Awareness Day and initiatives  conducted with the Finnish Zero Accident Forum. In the first  quarter of FY2011, the mill will launch the safety analysis risk  assessment (SARA) throughout the mill and will institute behaviour- based safety (BBS) programmes.   –  Stockstadt Mill: in May this year, the mill re-focused its safety  programme with the help of external consultants. First step was  an in-depth safety analysis of all areas in the mill, achieved through  both interviews and inspections. Second step was to implement a  workgroup to define measurements to improve safety performance  based on the results of the external safety analysis report. Going  forward, the mills main focus will be on the clear setting and  communication of safety targets, reorganising function and work  of safety experts in all departments and the start of behaviour- based safety work audits.   34 Sappi Fine Paper North America launches eQ Tool In 2010, Sappi Fine Paper North America launched its eQ Tool – an interactive  web-based tool that allows users to explore a full range of factors behind choosing  a sustainable paper. The eQ Tool illustrates Sappis industry-leading approach  to carbon management, explores the best use of recycled fibre, and brings to life  our progress in forest certification and waste reduction. The environmental  performance of a paper supplier is an increasingly relevant and critical factor in  choosing a product brand. The eQ Tool provides stakeholders with the foundation  to engage with the broader environmental considerations when choosing a paper  supplier. The eQ tool also provides users with the ability to generate a customised  product statement that summarises the environmental benefits of choosing Sappi  Fine Paper North Americas papers for a print job. The region publishes the eQ  journal which covers a broad range of sustainability topics. Green Ambassador programme extended  in South Africa Sappi ReFibre (previously Sappi Waste Paper), has extended its Green  Ambassador programme, initiated in 2009, by awarding Green Ambassador  Accreditation status to acknowledge companies, organisations and individuals  who are truly making an effort to recycle. Participants have to actively implement  recycling and a Sappi recycling agent has to be linked to the recycling initiative  to service the project. The volume of recyclables collected must be measured  and reported to determine the success and impact of the project while  participants also have to undergo training on the basic principles of recycling.  Ilanga Mall in Mpumalanga was the first shopping complex in South Africa to be  awarded Sappis Green Ambassador Accreditation status.

The aim of the campaign was to bring in more books than  there are Sappi employees and this was achieved with over 4,000 new and used  books being sent to nine non-profit organisations in the communities where our  sites are located.  We adopt a participatory approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by identifying the needs of  communities surrounding our operations, consulting with them and then tailoring specific programmes to meet  their identified needs.

Sappi employees in North America donated books to local schools  36 One of the greatest benefits to  Sappis paper, paper packaging and  chemical cellulose is that the wood  fibre is derived from sustainable and  renewable resources Report back: Planet  37  2010 sustainability report Planet Promoting biodiversity by planting trees Europe In 2010, over 40 staff at Sappis office in Brussels, Belgium, participated  in planting 1,250 trees in the Sonian Forest to celebrate World Forestry  Day. The aim was to create wildlife corridors and enhance biodiversity  locally. South Africa In 2008, Sappi Limited and car manufacturer Volvo South Africa  established a joint initiative GreenForBlue, whereby Volvo drivers are  encouraged to sponsor the planting of indigenous trees for each Volvo  car bought to mitigate the emissions of harmful gas from engines.  GreenForBlue trees are planted on Sappis lands, including land near  roadsides and between plantations, ensuring that they will be properly  looked after. GreenForBlue is linked to Sappis Sandisa Imvelo (Growing  Nature) campaign. Sandisa Imvelo oversees the planting of trees which are sourced from  the Trees for Fees programme of the Wildlands Conservation Trust.  This operates a series of a social development projects that help  communities. Disadvantaged children in rural communities grow the  seedlings and then barter the trees for food, clothes, bicycles and other  basic necessities. North America Over the past 150 years, there has been a sharp decline in native nut  bearing hardwood trees in Americas Midwest due to over harvesting,  flooding and disease. As part of Sappi Fine Paper North Americas  continued commitment to the environment and sustainable forestry,  in 2010 we provided free, two-year-old oak seedlings to our merchants  located in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Minnesota, Kentucky and  Wisconsin. The tree giveaway is part of The Million Trees Project, sponsored by  Living Lands & Waters, a nonprofit environmental organisation that  works to protect, preserve and restore Americas major rivers and  watersheds. The MillionTrees Projects goal is to grow one million trees  in the Midwest within the next five to ten years.

In  South Africa and Europe, we have decided to use the Forestry Industry  Carbon Assessment Tool (FICAT). This comprehensive methodology  was co-developed by the National Council for Air and Stream  Improvement (NCASI) and the Confederation for European Paper  Industries (CEPI) and uses the CEPI Ten Toes approach to provide  scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) information. We have completed  carbon footprints for our South African and European operations and  will complete carbon footprints for products manufactured in these  regions in 2011. In North America, we report on direct and indirect (scope 1 and 2), but  not scope 3 emissions. We are monitoring the development of two new  standards from the development of two new standards from the World  Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council on  Sustainable Development including the: Product Life Cycle Accounting  and Reporting Standard and Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting  Standards. Going forward, we will engage with the American Forest &  Paper Association (AF & PA) and other resources to develop industry- specific guidance on Scope 3 emission. The black liquor produced in is Sappis integrated mills is all renewable  and this is the dominant fuel for Sappis operations (30.7%). Own  renewable fuel does not fall within the EN-3 definition for direct fuel, but  is included here for its relevance to Sappis energy self-sufficiency. As it is  a biomass-derived fuel, it promotes reduced consumption of fossil fuels  with a concomitant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. The next most  dominant fuel is coal, used extensively in SA. The decreasing trend in coal  use is due to Gratkorn Mill which converted from coal use to gas. This is  shown by a corresponding increase in gas usage.  The increase in purchased steam is due to its use in Biberist Mill which was  acquired by Sappi in 2009 as well as Cape Kraft Mill, which converted from  coal-fired boilers to purchased steam. The decrease in own renewable fuel  in 2010 was due to the closure of Usutu Mill, responsible for approximately  4 million GJ/annum. The declining trend in purchased HFO is due to our NA  mills replacing HFO with purchased biomass. Own renewable fuel does not  fall within the EN-3 definition for direct fuel, but is included here for its  relevance to Sappis sustainability. As this definition includes biomass- derived fuel, it indicates the extent to we are able to generate our own fuel  and hence reduce our consumption of fossil fuels.  Note: Black liquor is the spent cooking liquor from the kraft process which results  when pulpwood is digested into paper pulp by removing lignin, hemicellulose and  other extractives from the wood to free the cellulose fibres. The resulting black  liquor is an aqueous solution of lignin residues, hemicellulose, and the inorganic  chemicals used in the process. Black liquor contains more than half of the energy  content of the wood fed into the digester.

We are in discussions  with Eskom to sell additional power from Ngodwana Mill. Other cogeneration opportunities we are currently examining in the  region include:   A project at Lomati sawmill to use waste wood (currently 47,000  tons) for cogeneration and condensing power;   A combined cycle gas turbine at Tugela Mill which would ultimately  result in the mill being independent of Eskom;   The utilisation of bark as a fuel for a new cogeneration project at  Saiccor Mill to generate more steam and electrical power, making  the mill less dependent on coal and more energy self-sufficient  (current level of energy self-sufficiency: 44%). The prefeasibility study  will be concluded by the end of December 2010. In South Africa we are looking at a number of  biofuel projects, including the collection of biomass  currently left in-field after harvesting for use as a  fuel source and in the creation of wood pellets. Improving our energy efficiency and lowering  our carbon footprint in North America As part of our commitment to investing in our assets, continuous  improvement and operating sustainably, Sappi Fine Paper North  Americas capex spend of US$36.3 million on the recovery circuit  enabled the Somerset Mill to increase the utilisation of black liquor, a  renewable fuel generated as a by-product of the pulping process. This  increase in black liquor utilisation is equivalent to the energy contained  in 100,000 barrels of oil per year. In the process we will lower costs,  improve energy efficiency and further reduce our carbon footprint as  well as increase pulp production. Note: Unless otherwise indicated, all data is given in specific form. This means that the actual quantity during the year indicated, whether energy,  water, emissions or solid waste, is expressed in terms of a production parameter. For Sappi, as with other pulp and paper companies, the  parameter is air dry tons (adt) of product. (The term tons is used in this report to denote a metric ton of 1,000 kg). Key CO2  = Carbon dioxide SF6 = Sulphur hexafluoride CH4 = Methane N2O = Nitrous oxide HFCs = Hydrofluorocarbons PFCs = Perfluorocarbons  For Sappi, purchased power and steam are the only energy types that  fall under the indirect energy category. The values for North America are  very low since they generate most of their power needs internally (85.1%),  consequently requiring very little purchased power and no purchased steam. The negative  gures for indirect emissions for Europe and North America  are due to the fact that these mills sold more power to their respective grids  than they purchased. The decline in global direct emissions is a measure of  greater fuel ef ciency.   Our carbon footprint  40 Promoting forest certification in North America Winning the SFI Presidents Award Third party forest certification has long been a challenge for about  10 million family forest owners who account for more than 60 percent  of private forest lands. Many are not certified because they lack  resources and certification is not economically feasible. Sappi, in  collaboration with two of our key customers, Time Inc and Hearst  Corporation, and two of our competitors, formed a partnership to help  small- and medium-sized landowners in Maine achieve third-party forest  certification the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and the American  Tree Farm System (ATFS). In 2010, the partnership received the SFI Presidents award for making  forest certification more accessible. Sappi Fine Paper North Americas sustainable forestry programme  achieves FSC group certification In June 2009, Sappi Fine Paper North America launched the Sustainable  Forestry Programme. Operating from Skowhegan, Maine, the programme  is comprised of a team of highly trained forest professionals, including  licenced foresters, dedicated to assisting woodlot owners in the state  of Maine to develop and manage their woodlots for the future. The  programme offers a variety of services to help landowners statewide  develop a forest management plan, determine the value of their woodlot,  conduct timber harvests that plan for the future while maximising return,  and also assist with wildlife management and aesthetics. In the year under review, the programme was certified as Forest  Stewardship Council (FSC) Group Managers in terms of the FSCs  Small and Low Intensity Managed Forests certificate. This initiative is  designed to help small and private landowners access and retain FSC  forest management chain of custody certification on smaller tracts of  land. Our programme can help landowners with the process of getting  their woodlot certified to the Forest Stewardship Council standard. Group certification in South Africa In South Africa, our own owned, managed and leased  plantations are 100% FSC-certified. However FSC certification  for small growers such as those participating in Project Grow,  our tree-farming scheme for subsistence farmers, is still a  challenge. A group scheme developed by the FSC was tested  by ourselves and other members of the industry but proved to  be unworkable. As part of the process to develop a South  African FSC standard currently underway, a separate small low  intensity managed forests (SLIMF) initiative is being developed,  but it is unclear when it will be ready to roll out.

Reduce solid waste and improve water quality Increases in water consumption for 2009 were the result of decreased  production – when production stops or slows, water still has to be consumed  to keep machines running. In 2010, with production having increased,  speci c water consumption decreased and the reducing trend prior to 2009  continued. Note: Water consumption by source is detailed in our expanded  sustainability report at www.sappi.com Sending solid waste to land ll is the least favourable method of disposal as  land lls generate methane, a greenhouse gas with approximately 21 – 23  times the global warming potential of CO2. We have reduced the amount  of solid waste to land ll over three years by 44%. Weve achieved this by  combusting solid waste for heat gain, sending boiler ashes for brick making  and giving lime mud to farmers. In Europe, only inert material may be  land lled (ashes, sorted inorganic building rubble, etc).     Innovative solutions for fibre sludge In South Africa, we are examining the use of fibre sludge at Tugela Mill  to produce a long-burning carbonised briquette capable of burning for  up to eight hours. The briquettes could prove to be extremely beneficial  to the informal market in particular. In this market, an estimated four  million SA households still rely on unprocessed fuels such as coal and  firewood and, in addition, a significant percentage of households rely on  paraffin for cooking, heating and lighting. The benefits of this project  include enhanced revenue, minimisation of a waste stream (fibre sludge)  which otherwise goes to landfill (diverting the waste stream helps to  minimise the methane emissions associated with landfill), reduced GHG  emissions by lower income households and the health benefits  associated with the elimination of GHGs and reduced use of paraffin. Helping farmers and reducing landfill At our Cloquet Mill in North America, we identified an opportunity  to beneficially use lime mud and boiler ash (byproducts from our  production process). Through a collaboration with the University of  Minnesota Carlton County Extension Agency, Sappi and the Agency  assist local farmers to use these lime mud and boiler ash to improve the  soil characteristics which in turn improve crop yields. Annually, we  distribute 25,000 to 30,000 tons of these byproducts to local farmers  in the Cloquet area, saving them over US$1 million per year in soil  amendments, while significantly reducing our landfill volumes. Southern African mills generally have high ef uent COD as the legislation  is not as stringent as in the other regions, particularly Europe. Saiccor Mill  is a special case and does not treat its ef uent. Its ef uent COD levels are  signi cantly higher, approaching the 1,000 kg/adt. Its data is excluded.  Generally all regions except SA experienced a drop in COD levels.  As with COD, SA mills generally have higher TSS in their ef uent streams.  The data for Saiccor Mill has been excluded. TSS in this region is 30 – 40 kg/ adt. The increase for NA for 2010 resulted from larger than normal TSS levels  for Somerset Mill. These resulted from excessive secondary sludge build up  in the treatment pond. This has now been attended to.   42 Report back: Planet continued Performance indicators Objectives FY2010 Actual performance FY2010 Objectives FY2011   Use of post-consumer  and post-industrial  waste   Continue to meet customer  needs for products containing  post-consumer and  post-industrial waste    Production of new Triple Green tissue  and Masuga text grade at Stanger Mill  in SA and Algro Nature in Europe    Globally, use of recycled fibre  increased by 9.2%    Review product offering in  relation to customer needs  Promote the recovery and use of recycled fibre Sappi Waste Paper becomes Sappi ReFibre In September 2010, Sappi Waste Paper was re-named and re-launched as Sappi ReFibre. Based on a business  model that draws on and empowers an extensive network of independent agents around the country, the division  is leading the development of innovative models to facilitate the recycling of paper and the minimisation of waste. Sappi ReFibre procures board and paper for recycling from its agents, who source it directly from homes, offices,  wholesalers and retailers, as well as from manufacturers in both the formal and informal sectors. Many of our  papers contain recycled fibres, and Cape Kraft Mill uses only recovered paper and board in its manufacturing  process. Triple Green tissue products launched Stanger Mill in South Africa is one of only a few mills in the world that uses bagasse (sugar cane waste) as its  primary source of pulp. The Triple Green range of fine paper has built up substantial brand equity amongst  environmentally-conscious end-users. The mill, which is already a leading manufacturer of virgin tissue wadding  products has entrenched the Triple Green brand further with its range of Triple Green tissue products launched in  July 2010. The range offers all the desirable characteristics of good tissue products such as whiteness, softness  andabsorbency. Fully compostable coated paper launched in Europe Sappi Fine Paper Europe recently launched Algro Nature, a one-side coated paper with fully renewable organic  raw material content which is officially certified as compostable. Algro Nature is a one-side coated paper grade  with much better on-shelf appearance compared to uncoated papers. The binding agents in the coating pigments  used for Algro Nature originate from entirely vegetable sources. Developing the product was challenging: One of the main advantages coated papers have over uncoated papers  for packaging applications is their excellent gravure printability. This allows for high quality reproduction of photos  and fine printing screens but requires a very smooth and flexible surface. As vegetable-based binding agents are  normally very brittle, it took more than half a year of laboratory testing to achieve the good printing level that Algro  Nature now offers. The packaging is suitable for all kinds of flexible packaging application: high quality wrappers, sachets, inner liners  and flexible pouches. A new avenue of use is in the catering business, for example at open-air events. The  compostable packaging can be thrown away with the food remains. This is not only environmentally-friendly but  also highly practical because the waste does not need to be separated. Similarly, with packaging in stores – if fruit  or vegetables get too old, they can be composted together with their packaging. The paper is currently offered in  grammages of 50, 60 and 70g/m .

Examples of these include: Vietnams discriminatory tariffs in favour of  ASEAN producers and Israels anti-dumping investigations against recycled containerboard and fine papers  produced in Europe. The European Commission imposed provisional anti-dumping duties with respect to imports  of coated woodfree paper from China with effect from 18 November 2010. The duties range from 19.7% to 39.1%. North America In September 2009, Sappi, together with two of its competitors and the USW1 filed unfair trade cases, with the  Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging that certain coated paper from  China and Indonesia had been dumped and subsidised by considerable margins, resulting in injury to the  domestic industry and its employees.  During October 2010 the ITC imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imported coated sheet paper  from Indonesia and China. The duties, which range from 25.2% to 313.8% are expected to re-establish a level  playing field in the United States.  Focusing on renewable energy In South Africa, as around the world, there is increasing emphasis on renewable energy. In March 2009, the  National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) announced and approved the landmark renewable-energy  feed-in-tariff (REFIT2) guidelines, which included wind, small hydropower, landfill gas and concentrating solar  power (CSP). Biomass was initially excluded, but solid biomass (ie 100% forest wood and solid fuel, ie pellets and  bricks produced as a result of physical processing of municipal waste) was subsequently included in REFIT,  published in 2010. Sappi engaged with NERSA with a view to broadening the definition of solid biomass to include   black liquor, sugar bagasse, residue from mill waste and all forms of invader bush. This was not achieved which  means that we are unable to use REFIT to capitalise on opportunities such as black liquor, on site renewable waste  such as bark and fibre and new projects or investments such as upgrades to existing assets such as boilers. We continue to engage with NERSA and await further developments. 1.  The United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied  Industrial and Service Workers International Union (United Steelworkers or  USW) is the largest industrial labour union in North America, with over 700,000  members. 2.  REFIT is a mechanism to promote the deployment of renewable energy that  places an obligation on speci c entities to purchase the output from qualifying  renewable energy generators at pre-determined prices.

Benchmark (in alphabetical order) Sappis application of benchmark Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Representing over 500 investors with US$64 trillion under  management, the CDP is the largest repository of greenhouse gas  data anywhere in the world. As our primary listing is in South Africa, we participate in the South  African CDP. We have participated in the CDP since it was first launched  in South Africa in 2007. In 2010 we were included in the Gold Leadership  Index of the South African Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) on the basis  of our carbon disclosure and mitigation strategies. Dow Jones World Sustainability Index (DJSI World)  Tracks the financial performance of the leading sustainability  companies to provide asset managers with reliable, objective  benchmarks to manage sustainability-related investment portfolios. We were invited to participate in this index in 2010. We improved our  score to 71% compared with the sector average of 64%. We have  considered key learning points from the exercise and are using some of  these to drive our sustainability initiatives. GRI G3 indicators  The GRI guidelines are indicators that are used internationally to  assess sustainability performance. Launched in 2006, the G3  guidelines are the so-called Third Generation of the GRIs  reporting guidelines.  We began the process of formally reporting in terms of the G3 guidelines  in 2007. In 2009 we declared ourselves as an A level reporter and have  done so again this year – in both years, our rating has been confirmed  by the GRI. JSE Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Index  Launched in May 2004, the JSEs SRI Index was the first of its kind  in a developing market. It has been a driver for increased attention  to responsible investment into emerging markets like South Africa. We have been included in the index every year since inception. In 2008,  we were recognised as one of the top performers on the Index. UN Declaration of Human Rights  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone  document in the history of human rights. Drafted by representatives  with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the  world, the Declaration was proclaimed by the United Nations  General Assembly in Paris on 10 December 1948 as a common  standard of achievements for all peoples and all nations.  Our commitment to the principles of this declaration has always been  inherent in all our policies and practices, but in 2009 we formalised this  commitment with the adoption of a policy on human rights.  Commitment to the Declaration has also been established in our supplier  policy, which also makes use of the following external reference points:   International Labour Organisation Core Labour Standards   International Standards Organisation 9001 (ISO 9001)   International Standards Organisation 14001 (ISO 14001)   Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 18001  (OHSAS 18001)   OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises   United Nations Global Compact UN Global Compact This is a chief executive officer-led strategic policy initiative which  gives signatories a platform for advancing their commitment to  sustainability and corporate actions. The Compact has two  principal objectives: mainstream the ten principles which  businesses commit to and catalyse actions in support of broader  UN goals, including the Millennium Development goals. We joined the UN Global Compact in 2008 and reported in accordance  with the ten principles since then. Our report for 2010 can be found  at www.sappi.com.   Recognised as one of the 20 most GRI-compliant companies in South Africa in a survey assessing 399  companies conducted by Sustainability Services.   Included in the Gold Leadership Index of the South African Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) on  the basis of our carbon disclosure and mitigation strategies.   Cloquet Mill received one of the 2009-2010 Minnesota Governors Awards for Pollution Prevention for work  in reducing the mills impact on community odour.   Sappi Fine Paper North America Release Papers Business received the Best Man-Made Material Innovation Award at  the Asia Pacific Leather Fair (APLF) – Materials, Manufacturing & Technology Trade Show for our newest texture, Bling.   Recognised as a top performer on the JSEs SRI (Socially Responsible Investment) Index in 2009.   A partnership in which Sappi Fine Paper North America is involved received the SFI Presidents Award for making forest  certification more accessible.  Paper specifications Acronyms This report is produced on Magno Satin, one of the worlds most  widely speci ed papers. We used Magno Satin 150g/m2 produced  at Gratkorn Mill in Austria for the text and Magno Satin 250g/m2  produced at Maastricht Mill in The Netherlands for the cover. As a group, one of Sappis key strategic goals is to reduce our  carbon footprint by improving energy ef ciency levels and decreasing  our reliance on fossil fuel. The combined heat and power (CHP)  generation plant at Gratkorn Mill which came on stream in mid-2007  highlights the success of this approach. The plant has resulted in  decreasing coal usage by 10% – 20%, reducing CO2 emissions by  5% – 10% and increasing the use of biofuels by 5% – 10%. Excess  electric power generated is sold to the public grid. Maastricht Mill only operates on natural gas and its highly ef cient  gas-steam combined heat and power (CHP) plant sells surplus  electricity to the local grid as well as heat for heating and cooling  municipal and resident buildings and a local shopping centre. The  mill minimises its carbon footprint further by shipping in raw materials,  including market pulp, pigments and  llers, by barge. The installation of an anaerobic reactor to Gratkorn Mills waste water  treatment plant in 2009 has reduced the chemical oxygen demand  (COD) of the ef uent and increased the production of biogas. During  the anaerobic biological process, special micro-organisms transform  the organic load in the wastewater into biogas. The process has  economic value, as the biogas is used for heat and power generation  and sludge disposal costs are reduced. Sappi was the  rst paper company in Europe to hold chain-of- custody certi cation for its entire European operations under  both the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme  for the Endorsement of Forest Certi cation (PEFC) schemes.  Gratkorn and Maastricht Mills are also ISO 9001, ISO 14001  and EMAS (Eco Management and Audit system certi ed).
