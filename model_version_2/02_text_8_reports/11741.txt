Our other tree visions are:  2) Hartmanns wants at least to be among the top five players in DK on core markets.   3) Hartmanns wants to be acknowledged as the leading opinion-led company on core markets.  4) Hartmanns wants to get awarded by Great places to work.    2.2.1 VALUE-BASED MANAGEMENT  Hartmanns practises a system of value-based management.  We laid down our values together in 2001, and have since then applied them to three main areas:      Our customers and partners    Our candidates    Internal    Our values have become an integral part of our internal processes, recruitment, interviews and decision-  making process.  Hartmanns is an opinion-led company – and we expect our customers to live up to our ethical standards, values and  attitudes – and that our partnerships with customers are subject to the values we list below.  We define our values as:    Mutual respect:  We believe in respect for individuals, and treat all our candidates as equals.  We believe that everyone HAS something to contribute to the job market we are part of, regardless of background,  ethnicity, age, culture, sex or social standing.  We believe that everyone MUST contribute to the job market we are part of.  We expect our working relationships to be based on mutual respect.    Partnering:  We want to be a true partner to our candidates and customers, and believe that partnerships sharing knowledge create  results.  We want to be a loyal sparring partner in good times and bad.  Good internal cooperation creates results for our customers.    Creating results:   Our goal in any relationship and assignment is to create results for our customers and candidates.  As such, it is our duty to turn down assignments if we believe our clients are able to achieve a better result using oth- ers.  We will achieve the goals we set ourselves with respect to all individuals.  We believe that competent and quality-conscious personnel are essential to be able to achieve results.     Innovation:  Our personnel are expected to think out of the box when it comes to creating results for our customers.  We believe that personal freedom encourages commitment, optimism and innovation.  We work with a flat organisational structure that supports flexibility and new ideas.  Our goal is to be a trendsetter in our industry for personnel and jobs.      2.2.2 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ETHICAL GUIDELINES  Hartmanns believes that as a recruitment company, we have a major responsibility for an expansive and varied job  market. As such, it is our duty to evaluate candidates with no regard to their ethnic background, social standing, politi- cal views, sex or age.  Hartmanns applies this policy towards its customers and own personnel, where we emphasise a wide spread of exper- tise.  Hartmanns has been a member of the voluntary organisation Netvrk Storkbenhavn Socialt Ansvar (network  Greater Copenhagen, social responsibility) since 2002. A network of private and public companies working towards  greater awareness of social responsibility in business life.  Hartmanns has worked closely with organisations such as local authorities on projects designed to help the unem- ployed get back onto the job market, including refugees and immigrants.  Hartmanns expects its customers and partners to represent, and reflect the same attitudes towards an expansive and  varied job market.     2.2.3 EMPLOYEES, DIVERSITY AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  Hartmanns today consists of 110 qualified staff who, upon hiring, have all signed a declaration to adhere to our inter- nal policies, including our written policy for diversity and social responsibility. This policy is also published in our  internal staff handbook and our Intranet:      The view of Hartmanns is that, as second actor, temp agency and recruitment partner, we must reflect the job  market in which we work. Thus, it is a part of Hartmanns staff policy to reflect diversity:    Hartmanns view is that, as a recruitment company, we have a significant shared responsibility for the open  and diverse labour market.    Thus, it is our duty to work with candidates without regard to their ethnic background, social circumstances,  political views, gender and age.    Hartmanns practices these views in relation to our customers as well as our staff, where we emphasise a  DIVERSITY AT HARTMANNS:  Hartmanns employees range from the ages of 19-68.  There is an equal distribution of men and women on all levels of the company, including the managerial  level.  Hartmanns typically has two trainees on staff at a time.  About 5% of our staff has a non-Danish ethnic background.  Hartmanns regularly has candidates in traineeships, staff on wage subsidies and/or flexible jobs for people  with a reduced ability to work.   broad distribution of competencies.    Since 2002, Hartmanns has been a member of the voluntary Greater Copenhagen Social Responsibility Net- work, a network of private and public companies that works to promote social responsibility in the business  community.    2.3 HARTMANNS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN RELATION TO         THE CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT  In accordance with its signing of the UN Global Compact, Hartmanns pledges to protect nature, the climate and the  environment, so that societal development can be carried out sustainably and with respect for the living conditions of  humans and the conservation of animal and plant species.    2.3.1 ABOUT HARTMANNS AND THE CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT:  Hartmanns has a written environmental policy:      Hartmanns founded its safety organisation in 2007.    2.3.2 SAFETY INFORMATION/COMMUNICATION  Information is distributed via safety bulletin boards in each division, as well as via the Intranet. To make the informa- tion as accessible as possible and to avoid unnecessary time consumption in connection with searching for informa- tion, the bulletin boards will contain all relevant information. It is possible to suggest safety, working environment and  environmental improvements on the safety bulletin boards.     2.3.3 WORKPLACE RISK ASSESSMENT (WPV):  All safety representatives have completed/passed the working environment course required by law (previously known  as the 9 course).  Then, a workplace risk assessment is performed, in which all staff take an electronic survey that is used as the basis  for individual improvement initiatives. WPV is a 3-year process which, in principle, is ongoing and is intended to  ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY  Hartmanns strives to work for a better environment and working environment and will grant environ- mental, health and safety considerations the highest priority in our decision making processes.  We will take into consideration environmental protection and the working environment for the benefit of  our employees, customers, candidates, partners and our surrounding community. We see employees as  our most important resource.  This means that we:    Ensure that our managers assume responsibility for the environment and working environment  and, in collaboration with the safety organisation, ensure that working environment considera- tions are integrated into our daily work.    Continually work on environmental and working environment improvements.     Train and motivate our staff to assume responsibility and act in relation to issues that affect our  colleagues and customers safety.     Adhere to laws, permit regulations and the requirements of public authorities.     Openly discuss our environmental and working environment policy and efforts.   secure an optimal working environment. The WPV showed a generally positive view of the physical and mental work- ing environment.  2.3.4 ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS   As mentioned previously, Hartmanns and our activities do not make a significant impact on the environment. How- ever, environmental conditions are an important issue and our influence on the environment is continually examined  and discussed.  We have identified our primary sources of pollution as follows:    CO2 emissions – from computers, electrical installations and company cars    Paper waste – from normal office operations and non-digital use of documents    Recycling of computers, monitors and servers  Hartmanns has taken the following specific environmental initiatives:    An ongoing replacement of computers with thin clients and parachutes, thereby reducing our electricity con- sumption significantly. Hartmanns had in 2006 a total of 580 computers, of which 380  were thin clients. In  2011 Hartmanns has 850 computers of which 845 are thin clients.    Since December 2006, all computers in all of Hartmanns divisions have been shut down centrally at 19:00.  Thus, our equipment does not run all night long.     Since 2006, all newly purchased IT equipment has fulfilled EU requirements for environmental waste.    Used paper is sorted in separate waste bins for recycling.    Work is being done to implement a procedure to significantly reduce our consumption of paper.    2.4 FURTHER WORK IN RELATION TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT:  As with the previous topic, a large share of the 10 principles are already an integrated part of Hartmanns everyday  work, not least because of the long-standing cooperation with the Danish state and municipalities, as well as member- ship of the Greater Copenhagen Social Responsibility Network since 2002.  After signing the Global Compact, Hartmanns will continue its work in the following three primary areas:  1. To the degree deemed expedient, we will revise our business operations so that the Global Compact principles  become a part of the strategy and everyday activities. In fact, Hartmanns already operates in accordance with  all of the Global Compacts principles and must now simply elaborate on these principles in its future strat- egy.    2. We will promote the Global Compact principles publically via press releases, presentations, website, etc.  Within a short time, Hartmanns will publically announce its support of the Global Compact principles on our  website, in addition to broadly incorporating communication of the principles in our external communications.  3. We will describe how Hartmanns operates according to the principles of the Global Compact in practice, via  the progress report entitled Communication and Progress, which will be submitted no later than two years  after joining and then once annually thereafter. We have already established a working group for this project,  with Executive Secretary Nina Cordth serving as Project Manager.
