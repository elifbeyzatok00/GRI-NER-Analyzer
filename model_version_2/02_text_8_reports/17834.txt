Contact Point: Muallem A. Choudhury Executive Director ACI Limited 245,Tejgaon I/A, Dhaka, Bangladesh E-mail: edfp@aci-bd.com  In a country like Bangladesh where per capita income is  only US $1400, getting a job means not only ensuring  his/her better living condition but also ensuring educa- tion and health facilities for the children and the family.  Bangladesh is a developing country starving to achieve  the status of middle income country by accelerating the  economic growth and poverty alleviation. It has experi- enced a solid average annual growth of 6.3 percent be- tween 2004 and 2008. In fiscal  year 2009, despite the  global financial crisis, Bangladesh recorded 5.9 percent  real GDP growth.  In 2011 the GDP growth  rate increased to 6.7 per- cent. Three fifths of Bang- ladeshis are employed in  the agriculture sector and  three quarters of exports  revenue comes from gar- ments industry. For a  country like Bangladesh,  employment is the key  tool for bringing economic  growth and reducing pov- erty.  Since its establishment,  ACI has been working for the socio-economic develop- ment of the country by taking initiatives to improve the  quality of life of the common people. ACI constantly en- deavors to behave as a responsible entity and in this re- gards, ACI considers employ- ment generation as a major ini- tiative to improve the economic  condition of the people. Aided  by this philosophy, ACI invested  in pharmaceuticals, consumer  brands, agribusiness and retail  chain business. Through the es- tablishment of new enterprises,  ACI creates job opportunities for  people of the country. ACI con- siders the development of differ- ent entities i.e. urban and rural  community development,  women  empowerment  and youth development  through the massive em- ployment generation pro- gram. ACI not only generates  employment but also cre- ates better working envi- ronment for the employ- ees. It successfully pro- vided a secured work  place for both male and  female employees. ACI believes in the talent of all em- ployees. So it motivates, encourages and appreciates  the new and creative ideas of employees.

An in-house training of total 464 man-hours was pro- vided to the factory employees on Fire and Safety awareness. The  program includes the usage of fire extinguishers, its placement identi- fication, possible sources of fire and safety measures. Written and oral  assessment on fire and safety awareness and first aid treatment was  also conducted among all work- ers. ACI always considers its employ- ees as the most important stake- holder. It arranges continuous  health related programs for the  healthy life of their employees. It  organized seminar on Infection  by Hepatitis B viral and Preven- tion for it and the motive of  these programs was to create  health awareness among the em- ployees. Other activities like  blood test and vaccination were  also conducted among the em- ployees. Global Hand Washing Day is a campaign for raising awareness among the  people regarding washing hands with soap and hand wash to protect  people from diseases. In appreciation of the concern for health and hy- giene, Bangladesh celebrates Global Hand Washing day with school going  children and their parents and thus raising awareness among the commu- nity at large. ACI, in conjunction with Smiling Sun Franchise Program (SSFP), arranged  an awareness program of hand washing with soap and hand wash to cele- brate Global Hand Washing Day held on 15 October 2011. Through the  association of SSFP, ACI distributed Savlon hand wash and bar soap  among the all divisional school. Advisory leaflet has also been distributed  to inform children the proper way of washing hand and protect them- selves from diseases. Through SSFP and its 323 static clinics, a total of 1  million people washed hands in appropriate way. Page 3 Raising Awareness among Employees for  Healthy and Safe Life Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection  of internationally proclaimed human rights Celebration of the Global Hand-Wash day Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges  ACI has been working in the rural areas of Bangladesh to provide community development services where poverty,  unemployment, malnutrition and other health related problems are outrageous. Adopt-a-Village is an initiative of  ACI to meet the basic needs for community development, improve living standards; endow better education, alter- native income, health care, fresh water supply and proper sanitation. In 2008, ACI initiated Adopt-a-Village pro- gram endeavoring to improve the economic and social condition of some of the most remote parts of Bangladesh.  There are some stirring factors which motivate ACI to participate in the CSR activities and inaugurate the project.  The stirring factors are:  Continuing ACIs operation as a responsible corporate citizen of the country  Improving the living standard of the people by using ACIs core competencies from different business  sectors like Pharmaceuticals, consumer and commodity products, and Agribusinesses.  Motivating the villagers to improve their fate on self-help basis; where ACI only works as a catalyst,  standing beside the villagers to assist them to change their own fortune  Achieving the trust of the customers to build good corporate image of ACI and uphold strong relation- ship to increase customer loyalty. In 2008 ACI inaugurated its adopt-a- village program as a pilot project in Gho- napara, a village in the district of Gopal- gonj. ACI has taken many initiatives to  solve the major problems of the people  of Ghonapara village. A base line survey  was conducted to rectify the major issues  causing intensive problem to the villag- ers. 2009 was a significant year when ACI  did its strategic planning to make the  project sustainable. In 2010 and 2011,  ACI took many actions for implementing the plans. After the end of the year 2011, ACI has successfully done an  evaluation to find out the effectiveness of the project. Guided by the philosophy  of using ACIs competence in different fields,  following programs were conducted during the period with the help of   ACIs own people and expertise. Health Care Services: ACI Pharmaceutical, a business unit of ACI limited,   provided massive health care service to the village people of Ghonapara  through medical camps. Different medical camps were conducted with  different agendas and for different diseases. Medical Camp on general disease and eye problem was an eminent ini- tiative of ACI. Many people suffer or even die because of lack of aware- ness and lack of access to the medical services. Free medical camp there- fore creates an opportunity for people to avail the quality service and   get health education. The key objectives of the medical camp on general  diseases and eye problem are to improve access to primary health care  among needy people and to treat minor, common illnesses. Through this  medical camp, people of Ghonapara got specialized consultation and  counseling about health care and get health education also.

Nearly half of the population with diabetes is un- diagnosed. Among those with diabetes, only 1 in 3 people get treatment, and roughly 1 in 13 achieves treatment  targets. Awareness could go a long way towards fighting and preventing diabetes. ACI, along with some registered  qualified doctors, provides medical service, advices and medicines to the people of Ghonapara. ACI endeavors to  generate diabetes awareness among the villagers about the prevention of this disease. Eye cataract remove by free operation is another health care initiative taken by ACI. The underprivileged people of  Ghonapara are not financially well off to carry out the cost of eye cataract operation. Therefore ACI sort out some  eye cataract patient and remove eye cataract by free operation. 16 people regain their eye sight through the eye  cataract operation and they are now having a luminous life.  ACI provides treatment to the people who have hearing impairment. Under this program 1 person get opportunity  to avail the treatment and hearing aid from ACI. Skilled Development Program: ACI conducted skill development training program for the farmers helping them to  improve agronomical practices leading to higher crop production. Through the training program, ACI made the  farmers of Ghonapara acquaint with the use of modern equipment and materials. By using the new technology and  equipment, farmers will be able to increase the crop production rate and take necessary steps for crop protection.  ACI conducted day long training session in 4 separate baths consists of 119 farmers of Ghonapara village. About 100  percent farmers expressed their positive view toward the training program. They expressed that they are now able  to protect their crops from pest and grow more crops with the technical assistance from ACI. Safe and Judicious Use of Pesticides and Film Show: ACI, along with some other entities, has organized a day-long  training program on Safe and Judicious Use of Pesticides and Film Show where 34 farmers received training and  certificates from Bangladesh Crop Protection Association (BCPA). Looking Forward: With the success of this pilot project, ACI aims to extend its services for the development of com- munity at a larger scale. Now, ACI has decided to execute the same project in 10 more villages and improve the so- cial and economical structure similarly. ACI has already conducted the base line survey in Baborgati, Bijoypasha,  Dalnia, Sareshpur, Golabaria, Gopalpur, Modhupur, Nilokhee, Shibpur and Tebaria and all of these villages are situ- ated in Gopalgonj district. Adopt-a-Village project was taken in one village aiming to improve the living standards of under-privileged people in  rural regions. For the sustainable development of the community, ACI hopes to replicate the project in remotest  areas across the Bangladesh and uptake several CSR activities ranging from medical aid services to community  based training and development programs aligned with its business practices.  Page 5  Page 6 Tori or Information Boat carries information and  services close to remotest and most marginalized  people of Bangladesh to alleviate their misery. All  boats were equipped with doctors, medical atten- dants, medicines and other essential utilities that  were necessary to serve the patients in the eastern  and northern part of the country.  In the year 2011, as part of continuing with the pro- gram, twelve camps were arranged in different vil- lages of Rangpur, Bogra and Thakurgaon districts.  About 1207 people were served in these medical  camps and received medicines and consultation ser- vices from the medical teams. ACI in association with CARE Bngladesh, funded the  medical camp named Amar Shasthya (My Health) since 2009 aiming to facilitate medical service to the  people who were suffering from health problems in  the marshlands (Haors) in Bangladesh.  Generally, the status of health services in Haor areas  is lower than that of other regions. An overwhelming  majority in Haor areas depends on traditional heal- ers. Common diseases among the Haor people are  high mortality rate of children and mother, the prob- lems of malnutrition, the problems in birth control,  Pelvic infection, nutritional disease especially among  the children and pregnant women, chronic respira- tory infections and weight loss. There is also lack of  medicines in the hospitals of Marshlands. Tothyo  My Health (Amar Shashthya) Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges UNITED NATION GLOBAL COMPACT ACI Agribusinesses, the leading agriculture integrator in Bangladesh, is dedicated to gaining prosperity of  Bangladesh through food security. ACI Agribusinesses offers complete solutions to farmers and also edu- cates them about the technical know-how. ACI provides total solution of agribusiness to the farmers through  six business units i.e. ACI fertilizer, Seed, Animal Health, Crop Care and Public Health, Motors and Cropex.  ACI with the help of its different agribusiness units organizes massive training programs for the farmers and  mechanics across the country.  ACI employed dedicated team members who conduct the training programs  and transfer the modern technology allied to agriculture. They suggest the best possible ways of using bal- anced fertilizer for successful crop production and maintenance of soil health, appropriate use of hybrid  seed for high yielding varietys crops, using insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides for crop protection and  identifying the appropriate crop protection chemicals to ensure the greater variety and adaptability to the  farmers etc.  Field team members of ACI Motors Limited also instruct the farmers about the modern devices, mechanical  cultivation and usage of agro-machineries. In 2011 ACI organized extensive training programs for farmers and mechanics. Around 24 training programs  were conducted for more than 1000 mechanics and almost 800 thousand farmers were participated in dif- ferent training programs arranged by all units of agribusiness division.
