Curry –Chairman/CEO Page 8 of 10    Our interest in the Caribbean and Central American region is being tailor-made to prevent  ECBIZNET INCORPORATED and/or affiliated entities from experiencing the most common pit- falls of coming face-to-face with adverse market influence or avoidance of full adherence to the  Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN) and full and complete adherence Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act of 1977.     Rather than creating un-fair competition or encouraging existing duopolies we seek to promote  a coopetition strategy which over time would prove to be anti-corrupt.        ECBIZNET: Miami; Erskine R. Curry Chairman/CEO asked the 2012 CANTO  Conference the 64 million dollar question: In a connected world would you  rather be a Service Provider, a Small-business, or an End-user???      Pointing out the fact: remained CANTO of its 23 year old challenge (Back in  1989) which called for Caribbean Telecom Operators to Significant reduce the  cost of broadband and telecom services in the region. Today the cost of  telecom services and broadband is increasing not decreasing as it should be.      In a second reminder to CANTO Curry recalled the other 23 year old  challenge  which  called  for  Caribbean  Telecom  Operators  to  seek  harmonization  and embrace the MDG Broadband Initiative: which in his  opinion is an initiative which is already too little, too late! As it stands right  now –we are already a day late and a dollar short -says Curry.       Making the recommendation for CANTO to also be mindful of another 23 year  old challenge Curry thanked Caribbean Telecom Operators in the region for  leading the way in ending government monopolies to which he noted; he  was happy to observe there are fewer government monopolies in existence  today than there were in yesteryear.      Currys went on to make allegations accusing key regional network operators  (such as Digicel and Cable & Wireless) of operating existing Duopolies. Curry  has since gone on record as noting how a duopoly in any marketplace creates  imperfect competition, influence market demands and suppresses the  economic possibilities of sustainable revenue assurance. The government  monopolies of yesteryear were bad for big businesses: The duopolies, of  today are bad (if not worse) for small businesses and end-users; and therefore  duopolies are bad for all of us! says Curry.      Curry said; To accelerate the broadband experience in the Caribbean -and to  transform the way we live and do business in the region; ECBIZNET  INCORPORATED and/or its affiliated entities will be seeking the blessings of  the CANTO Secretary General and the delegates of the 2012 CANTO  conference to support ECBIZNET INCORPORATED and/or its affiliated  entities in its effort to lead a coalition of small businesses in aggressive legal  action to rid the Caribbean of existing duopolies.           A MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES     In short, the degree to which ECBIZNET INCORPORATED and/or its affiliated entities deployed  targeted performance indicators; how they were met -and the disclosure of other qualitative or  quantitative, measurements of results are detail below.   2012 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP)  W  W  W  .
