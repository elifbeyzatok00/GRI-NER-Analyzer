Im proud to share with you some of the things that IKEA has  accomplished so far together with our customers, co-workers,  suppliers and partners such as WWF, UNICEF and Save the  Children. Working together, taking many small steps in the  same direction, means that we can make huge contributions  towards a more sustainable future. The IKEA vision is to create a better everyday life for the  many people, and we believe that home is the most important  place in the world. We offer affordable home furnishing prod- ucts and solutions, while also taking responsibility for people  and the environment. We want our customers to be able to  freely choose from our range, knowing that they do not have  to choose between sustainability, style, function or price. IKEA has begun a long journey with sustainability as one   of four cornerstones in our overall direction Growing IKEA –  together. This, combined with a long history and culture built  on enthusiasm and a constant strive for renewal, makes us  well equipped to tackle some of the global challenges we are  all facing. Im convinced that we will find new, unique opportu- nities to build a better tomorrow. mikael Ohlsson president and CEO, IKEA group Im delighted to welcome our new Chief Sustainability Officer  Steve howard on-board. his competence and passion, not  least when it comes to climate-related issues, will help sup- port the innovation and drive we need to make IKEA a truly  sustainable company and help our customers to live a more  sustainable life at home. On behalf of all of IKEA, I thank you for taking the time   to read this report and share our progress. lETTER FROm THE CEO IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    5  IKEA can play a vital role The release of this report also marks the start of my journey at  IKEA. Im excited to join many dedicated colleagues in a com- pany that puts its social and environmental values at the heart  of its business. My aim is to incorporate sustainability into every part of the  IKEA experience – from raw materials and how products are  made to inspiring us to live a more sustainable life at home. IKEA has laid a great foundation over the last decade or so,  and that shows in this report. Persistent, hard work within for- estry and cotton cultivation is paying off; the IKEA Foundation  helps us improve the lives of many millions of children in need;  and the goal to use 100 percent renewable energy in all IKEA  units is an industry-leading commitment.  I know that IKEA possesses both the desire and the ability  to take on the challenge of transformational change. Much of  the world is in an era of unprecedented growth with populations  in the worlds cities swelling by more than one million people  every week. Quite simply, sustainability can no longer be an  optional, luxury item in a society heading towards nine billion  people. living a more sustainable life must be affordable and  accessible for everyone. Our products and services should  Steve Howard Chief Sustainability Officer, IKEA Group have no negative impact on the planet, but preferably have  positive impact and generate zero waste and zero carbon.  This doesnt mean that the world cant still be exciting.  Future generations must be allowed to enjoy the same or bet- ter quality of life as we have today, but in a way that takes  care of both people and our planet. IKEA plays an important  role in meeting the many peoples aspirations through innova- tive, exciting products that will increasingly offer a more sus- tainable way of life, giving people better choices without com- promises to the way they want to live, work and play. This is the challenge we must embrace if we are to provide  a great quality of life for present and future generations. I  believe IKEA can do this. We can and will play a vital role in   a more sustainable future.

IKEA sees sustainability as a business opportunity as well as  a condition for being a good company. IKEA Sustain ability Direction for FY15 will help us  consistently move all aspects of our operations in the right direction towards our goals.  SUSTAINAbIlITY IS A CORNERSTONE OF OUR OvERAll DIRECTION Sustainability is one of the four cornerstones of the overall direction for the IKEA Group, Growing  IKEA – Together. Sustainability shall be an integrated part of our business, which means that all  IKEA strategies and business plans must clearly and systematically integrate sustainability improve- ments and investments as part of everyday operations. To assist this process, we have developed   the IKEA Sustainability Direction with key priorities and overall goals for FY15.  To integrate sustainability into our business, we need to take social and environmental responsi- bility in every step of the value chain. We will therefore create and secure sustainable set-ups for:  product development and sourcing of raw materials of home furnishing and food products  production and distribution  marketing  stores and shopping centres  the products end-of-life SpECIFIC gOAlS TO bE SET IN All pARTS OF IKEA For some priorities, we have already set specific, overall goals complemented by a number of area-  specific targets. During FY11, more targets at all levels of the organisation will be developed to help  us measure our progress. Integrating the IKEA  Sustainability  Direction into everything we do IKEA vISION, bUSINESS IDEA & SUSTAINAbIlITY Our business idea is to offer a wide range of   well-designed, functional home furnishing products  at prices so low that as many people as possible   will be able to afford them. The IKEA vision  is to create a  better everyday  life for the many  people. Wherever we are, we shall  act with respect to have a  positive impact on people   and the limited resources   of our planet to ensure long- term profitability. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    14 INTRODUCTION: GOvERNANCE  lOCAl, NATIONAl AND glObAl RESpONSIbIlITY  The IKEA culture is key in defining how we integrate sustainable behaviour throughout our organisation.  Among our values are togetherness, humbleness, simplicity and cost-consciousness. We believe in  doing more with less, listening to and learning from others, and being fair and honest. Every IKEA manager is responsible for including sustainability in his or her area of responsibility  and to set goals. To support them, there are sustainability managers and many social and environ- mental specialists covering a wide range of areas, such as chemical experts, forestry specialists,  energy experts, code of conduct specialists and auditors. In addition, all IKEA stores and distribution  centres have social and environmental co-ordinators who work with sustainability related training,  working conditions, safety, waste management, and water and energy conservation.  IKEA DOES NOT ACCEpT CORRUpTION IN ANY FORm IKEA does not accept corruption in any form, whether direct or indirect, and works proactively to   prevent it. All suppliers must sign an acceptance of this policy.  Our corruption policy, Rules of Prevention of Corruption, and an investigation policy describe how  we will act when we suspect fraud, corruption, theft and other illegal behaviour. Firm policies and an  internal ethics programme with training and workshops help to minimise the risk of illegal behaviour  in the IKEA organisation. We make regular risk assessments on different markets and handle any  deviations to policy and guidelines with systematic urgency. glObAl COmpACTS gUIDINg pRINCIplES  IKEA is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact. We are committed to aligning our opera- tions and strategies to the Global Compacts ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour,   environment and anti-corruption.

By sharing experiences and  learning from others, we can accomplish more than we could have  done by working on our own.   IKEA works in partnership with UNICEF and Save the Children   to strengthen childrens rights, and with the global conservation  organisation WWF on projects within forestry, cotton and   climate change.

The vision to create a better everyday life for the many people is not just  about offering great home furnishing products – it is also about contributing to a better  future by taking social and environmental responsibility towards our customers, our co- workers, our suppliers and the people who work for them, as well as towards the entire  community. IKEA CUSTOmERS  We want our customers to always feel confident that the products they purchase from IKEA are of  good quality and safe to use. They should be able to freely choose among all our products, knowing  that IKEA is committed to sustainable practices and that they do not have to choose between sustain- ability, style, function or price.  More than 38 million customers in 23 countries are members of IKEA FAMIlY, the customer club  that helps us care for and reward our most active customers. Several stores run IKEA FAMIlY activi- ties aimed at engaging customers to participate in our sustainability work and support a variety of  projects in the local community. The IKEA FAMIlY lIvE Magazine helps us reach six million house- holds around the world with tips and ideas for a more sustainable life at home, as well as in-depth  features on what we do to take responsibility for people and the environment. Customer feedback on individual products are systematically documented in case of returns and/ or complaints so that IKEA can take action when needed. Any indication of safety problems will  immediately be followed by global measures to prevent injury and/or health hazards.  To collect structured feedback from customers, IKEA conducts market research through the  brand Capital survey – a tool to monitor and improve the implementation of the IKEA concept and  to measure customer satisfaction in each market. The survey is conducted once a year. In addition,  we monitor how satisfied customers are with their local IKEA store through the annual Customer  Satisfaction Index (CSI) survey. The survey provides an international benchmark for our stores, and  ensures that customer satisfaction issues are regularly addressed. IKEA CO-WORKERS Our co-workers are our most valuable resource – when they grow, IKEA grows. IKEA is committed to  being a good employer that offers a safe and healthy work environment together with development  opportunities for each individual.  IKEA conducts an annual company-wide survey to collect feedback from co-workers. We want to  learn what motivates them and what they are dissatisfied with, so that IKEA can keep improving as  an employer. The survey is completed anonymously to encourage honest feedback.

In FY10, we created Our Never Ending  Job, an inspiring reference book covering many small and large  actions that IKEA has taken in the field of sustainability. Printed   on recycled paper in 18 languages, it is distributed to all current  co-workers in 41 countries, as well as to those that will join us  over the next two years. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    16 INTRODUCTION: STAKEhOlDERS  IKEA SUpplIERS AND THEIR EmplOYEES  IKEA is a production-oriented company, and we strive to build long-term relationships with suppliers  that share our values and who want to grow and develop together with IKEA.  Many ideas for design and product development are born on the factory floor when IKEA co-workers  are on-site, and this close relationship also opens up possibilities for frank and honest dialogue about  topics related to environmental and social issues. We cooperate with suppliers to spread best prac- tices in various areas to increase their ability to take on more social and environmental responsibility.  For a supplier, investments in working conditions and the environment often lead to more orders,  better productivity and improved profitability, thereby improving competitiveness. Every three years, IKEA conducts a supplier survey to collect feedback from our suppliers on our  relationship. The feedback is given anonymously to protect suppliers and encourage frank and open  input. We ask questions about, for instance, if IKEA is sensitive to suppliers opinions, if discussions  are respectful, and if IKEA handles complaints in a satisfactory manner. If the feedback indicates   a need for improvement, an action plan is developed for the area concerned. COmmUNITIES IKEA is active in the communities where we do business. We participate in a wide range of activities  globally, nationally and locally. Through partnerships with carefully selected organisations, we sup- port projects that are designed to match the needs of the communities in which they take place.  NgOS AND OTHER STAKEHOlDERS  Regular dialogue with some of our stakeholders and partners is an important way for us to gain  and share knowledge that helps us move forward. by cooperating with companies, trade unions and  organisations, we accomplish more than we could have done by working on our own.  THE ENvIRONmENT  IKEA strives to minimise the negative impact on the environment by applying innovative thinking in  every step of the long chain, from the very first idea for a product to when the customer no longer  wants it. Cost-consciousness is part of our culture, and it inspires us to try to make more from less  resources and minimise waste in every form.  We believe that IKEA has the possibility to even contribute to a better environment. For example,  we can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimise waste and water consumption in society  by offering products that help our customers live a more sustainable life at home.

IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    17 INTRODUCTION: STAKEhOlDERS  CUSTOMERS IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    18  We want customers to confidently and freely choose among all our products, knowing that  IKEA is committed to sustainable practices and that they do not have to choose between  sustain ability, style, function or price. The IKEA Sustainability product Score Card will help  us offer a more sustainable range of products.  INTRODUCINg THE IKEA SUSTAINAbIlITY pRODUCT SCORE CARD A new tool for more sustainable product development and purchasing has been developed for intro- duction during FY11. The IKEA Sustainability Product Score Card will help classify the IKEA home   furnishing range. It will steer us towards selecting the best possible alternatives within 11 criteria  that have an impact on a products sustainability profile throughout its life-cycle.  IKEA Sustainability Product Score Card criteria, in brief:  More from less (using less material in the product)  Renewable material   Recycled material   Environmentally better material   Separable & recyclable material  Product quality   Transport efficiency (number of products per container)  Energy efficient production  Renewable energy in production   Raw material utilization at suppliers  Product use (less use of energy and water, and less waste in customers homes) For a product and its packaging to be classified as more sustainable compared to its predecessor or to  comparable products on the market, it must score a certain number of points in the IKEA Sustainabil- ity Product Score Card. It is a prerequisite that the product is produced by suppliers that live up to  the social and environmental requirements in the IKEA code of conduct IWAY.  The IKEA Sustainability Product Score Card is an internal tool that will help us measure our  progress and improve the sustainability in our entire range of products. Therefore, scores will not be  communicated to customers in the form of individual product labels.  Introducing a new tool to develop more  sustainable products             mAKINg mORE FROm lESS If STUvA had been in the range a few years ago, we would only have been able to  make 13 STUvA storage boxes from the wood of one tree. Today, one tree is enough  for 23 of them! how did we do it? We replaced some wood with air, using a technique  called board on Stiles instead of the traditional 18 mm chipboard.  board on Stiles  1.  Stiles are combined with honeycomb paper in  an automatic process. Heated, thin fibre- board is placed on each side and everything  goes into a rolling press. 2.  After pressing, the board is split into a number of different  widths depending on the product line. 3.  The boards are drilled and varnished or painted – ready for packaging. 4.  Strong and lightweight, the final product allows for better filling rates in containers   and trucks, and is easy for customers to handle. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    19 CUSTOmERS: MORE SUSTAINAblE PRODUCTS  gOAlS TO DEvElOp mORE SUSTAINAblE pRODUCTS  IKEA has set new product development targets for the end of FY15 based on our Sustainability   Direction.  90 percent of the IKEA sales value shall come from home furnishing products classified as   more sustainable according to criteria in the new IKEA Sustainability Product Score Card.  All product materials shall be renewable, recyclable or recycled.   Our energy-consuming products, such as lights and white goods, will be at least 50 percent   more efficient than average installed products on the market in 2008 (based on estimated   averages for the European markets).  Our water-consuming products (such as taps, dishwashers and washing machines) will be   at least 50 percent more efficient than average installed products on the market in 2008   (based on estimated averages for the European markets). SOlUTIONS FOR A mORE SUSTAINAblE lIFE AT HOmE IKEA wants to help customers take simple measures at home that contribute to a better environ- ment and save on household expenses. IKEA products can help customers adopt a more sustainable  behaviour at home, and – as a group of several hundred million people – reduce their overall   climate impact.  All IKEA kitchen taps are now fitted with a Pressure Compensating Aerator (PCA) that can reduce  water use by 30 percent on average. The same technology will be introduced for all bathroom taps   in FY11. IKEA has also extended the range of products to help with waste-sorting, moving from mainly  kitchen-based products to also include solutions suitable for secondary storage areas. For example,  RETUR is a series of wall-hanging storage products to be used for paper, cardboard, batteries, glass  and plastic, etc., and DIMPA provides a low-price portable alternative. All incandescent light bulbs have been phased out and replaced with low-energy alternatives  named SPARSAM, and the range of lED-based light products is being expanded.  mORE RESOURCES TO SUSTAINAblE pRODUCT DEvElOpmENT IKEA of Sweden is responsible for developing the range of home furnishing products. Now all of its  eight business areas have a dedicated sustainability leader, supported by a central group of seven  people, responsible for leading and supporting the sustainability work within product development  and supply chain. In addition, product developers, technicians and others are invited to take part in three different  training modules on waste, energy and water issues. A separate training programme is available on  how to use the IKEA Sustainability Product Score Card.  DECISION TO bUY RSpO CERTIFICATES IKEA has decided to purchase Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Certificates to help stimu- late more sustainable palm oil production.  In early 2011, we will buy certificates equivalent to the volume of palm oil used for IKEA products.  IKEA has also decided to take on a more active role in the RSPO. IKEA suppliers purchase palm oil mainly from Malaysia and Indonesia. This raw material is associ- ated with environmental issues such as deforestation and peat land destruction, as well as social  issues relating to indigenous populations and working conditions.  While palm oil used in IKEA products represents only around 0.1 percent of the global market,  IKEA is relatively large in the candle segment. Today, IKEA uses approximately 60,000 tonnes of  palm oil in total, of which around 59,000 tonnes are used for candle production. The rest is used for  frying oil and food production, hygiene products and to prepare rattan for home furnishing products.  IKEA candles contain around 30 percent palm oil. We replaced paraffin in candles with palm  stearin a few years ago in an effort to achieve a smaller carbon dioxide footprint. based on what we  know today, we believe that actively contributing to more sustainable palm oil production is the most  effective way forward towards more sustainable products. however, the quest for more sustainable  raw materials is constant, and IKEA continues to investigate alternatives to palm oil.

With the help  of external expertise, we hope to get a better understanding of how to reduce energy and water   consumption as well as minimise food waste and food packaging. The purpose is to create guidelines,  to be rolled out in FY11, on how to minimise our environmental impact.  DECISION TO INTRODUCE UTZ CERTIFIED COCOA IKEA has decided to introduce one UTZ Certified cocoa product in the IKEA food range in FY11, a dark  chocolate bar. IKEA is expected to be the first retailer to offer a product with 100 percent, fully trace- able UTZ Certified cocoa. As with UTZ Certified coffee purchased at IKEA, customers will be able to  trace the beans used in the dark chocolate bar all the way back to the plantations through a code on  the packaging. NEW ANImAl WElFARE STANDARD FOR CHICKEN IKEA has introduced its first animal welfare standard for food sourcing. The standard on broiler  chicken has been developed together with Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), and the goal is that  all chicken suppliers will comply as of January 2011.  The standard specifies the maximum stock density of 30 kg birds per square meter (m2) com- pared to the current EU requirement of a maximum of 36-42 kg birds/m2. Other requirements include  that the chickens must have natural light through windows, perching and pecking objects, and access  to straw bales to encourage foraging. The work to develop more animal welfare standards continues in cooperation with CIWF. IKEA  expects standards for egg laying hens, pig, beef cattle and dairy cattle to be the next to be developed  in FY11 and FY12.   STANDARD FROm THE SAlmON DIAlOgUE ClOSE TO COmplETION IKEA and all its suppliers of salmon products participate in the Salmon Dialogue, a multi-stakeholder  initiative managed by WWF. The Salmon Dialogue has developed principles and criteria for environ- mentally, socially and economically responsible salmon farming, which are to be finalised during  2011. The ambition is that all IKEA salmon products shall be sourced according to the Aquaculture  Stewardship Council (ASC) standard by 2015.

IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    21 CUSTOmERS: MORE SUSTAINAblE PRODUCTS  The way we work ECONOmISINg ON RESOURCES We want as many people as possible to be  able to afford IKEA products as part of our  vision to create a better everyday life. This  applies to the home furnishing range as  well as to the meals served in IKEA restau- rants and the food sold in the Swedish  Food Market. Cost-consciousness is essential to this  idea. This inspires us to make economical  use of all resources and to seek innovative  solutions. This in turn helps us to reduce  our overall environmental impact. HOmE FURNISHINg pRODUCTS  mAKINg mORE FROm lESS IKEA strives to use the least possible  resources to make the best possible prod- ucts, and we work systematically to inte- grate sustainability into our product solu- tions. Using hollow legs on furniture and  chipboard as filling are classic IKEA ways of  saving on wood resources.  We are also introducing new quality  standards in cotton production to minimise  the use of raw material while enhancing  quality, and blending cotton with other  materials to reduce cotton use.  RENEWAblE, RECYClAblE AND  RECYClED mATERIAlS by the end of FY15, all product materials  shall be renewable, recyclable or recycled.  The main raw materials used in IKEA prod- ucts are wood, cotton and glass. The latter  is recyclable, while wood and cotton are  renewable materials. SUSTAINAblE SOURCINg OF RAW  mATERIAlS Raw material extraction is often associated  with environmental and social concerns.  IKEA wants to support the development   of sustainable practices for what are often  long and complex supply chains. We work actively with our partners   to spread better management practices   in cotton-growing areas in India and   Pakistan, and to increase the availability   of certified wood. In the future, we want to focus even  more on finding ways to not only decrease  the amount of raw materials required for  IKEA products, but also to find alternative  materials to avoid the depletion of precious  resources.  Read more on page 59  Forestry   Read more on page 64  Cotton NO ECO-lAbEllINg OF IKEA HOmE  FURNISHINg pRODUCTS We label our home furnishing products  exclusively with the IKEA logo, as we want  our customers to know that this stands for  products that are safe and produced with  respect for people and the environment.   As this applies to the entire IKEA range,   we have chosen not to use any certification  labels for home furnishing products.  We want customers to confidently and  freely choose among all our products,  knowing that IKEA is committed to sustain- able practices and that they do not have to  choose between sustainability, style, func- tion or price. FOOD pRODUCTS  TACKlINg CONCERNS OvER FISHINg  AND ANImAl WElFARE IKEA wants to offer quality food products  at low prices, while also giving our custom- ers peace of mind knowing that we source  food products in a responsible manner.  IKEA has restrictive requirements on  food products to prevent overfishing, and  we cooperate with Compassion in World  Farming (CIWF) to develop animal welfare  standards. The herring sold by IKEA comes from  sustainable fisheries outside the coasts of  Norway, and all of our salmon suppliers  take part in WWFs Salmon Dialogue. When  local restaurant dishes include fish caught  in the wild, it must not come from endan- gered stocks. Read more on page 49  Industry-specific requirements for  IKEA Food suppliers All COFFEE AT IKEA IS UTZ  CERTIFIED All coffee sold and served at IKEA is UTZ  Certified. That means it has been produced  with care for people and the environment,  and that you can trace the beans all the  way back to the plantations through a code  on the packaging. UTZ Certified is an inde- pendent non-profit organisation that sets  social and environmental standards for  sustainable coffee growing and distribu- tion, and now also cocoa and tea. For more information on   UTZ Certified, please visit   www.utzcertified.org ORgANIC FOOD AvAIlAblE IN   All STORES All stores must offer at least one food dish  based on exclusively organic ingredients,  and a minimum of 10 percent of the range  in the Swedish Food Market must be  organic.  Currently, 14 percent of the global   articles found in the Swedish Food Market  are produced from organic ingredients.   In addition, many markets source organic  food for their national menu in the restau- rants; for example IKEA Italy has around  70 organic ingredients used for restaurant  food preparation. COOpERATINg WITH OTHERS IKEA engages in dialogue with several  stakeholders on animal welfare, such as  the Compassion in World Farming (CIWF)  and the Salmon Dialogue. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    22 CUSTOmERS: MORE SUSTAINAblE PRODUCTS  COmmENTS ON KpIS AND FIgURES 2010 IKEA has set new targets for the end of FY15 and will start   reporting on progress in FY11. The IKEA Sustainability Product  Score Card, which will be rolled out in FY11, will play a major   role for more sustainable product development and purchasing   in coming years. The efficiency of energy and water consuming products will be  compared with the estimated average installed products on Euro- pean markets, using 2008 as a base year. Today, we have little reliable data on the share of recycled   and recyclable materials used for IKEA home furnishing products,  but we know that the share of renewable materials remains fairly  constant at around 70 percent as cotton and wood are our two  most important raw materials. All incandescent light bulbs were phased out during FY10, and  sales of energy saving alternatives have increased.

This is why our products are subject to extensive testing, and  why IKEA works proactively to stay ahead of standards and regulations. pREpARED FOR INCREASED REgUlATION ON pRODUCT SAFETY IKEA works proactively to meet and comply with legislation and standards on product safety. The  number of international and national standards and requirements for consumer products are in- creasing, and the trend of shorter lead times for implementation continues. More than 60 new or  updated legislations and standards that affect IKEA home furnishing products are expected to come  into force during the coming three years. These requirements concern various areas, such as forest  trace ability, environmental requirements and reporting obligations, health, childrens products and  stability requirements.  Chemicals are a necessary part of most home furnishing products and manufacturing processes,  but IKEA works actively to eliminate, replace and reduce harmful substances in products and produc- tion wherever feasible. IKEA has decided that, by end of FY13, substances that are due to be prohib- ited by law shall have been phased out from IKEA products before the legislation is in place. ACTIvE pARTICIpATION IN STANDARDISATION EFFORTS  IKEA is often invited to participate in both national and international standardisation work in order to  contribute knowledge and experience that helps secure high-quality standards and testing methods.  In FY10, IKEA made an agreement with the Swedish Standard Institute to develop official transla- tions of Chinese standards relating to home furnishing products. This will simplify the interpretation  of Chinese requirements and help IKEA and other companies avoid non-compliance issues.  We work proactively to ensure safe   and healthy products QUAlITY TESTINg SINCE THE 1960s  IKEA started to test product quality at the  IKEA Test laboratory in lmhult, Sweden,   in the 1960s. Today, this laboratory alone  conducts 6,000-7,000 tests annually on fire  resistance, durability, emissions and much  more. Tests are based on various European  and international safety and quality stand- ards as well as IKEA-unique criteria that   look at how customers might use the prod- ucts. The laboratory is also a competence  centre working closely with IKEA designers,  product developers and technicians during  product development. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    24 CUSTOmERS: SAFE & hEAlThY PRODUCTS  The way we work REmOvINg lEAD FROm HOmE FURNISHINg pRODUCTS Whenever possible, IKEA strives to remove harmful substances from our products above and beyond  legal requirements. lead and cadmium are two such examples, and IKEA drinking glasses have been  free of these substances since the early 90s. In FY10, IKEA introduced new cost- and energy-efficient lead- and cadmium-free screen printing  paint systems for glass, one using Uv technology and one using thermal plastic inks. These printing  techniques will be used for both drinking glasses and decorative glass products. In FY10, IKEA also  introduced an alternative production method for mirrors, resulting in a lead-free mirror range. When U.S. regulatory authorities decided on tougher limits for lead levels in childrens products as  of February 2010, IKEA decided to remove all lead from the entire range of IKEA fixtures and fittings  by the end of FY11, and implementation at IKEA suppliers is under way.  WIDER SCOpE FOR THE IKEA CHIlDRENS SCHOOl Co-workers across IKEA who work with the Childrens IKEA range go through regular training in the  IKEA Childrens School. Our teachers are experts in their field and teach us about childrens develop- ment and needs with focus on quality, safety and health. In FY10, invitations to the training sessions  were extended to also include retail managers and suppliers of childrens products.  The introductory e-learning has been updated and now includes a film IKEA Childrens School –  The Movie that gives an overview of childrens needs and the implications on the IKEA range. The  e-learning module is followed by classroom activities during one to three days, depending on the  work role, before a participant is licenced to work with the IKEA Childrens range. ENAblINg bETTER INFORmED FOOD CHOICES  We plan to provide full nutritional information to customers for the food served and sold in IKEA  stores during FY11. This is already available on products in the Swedish Food Market range and on  restaurant food served in some U.S. states. Transparent information on all food products and dishes  will make it easier for customers to make informed choices. A gENEROUS RETURN pOlICY AND  STRICT FOllOW-Up ROUTINES IKEA has a generous return policy, and   customers have at least 30 days to bring  back purchased products for a full refund  regardless of the reason for the return.  Every return is systematically documented  so that IKEA can analyse reasons for returns  and take action when needed. There are  routines in place for returns related to  quality problems, so that measures can be  investigated by IKEA and the supplier in  question. In addition, return reasons that  can be an indication of safety problems  immediately prompt measures to prevent  injury and/or health hazards. RIgOROUS SAFETY AlARm  pROCEDURES Any indication of safety problems with  IKEA home furnishing and food products  immediately prompts measures deter- mined by our Safety Alarm process to pre- vent injury and/or health hazards. The Safety Alarm process helps us to secure  and monitor product safety and safety  standard compliance on all IKEA markets  and to initiate corrective and preventive  action if needed. All IKEA co-workers have  a duty to report safety-related incidents or  risks involving IKEA products. Our guide- lines state that the threshold should be  deliberately low for reporting, and that  over-reporting is encouraged. Alarms are directed to a central internal  watchdog team, which is on stand-by  around the clock, for initial classification.  In case of severe risk, an immediate sales  stop or recall can be set in motion almost  instantly. All alarms trigger an investiga- tion into the problem, involving all neces- sary parts of the IKEA organisation as well  as suppliers and authorities when needed.  Safety Alarms also provide important infor- mation for product developers and design- ers in their quest to develop safe and  healthy products. Every IKEA store and national Service  Office has dedicated resources working  with safety alarm procedures, and they  receive regular training. HOmE FURNISHINg pRODUCTS  pROACTIvE RISK ASSESSmENT AND  ExTENSIvE TESTINg IKEA uses proactive risk assessments to  ensure product safety by evaluating, detect- ing and eliminating potential hazards. Each  year, thousands of tests are carried out on  home furnishing products during IKEA prod- uct development, and various tests are con- ducted continuously during production.  Suppliers are required to have product  tests conducted at IKEA-approved third- party laboratories. IKEA has its own third- party accredited test laboratories in Sweden  and China, which are complemented by  more than 100 external laboratories  around the world. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    25 CUSTOmERS: SAFE & hEAlThY PRODUCTS  The IKEA Test laboratory in lmhult,   Sweden, has increased its work with pro- active risk assessment during the early  stages of home furnishing product devel- opment. Special technicians have been  trained to work with designers and product  developers from the drawing board, pro- viding input to constructions and advice  based on prototypes. Tests are conducted  not only in relation to standards and regu- lations, but also based on how customers  eventually use the product. In addition,   the teams conduct assembly tests to facili- tate the process for customers and make  the final product safer to use. SpECIAl FOCUS ON CHIlDRENS  SAFETY IKEA pays particular attention to childrens  products, which must meet especially high  quality and safety requirements. We test  IKEA childrens products to strict national  and international safety standards and leg- islation at independent, third-party test  laboratories and institutes around the  world. Tests are made before we start pro- duction and thereafter on a regular basis. Special risk assessment based on chil- drens needs is a cornerstone of our quality  work during product development and in  the production stage. The purpose is to  detect and eliminate potential hazards and  to ensure the product is safe to use also in  ways an adult may not normally anticipate. Co-workers across IKEA who work with  the Childrens IKEA range go through regu- lar training in the IKEA Childrens School   to learn about childrens development and  needs, with focus on quality, safety and  health. USINg THE SAFEST pOSSIblE  CHEmICAlS IKEA aims to refrain from the use of chemi- cals and substances that could potentially  be harmful to people and the environment.  We strive to always use materials, surface  treatments and production techniques with  the lowest possible emissions.  The IKEA range shall comply with the  strictest laws and safety standards on all  our markets, and we have detailed require- ments on the use of chemicals and other  substances in the manufacturing process.  If one country tightens its rules, we intro- duce these new regulations on all IKEA  markets where and when possible.  Examples of such legislation are the EU  RohS directive on hazardous substances   in electrical and electronic components and  the REACh legislation on the restriction of  chemicals.  IKEA participates in formal and informal  networks related to REACh. For instance,  IKEA monitors the updates of The Interna- tional Chemical Secretariats (ChemSec)  initiative Substitute it Now (SIN), which  lists substances that may be included in  REACh.  FOOD pRODUCTS  SAFE AND HEAlTHY FOOD pRODUCTS health is an important parameter when we  develop the IKEA food range. We try to  minimise the use of chemical additives,  such as certain preservatives, and have  prohibited monosodium glutamate (MSG)  and AZO dyes, which are suspected to  have negative health effects.  We have banned all flavour enhancers in  IKEA branded food products. Also, IKEA does  not allow genetically modified organisms  (GMO) in IKEA branded products. As it is  almost impossible to source GMO-free food  in the United States and Canada, an excep- tion of the ban has been issued for those  countries. however, our own packaged brand  products are always GMO-free regard less  of where they are sourced and sold. IKEA has limits on artificially produced  trans fats in the cooking oil, food products  and dishes sold and used in our stores. A  maximum of 2 per cent of the total fat con- tent may be trans fats, which is the small- est quantity that can be measured.  Read more on page 49  Industry-specific requirements for  IKEA food suppliers ENSURINg RESTAURANT FOOD  SAFETY IKEA is determined to ensure that the food  served in our restaurants and sold in the  Swedish Food Markets is safe to eat. IKEA  has a mandatory web-based learning pro- gramme on food safety for all co-workers  working with food in our restaurants,   kitchens and stores.  Two annual food safety audits are   performed by external parties in every  IKEA store. The audit includes food han- dling, cleaning practices, storage rooms  and garbage practices. If deviations from  protocol are detected, the store must  immediately set up corrective measures  and undergo a new audit. In addition,   independent third-party auditors conduct  compliance and calibration audits to ensure  consistent audit judgement levels and   follow-up procedures. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    26 CUSTOmERS: SAFE & hEAlThY PRODUCTS  IKEA customers are encouraged to contribute to positive social and environmental develop- ment through campaigns and activities run by IKEA and our partners. Customer engagement  reached new highs in FY10 and helped us make a difference in many parts of the world. ANOTHER RECORD DONATION FROm SOFT TOYS CAmpAIgN During the holiday season at the end of each year, one euro for every soft toy sold in IKEA stores world- wide is donated, split between Save the Children and UNICEF projects aimed at improving childrens  education. The FY10 campaign generated 7.1 million euro, and the FY11 campaign generated another  8.6 million euro, enabling UNICEF and Save the Children to extend or start projects in 22 countries.  During one extra week at the end of the FY11 campaign period leading up to Christmas 2010,  donations were not only based on soft toys sales, but on all products in the Childrens IKEA range and  a special childrens meal in the restaurants. And, for the first time, stores outside the IKEA Group  took part in the campaign, bringing the number of participating stores to more than 300. Since the campaign began in 2003, the IKEA Foundation has donated 35.2 million euro, enabling  improved schools for approximately 8 million children in close to 40 countries. SUCCESS FOR SUNNAN lAmp SAlES AND DONATIONS For every SUNNAN solar-powered lamp sold in IKEA stores, the IKEA Foundation donates one SUNNAN  lamp, split between UNICEF and Save the Children. The lamps are distributed to children in develop- ing countries to help them play, read, write and study after dusk. In the first 12 months from the  start in June 2009, more than 500,000 SUNNAN lamps were sold – double the initial goal.  Donating lamps is an important contribution to children in developing countries – especially girls –  who struggle to keep up at school because their only opportunity to do homework is at night after  completing household chores.

There are many examples of how the campaign engages both customers and co-workers  – and the commitment grows from year to year! For example, IKEA Poland encour- aged additional soft toy sales by  inviting customers to give twice by  buying a soft toy and leaving it in  transparent boxes placed near the  store exits. As a result 6,000 soft  toys were donated to eight childrens  hospitals around Poland in addition  to the donation made by the IKEA  Foundation to UNICEF and Save the  Children educational projects. In Sweden, two  co-workers from the store that generated the  biggest soft toy sales were treated to a field  trip to Moldavia with UNICEF to visit projects  funded by the campaign.  IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    27 CUSTOmERS: CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT  IKEA FAmIlY mEmbERS INvITED TO HElp pAKISTAN FlOOD vICTImS With homes, schools, hospitals, crops and livestock being destroyed by the 2010 flooding in Pakistan,   an estimated nine million children and their families urgently needed shelter, food, water and   health care. The IKEA Foundation appealed to millions of IKEA FAMIlY members to support a web-based dona- tion campaign benefitting UNICEF and Save the Children emergency relief efforts in Pakistan. In addi- tion, we have donated more than one million IKEA products, including 700,000 buckets, 200,000  blankets and 10,000 SUNNAN lamps.  HIgH ENgAgEmENT AmONg IKEA FAmIlY mEmbERS In several IKEA stores, the IKEA FAMIlY customer club is used to engage customers in a variety of  community projects. It can be through specific activities and campaigns, as well as through IKEA dona- tions that are based on the number of times the IKEA FAMIlY membership card is swiped in-store. In the UK, every IKEA FAMIlY card swipe raises money for the conservation charity Woodland Trust.  Since 2007, about one million GbP have been raised, and 230 acres of woodland have been created.  IKEA FAMIlY members that swipe their cards in Sweden raise 0.25 SEK to Save the Childrens parent  hotline, and this has generated four million SEK in the past two years. In Australia, IKEA FAMIlY  members can now choose which charity IKEA donates money to – each swipe generates 0.10 AUD to  UNICEF Australia or, depending on which store the card is swiped in, three different local charities  that work with children and young people. In France, each card swipe during February every year generates 0.20 euro in money or IKEA furni- ture to Fondation Abb Pierre, an NGO that helps the most disadvantaged find decent, long-term  housing. And IKEA Spain ran an IKEA FAMIlY card swipe activity in March and April, when 0.10 euro  was donated to support a variety of social projects selected at store level.  SUCCESS FOR CHRISTmAS TREE CAmpAIgN IN RUSSIA  Several IKEA markets have run Christmas Tree Campaigns in recent years. The latest country to  success fully use this to engage customers in forestry issues was Russia. All Russian stores offered   the opportunity for customers to bring back trees, purchased at IKEA, after the holidays to get part of  the money back. For each returned tree, IKEA Russia donated 50 roubles to WWF.  Nearly 60 percent of the trees sold were returned, enabling the donation of 1.6 million roubles to  a WWF school project in Arkhangelsk in northern Russia, teaching children the basics of responsible  forestry and engaging them in tree planting. The returned Christmas trees were used by IKEA suppli- ers to produce items such as chipboard and pellets, while twigs and needles that could not be refined  were used as bio-fuel.

Our Sustainability Direction for  FY15 states that IKEA must take responsi- bility to enable and encourage customers  to recycle and reuse products when they  are no longer wanted.  Today, many stores offer at least some  opportunities for customers to return and  sort waste for recycling. For example,   customers can return batteries and com- pact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs at most  IKEA stores. CFl bulbs use 80 percent less  energy and last 10 times longer than tradi- tional bulbs. however, CFl bulbs contain   a small amount of mercury, which means  that the bulbs have to be recycled in a   safe way. IKEA has started investigating the  opportunities for full recyclability of differ- ent materials used in IKEA products, and  how cyclic systems can save scarce natural  resources and minimise CO2 emissions.

We want co-workers that share our values  to stay and grow with us. This is why we place emphasis on safe and healthy working   conditions, sound benefits and career development based on equal opportunities and  strong corporate values.  NEW gOAlS FOR CO-WORKER SATISFACTION We want our co-workers to stay and thrive with IKEA, and we continuously monitor overall job satis- faction and motivation through a company-wide survey called vOICE.  In FY10, IKEA set the goal for the end of FY15 that the global average vOICE index should reach  700 out of a maximum 1000, up from 659 in FY10. We have also decided that the leadership index,  which measures co-workers view on their managers, shall reach 75 by the end of FY15 compared to  todays 73. National and local improvement goals are to be set based on the surveys sub-categories that   are the most important for that particular organisation. mORE TRANSpARENT CAREER OppORTUNITIES SUppORT DIvERSITY IKEA has decided to introduce more transparent ways of spotting potential and promoting co-workers  in order to increase diversity and expand the pool of upcoming talent. For example, co-workers can nominate themselves to the new international backpacker Pro- gramme. Nominees are assessed through an online global tool before national human Resources  teams finalise the selection of a total of 200 young potentials for a one-year trainee programme in  two different countries. The programme will not only help IKEA develop leaders for key positions and  recruit them internally, but also provide each country with a broad pool of potential future leaders   to develop in local programmes. The Backpacker Programme is expected to run for five years, with   a 50/50 ratio of male and female participants. Another way to promote diversity and equal opportunities is the +200 project, which has the  objective of identifying internal candidates to be developed as potential successors to 200 top man- agement positions.    Strong co-worker relations help us grow  and develop together CO-WORKER ADvOCATE TEAm SUppORTS   U.S. CO-WORKERS  In the United States, IKEA co-workers who may have  concerns with their managers, think they may have been  unfairly treated or just need coaching on work relations  have access to a special internal hR function to assist  them. This Co-worker Relations team assists in antici- pating, addressing and diffusing workplace issues;  resolving disputes between and among management  and co-workers; as well as working to maintain a posi- tive and productive work environment. Co-workers  issues can be reported to the iSpeak call-centre or  website, and a team of four people stand by to listen   to their concerns, mediate, provide advice and suggest  solutions or conduct an investigation. The team also  has access to external competencies to help with, for  example, legal advice. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    31 CO-WORKERS: WhEN WE GROW, IKEA GROWS  bETTER HEAlTH & SAFETY STANDARDS, WORKINg CONDITIONS Today, IKEA units base most of their occupational health and safety standards on local regulations  and national legislation that vary from country to country. IKEA is now looking into the various   standards, and we aim to level out differences by setting a minimum standard. We are also looking into various ways of improving general working conditions in key areas. For  example, IKEA and representatives from the European Works Council have conducted a case study   at a saw mill in Slovakia, owned by IKEAs industrial arm Swedwood, in order to learn more about  working conditions outside the retail environment. The aim is to develop guidelines and spread good  examples to other IKEA industrial units.  NEW pRINCIplES AND gUIDElINES FOR COmpENSATION & bENEFITS IKEA wants to offer competitive and transparent compensation and benefits that attract, motivate  and retain talent. To support this, IKEA has developed global, mandatory guidelines for compensation  and benefits that are to be implemented on all markets during FY12. The guidelines provide a common global approach combined with clear local responsibility to secure  relevance, competitiveness and to meet the individual need in line with different life situations. Each  country must offer the same benefit structure for all co-workers in the country and support co-workers  with individually adapted benefits to reflect and meet changing needs in life over the years. Benefits are to be based on core IKEA values as well as local laws and market conditions, and there  must be an element that is considered outstanding on the market. For example, legislated parental  leave varies from country to country, and IKEA may locally select this as an area where outstanding  benefits could be offered.  A gREAT plACE TO WORK In 2010, the Great Place to Work Institutes annual Trust Index   Survey listed IKEA Poland as the best large workplace (more than  1,000 employees) in Poland, and the 49th best large workplace   in Europe. IKEA Spain and IKEA Finland were ranked the second   and third best large workplace in their respective countries.  Nearly 300,000 employees provided feedback on 1,300 compa- nies, making this the largest annual workplace survey in the world.  The surveys definition of a great workplace is an organisation where  employees trust the people they work for, have pride in what they  do and enjoy the people they work with. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    32 CO-WORKERS: WhEN WE GROW, IKEA GROWS  OUR vAlUES SHOW US THE WAY IKEA embraces human rights and respect  for the individual, and the way we work is  based on a strong and living company cul- ture. The foundation is a set of shared val- ues that guide us in our everyday work.  We value togetherness, humbleness,  simplicity, cost-consciousness and common  sense. We share a strong desire to learn and  improve. We encourage co-workers to ques- tion accepted solutions and test new ideas,  and see mistakes as a way to grow and  develop. We expect our managers to lead by  example, to live and explain the IKEA values. lISTENINg TO OUR CO-WORKERS IKEA uses a company-wide survey called  vOICE to monitor how co-workers view  various aspects of their employment at  IKEA. Each year, we ask our co-workers to  fill in the survey anonymously to highlight  what motivates them and what they are dis- satisfied with. Results from the survey help  define areas to develop at IKEA. As a com- plement, the IKEA leadership Index quan- tifies how co-workers view their managers.  SAFE AND HEAlTHY WORKINg  CONDITIONS IKEA strives to offer a safe and healthy  work environment for all our co-workers.  The safety of co-workers and customers is  a top priority at IKEA, and much emphasis  is placed on making sure co-workers get  appropriate training and have access to the  right tools and safety-gear. All co-workers within retail and distribu- tion undergo safety training before starting  to work at IKEA. This includes training on  how to use equipment and machinery, fire  and evacuation training, routines to prevent  and handle workplace accidents, ergonom- ics, etc. If appropriate, co-workers are also  trained on how to handle threats – such as  bomb threats – and robbery situations. Each country shall have its own safety  committee with co-worker representatives,  working actively to secure a safe working  environment. Each IKEA unit also has a  risk manager, responsible for local safety  routines and drills based on the IKEA  Group Risk Manual. Safety work is evalu- ated annually. DIAlOgUE WITH UNIONS IKEA strives to have open and honest dia- logues with co-workers, unions and other  co-worker associations locally and interna- tionally, building and developing construc- tive relationships based on mutual respect.  Through our commitment to this dialogue,  we challenge ourselves, our co-workers and  their associations to find innovative and  sustainable solutions based on the IKEA cul- ture of simplicity and cost-consciousness.  IKEA supports each co-workers right to  freedom of association and does not express  any preference within the institutional and  recognised co-worker associations. We  respect the rights of our co-workers to join,  form or not to join a co-worker association  of their choice without fear of reprisal, inter- ference, intimidation or harassment. STRIvINg FOR DIvERSITY AND  EQUAl OppORTUNITIES We are convinced that IKEA becomes more  creative and dynamic with a diverse work  force, and we strive to recruit co-workers  of different backgrounds and experiences.  The top 800 IKEA managers around the  world represent more than 50 different  nationalities, and our overall ambition is to  have a workforce that mirrors the diverse  IKEA customer base. SUppORT TO FUlFIllINg CAREERS We want our co-workers to have a fulfilling  career and grow with us, both professionally  and personally. Each co-worker is in charge  of his or her own competence development  with continuous support from IKEA.  Co-workers who have mastered their   current job are encouraged to seek new chal- lenges. This could be in the form of more  responsibility or through an alternative  career route inside IKEA by changing location  or work function. The annual development  talk is one opportunity to discuss and outline  career paths as well as training needs.  Competence development in many forms  is available to all, from the introduction of  new co-workers to top management, often   in the form of on-the-job training comple- mented by traditional classroom courses and  a wide range of web-based training activities  for all aspects of IKEA operations.  E-learning activities from the IKEA learn- ing Centre help develop relevant and essen- tial skills for various IKEA functions and reach  many co-workers with the same education.  KEEpINg CO-WORKERS INFORmED Access to relevant information is a neces- sity to enable co-workers to do their job,  but IKEA also wants to build strong rela- tions with co-workers and help them  engage in their workplace with a sense of  value and belonging. Well-functioning  internal communication is a foundation for  our co-workers ability to perform their  tasks and to learn and develop, as well as  for effective leadership. Each manager is responsible for ensuring  that his or her co-workers have the ability  and tools to receive and understand relevant  information. Communication skills are part of  all basic leadership training programmes,  and there are a number of tools and special- ists available to support managers. The IKEA Intranet is complemented by  a variety of different channels such as reg- ular meetings, easily accessible notice  boards and plasma screens, newsletters  and closed-circuit radio. The global co- worker Magazine Readme which is distrib- uted to all co-workers and translated into  19 languages. This magazine is in many  parts of the organisation complemented   by national and local magazines.  In many countries, IKEA has web-  enabled services on the Internet to better  reach co-workers with limited computer  access at work and better access outside  work. Co-workers can log in through the web  browser of any computer or mobile phone to  access a range of simply written benefit  descriptions and self-serve applications relat- ing to wages and benefits, as well as news  and information about various IKEA activities.  TRANSpARENT jOb mARKET  THROUgH jObS AT IKEA We want to make it easy for potential job  applicants to see whether IKEA fits their  needs and aspirations, and we want to  recruit co-workers who will enjoy a long- term career with IKEA. This is why IKEA   values are one important aspect of the Jobs  at IKEA section of the IKEA website. The  content and structure gives an overview of  what it is like to work at IKEA, with co-worker  stories and descriptions of various jobs, and  job applications can be made online. In FY10, IKEA received nearly one million  applications, both for unsolicited and specific  open positions.  SUppORTINg WORK-lIFE bAlANCE Co-workers of different ages are at differ- ent stages of their lives, and have different  professional needs and abilities.   IKEA can meet individual co-worker  needs for work-life balance in various ways,  for example, by offering flexible working  hours, part- or full-time work, more or less  responsibility, job sharing or telecommuting. The way we work IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    33 CO-WORKERS: WhEN WE GROW, IKEA GROWS  COmmENTS TO KpIS AND FIgURES 2010  Overall results from vOICE and the leadership index remain  steady. There is a clear connection between good leadership and   a good working climate, which in turn has a clear connection to  business results. This is why we have ambitious global goals for  FY15. With global goals as a base, national and local improvement  targets are developed from local survey results and the priorities  that are the most important for that particular organisation. There are more women than men working on the IKEA sales  floors, and while the share of women is increasing at management  level, we still have some way to go before we reach our goal of full  gender balance. When the percentage of male/female managers  does not add up to 100, it is due to vacancies.  IKEA operates in a constantly evolving and competitive retail  environment with high staff turnover. however, staff turnover con- tinued to decrease in FY10, as a result of the economic downturn  as well as persistent efforts to increase the retention rate. The  average length of employment for an IKEA co-worker is around  four years, and staff turnover is significantly lower among full- time co-workers.

Our focus is to motivate and support suppliers continuous efforts to improve.  The IKEA code of conduct IWAY has played, and will continue to play, an important role   in positive developments. CElEbRATINg TEN YEARS OF IWAY DEvElOpmENTS  2010 marks the ten-year anniversary for the IKEA code of conduct, IWAY. Our social and environmental  requirements have helped both IKEA and its suppliers to become more responsible and more competi- tive in a society that rightfully expects us to constantly do better. IKEA has started the work to take  IWAY to the next level, making significant efforts to reach full compliance deeper into our supply chains. Since it was first introduced in 2000, IWAY has contributed to many large and small improvements  in the IKEA supply chain. Many suppliers have also experienced that investments in working condi- tions and the environment often lead to more orders, better productivity and improved profitability,  thereby improving competitiveness. So far, hundreds of lakes, rivers and local communities have benefited from IKEA-required waste  water treatment installations at factories, and improved water management has made a huge differ- ence especially in developing countries. hundreds of thousands of workers now know more about  their basic rights, for example about the benefits they are entitled to. They have opportunities to  influence health and safety aspects at their workplace, and many accidents have been prevented  through better fire safety equipment and regular evacuation drills.  Over the years, the focus in IWAY and our work has shifted to be more about what needs to be  achieved rather than on detailing how to do it. This has opened up opportunities for flexible solutions  better adapted to each individual situation, encouraging suppliers to take more responsibility them- selves. Monitoring and audits have remained an important part of securing compliance, but we have  also devoted an increasing amount of resources to supporting and developing suppliers in a number  of key areas in order to strengthen their ability to fulfil and surpass our requirements.  A working group has now started planning for IWAY of the future, which is expected to be ready  for implementation in FY13. The work will involve a variety of internal competencies and external  experts to ensure the best possible scope and content. Ten years of learning guide us   into the future SUppORTINg SUpplIER DEvElOpmENT IKEA representatives are often on-site at suppliers,  where an open dialogue encourages active respons- ibility for social and environmental issues. A new,  systematic approach to home furnishing supplier  development was introduced in FY10. Initially  around 200 suppliers are eligible to be part of a   Supplier Development Programme (SDP). Read more on page 39  Home furnishing suppliers IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    36 SUpplIERS: CODE OF CONDUCT  THE IKEA SUpplY CHAIN IKEA has thousands of suppliers and serv- ice providers covering the wide range of  products and services required for global  operations. In addition to the suppliers of  home furnishing products in the IKEA  range, there are food product suppliers,  goods transport service providers and  companies that provide IKEA with indirect  services and materials. In turn, most of  these have a number of sub-suppliers. Our main focus has been on IKEA home  furnishing suppliers, and on supporting  them in taking responsibility for people and  the environment. IKEA co-workers are  often on-site at these suppliers, and our  close and long-term relationships with  them have contributed to many improve- ments. Over the past few years, IKEA has  gradually increased its efforts to also sup- port developments with the vast range of  other suppliers and service providers.  ClOSE AND lONg-TERm  RElATIONSHIpS The supply chain is often long with numer- ous sub-suppliers. Many IKEA home fur- nishing suppliers operate in developing  countries that struggle with social and  environmental challenges.  We believe IKEA contributes to positive  developments in the supply chain by   being on-site and conducting responsible  business, and by cooperating with others  – companies, authorities and NGOs. IKEA strives to build long-term relation- ships with suppliers who share our values  and want to grow and develop together  with IKEA. Our focus is to motivate and  support suppliers to take more responsibil- ity and ownership themselves, so that  developments become sustainable and  independent of IKEA presence.  THE CODE OF CONDUCT IWAY IWAY is the IKEA code of conduct, first  introduced in 2000. It specifies the require- ments that we place on suppliers of prod- ucts and services. We focus on building the  suppliers understanding of what they need  to comply with so that they can implement  the most suitable measures more inde- pendently. In addition to the main docu- ment, there are several industry-specific  supplements and a special code of conduct  for child labour. IKEA suppliers are respon- sible for communicating the content of the  IKEA code of conduct to their employees  and sub-suppliers.  New suppliers are selected based on   a list of IWAY start-up requirements. This  helps us select suppliers that share our   values and who want to grow and develop  together with us.  Suppliers must comply with the IWAY  start-up requirements before being allowed  to deliver to IKEA, while being given a  maximum implementation time of 12  months from the first delivery date for  other IWAY requirements.  Read more on page 38  Requirements in the IKEA code   of conduct THE IKEA WAY ON pREvENTINg  CHIlD lAbOUR IKEA does not accept child labour and  works actively to prevent it. All IKEA sup- pliers and sub-contractors must comply  with a special code of conduct on child  labour, The IKEA Way on Preventing Child  labour. It has been established in order   to make the IKEA position on child labour  clear to suppliers, their sub-contractors  and their employees, as well as to other  relevant parties. All actions taken shall be  in the best interests of the child.  IKEA conducts regular audits to ensure  that there are no children working on   home furnishing suppliers premises all  over the world. In addition, KPMG, a third- party auditor, conducts unannounced   random checks at hundreds of suppliers  and their sub-contractors in India with spe- cial emphasis on child labour. Third-party  auditor Intertek has started conducting  child labour audits at IKEA sub-suppliers   in bangladesh.

IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    37 SUpplIERS: CODE OF CONDUCT  The IKEA code of conduct – IWAY IWAY specifies the requirements that we place on suppliers of products and services.   Suppliers are responsible for communicating the content of the IKEA code of conduct to  their employees and sub-suppliers. below is a summary of some of the key points of IWAY. 1. lEgAl COmplIANCE The IKEA supplier shall always comply with  the most demanding requirements whether  they are relevant applicable laws or IKEA  IWAY specific requirements. 2. START-Up REQUIREmENTS The following criteria need to be fulfilled  before starting up a business relationship  with IKEA:  No child labour  No forced or bonded labour  No severe environmental pollution  No severe safety hazards  A transparent and reliable system for  records of working hours and wages  Insurance covering medical treatment  for work related accidents to all workers 3. ENvIRONmENTAl STANDARDS Suppliers shall have plans in place to  reduce the environmental impacts   from their production and operations.   Suppliers must:  Work to reduce energy consumption  Prevent pollution to air, ground   and water  Handle, store and dispose of chemicals  and hazardous waste in an environ- mentally safe manner  Ensure that workers handling chemicals  and hazardous waste have the right  competence and are adequately trained 4.  SOCIAl AND WORKINg  CONDITIONS IKEA expects its suppliers to respect   fundamental human rights, and to treat  their workers fairly and with respect.   Suppliers must:  Provide a healthy and safe working  environment  Provide health and safety training   for workers  Ensure their buildings are safe, have  reasonable privacy, are quiet and   have facilities for personal hygiene,   in those instances where housing   facilities are provided  Pay at least the minimum legal wage  and compensate for overtime  Base overtime on voluntary agree- ments, not exceeding legal limits  Allow time off and regular breaks  Not discriminate on any basis  Not prevent workers from exercising  collective bargaining activities  Not accept corporal punishment,   threats of violence or other forms of  mental or physical coercion The IKEA Way on preventing Child labour The IKEA Way on preventing Child labour details the IKEA position on child labour and  specifies mandatory requirements for IKEA suppliers and their sub-contractors. Below is a  summary of the key points. 1. gENERAl pRINCIplE IKEA does not accept child labour. IKEA  supports the United Nations (UN) Conven- tion on the Rights of the Child (1989). Our  position is also based on the International  labour Organisation (IlO) Minimum Age  Convention no. 138 and the Worst Forms of  Child labour convention no.182. 2. ImplEmENTATION IKEA requires that all suppliers shall recog- nise the UN Convention on the Rights of  the Child, and take actions to prevent child  labour. Suppliers must comply with all relevant  national and international laws, regulations  and provisions applicable in the country of  production. If child labour is found in any place of pro- duction, IKEA requires the supplier to  implement an immediate corrective action  plan. The corrective action plan shall take  the childs best interests into consideration  and enable more viable and sustainable  alternatives for the childs development. 3. YOUNg WORKERS IKEA supports the legal employment of  young workers. Young workers of legal  working age have, until the age of 18, the  right to be protected.  IKEA requires all its suppliers to ensure  that young workers are treated according  to the law, including measures to avoid  hazardous jobs, night shifts and ensure  minimum wages. limits for working hours  and overtime should be set with special  consideration to the workers young age. 4. lAbOUR FORCE REgISTER Suppliers shall maintain documentation   for every worker verifying the workers  date of birth. 5. mONITORINg Suppliers are obliged to keep IKEA informed  at all times about all places of production  (including their sub-contractors). IKEA has  reserved the right to make unannounced  visits at any time to all places of production  (including their sub-contractors) of IKEA  products. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    38 SUpplIERS: CODE OF CONDUCT / IWAY  IKEA is a production-oriented company, and we are often on-site in the factories. This active  presence and a solid understanding of production terms give us influence and the opportu- nity to take on an active role in supplier development. Over the next few years, prioritised  suppliers will be eligible for development programmes in six different categories. INTRODUCINg SUpplIER DEvElOpmENT pROgRAmmES  A new, systematic approach to home furnishing supplier development was introduced in FY10. All  1,074 IKEA home furnishing suppliers have been classified based on capacity, performance and long- term potential, including sustainability aspects. Initially, around 200 suppliers with the highest prior- ity classification are eligible to be part of a Supplier Development Programme (SDP). During the SDP analysis phase, IKEA identifies a limited number of suppliers with particular  potential to improve within a specific area, and offers support for a certain period of time. Support  can be provided within six main categories: sustainability, purchasing (including raw materials),  logistics, manufacturing, quality and product development.  SDP Sustainability focuses on two sub-categories: energy and water. Forestry issues and several  other environmental aspects of suppliers activities, such as raw material utilisation, are sub-categories  covered by other SDP categories.  gOAl TO REACH 100 pERCENT IWAY COmplIANCE bY END FY12 One of the goals in our new Sustainability Direction is that all IKEA home furnishing suppliers shall  comply with all requirements in the code of conduct IWAY by the end of FY12. New suppliers must  comply with the IWAY start-up requirements before being allowed to deliver to IKEA, while being  given a maximum implementation time of 12 months from the first delivery date for other IWAY  requirements.  It is realistic to expect challenges to achieve full IWAY compliance by FY12 among suppliers in  some Asian countries. For instance, full IWAY compliance in China will take longer since there are  major challenges related to freedom of association and working hours. There is a wide gap between  legislated working hours and reality in China. The high share of migrant workers in China means   that in some regions an 80 hour working week is not uncommon. We have decided to take a step- wise approach to meeting this challenge by working with our suppliers to first secure a maximum  60-hour total work week by the end of FY12 and then work towards the legal limit of 40 working  hours per week plus a maximum of 36 overtime hours per month.  Further, IWAY states that workers should have freedom of association. Today, Chinese legislation  restricts this, and it is not possible for our Chinese suppliers to comply with our requirement. To improve  social and working conditions in China, IKEA cooperates with other international companies and organi- sations while also seeking support from Chinese authorities. In the meantime, the IWAY requirement on  health & Safety Committees allows Chinese workers to give input on their working situation. INCREASED EFFORTS TO SECURE IWAY AT SUb-SUpplIERS  The work to secure the IKEA code of conduct IWAY at sub-suppliers has progressed and we have  increased our support to suppliers in their work to implement and maintain the IWAY requirements at  sub-suppliers units. We have also increased the number of sub-supplier audits. Read more on   page 36–38  IWAY code of conduct A new generation of supplier development  programmes IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    39 SUpplIERS: hOME FURNIShING SUPPlIERS  Updated global guidelines on how to work with suppliers on IWAY and to better secure the require- ments at sub-suppliers were introduced in FY10. The work with sub-suppliers is primarily focused   on compliance with the IWAY start-up requirements at those sub-suppliers that are categorised   as critical.  The purchasing organisation in South Asia, where suppliers often use many sub-suppliers that can  be home-based and/or spread over a large geographical area, has developed a web-based real-time  database of sub-suppliers. here, suppliers continuously update details on their sub-suppliers to the  end of the supply chain, providing the necessary details to allow for concentrated improvement  efforts as well as unannounced audits in high-risk areas. IKEA is currently looking into a common  database solution that can be used where todays systems do not meet IKEAs needs. IWAY CAlIbRATION AND TRAININg ACTIvITIES  The Compliance and Monitoring Group (CMG) has conducted a large number of IWAY calibration  activities during the year following the updated IWAY requirements in FY09. This has given those working with IWAY the opportunity to take part in discussions and workshops  in the factories aimed at clarifying the revised IWAY requirements and increasing understanding. COOpERATINg WITH OTHERS   ON CHAllENgINg TOpICS IKEA believes that cooperation with others helps us  achieve more than we could on our own, not least  when it comes to challenging areas and topics that   are not unique for IKEA. For example, in South Asia,  we collaborate with other retailers to support positive  developments related to wages and compensation,   as well as code of conduct implementation at sub-  suppliers. In northwestern vietnam, Save the Children  has helped us educate 1,500 parents and village influ- encers in childrens rights to prevent child labour in the  often home-based textile industry. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    40 SUpplIERS: hOME FURNIShING SUPPlIERS  IWAY SUppORT AND mONITORINg IKEA co-workers from our local and  regional IKEA Trading Service Offices are  often on-site at suppliers factories to sup- port and motivate suppliers to implement  and maintain IWAY requirements. Their  active presence contributes to suppliers  development.  IKEA auditors regularly visit suppliers   to ensure that IWAY criteria are met. These  visits can be both announced and unan- nounced. Over the last few years, the  number of unannounced audits has in- creased substantially. These give us a   more accurate picture of suppliers facto- ries and help us focus support to specific  areas of non-compliance. Each supplier is audited at least every  second year, and more frequently in some  countries based on risk assessment. IKEA  auditors help with action plans when there  is non-compliance, and they conduct follow- up visits to review progress.  There are clear mandatory directions  for how to conduct audits, what the conse- quences are in case of incompliance, how  to follow up, etc. Incompliance with the  IWAY start-up requirements leads to im- mediate stop of deliveries, while suppliers  have up to 90 days to implement corrective  actions in case of non-compliance with  other requirements. Once non-compliance  with start-up requirements is resolved,  suppliers are still on probation for six  months with intensified monitoring.   Non-compliance data are followed up   on a monthly basis. The IKEA Compliance and Monitoring   group (CMG) is responsible for ensuring  that the same audit judgement level and  follow-up procedures are used worldwide.  This is done through separate calibration  activities and training as well as compli- ance audits to verify results. Together  these ensure a common audit and imple- mentation standard. Third-party auditors such as KPMG,  Intertek Testing Services and Pricewater- houseCoopers verify IKEA working meth- ods and audit results. These third-party  auditors also conduct their own audits at  IKEA suppliers.  SUpplIERS RESpONSIblE FOR IWAY  AT SUb-SUpplIERS A sub-supplier is defined as a company  supplying services, raw material, compo- nents, and/or production capacity to an  IKEA supplier. It is the responsibility of the  IKEA suppliers to ensure that their sub- suppliers acknowledge, understand and  accept the IWAY requirements. however,  the IKEA supply chain is often long, and  ensuring IWAY compliance at many thou- sands of sub-suppliers represents a major  challenge. IKEA initiates wood supply chain audits  at sub-suppliers of wood raw material for  IKEA products. For other types of sub-  suppliers outside of suppliers premises,   we conduct a limited number of IWAY  audits. These audits primarily target sub- suppliers who produce a main part of an  IKEA product and those who use processes  recognised as potentially harmful to the  environment or to the health or safety of  workers. Audits also target sub-suppliers  operating in an industry or supply setup  that is prone to child labour and/or forced  and bonded labour. COOpERATION WITH bSR ON   ONE vOICE – bEYOND mONITORINg business for Social Responsibility (bSR)   is an organisation developing socially  responsible business solutions for many   of the worlds leading corporations. IKEA   is part of the bSR project One voice –  beyond Monitoring to address corporate  social responsibility challenges in China.  Read more about business   for Social Responsibility at   www.bsr.org The way we work IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    41 SUpplIERS: hOME FURNIShING SUPPlIERS  COmmENTS ON KpIS AND FIgURES 2010  The total number of IKEA suppliers has decreased over the last  few years, which means that the total number of audits conducted  has also decreased. however, the average number of audits per  supplier has increased somewhat. Each supplier is audited at least  every second year, and more frequently in some regions based on  risk assessment. The number of unannounced audits has  increased substantially over the last few years. Our new overall goal is that all home furnishing suppliers shall  be IWAY approved by the end of FY12, and, in general, compliance  is moving in the right direction on all three continents. To achieve full IWAY compliance by FY12 among suppliers in  some Asian countries we face challenges relating to, for instance,  working hours, minimum legal wages and social insurance. Although we have made progress, working hours continue to  be above legal requirements and international norms in some  regions. It is also true that in China and vietnam legal restriction  regarding freedom of association prevents suppliers from meeting  IWAY requirements. In both of these cases, although not fully  approving the suppliers, we have given an exception to these  questions in order to work with suppliers to solve issues that are  complex and not always fully under their own control.  China  There is a wide gap between legislated working hours and reality  in China. The high share of migrant workers in China means that  in some regions an 80 hour working week is not uncommon.  We have decided to take a step-wise approach to meeting this  challenge by working with our suppliers to first secure a maximum  60-hour total work week by the end of FY12 and then work  towards the legal limit of 40 working hours per week plus a maxi- mum of 36 overtime hours per month. We feel this is a realistic and pragmatic approach, and as we will  continue to have a long-term relationship with most of our suppliers  this will lead to a more sustainable implementation of IWAY.   Our requirement regarding freedom of association contradicts  Chinese legislation, and it is not currently possible for our Chinese  suppliers to comply. The development of workers health and  safety committees has provided workers with a voice in their every- day working conditions. however, this still does not represent  freedom of association.  Still, only 7 percent of Chinese suppliers are IWAY approved  with the above exceptions taken into consideration. Achieving full  compliance with social insurance requirements remains a chal- lenge, but we are progressing and have secured full coverage of  accident insurance in FY10.  We have also seen steady progress related to chemical and  waste management, fire prevention and workers health and  safety, and today the average IWAY fulfilment rate for Chinese  suppliers is 93 percent.  South Asia South Asia shows significantly improved IWAY approval rates, most  notably when it comes to working hours. Excessive overtime is  common in the region, but our focused efforts to support suppliers  with guidelines and action plans have led to substantial improve- ments. Compliance with requirements related to wages, benefits  and working hours increased to 92.2 percent from 82.5 percent.  South East Asia South East Asia, too, shows improvements in almost all IWAY  requirement categories. however, the region continues to face  challenges related to working hours, which is primarily due to leg- islation in Thailand that allows for a total of 84 hours worked per  week. We have again begun to work with our suppliers to take a  step-by-step approach to meeting a 60-hour work week and a  fully sustainable IWAY implementation by the end of FY12.

In FY10, customer delivery transport providers started implementing IWAY to secure our  requirements on social and environmental responsibility. INTRODUCINg IWAY AT CUSTOmER DElIvERY TRANSpORT pROvIDERS  IKEAs long-haul ocean and land transport service providers have been covered by the code of con- duct IWAY since 2005. In FY10, IKEA expanded the IWAY scope to include customer delivery carriers  that transport products from our customer distribution centres (CDC) directly to IKEA customers. These carriers generally use smaller vehicles to transport products to customers homes. In the  first year, eight customer delivery carriers representing 20 percent of our total expenditure in this  category were audited and approved as compliant with IWAY as well as the industry-specific require- ments. This indicates a generally high level of preparedness in the industry with regard to the issues  included in IWAY.  The goal is that these carriers as well as the long-haul carriers shall comply with IWAY and the  industry-specific requirements by the end of FY12. New suppliers must comply with the IWAY start- up requirements before being allowed to deliver to IKEA, while being given a maximum implementa- tion time of nine months for all other requirements.  ClEAN CARgO DATA TO bE USED FOR pROCUREmENT  IKEA is part of the Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG), a project under business for Social Responsi- bility (bSR). The Environmental Performance Matrix, which maps ocean carriers environmental  impact, was developed in FY09, and carriers have provided data for both FY09 and FY10.  IWAY SUppORT AND mONITORINg IKEA products are transported by road,   rail and sea between suppliers, distribution  centres and IKEA stores, and from our  stores home to our customers. IKEA audits its transport service provid- ers at least every 24 months to monitor  compliance with our code of conduct IWAY,  including the transport industry-specific  requirements.  In addition, IKEA transport social &  environmental developers engage in dia- logue with transport service providers on   a regular basis to support best-practice  exchanges between suppliers and to make  sure transport service providers conduct  their own internal audits annually.

IKEA will only procure trans- port services from suppliers who achieve a  minimum score (100 points in Europe, and  50 points in Russia, Ukraine & Asia Pacific)  in the ranking developed under ERRT. The  survey, and hence ranking, includes the  impact from the largest sub-contractors to  give a better overview of a carriers total  situation. In North America, the minimum  requirements to procure land and customer  delivery carriers is that they must be a  member of the U.S. Environmental Protec- tion Agency (EPA) Smartway programme,  and have a score of 1.0 or above.

Approval rates in all three carrier categories exceeded the  goals set for FY10, reflecting the industrys responsiveness to  demands from customers and society within the social and envi- ronmental area. In FY10, customer delivery carriers were audited  for the first time, and all audited carriers were also approved,   indicating a high level of preparedness in this sector. IKEA uses a limited number of ocean carriers, and the sharp  increase in approvals follows the audits of a handful of carriers that  represent a large share of our total expenditure in this category.

INTRODUCINg IWAY AT NATIONAl FOOD SUpplIERS IKEA has taken a first step towards implementing our code of conduct IWAY at national food suppli- ers. All national food suppliers are expected to have signed the IWAY Compliance Commitment by the  end of 2010, and they will have a maximum of 12 months to implement the code of conduct.  IKEA realises that monitoring and auditing the many national food suppliers will be a challenge,  requiring both resources and time. The first IWAY audits among more than a thousand national food  suppliers are expected to be conducted in FY12, with around 100 suppliers selected for audits based  on risk assessment.  Introducing IWAY at national   food suppliers IKEA bRANDED   FOOD pRODUCTS The IKEA branded food prod- ucts sold in the Swedish Food  Market in-store are produced  by some 40 suppliers. The FY10  range consisted of 90 products,  and approximately 50 new  products will be launched over  the next year. All IKEA branded  food products are based on  Swedish recipes and traditions.

The global range,  bought from 90 suppliers, is the same in   all IKEA stores worldwide. In addition,   each country purchases food for the local  part of the menu. REQUIREmENTS ON FOOD SUpplIERS In addition to the requirements in IWAY,  IKEA food suppliers must fulfil a number of  industry-specific requirements. Global food suppliers compliance of IWAY  requirements is monitored by IKEA audi- tors. In FY12, audits at national food suppli- ers will be introduced.  The IKEA Compliance and Monitoring  group (CMG) is responsible for ensuring  that the same audit judgement level and  follow-up procedures are used worldwide.  This is done through separate calibration  activities and training as well as compli- ance audits to verify results. Together  these ensure a common audit and imple- mentation standard. The food-specific requirements are not  part of the IWAY audits. however, all global     food suppliers must have an approved food  safety management certification, such as  the bRC Global Standard for Food Safety,  and provide relevant documentation to  prove this. National food suppliers must  have a hazard Analysis Critical Control  Point (hACCP) system in place, and pro- vide documentation upon request.

In FY10, we decided to develop code of conduct audit procedures  and will conduct the first audits during FY11. INTRODUCINg SYSTEmATIC AUDITS FOR CATAlOgUE SUpplIERS IKEA Catalogue suppliers have provided regular information on environmental performance and com- pliance towards the IKEA Catalogue Sustainability Requirements since 2002.  At the end of FY10, IKEA decided to conduct systematic audits of IKEA Catalogue suppliers. We  have started to develop audit procedures and train internal resources to conduct audits based on the  IKEA Catalogue Sustainability Requirements. The first audits will be conducted during FY11. IKEA mONITORS THE  ImpACT OF THE CATAlOgUE All IKEA Catalogue suppliers are  required to report water and  energy consumption, as well as  emissions to water and air. This  data is used by IKEA to calculate  the environmental impact indica- tors per catalogue copy annually. THE IKEA CATAlOgUE IS OUR mAIN  mARKETINg CHANNEl The IKEA Catalogue has been an indispen- sable way of communicating the IKEA  range to our customers. The IKEA Cata- logue 2011 (produced in FY10) was printed  in more than 197 million copies in 29 lan- guages and 61 editions. It is read by more  than 400 million people in 38 countries.  STRIvINg FOR SUSTAINAblE  CATAlOgUE pRODUCTION All catalogue suppliers document data on  fibre sourcing and use; water and energy  consumption; as well as emissions to water  and air. Using this information, IKEA  reports the catalogues environmental  impact per copy. The IKEA Catalogue was the first major  colour publication in the world to be printed  on TCF (Totally Chlorine Free) paper. The  bleaching technology in the paper and pulp  industry has developed since then, and the  focus is on avoiding the use of elementary  chlorine. Today, the paper we use for the  IKEA Catalogue is a mix of both TCF and  ECF (Elementary Chlorine Free) paper.  In FY08-09, we moved to a new com- pact format for the IKEA Catalogue to  reduce paper consumption and cut trans- portation needs. This also resulted in lower  CO2 emissions per copy. The way we work IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    50 SUpplIERS: CATAlOGUE SUPPlIERS  Industry-specific requirements for IKEA Catalogue suppliers IKEA catalogue suppliers must comply with the IKEA Catalogue Sustainability Require- ments, which are based on the code of conduct IWAY, as well as industry-specific require- ments for pulp and paper suppliers; artwork, repro and IT online service suppliers; and for  gravure and offset printing suppliers. below is a summary of key points in the industry- specific requirements. 1. pUlp AND pApER SUpplIERS:  The origin of wood fibres for pulp and  paper must be known  Virgin wood fibre must comply with  IKEA wood requirements  No elementary chlorine used for bleach- ing processes  All transport of fibre, pulp and paper  must be documented  Use of energy must be documented   and energy reduction targets set  Use of energy from renewable sources  must be reported  Specific limits on emissions to air   and water 2.  ARTWORK, REpRO AND IT ONlINE  SERvICE SUpplIERS:  A procedure to take environmental  aspects into consideration when pur- chasing computers and screens  Reuse or recycling/destruction of   discarded electronics by authorised  companies  Use of energy must be documented   and energy reduction targets set 3. gRAvURE pRINTERS:  Safe plating processes and safe   chrome management  Documentation of production and   paper consumption  Use of energy must be documented   and energy reduction targets set  Clean water consumption must   be documented  Emissions to air and water must   be documented  All transport related to printed   products must be documented 4. OFFSET pRINTERS:  Safe discard of plate developer  Documentation of production and paper  consumption, including waste  Use of energy must be documented   and energy reduction targets set  Clean water consumption must be   documented  Emissions to air and water must be   documented  All transport related to printed products  must be documented   COmmENTS ON KpIS AND FIgURES 2010 The IKEA Catalogue 2011 (produced in FY10) involved a total of  39 suppliers. Overall, the industry-specific environmental data has  improved, reflecting increased integration of sustainability aspects  in the purchasing process and in supplier selection. Energy con- sumption and CO2 emissions have continued to decrease, and the  share of certified fibres has increased. however, vOC emissions per copy have increased. This increase  has been identified to derive from two large-volume printing sup- pliers. An investigation has been started together with the suppli- ers, and there will be corrective action plans.

Thats why the IKEA Foundation works in partnership  with UNICEF and Save the Children to make a difference for millions of children in need  around the world by reducing malnutrition and infant disease, and by dramatically improv- ing literacy. ExTENDED COmmITmENT TO HEAlTH pROjECTS UNICEFs child survival programmes in India focus on improving the health and nutrition of children,  and increasing the number of children surviving their first five years. The programme supported by  the IKEA Foundation consists of three parts: the health projects involve immunization, maternal and  child care, and establishment of sick born care units; the nutrition projects focus on advocating for  breastfeeding and nutritious food for children and expecting mothers; and the water and sanitation  projects aim at ensuring water safety and better sanitation in households and institutions.  In FY10, the IKEA Foundation decided to invest an additional 7.5 million euro in UNICEFs water  and sanitation programme – which is a doubling of previous donations. This support will help expand  the scope of this programme in 15 states.  Close to 80 percent of all childhood deaths in India take place within the first year of the childs  life, and the majority of these deaths occur in the first week. The IKEA Foundation supports UNICEFs  approach of setting up model Sick Newborn Care Units in district hospitals, providing essential  instruments, training staff and renovating premises. here, vulnerable newborn babies receive essen- tial care to survive their first days and weeks of life. The initial model sick newborn care unit funded  by the IKEA Foundation has now been scaled up by the Indian government, 213 are operational and  291 clinics are due to open in 15 states. In addition, the IKEA Foundation decided to invest 1.8 million euro in the US Columbia Universitys  Earths Institute programme in Indias Uttar Pradesh. The donation will be used to set up model dis- tricts to help give poor rural families greater access to health care. This support complements the  UNICEF child survival programmes funded by the IKEA Foundation. COTTON pROjECT vIllAgES IN pAKISTAN AFFECTED bY FlOODS The IKEA Foundation supports UNICEF and Save the Children child rights projects running 2009– 2015 covering a number of cotton producing states in India and Pakistan.

In addition, the IKEA Foundation appealed to IKEA FAMIlY members to support a web-based  donation campaign benefiting UNICEF and Save the Childrens emergency work in Pakistan.  SUppORT TO HAITI EARTHQUAKE vICTImS On January 12, 2010, an earthquake devastated impoverished haitis capital, Port-au-Prince, leaving  three million people in urgent need of assistance. The IKEA Foundation supported the earthquake   victims with around 100,000 IKEA products, such as pillows and quilts.  UNDp pROjECT TO EmpOWER WOmEN mAKES pROgRESS  The IKEA Foundation has a long history of investing in projects attacking the root causes of child labour  in India. As women are important change agents to create a better future for children, the IKEA Foun- dation initiated a cooperation with UNDP in 2009. The programme aims to empower 50,000 women in  Uttar Pradesh to become entrepreneurs, leaders, role models and agents of change.  The project is progressing as planned. During the first 18 months of the project, 3,000 women  have received training on credit management, and a dairy production company employing 12,000  women and a craft-producing company employing 5,000 women have been established. The goal for the end of 2013 is that the women supported by the project achieve a secure and  enhanced income and effectively participate and contribute to decision-making in domestic and   public spheres.

In 2010, IKEA Social Initiative- funded programmes were included in the  Stichting IKEA Foundation (the IKEA Founda- tion), and all programmes will be executed in  the name of the IKEA Foundation as of 2011.  The IKEA Foundation is a Dutch charit- able foundation, funded by the Stichting  INGKA Foundation, which also owns the  IKEA Group parent company, INGKA hold- ing b.v. Donations from the Stichting IKEA  Foundation during 2010 total an estimated  45 million euro. The IKEA Foundation funds holistic,  long-term programmes addressing chil- drens fundamental needs with the aim to  create substantial and lasting change –  enabling them to eventually take charge of  their own future. We work with strong strategic partners  to achieve large scale results by addressing  four fundamentals in childrens lives – a  place to call home, a healthy start in life, a  quality education and a sustainable family  income – whilst applying innovative solu- tions to accelerate development.

HEAlTH, EDUCATION AND WOmENS  EmpOWERmENT The IKEA Foundation focuses its long-term  programmes on three areas; a healthy  start in life; education and protection; and   womens empowerment. Over the pro- gramme period, the IKEA Foundation has  committed 125 million euro to these pro- grammes in South Asia.  The way we work IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    54 COmmUNITIES: ThE IKEA FOUNDATION  The support to child survival programmes  in India with UNICEF and Earth Institute  totals approximately 68 million euro over  the project period. The education and pro- tection programmes with Save the Children  and UNICEF in the cotton-seed and cotton  producing areas of India and Pakistan, as  well as the UNICEF projects in the carpet  belt and metal ware industry of Uttar  Pradesh, India, will benefit from a 51 mil- lion euro donation over the project period.  The women empowerment programme  with UNDP is funded with 5.5 million euro  over the project period.  A healthy start in life  Since 2007, the IKEA Foundation supports  UNICEF programmes in 18 Indian states  aimed at increasing child survival rates as  well as improving their life-long develop- ment. Strong emphasis is placed on pre- ventive health, Nutrition and Water and  Environmental Sanitation initiatives. It  reaches out to 80 million children and   10 million women with proven low-cost  actions that have a big impact on child and  maternal survival. Child rights in cotton and carpet areas The IKEA Foundation believes that children  everywhere have the right to be protected  from exploitation, abuse and neglect. All  children should have access to quality edu- cation, and child labour is unacceptable.  between 2009 and 2015, some 10 million  children will benefit from the IKEA Founda- tion-supported programmes, managed by  UNICEF and Save the Children. Close to  20,000 villages in the carpet-making dis- tricts of India and in the cotton- and cotton  seed-growing areas in India and Pakistan  will benefit.  Womens empowerment Women and mothers are important change  agents for improving childrens well-being  and achieving lasting change in society.  This is why all programmes supported by  the IKEA Foundation include community- based actions that help empower women to  create a better future for themselves, their  communities and their children. A specific  cooperation with UNDP will enhance the  social, economic and political empower- ment of 50,000 women in 500 villages. THE IKEA SOFT TOYS CAmpAIgN During the holiday season at the end of  each year, one euro for every soft toy sold  in IKEA stores worldwide is donated, split  between Save the Children and UNICEF  projects aimed at improving childrens edu- cation.

Financial support can be pro- vided to assist with the mid- and long-  term recovery in the aftermath of disasters  such as earthquakes, floods and cyclones.  To support immediate humanitarian  relief efforts during major emergencies,  the IKEA Foundation helps with in-kind  donations of IKEA products such as blan- kets, cooking utensils and comforting   soft toys.  IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    55 COmmUNITIES: ThE IKEA FOUNDATION  On top of the IKEA Foundations commitment to improving the life opportunities of the  many children, IKEA wants to be a good neighbour in the local community. This means  that all IKEA units shall engage in local social and environmental issues, and lend a help- ing hand in times of need. mANY lOCAl INITIATIvES TO SUppORT THE lOCAl COmmUNITY Our efforts to be a good neighbour in the local community are reflected in a wide range of activities  initiated by IKEA stores, distribution centres and offices. Below are a few examples of national and  local activities that have taken place during the year to support social and environmental causes. All Canadian IKEA stores and their 4,500 co-workers help Make-A-Wish Canada grant room  makeover wishes to children living with life-threatening medical conditions. Stores donate products  in-kind and IKEA co-workers offer inspirational home furnishing expertise. In addition, customers  were invited to donate $1 CAD to the organisation at the self-serve check-outs during July–September  to help Make-A-Wish Canada create lasting memories for deserving children. In Germany, Operation Daywork offers students aged 15 and over a day off school to support  children around the world. Their wages are donated towards building schools in countries such as  Rwanda, Sudan and Angola. In FY10, IKEA provided 330 students with work as part of Operation  Daywork, and donated 20,000 euro. IKEA  wants to be a good neighbour  in the local community SUppORTINg SOW A SEED IN bORNEO  IKEA supports Sow a Seed, a project aiming to reforest and maintain  18,500 hectares of lowland forest in Sabah in Malaysian borneo, and  to protect the area from logging for a period of 50 years. Since the  start in 1998, nearly 9,500 hectares of forest have been replanted  with native tree species. The project has also contributed to the  building of homes, meeting places for social events, and field accom- modations for more than 150 local workers and their families.   The planting phase is expected to be completed in 2013, and funds  have been set aside for maintenance until 2023. The project also  provides three years of research funding for the Swedish University  of Agricultural Sciences.  Sow a Seed is a partnership between IKEA, the Swedish University  of Agricultural Sciences, the Yayasan Sabah Group and the Malaysian  forestry company RbJ.

The Perryville distribution centre in Maryland, US, helped the Cecil County Domestic violence and  Rape Crisis Center by carrying out a 5,000 USD refurbishment of the facility. Co-workers volunteered  their time to paint and furnish the kitchen, the office, the foyer and the basement tweens room.  In the UK, IKEA Coventry participates in Operation Christmas Child, run by the Samaritans  Purse charity. In FY10, the store donated display toys and various IKEA products to orphans and chil- dren in need, and this Christmas all co-workers were encouraged to donate toys, educational sup- plies, hygiene products and sweets, pack then in shoeboxes and wrap them as gifts. IKEA Trading North America made a donation of 5,000 USD to help restore the buffalo bend  Nature Park outside houston, Texas. The money was used to buy 140 trees, which were planted by  IKEA co-workers. In Russia, IKEA and the Kirov Certification and Quality Centre work together with a Russian forest  concession owner to help find ways of getting additional income from a well-managed forest without  increasing logging. Job opportunities and extra income can be generated from, for example, berries,  mushrooms and honey, as well as from hunting. glObAl, NATIONAl AND lOCAl  COmmUNITY pROjECTS IKEA engages in community projects   at a global level as well as nationally and  locally, supporting projects that are  designed to match the needs of the com- munities in which they take place.  As part of our commitment to being   a good neighbour, most IKEA stores are  actively involved in their local communities  in partnership with carefully selected  organisations. The IKEA FAMIlY customer  club, with more than 38 million members   in 23 countries, is sometimes used to also  engage IKEA customers in various commu- nity projects. There are many examples of  national and local community projects,  which can be found on the IKEA website. For more information on what  IKEA is doing in your country,  please visit www.IKEA.com THE IKEA CHARITY pOlICY IKEA has a Charity Policy and Community  Involvement Guidelines for global, national  and local community support. The guide- lines clarify principles and definitions, what  kind of projects IKEA prefers to support  and with which type of partners. They also  provide guidance on how to structure  projects, as well as how to work with  accounting. All IKEA-sponsored projects should  focus on prioritised social and/or environ- mental issues. The prioritised social issues  are related to children, the homeless, and  victims of emergencies and/or natural   disasters. The prioritised environmental  issues are related to the protection of natu- ral resources, climate change, and educa- tion and training in these areas. WWF, UNICEF AND SAvE THE  CHIlDREN ARE KEY pARTNERS UNICEF, Save the Children and WWF   are the preferred partners in community  projects supported by IKEA.

Our IWAY   Forestry requirements demand the legality and traceability of the timber used in our   products, which means that the IKEA standard is applied throughout the supply chain.   In addition to these minimum requirements, our certified wood volumes increased   substantially in FY10. The decision has also been taken to apply IWAY Forestry require- ments to suppliers of board materials.  SUbSTANTIAl INCREASE OF CERTIFIED WOOD vOlUmES  The share of certified solid wood increased substantially in FY10 to 23.6 percent, from 16.2 percent  the year before. This improvement is a result of several factors. In 2009, certified wood areas increased by 15 million hectares globally, thus increasing the overall  availability of certified wood. IKEA has actively supported certification efforts in some of our key  wood sourcing areas, notably Russia, in cooperation with WWF and the national FSC organisation.  Chinese certified forest areas have also increased substantially as a result of a cooperation between  IKEA, WWF and other parties.  All Swedwood and Swedspan production units, with one exception, are now FSC chain-of-custody  certified. All Swedwood forest leases are also Forest Management-certified. Nearly 42 percent of  Swedwoods solid wood is FSC-certified. IKEA FORESTRY REQUIREmENTS FOR bOARD mATERIAlS As of September 1, 2010, the IKEA forestry requirements for wood also apply to board materials.  This means that the volume of wood-based products covered by our requirements has more than  doubled compared to before, when the requirements applied only to solid wood products. Applying IKEA forestry requirements to board materials means that IKEA suppliers must imple- ment systems to ensure that our requirements, including legality of the wood used in the board, are  met. board product suppliers and key sub-suppliers have been consulted, and practical trials have  been performed as part of preparations during FY10. IKEA purchasing teams have been trained by  IKEA forestry specialists on the requirements and how to provide support to suppliers. In addition,  our IWAY auditors have had specific training on monitoring this new scope.  The work to set goals for the volume of certified board material is expected to be completed in  FY11. Many of the roughly 100 board product suppliers are expected to achieve full compliance from  the start but will have four months to adjust to the new requirements and put action plans in place  before being subject to normal noncompliance consequences. Some implementation challenges are  expected in China and South East Asia, while most European and Russian suppliers are well prepared  to meet the new requirements.  IKEA is in active dialogue with both product suppliers and key board material manufacturers with  the aim of facilitating and encouraging increased use of certified wood in all IKEA wood-based products.  Read more on page 62  IKEA requirements   for wood used in   IKEA products More certified wood volumes and wider  scope for IKEA  requirements IKEA AND WWF HElp INCREASE CERTIFICATION IN CHINA A joint IKEA and WWF project has helped increase the FSC-certified  area in Northeast China. So far, six Chinese forest bureaus have had   a total of 1.4 million hectares of forest certified, representing 88 per- cent of the total FSC-certified area in China. The project has also  mapped high conservation value forests, with tiger conservation as   a key indicator, and developed forest management plans for nine   forest bureaus in the area.  Read more about the IKEA and  WWF cooperation on forestry at  www.panda.org/IKEA IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    59 ENvIRONmENT: FORESTRY  ExTRA EFFORTS TO SECURE lEgAl WOOD SOURCINg IN CHINA During the year, IKEA purchasing teams and forestry specialists have focused efforts on helping   Chinese suppliers to improve their procedures to secure that the wood they use for IKEA products  comes from legal sources.  All business dialogues have systematically included discussions around illegal logging, and we  have conducted a large number of wood supply chain audits in China. In addition, IKEA has helped  several suppliers identify controversial wood sources and supported their efforts to replace them   with safer alternatives. More than 80 audits were conducted by IKEA or third-party auditors in China in FY10. A small  share of this audited volume, 4.2 percent, was not approved due to unclear origin or non-compliant  procedures. however, none of these audits showed any evidence of illegal wood in the supply chain.  pREpARED FOR lEgISlATION AgAINST IllEgAl lOggINg The lacey Act in the United States prohibited import of products containing illegally felled wood  already in 2008. Similar legislation will be introduced in the EU after 2012 and is being discussed in  Australia, Switzerland and Japan. IKEA welcomes such legislation, as it helps motivate and drive glo- bal improvements in forestry management. IKEA is well prepared to meet these new demands. We are increasing our use of FSC-certified  wood and have long had systems in place to avoid questionable wood entering the supply chain.   This means that we can expect to comply with the demands for appropriate due diligence systems. TWO NEW AllIANCES TO pROmOTE lEgAl WOOD TRADE In FY10, IKEA joined two alliances aimed at promoting legal wood trade through functional market  regulation. IKEA and other retailers launched the Timber Retail Coalition (TRC) in April 2010 to help ensure  minimum ethical standards for all timber and wood products sold in the European Union. The TRC will  work to promote the introduction of EU-wide regulation on timber sourcing practices. by providing a  single platform for engaging with policymakers, the TRC will support measures to curb illegal logging  by ensuring that illegally harvested timber products do not have easy access to the EU marketplace.  To influence and support the development of tools and guidelines based on the U.S. Lacey Act,  IKEA joined the Forest legality Alliance (FlA). FlA is a joint effort of the World Resources Institute  and the Environmental Investigation Agency, supported by the United States Agency for International  Development and companies in the forest sector. The goal is to reduce illegal logging through sup- porting the supply of legal forest products.  DIgITAl mAp TO SAFEgUARD RUSSIAN FORESTS IKEA has funded a World Resource Institute project in Russia to develop a new digital map of the   Russian State Forest bureaus holdings and borders. The map is available on the Internet and pro- vides detailed information, for example, about the high conservation value forests in Karelia and  Irkutsk. It assists IKEA and others to better assess wood sourcing risks in the area. Read more about the  Forest legality Alliance  at www.wri.org/fla IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    60 ENvIRONmENT: FORESTRY  IKEA FORESTRY REQUIREmENTS All IKEA solid wood and board product sup- pliers must live up to the IKEA code of con- duct IWAY as well as the IKEA forestry  requirements.  We do not accept wood from forests  where high conservation values are threat- ened. In sensitive areas we require the for- est manager to have a certified manage- ment plan that respects the conservation  values. We require our suppliers to docu- ment the origin of their wood.  Suppliers must deliver a wood procure- ment plan and demonstrate that they have  systems to ensure that IKEA minimum  requirements are met before they are  allowed to start deliveries to IKEA. Our for- estry specialists assess the wood procure- ment plan and the evidence provided. Com- pliance with the requirements is followed up  through regular audits and reporting. Read more on page 62  IKEA requirements for wood used in  IKEA products A STRATEgIC AppROACH TO  FORESTRY CHAllENgES Our long-term goal is to source all wood  used in IKEA products from forests verified  as responsibly managed, according to a  system recognised by IKEA. IKEA refers to  such forests as preferred sources. Today,  Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), includ- ing Forest Management (FM) and Chain of  Custody (CoC) standards, is the only certi- fication scheme recognised by IKEA. The  current goal is that 35 percent of IKEAs  solid wood volumes shall come from pre- ferred sources by the end of FY12.  Wood is a valuable resource. Resource  efficiency is therefore of great importance  not only from an environmental point of  view but also from a cost perspective. We  are constantly searching for new tech- niques to get the best possible return from  every tree trunk. Our global sourcing means that we  source wood also from regions that are  troubled by illegal logging and other unsus- tainable forestry practises. Our suppliers in  these areas struggle with low availability of  certified wood volumes and traceability in  complex supply chains. To be able to oper- ate in these regions, IKEA has systems in  place to avoid controversial wood entering  the supply chain, and we cooperate with  forest managers and NGOs to increase   the availability of wood from responsibly  managed forests. We believe we best con- tribute to lasting positive change by con- ducting responsible business and actively  supporting certification development in  countries such as China and Russia. The Wood Supply function of IKEA  works to support selected wood suppliers  in developing efficient and sustainable sup- ply strategies. Its aim is to secure future  price reductions and access to competitive  wood raw material.  mONITORINg FOCUSED ON HIgH- RISK SUpplY IKEA suppliers must be able to report the  origin of their wood every four months,  which forms the basis for the risk assess- ment and planning of our wood supply  chain audits.  IKEA focuses its approach and  resources for supplier monitoring and wood  supply chain audits on high-risk suppliers  and high-risk areas. This means that IKEA  suppliers sourcing wood certified by  acknowledged forest certification schemes  such as FSC is mainly monitored through  independent auditors. Our own audit  resources focus on suppliers that are not  yet forest management or chain-of-cus- tody certified, e.g. suppliers operating in  areas associated with risks of unacceptable  forest management practises, including  illegal logging, and suppliers that have  failed earlier audits.  In addition, third-party auditors, such  as Rainforest Alliance SmartWood Pro- gramme, conduct wood supply chain audits  for IKEA. Wood supply chain audits by IKEA  or third party auditors are based on risk  assessments using supplier data on wood  origin. Any indication that unwanted wood  could be entering the IKEA supply chain  triggers a stop of deliveries and an audit.  Audits in the Swedwood and Swedspan  supply chain are always conducted by  third-party auditors to avoid conflicts of  interest as the two industrial groups are  owned by the IKEA Group.  IKEA FORESTRY SpECIAlISTS  IKEA forestry specialists spread knowledge  about responsible forestry in the wood sup- ply chain. They also support our trading  service offices with wood supply chain  audits, when they trace the supply of wood  all the way back to the forest to verify that  IKEA requirements are met.  SpECIAl FOCUS ON lOggINg IN  RUSSIA AND CHINA IKEA is engaged in a number of projects  together with WWF to address the chal- lenges of illegal logging and unsustainable  forestry in Russia and China, which are   two of IKEAs most important wood sourc- ing countries. We have also chosen to   concentrate most of our own resources  here by dedicating two-thirds of our forestry  specialists to the area. Some of these spe- cialists focus entirely on cross-border trade  as approximately one-third of the wood  IKEA suppliers source in Russia is proc- essed in China. IKEA conducts seminars and training  sessions in Russia and China together with  representatives from forestry companies  and authorities such as customs. IKEA also  encourages suppliers to participate in the  WWF initiative Global Forest & Trade Network  (GFTN) to strengthen their commitment   to eliminate illegal logging and promoting  responsible forestry. GFTN in Russia has   41 members, representing large forest  companies with around 75 percent of FSC  certified areas in Russia. In China, IKEA  works with the Rainforest Alliance Trees  Programme, WWF China and the Chinese  Academy of Forestry in addition to the For- est Stewardship Council (FSC), to improve  the standards of forest management and  availability of certified wood. The way we work IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    61 ENvIRONmENT: FORESTRY  IKEA requirements for wood used in IKEA products The IKEA Forestry Standard is a material-specific supplement to the IKEA code of conduct  IWAY. It contains basic requirements for IKEA wood product suppliers. As of September 1,  2010, the requirements also apply to suppliers of board materials. 1.  mINImUm CRITERIA ON WOOD FOR  IKEA pRODUCTS  Not from forests that have been illegally  harvested   Not from forestry operations engaged   in forest related social conflicts   Not harvested in uncertified Intact   Natural Forests (INF) or other geographi- cally identified High Conservation Value  Forests (hCvF)   Not harvested from natural forests in  the tropical and sub-tropical regions  being converted to plantations or non- forest use   Not from officially recognised and geo- graphically identified commercial Genet- ically Modified (GM) tree plantations  Suppliers must have procedures in place to  secure this throughout their supply chain.  They must know the origin of their wood  and accept audits at every link in the chain.  They regularly report the wood origin, vol- ume and species used in IKEA products via  the IKEA Forest Tracing System. 2.  CRITERIA FOR IKEA pREFERRED  WOOD SOURCES Wood certified according to Forest Steward- ship Council (FSC) Forest Management (FM)  and Chain of Custody (CoC) standards  meets the IKEA requirements for preferred  sources. Suppliers using preferred wood  sources must also have a valid FSC Chain  of Custody or other chain of custody certifi- cate recognised by IKEA, covering in its  scope the production for IKEA. COOpERATINg WITH WWF  IKEA cooperates with WWF to support  responsible forestry, and to increase the  availability of certified wood. For example,  there are joint WWF projects aiming to  ensure responsible forest management  practices and to curb illegal logging in the  cross-border trade between China and  Russia, as well as a number of projects in  laos, Cambodia, vietnam, lithuania, bul- garia, Romania and Ukraine.  IKEA is also a member of the Global  Forest & Trade Network (GFTN). The GFTN  is a WWF initiative to eliminate illegal log- ging and drive improvements in forest  management.

IKEA does not use wood  from high value tropical tree species, e.g.  teak or mahogany. Most of our outdoor   furniture is made of acacia, which is sturdy  and hardwearing. Acacia is mostly grown   in plantations to produce wood for the pulp  and paper industry. IKEA sources acacia  from plantations in Indonesia, vietnam   and Malaysia. Today, the acacia used for IKEA prod- ucts must comply with our minimum   forestry requirements, which means that  the origin must be known and it must not  be illegally felled. Our long-term goal is   to source all wood in the outdoor furniture  range from forests that are independently  verified by a third party as responsibly  managed. Today, the availability of FSC-certified  acacia in vietnam is limited. IKEA cooper- ates with WWF to increase suppliers ability  to meet requirements on timber legality,  and to help plantation owners to develop  responsible management. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    62 ENvIRONmENT: FORESTRY  COmmENTS ON KpI AND FIgURES 2010 The amount of solid wood used for IKEA products has decreased,  partly as a result of increased use of board material.  The share of certified solid wood increased substantially in  FY10 to 23.6 percent, from 16.2 percent the year before. The  overall availability has increased, and nearly 42 percent of   Swedwoods solid wood is now FSC-certified.  In order for us to reach our goal of a 35 percent share of certi- fied wood in the range in FY12, we will continue to support suppli- ers in their work to ensure proper documentation. Today, some  strategically important IKEA suppliers have access to wood from  certified forests, but have not fully implemented chain-of-custody  certification to verify this. As a result these wood volumes cannot  be accounted for in the statistics over certified wood. The work   to set goals for the volume of certified board material is expected  to be completed in FY11. In FY10, the number of wood supply chain audits increased  substantially, and the audited wood volumes more than doubled,  while the approved share of these volumes increased to 97 per- cent. Cases of non-compliance are most commonly related to a  lack of proper administrative routines, and the past few years  positive development means that we are approaching the FY12  goal of 100 percent.  IKEA focuses its approach and resources for supplier monitor- ing and wood supply chain audits on high-risk suppliers and high- risk areas. A majority of audits were conducted in Russia and  China, the balkan and South East Asia. For instance, more than   80 audits were conducted by IKEA or third-party auditors in China.  A small share of this audited volume, 4.2 percent, was not approved  due to unclear origin or non-compliant procedures. however,   none of these audits showed any evidence of illegal wood in the  supply chain.

Our engagement has continued  to generate very encouraging results, despite devastating floods in Pakistan, and the  share of more sustainable cotton in the IKEA range has increased. We now aim to reach  100 percent by the end of FY15. ExpANDINg FARmINg pROjECTS IN INDIA AND pAKISTAN IKEA and WWF started working together to support cotton farmers by introducing more sustainable  farming practices in 2005. Today, IKEA supports projects run by a number of organisations in order   to reach a larger number of farmers. In FY10, an additional three cotton farming projects with local  partners were initiated in India, bringing the current total to 15 projects in six states in India and one  in Pakistan.  On average, participating farmers in all our projects have halved their water consumption and  chemical pesticide use, while the use of chemical fertilisers has been cut by 30 percent.  The 2009/2010 harvest of this more sustainable cotton reached 160,000 tonnes with around   62,000 farmers using better management practices. harvested volumes as well as the number of   farmers using the new practices are expected to increase rapidly over the next few years as successful  project farmers spread their knowledge and inspire others. During the 2010/2011 season, we expect  the harvest of more sustainable cotton to reach 254,000 tonnes, involving some 80,000 farmers. Inspired by the work done by IKEA and WWF, one IKEA textile supplier in India has independently  started similar projects involving neighbouring farmers. INCREASED SHARE OF mORE SUSTAINAblE COTTON IN THE RANgE IKEA purchased 25,500 tonnes of more sustainable cotton from project farmers during the  2009/2010 season, more than twice as much as the year before. This means that the share of more  sustainable cotton in the IKEA range jumped to around 13.4 percent of our total cotton use. IKEA will continue to buy only parts of the volumes created with more sustainable management  practices in order to avoid creating premium prices and to speed up the process of making this cotton  a tradable commodity available to all. Increasing the share of more sustainable  cotton in the range OUR HEAlTH IS   mUCH bETTER NOW Tapu Kehar Rangapara in Gujarat, India,  suffered from serious health problems  triggered by the chemicals used on his  cotton farm. When he joined the IKEA- funded cotton farming project, things  soon started to improve. I used to be  exhausted all the time. I had bad rashes  to my skin, and my wife and I both had  constant headaches. Now we are much  healthier and life is better. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    64 ENvIRONmENT: COTTON  TOWARDS bETTER COTTON IN THE IKEA RANgE bY FY15 IKEA wants all cotton used for IKEA products to be produced according to the social and environmental  criteria developed by the better Cotton Initiative (bCI) by the end of FY15.  bCI started testing its draft criteria in 2009-2010 in regional pilot projects in West Africa, brazil,  Pakistan and India. The first cotton to be produced according to the draft BCI criteria was harvested  in October 2010 in Pakistan, in an area that was initially part of the IKEA and WWF project. IKEA aims  to buy some of this first Better Cotton harvest.  NEW INITIATIvE TO HElp SpEED Up CApACITY bUIlDINg IKEA, the Rabobank Foundation, bCI, the Dutch Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDh), WWF, Solidaridad  and a number of international retailers have developed a joint strategy to speed up the implementa- tion of better Cotton as a tradable commodity.  To support this strategy, the better Cotton Fast Track Programme (bCFTP) and a related fund have  been established. The fund will initially be used to run 10 Solidaridad cotton projects in India and   two WWF projects in Pakistan. The goal is to reach a production of one million tonnes of better Cotton  by 2015. pROjECT FARmERS AFFECTED bY FlOODS heavy monsoon rains from July 2010 onwards have left many millions of people in Pakistan injured  or homeless, and around 15 percent of the nations cotton crops were lost due to flooding. Heavy  rains have also hit parts of India and China, causing harvest delays and contributing to all-time high  prices for cotton on the world market. Farmers working on IKEA-supported projects in southern Punjab, Pakistan, have had some dam- age to their crops, while largely escaping significant losses. To help UNICEF and Save the Children alleviate the most urgent needs in Pakistan, the IKEA Foun- dation donated more than one million IKEA products, including 700,000 buckets, 200,000 blankets  and 10,000 SUNNAN lamps.

It has excellent comfort  qualities as it is soft and breathable – and  it is a renewable resource. At the same  time, it is a material associated with major  concerns for both people and the environ- ment. IKEA works to reduce its need for  cotton, but it is not realistic to believe that  all cotton can be replaced with alternative  materials. This is why we work actively   to increase the availability of more sustain- able cotton. by encouraging cotton farmers to intro- duce more sustainable farming practices,  IKEA has set out to create lasting and  large-scale improvements in conventional  cotton cultivation. Together with parties  including other international companies,  NGOs, governments and authorities, we  can actively contribute to improve conven- tional cotton production and take part in  making this more sustainable raw material  a globally available commodity – without  creating premium prices. We are step-  by-step increasing the share of this more   sustainable cotton across the range. IKEA cooperates with WWF and local  partners to spread more sustainable cotton  growing practices, and the IKEA Founda- tion cooperates with UNICEF and Save the  Children to address childrens rights issues  associated with cotton farming. IKEA is also  a founding member of the better Cotton  Initiative (bCI). IKEA SUppORTS COTTON FARmINg  pROjECTS IKEA cooperates with WWF and other part- ners to influence mainstream farmers in  India and Pakistan – two of IKEAs main  cotton sourcing countries – to grow cotton  in a more sustainable way. It started as  Farmer Field Schools with 20 weeks of  training for 450 farmers in 2005. The  projects also involve local organisations   in order to reach larger number of farmers,  and IKEA now estimates that around  80,000 farmers have introduced or are  about to introduce more sustainable   practices. The projects are based on hands-on train- ing in the field, which allows farmers them- selves to see and experience the benefits  of changing the way they grow cotton.  Successful farmers act as an inspiration to  others, and better farming practices are  being spread from farmer to farmer. Their  environmental impact is reduced and   efficiency improved, while cotton crop  yields are maintained and their earnings  increased.  An increase in sustainable farming prac- tices leads to significant improvements in  mainstream cotton farming in several cotton- producing states in both countries and dras- tically increases available volumes of cotton  grown in a more sustainable manner. CONNECTINg SUpplIERS TO mORE  SUSTAINAblE COTTON We support IKEA suppliers working with  cotton textiles to connect with suitable raw  material sources. IKEA has also facilitated  access to a number of new cotton sources  to enable suppliers to blend the right qual- ity. In return, the suppliers must commit   The way we work IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    65 ENvIRONmENT: COTTON  to buying more sustainable cotton as it  becomes available. SEARCHINg FOR FUNCTIONAl  TRACEAbIlITY SYSTEmS Tracing the cotton used in IKEA products all  the way back to the farms it grew on is an  important part of securing more sustaina- ble cotton products. Today, IKEA uses a  web-based traceability system initially  introduced to be used in connection with  our cotton projects in India and Pakistan.  This system is being introduced throughout  the IKEA cotton supply chain, but IKEA is  also search for alternative, innovative solu- tions that may be better suited for large- scale tracing. pART OF THE bETTER COTTON  INITIATIvE (bCI) IKEA is one of the founding members of  the better Cotton Initiative (bCI). This glo- bal multi-stakeholder organisation aims to  make global cotton production better for  the people who produce it, better for the  environment it grows in and better for the  sectors future. leading participants are  international companies and NGOs, as well  as an increasing number of ginners and  textile producers.  bCI has developed draft criteria for better  Cotton. Criteria cover environmental as- pects, such as the use of chemicals and  water, as well as social aspects relating to  child labour, working conditions and wages.  Criteria testing started in 2009 in regional  pilot projects in West Africa, brazil, Pakistan  and India. The tests will be monitored and  evaluated over the next few years to see if  the criteria need further revision. Once  these criteria have been fully evaluated, set  and introduced, bCI will take on responsibil- ity for verifying compliance at farm level.

All children should have  access to quality education, and child labour  is unacceptable. The IKEA Foundation has  identified cotton and cotton-seed farming  as areas where there is a great need to  improve the rights and lives of children.  between 2009 and 2015, around 10 million  children in more than 15,000 villages in  cotton and cotton-seed growing areas in  India and Pakistan will benefit from the  IKEA Foundation-supported programmes,  managed by UNICEF and Save the Children.  Read more on page 53  The IKEA Foundation REDUCINg OUR NEED FOR COTTON At the same time as IKEA works to use  more sustainable cotton, we also try to  reduce our reliance on cotton as a raw  material for our products. One way to reduce the need for cotton  is to use blends, for example a blend of  cotton and linen. Alternative materials play  an important role, too. For example, lyocell  made from cellulose fibres is already used  in a number of IKEA products that require  similar characteristics as cotton. IKEA  expects the range of lyocell textile products  to increase substantially in coming years,  significantly contributing to a decreased  use of cotton. In addition, IKEA suppliers are adapting  production to meet new quality standards  that reduce the amount of cotton needed  and the weight of textiles, while the overall  textile quality is enhanced. COmmENTS ON KpIS AND FIgURES 2010  The volume of more sustainable cotton increased substantially in  FY10, and we have now set out to reach 100 percent in the IKEA  cotton textile range by the end of FY15.  harvested volumes are expected to increase rapidly over the  next few years as successful farmers spread their knowledge and  inspire others, and more and more IKEA textile suppliers commit  to buying this more sustainable cotton.

In FY10, our first attempt to map the full IKEA  footprint confirmed the importance of continued efforts to help improve agricultural prac- tices in cotton farming. A FIRST ATTEmpT TO mAp OUR WATER FOOTpRINT A first rough estimate of IKEAs overall water footprint based on data from FY09 was developed in  FY10. While we still lack consistent and reliable data from most parts of IKEA operations, it is clear  that the most significant footprint comes from raw material extraction, and cotton cultivation in   particular. In addition, business for Social Responsibility (bSR) has helped us make a brief overall  assessment of water-related risks in the IKEA value chain. The footprint mapping and risk assessment confirm the importance of IKEAs contribution to intro- duce better water management practices in conventional cotton farming. They also show the poten- tial in supporting suppliers of textile and metal products in their work to reduce consumption and  improve water treatment, as well as in helping customers reduce their consumption at home. ImpROvED WATER TREATmENT AT SOUTH ASIAN SUpplIERS The number of suppliers in South Asia with biological water treatment plants increased dramatically  in FY10. During the year, the number of suppliers with functional treatment plants jumped from   five to 32 in Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, and only a handful of suppliers are still in the process   of introducing them. Suppliers had support from an IKEA water specialist and an external consultant, who mapped  each suppliers water treatment to see how they could be upgraded and provided technical know- how. In addition, training sessions were held at every supplier to teach them how to optimise plant  operations once installed. biological treatment plants are now a precondition for new textile suppliers in South Asia. Today  more than 75,000 cubic metres of waste water is treated through these treatment plants every day.  Some existing suppliers have decided to take water treatment one step further and install reverse  osmosis treatment plants at their factories.

The best thing I did   was to invest in drip irrigation. I have halved my  water use and the yield has increased by 40 per- cent. Now two of my neighbours have decided   to install drip irrigation, too. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    67 ENvIRONmENT: WATER  SUpplIER pROjECTS TO ImpROvE WATER CONSERvATION The IKEA purchasing teams in South Asia and Turkey are starting pilot projects aimed at reducing  water use and recycling more water. IKEA water specialists have helped map water consumption at selected suppliers, and they are  now developing action plans on how to prevent water waste and how to better conserve and recycle  water. The ambition is to spread the results and learnings from these pilots to other suppliers. Water is also one of the sub-categories for the new IKEA Supplier Development Programmes  (SDP). While the most suitable suppliers for SDP water projects are yet to be identified, a programme  description has been developed and an SDP water project leader has been identified.  lOCAl INITIATIvES TO RAISE CUSTOmER AWARENESS  Some IKEA stores have started local initiatives to help raise customer awareness of water-related  environmental challenges. For example, our Italian stores try to decrease the use of bottled mineral  water by encouraging customers to drink local tap water instead.  In collaboration with a local NGO and public water companies, IKEA SlOM glass bottles with stop- pers were sold with a label with information about the quality of local tap water. For every bottle sold,  0.2 euro was donated to the NGO legambiente, and a total of 6,000 euro was donated to remedy  pollution in the lambro River after an environmental accident.  In addition, three Italian stores offer IKEA FAMIlY members, in a special water house outside  the store, free sparkling and still purified water, which is taken from the local public aqueduct. This  water house project won the Sustainability International Forum (SIF) Prize in 2010.

Swedwood may now treat this water on- site instead of collecting it for evaporation or transportation to a  municipal water treatment plant. All storm and log yard water at  Wielbark will be collected for oil and particle separation and then  directed to a specially designed infiltration pond. The aim is to pro- tect local aquatic systems, invest in sustainable usage of water and,  at the same time, minimise transportation. SUSTAINAblE WATER pRACTICES IN  COTTON FARmINg The IKEA-supported projects for more sus- tainable cotton farming in India and Paki- stan have reduced participating farmers  water consumption significantly through  the introduction of better management  practices. Cotton farming can be highly  water intensive if appropriate irrigation  methods are not used, and project results  show that the water consumption can often  be halved. Read more on page 64  Cotton WATER TREATmENT AT IKEA  SUpplIERS The IKEA code of conduct, IWAY, includes  requirements on water treatment. IKEA  supports suppliers to implement waste  water treatment processes to ensure water  quality in suppliers local communities.  Audits have proven good progress particu- larly in South Asia, where IKEA has sup- ported the implementation and mainte- nance of waste water treatment systems   to ensure that capacity is appropriate for  waste water volumes.  All IKEA home furnishing suppliers must  have action plans on how to reduce their  environmental impact, and IKEA supports  suppliers in regions with scarce water  resources. In India, we have helped suppli- ers improve water recycling and set targets  for continued improvements. All IKEA Catalogue suppliers are  required to monitor and report water con- sumption as well as emissions to wastewa- ter. IKEA calculates and reports this data  per Catalogue copy.

A  printing technique called Soft Pigment  Printing (SPP) reduces the water consump- tion by 60 percent compared to traditional  printing techniques while also giving the  textile a soft feel and excellent light-fast- ness. Today, around 40 percent of our  printed textile products are produced with  techniques that require less water. REDUCINg WATER CONSUmpTION   AT IKEA All IKEA stores and distribution centres  measure their water use, and several stores  have implemented various measures to  reduce consumption. For instance, IKEA  France is one of the countries that installs  waterless urinals in new stores and retrofits  others with grey water systems so that roof  run-off water can be used for toilet flushing. HElpINg CUSTOmERS SAvE WATER  AT HOmE We have decided to develop the IKEA  range to support IKEA customers live a  more sustainable life at home by reducing  their energy and water consumption, and  help them save money at the same time.  IKEA kitchen taps are already fitted with a  Pressure Compensating Aerator (PCA) that  can reduce water use by 30 percent or  more by limiting the water pressure and  adding air to the water flow, and we are  constantly looking for other innovative  techniques to support reduced household  water usage.  Read more on page 19  More sustainable products COmmENTS ON KpIS AND FIgURES 2010  Reducing our water footprint is one of the overall priorities in the  IKEA Sustainability Direction. A first rough estimate of our overall  footprint based on data from FY09 was developed in FY10. Over  the next few years, we will address water issues more widely  across the value chain. While the estimates are still rough, it is clear that the most sig- nificant footprint comes from cotton cultivation. This confirms the  importance of our ongoing efforts to spread more sustainable  water management practices in cotton producing areas in India  and Pakistan.

We have set an overall goal for FY15 to have zero waste  to landfill from our own operations, and have decided that all IKEA markets shall enable  and encourage customers to reuse or recycle all IKEA products at end-of-life.  pRODUCTS AND SOlUTIONS TO HElp CUSTOmERS mINImISE WASTE IKEA wants to develop products and solutions that enable customers to conveniently sort and reduce  household waste volumes. A training module has been developed to help product developers, techni- cians and others to learn more about household waste issues. In FY10, IKEA extended the range of products that help customers with waste-sorting, moving  from mainly kitchen-based products to also include solutions suitable for secondary storage areas.  For example, RETUR is a series of wall-hanging storage products to be used for paper, cardboard,  batteries, glass and plastic, etc., and DIMPA provides a low-price portable alternative. IKEA has a climate-related project focused on reducing energy and water consumption, prevent- ing unnecessary food waste and minimising other household waste. The project aims to provide input  to IKEA range development on solutions that would have the biggest positive impact, and to develop  communication that inspires co-workers and customers to live a more sustainable life at home.  mINImISINg WASTE AT IKEA STORES AND DISTRIbUTION CENTRES All IKEA stores and distribution centres recycle large quantities of material. The Waste Management  Manual for the IKEA group was first established in 1999. The manual requires all stores to, at a mini- mum, sort the most common waste items: cardboard, paper, plastic, wood, metal and glass.  In some stores, as many as 15 categories of waste are sorted. In practice, this ensures that  almost 75 percent of the waste is sorted in the stores and more than 80 percent is recycled or used  for energy production. This helps us to save resources and can result in considerable savings.  IKEA stores and distribution centres also work to minimise damage to products. however, when  damage does occur, IKEA attempts to repair products rather than simply discard them. The results of  efforts made in the stores are measured in the Recovery Index. WASTE RECYClINg FOR CUSTOmERS AT IKEA STORES IKEA wants to make it easy for customers to recycle our products at the end of their life-cycle. Our  Sustainability Direction for FY15 states that IKEA must take responsibility to enable and encourage  customers to recycle and reuse products when they are no longer wanted. Today, many stores offer at least some opportunities for customers to return and sort waste for  recycling. For example, customers can return batteries and compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFL) at  most IKEA stores. CFl bulbs use 80 percent less energy and last 10 times longer than traditional  bulbs. however, CFl bulbs contain a small amount of mercury, which means that the bulbs have to be  recycled in a safe way.

This is why  IKEA Coventry, UK, donates ex-display  textiles, such as sofa covers, curtains and  loose fabrics to local schools with little  money for materials. here, artistic stu- dents use them for creating new products,  such as textile recycling bags, or to design  clothes and organise fashion shows. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    70 ENvIRONmENT: WASTE  REUSE, RECYCLE – OR PASS IT ON!  In Sweden, IKEA has started a Buy & Sell website for used IKEA  products to prolong their life, through the IKEA community Life at  home. Advertising is free of charge for IKEA FAMILY members. All  advertisements will also be displayed on Swedens largest classified  listings site Blocket, while IKEA products advertised on Blocket will  automatically be shown on the IKEA community site. Try it out on www.ikea.se/ livethemma WASTE MANAGEMENT AT IKEA SUPPLIERS IKEA wants to minimise the amount of waste generated in the manufacturing process, and if possible  to use it in the production of other home furnishing products. Our designers, product developers and  technicians get great ideas by spending time in the factories and talking to suppliers. LUSY BLOM  cushion is one good example. It is filled with leftovers from IKEA quilt production, so we can make  sure the content is safe and healthy as well as making use of material that would otherwise be  wasted.  Waste from production can still come to good use even if it is not suited for home furnishing prod- ucts. For example, the production units at Swedwood and Swedspan – the industrial groups owned  by IKEA – often use their own wood waste to produce energy instead of relying on oil and gas.  Some IKEA suppliers use materials and production methods that generate hazardous waste. This  is why our code of conduct IWAY states that suppliers must handle, store and dispose of hazardous  waste in an environmentally safe manner, and that workers must have the appropriate competence  and protection as needed. INVESTIGATING HOW TO TURN WASTE INTO RESOURCES  Turning waste into resources and minimising its environmental impact are serious challenges to society  as a whole. This is why we have started a project called Closing the loops to investigate the oppor- tunities for full recyclability of different materials used in IKEA products, and how cyclic systems can  save scarce natural resources and minimise CO2 emissions.  Read more on page 85  Closing the loops COMMENTS ON KPIS AND FIGURES 2010  Our overall goal for FY15 is that no waste from our own operations  shall go to landfills. Already today, a high share of our waste is  recycled, reclaimed or used for energy production.  The amount of waste generated by our stores decreased partly  as a result of consistent efforts to repair damaged goods to sell   as is in stores bargain corner, which is also reflected in the  improved Recovery Index. Swedspan was formed as a spin-off from Swedwood in 2008,  and started reporting comparable data in FY10.

This is why IKEA tackles climate change with a wide range of actions  throughout the value chain. In FY10, we started the work to set specific emission reduc- tion targets, and intensified our efforts to find adequate measuring methods. IKEA WANTS TO HAvE A pOSITIvE ImpACT ON THE ClImATE We are reducing CO2 emissions from our own operations, while also examining the opportunities  IKEA has to help reduce emissions in society and support our customers to reduce their emissions.  Together with WWF, we have investigated some of these opportunities and how to calculate   climate-positive aspects from what we do together with our customers. Inspiring and enabling IKEA  customers to make changes at home can make a huge difference. If 50 million customers reduce  their food waste by 14 percent, this would save approximately six million tonnes of CO2 per year. And  if 20 million households cut the power used for equipment in stand-by mode by 50 percent, it would  save 1.4 million tonnes of CO2.  AmbITION TO SET SpECIFIC EmISSION REDUCTION TARgETS  Our commitment to tackling climate change means that all parts of IKEA have started to develop   specific reduction targets and methods of measuring CO2 emissions from our own operations, the  supply chain and from travel to IKEA stores.  ROAD-TESTINg NEW gREENHOUSE gAS pROTOCOl STANDARDS In FY10, IKEA was one of the companies that were invited to road-test new global standards in the  Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GhG Protocol). The tested standards were designed to provide methods to  account for emissions associated with individual products across their life-cycles and of corporations  across their value chains. The draft standards were used during the road-test to update IKEA carbon footprint calculations  and to report on areas that were not part of earlier mapping activities, for example products end-of- life, building materials and employee commuting. however, available data are still inadequate and  inconsistent in some areas, and emission calculations can only be considered as rough estimates. IKEA continues to explore and cooperate with others to develop new, improved measuring and  reporting methods that will give us the tools we need to accurately monitor our CO2 emissions.

IKEA induction hobs  are one good example of how we can make energy- efficient solutions available to the many people by  offering good quality at affordable prices. In 2010, we  reduced the price on one of our most popular induc- tion hobs substantially in most European markets. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    72 ENvIRONmENT: ClIMATE  EmISSION REDUCTIONS  THROUgHOUT THE vAlUE CHAIN IKEA wants to reduce carbon dioxide emis- sions from all aspects of our operations   – from how raw materials are extracted;   how our products are manufactured; how  the products are transported; how we heat,  cool and light our buildings; how people  are transported to and from our stores;  from the use of our products in customers  homes; and finally at the end of a products  life-cycle. This is a great challenge, but IKEA is  making progress. We are investigating the  climate impact from all our operations and  are in the process of setting specific emis- sion reduction targets, and we cooperate  with others to establish standards on  measuring and follow-up. COOpERATINg WITH WWF ON  ClImATE CHANgE IKEA has cooperated with WWF to tackle  climate change since 2007. A majority of   carbon dioxide emissions related to IKEA  come from material extraction, suppliers,  customer transportation, and the use and  disposal of products – areas that IKEA   can only indirectly influence. This is why  several climate projects aim at increasing  our ability to positively influence suppliers,  customers, policy makers and others while  also developing our range to become more  energy efficient. Below is a brief summary  of our climate projects. Energy use at suppliers 2010–2011 This supplier energy pilot focuses on  Poland and China, and the identification of  barriers that prevent us from proceeding  faster to a low-carbon supply chain. The  project aims to develop relevant strategies  to remove these barriers, as well as to  develop and run specific actions. The learn- ings can help us support suppliers efforts  to save energy and reduce their climate  impact, while also improving efficiency and  reducing costs. Read more on page 78  Energy use at suppliers Transport of people 2007–2010 Pilot projects in the United Kingdom, China  and the United States have explored more  sustainable ways to transport people to  and from IKEA stores, helping them to  leave the car at home and reduce CO2  emissions. A toolbox developed as part of  the project will offer guidance to IKEA  stores on strategies to achieve more sus- tainable transportation. Read more on page 81  Transport of people Sustainable life at home 2010–2011 This project aims at identifying smart prod- ucts and services that IKEA can offer to  help our customers live a more sustainable     life at home, and at creating customer  awareness of how their behaviour can help  to reduce climate impact.  Read more on page 83  Sustainable life at home Climate perspective on food products  2009–2011 This project aims at finding ways to adapt  the IKEA food range to be more climate  smart, and what IKEA can do to influence  both food suppliers and the customers who  buy our food products. Read more on page 84  Climate perspective on food products Closing the loops 2010–2011 This project investigates the opportunities  for full recyclability of different materials  used in IKEA products, and how cyclic sys- tems can save scarce natural resources  and minimise CO2 emissions. It will explore  how to close material loops, with specific  focus on recyclable products and use of  recycled materials in new products.

We have estimated CO2 emissions from our value chain based  on the draft Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and  Reporting Standard developed by the World Resources Institute  (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Develop- ment (WBCSD). Current calculations show that 85 percent of the  carbon dioxide emissions related to IKEA and our products are  attributed to material extraction, customer transportation, the use  of products and their end-of-life. These rough estimates help us  identify the most important areas to focus on. We have measured energy consumption for IKEA buildings for  a number of years, and CO2 emissions are calculated from these  data. Here, we can see that emissions are increasing not only in  absolute terms as a result of increased sales, but also in relative  terms: CO2 emissions expressed as kilograms per sold cubic metre  of IKEA products increased by 30 percent to 34.3 kg.  A newly acquired Swedspan factory adds to CO2 emissions, but  the main reason for the overall increase is that the share of renew- able energy used in IKEA buildings decreased during the year.  When our supply agreements for grid electricity from renewable  sources expired in major markets – Germany and France – they  were not replaced, as IKEA has decided not to pay premium prices  for green grid electricity. This is one of the reasons why IKEA  invests in alternative solutions, such as solar panel systems and  wind turbines. The reported CO2 emissions from IKEA suppliers include all  home furnishing suppliers, food suppliers and catalogue suppliers.  Today, around 70 percent of home furnishing suppliers report  actual figures for energy consumption and CO2 emissions, and  these figures are well in line with previous years estimates.

To speed up  our work to increase energy efficiency and reduce the use of fossil fuel, all IKEA countries  have been given the task to set specific CO2 reduction targets.  mAjOR INvESTmENTS IN WIND AND SOlAR pOWER  The implementation of the FY09 decision to install photovoltaic (solar) panels on around 150 stores  and distribution centres is progressing well, and the cost of solar panel systems and installation has  decreased significantly. In FY10, the number of buildings with solar panel systems nearly doubled,  from nine to 17, and we expect to reach around 40 buildings by the end of FY11. Among the coun- tries that have or are about to install solar panel systems are Spain, Germany, the United States,  Canada, Czech Republic, belgium, Italy, the UK and France. IKEA has also increased its investments in wind turbines in France and Germany, with 52 turbines  installed or in the process of being installed and connected to the power grid. These installations are  expected to generate around 95 GWh, the equivalent of 10 percent of the total FY09 electricity con- sumption in IKEA buildings. SETTINg gOAlS TO REDUCE ClImATE ImpACT FROm OUR bUIlDINgS Our Sustainability Direction states that IKEA shall significantly reduce CO2 emissions from our own  operations by being innovative, energy efficient and using more renewable energy. During FY11, all  IKEA countries are to develop reduction goals for energy consumption and CO2 emissions for their  stores, distribution centres and factories.  The goals are to be based on the direction decided in FY06 that all IKEA buildings should, long- term, run on 100 percent renewable energy and that energy efficiency should improve by 25 percent  compared to 2005. Over the past few years, our energy project IKEA Goes Renewable has helped IKEA realise some of  the many potentials to save energy and shift from fossil fuels to the relatively high share of renewable  energy being used to run IKEA buildings. Specific goals beyond the overall direction will help IKEA gain  momentum in its work to reduce the climate impact from our own buildings over the next few years. Continued investments in renewable energy  for IKEA  buildings SOlAR pANEl INSTAllATIONS IN NORTH AmERICA IKEA U.S. already has solar panels fitted to three stores  around the country, and has started installations on another  seven stores and one distribution centre in California. Once  all are in use in 2011, the 20,000 panels in California will have  an annual output of 6,650 MWh of electricity, representing  CO2 reductions equalling the yearly emissions of 914 cars.  The distribution centre in Tejon will have one of the top ten  largest commercial rooftop systems in the United States.  By the end of 2010, IKEA Canada will have fitted three  Ontario stores with solar panels that are expected to pro- duce around 960 MWh per year, roughly the equivalent of  what it takes to power 100 homes. This will be what is  believed to be the largest rooftop solar installation owned   by a retailer in Canada.  IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    75 ENvIRONmENT: ClIMATE / ENERGY USE IN IKEA bUIlDINGS  SpECIFIC ENERgY EFFICIENCY TARgETS FOR NEW STORES IKEA has decided to introduce specific energy efficiency targets for new stores. The current target   of 45 kilowatt hours (kWh) per cubic metre of sold goods at the fifth year of operation has been  replaced by individual targets appropriate for each stores conditions, such as the climate, store  opening hours, etc.  Research and experience show that new stores in some locations are unable to reach the previous  target, while stores in some other locations have the potential to limit their energy consumption to  25–30 kWh/m3. The current average performance for existing stores is close to 70 kWh/m3.  STRONg ACTION plANS bASED ON RETRO-FIT AUDIT RESUlTS In FY08-09, IKEA conducted an audit of all buildings and created individual action plans to make  retro fits in order to improve their energy efficiency and use of renewable energy. The implementation  of action plans continued in FY10, with many successful examples. In Canada, the Vaughan store has improved its energy efficiency by almost 35 percent or 3,500  MWh a year, by implementing a series of energy saving measures including reducing the ventilation  speed when the store is not busy, fitting fans to blow hot air down from the ceiling and improving the  automatic control of lighting and heating systems.  In Austria, the Wels distribution centre has reduced its CO2 emissions by 62 percent since FY05  and has made annual energy consumption savings of about 19 percent or 1,100 MWh. And, at the  end of FY10, they started building a biomass boiler alongside the existing gas boiler to further cut  their CO2 emissions.  Our industrial group Swedwood has reduced its oil and gas consumption by 71 percent compared  to FY05, saving 18,500 MWh a year. The factory in lmhult, Sweden, has reduced its oil consumption  by 98 percent by switching from burning oil to wood waste. At the end of FY10, some 1,000 action points remained to be implemented, while more than   2,000 have been completed. IKEA gOES RENEWAblE  IKEA Goes Renewable (IGR) is our  project to reduce carbon dioxide emissions  from IKEA buildings. Our long-term direc- tion is that all IKEA buildings shall be sup- plied with 100 percent renewable energy.  We also want to improve our overall energy  efficiency by 25 percent compared to FY05.  IKEA defines renewable energy as energy  derived from resources that are regenerated  naturally or cannot be depleted. IKEA has  decided not to pay premium prices for grid  electricity from renewable sources. This is  one of the reasons why IKEA invests in  alternative solutions, such as solar panel  systems and wind turbines, to supply its  buildings with renewable electricity. Invest- ments in more sustainable energy solutions  often represent significant cost savings and  relatively short pay-back periods.  CENTRAl SUppORT FOR DElEgATED  RESpONSIbIlITIES Each IKEA market is responsible for reduc- ing its carbon dioxide emissions from its  buildings and for increasing its use of  renewable energy. National management  teams are supported by a central team of  experts and facilitators, as well as coordi- nators at each local unit. STANDARDS FOR ENERgY  mANAgEmENT IKEA establishes and updates standards  continuously in order to make better equip- ment and energy management choices.  This translates into savings that improve  energy efficiency considerably. IKEA has  standards for the most important building  components of stores, and specifies a  range of energy efficient measures for new  IKEA buildings.  A number of projects – on both a global  and local level – are being undertaken to  encourage all IKEA buildings to continu- ously improve energy efficiency. Some of  these get input and support from partners,  such as the partnerships between WWF  and IKEA in around ten countries including  Austria and Switzerland. IKEA also cooper- ates with other retailers in the European  Retail Round Table (ERRT). AlTERNATIvE ENERgY SOURCES  USED FOR HEATINg IKEA wants to move away from the  dependence on fossil fuels. This is why  space and water heating for new IKEA  buildings comes from more sustainable  sources whenever possible. This is done  using ground source heat pumps, air heat  pumps, biomass boilers and solar panels.  Most new construction projects incorpo- rate one or more renewable sources of  heating. All new stores in Sweden are  being fitted with geothermal heating and  cooling systems, and more than 25 IKEA  units worldwide have been fitted with bio- mass boilers since FY05. Solar hot water  heating systems are installed at more than  50 IKEA sites. At the logan store in bris- bane, Australia, the system supplies all hot  water for the store all year round using  heat from the sun. The savings on energy  costs is expected to cover investment costs  in only two years.  The way we work IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    76 ENvIRONmENT: ClIMATE / ENERGY USE IN IKEA bUIlDINGS  COmmENTS ON KpIS AND FIgURES 2010  In FY10, the number of installed solar panel systems nearly doubled,  and we expect the share of renewable energy to rise during FY11  as a result of our rapid increase of solar panel systems combined  with investments in more than 50 large wind turbines and some  new biomass boilers and heat pumps. however, in FY10 the share of renewable energy used in IKEA  buildings decreased. When our supply agreements for grid electric- ity from renewable sources expired in major markets – Germany  and France – they were not replaced. IKEA has decided not to pay  premium prices for green grid electricity, and this is one of the  reasons why we invest in alternative solutions to supply our build- ings with renewable electricity.  Meanwhile, the energy efficiency of IKEA buildings continues   to improve, with Swedwood showing significant progress. Overall,  our energy consumption has increased, partly as a result of a cold  winter and hot summer in many locations. however, the energy  efficiency still improved as the energy consumption in our stores  and Swedwood increased less than their productivity, whilst our  distribution centres reduced their energy consumption faster than  their productivity decreased. Swedspan was formed as a spin-off from Swedwood, and since  FY10 was their first year of full operation, there is no benchmark  available.

Several successful energy projects with suppliers  during FY10 prove that relatively modest investments often lead to big improvements.   The experiences will be used to further realise the huge potential at key suppliers in   coming years. gREAT RESUlTS FROm SUpplIER ENERgY pROjECTS In FY10, IKEA and 70 suppliers worked together in energy projects with the goal of reducing con- sumption and carbon dioxide emissions, while also saving costs and increasing competitiveness. In  total, participating suppliers are estimated to have saved more than 150 GWh of energy and reduced  CO2 emissions by more than 40,000 tonnes. Two Chinese glass suppliers have reduced their energy consumption by 46 percent and 30 percent  respectively, and the carbon footprint by 40 percent and 21 percent. A board material supplier in  Lithuania improved the energy efficiency by 37 percent and saved 350,000 euro in just one year.  One textile supplier in bangladesh has reduced energy consumption by 20 percent and cut CO2  emissions by 10,000 tonnes in the first six months of the project. This supplier expects to reduce  costs by 530,000 euro in the first year alone as a result of investing 70,000 euro in a number of  energy efficiency measures.  Many suppliers also invest in technology with longer pay-back periods. A plastics supplier in Czech  Republic has started the installation of a solar power plant to cover up to 50 percent of the factorys  electricity need, while a Slovenian aluminium supplier has installed biomass boilers that halved CO2  emissions compared to the old oil-fuelled system. pROjECT TO HElp REmOvE lOW-CARbON bARRIERS  IKEA and WWF have launched a follow-up to a supplier energy efficiency project that ran in FY08–09.  The earlier project delivered action plans to improve supplier energy efficiency based on energy  audits at selected suppliers in China, Poland and Sweden, but also helped raise IKEAs awareness of  barriers preventing us from proceeding faster to a low-carbon supply chain. The follow-up project focuses on Poland and China, and runs until the end of FY11. The aim is   to identify specific barriers and develop relevant strategies to remove these barriers, as well as to  develop and run specific actions. The project explores what needs to happen at IKEA and what needs  to happen externally, for example when it comes to infrastructure and legislation.  The second half of the project is about creating an innovation platform. Two suppliers in different  energy-intensive material categories – plastics and textiles – are taking part. We have analysed their  energy set-up and the best practices, and will now explore what would be required from an innova- tion perspective to improve energy efficiency. A workshop with global innovators and incubators,   as well as various competencies from IKEA and WWF, will start a dialogue that may result in new  solutions. Ideas and proposals will be evaluated to see if they can be tested in later pilot projects. Big potential to improve energy efficiency  at IKEA  suppliers bIOmASS plANT AT SWEDSpAN   mAKES A DIFFERENCE Swedspan, an industrial group within IKEA, has  decided to minimise CO2 emissions at its new board  production unit in Poland with the aid of a biomass  combined heating and power plant. Once installed   in spring 2011, the plant is expected to produce an  annual surplus of around 40,000 MWh of renewable  electricity, which can be supplied to the electricity grid. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    78 ENvIRONmENT: ClIMATE / ENERGY USE AT SUPPlIERS  Effective distribution in the entire goods flow from supplier to customer is important to  achieve low prices and to minimise the environmental impact from transport. In FY10,   we decided to remove wooden pallets from the supply chain as part of our constant quest  to increase filling rates and decrease CO2 emissions from transport.  REmOvINg WOODEN pAllETS FROm THE IKEA SUpplY CHAIN by the end of FY11, all IKEA suppliers are expected to have phased out wooden pallets and instead  use more sustainable alternatives such as paper pallets and recycled plastic loading ledges. Aban- doning wooden pallets means that we no longer have to transport empty but bulky pallets from the  stores backwards in the supply chain. Paper pallets and loading ledges can be adapted to product size, which means optimised unit  loads and improved filling rates. In addition, IKEA product developers and packaging specialists   can optimise designs to fit trucks and containers rather than fixed pallet sizes. Most suppliers in North America and Asia Pacific have already stopped using wooden pallets, and  around 40 percent of European suppliers. Internally, IKEA stores and distribution centres are in the  process of developing new storage solutions to handle unit loads without wooden pallets. NEW CONTAINER STANDARD ImpROvES FIllINg RATES  IKEA has decided to move away from the current Dry-van (Dv) containers with a standard height of  2.4 metres and increasingly use the high-Cube (hC) containers with a standard height of 2.7 metres.  This is expected to improve filling rates. In turn, this will reduce the number of shipments and con- tribute to keeping CO2 increases from transport lower than the overall IKEA sales growth. Many IKEA products can be shipped with higher filling rates by combining the HC container with  paper pallets and loading ledges. For example, an HC container can fit 25 percent more LACK tables  than a Dv container. TESTINg ElECTRIC vEHIClES FOR CUSTOmER HOmE DElIvERIES IKEA and a transport service provider in Paris, France, have tested the potential of using electric and/ or compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles for customer deliveries. So far, results have been more  favourable towards CNG vehicles, due to electric vehicles limited reach per charge. The ambition is   to test alternative technology in two more markets during FY11. COllAbORATION TO DEvElOp ClImATE pROTECTION plATFORm IKEA has been part of a group of leading companies from different industries, who have joined forces  to launch a multi-industry, voluntary programme focused on reducing the environmental impact of   European road transport. The aim is to promote green procurement of transport services and of fuel- saving and/or emission-reducing technologies in order to reduce energy use, greenhouse gas emis- sions and other pollutants in freight transportation.  Two European IKEA transport carriers have been part of evaluating the U.S. EPA SmartWay tools   to see how a similar solution would work in Europe. The programme is expected to help IKEA more   accurately report CO2 emissions from transport. Read more at   www.epa.gov/  smartwaylogistics New measures to improve goods transport  filling rates EvERYONE WINS WITH RE-DESIgNED EKTORp Since its launch in 1996, the EKTORP sofa has been one of  our most popular products. but the bulk made it a challenge  to transport and store in a cost-effective and environmentally  sound manner. Now EKTORP has been turned into a cus- tomer assembly piece. Thanks to the flatpack, each pallet  can fit twice as many sofas as before. And everyone wins:  the cost for IKEA has dropped, CO2 emissions from transport  have dropped, and the price has dropped. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    79 ENvIRONmENT: ClIMATE / TRANSPORT OF PRODUCTS  STRIvINg FOR mORE EFFICIENT  gOODS TRANSpORT IKEA has strived for innovative and effi- cient transport solutions for our products  ever since the early 1950s, with flatpacked  furniture being the first major break- through. Effective distribution in the entire  goods flow from supplier to customer is an  important piece of the jigsaw to achieve a  low price, and to minimise the environ- mental impact from transport.  IKEA products are purchased both glo- bally and regionally to secure low prices  and high quality while also trying to avoid  unnecessary transport. We use direct deliv- eries from suppliers to stores to a large  extent, and try to minimise goods going  into intermediate storage in distribution  centres. We choose rail transport where possible,  and where this is the more environmentally  adapted option. Truck and container loads  are optimised to maximise fill rates and  minimise the number of transports, and we  work actively with transport service provid- ers to reduce their environmental footprint. INNOvATIvE DESIgN INCREASES  FIllINg RATES Smart packaging is the most effective way  to reduce the environmental impact from  goods transport. Already at the drawing  table, designers and product developers  include considerations to packaging solu- tions as part of their assignment. Product  packaging is optimised to increase filling  rates.  IKEA works to increase the awareness  along the value chain. Each IKEA trading  area has a filling rate coordinator, and  analysis tools and training packages are  available for all.  INDUSTRY-SpECIFIC REQUIREmENTS IKEA transport service providers must  comply with the requirements in our code  of conduct IWAY, including industry-specific  requirements. The way we work COmmENTS ON KpIS AND FIgURES 2010  The target to reduce CO2 emissions per transported cubic metre  kilometre (CO2/m3km) by 12 percent in FY10 was surpassed. For  the end of FY15, the goal is to reduce emissions by 10 percent,  with FY10 as the base year and calculated as grams per cubic  metre transported goods (CO2/m3) instead of grams per trans- ported cubic metre kilometre. Filling rates are stable to slightly higher, and we expect con- tinued positive developments as wooden pallets are being phased  out and the use of high Cube containers increases.

A number of global and local initiatives support this  ambition, and we have developed a toolbox together with WWF to spread ideas and  solutions for more environmentally friendly people transport. Internally, more and more  co-workers choose virtual meetings before travel. TOOlbOx AvAIlAblE FOR IKEA STORES In FY10, IKEA and WWF finalised pilot projects aimed at finding more sustainable ways to transport  people to and from IKEA stores. IKEA stores in the United States have tested a toolbox of measures  to help people get to the stores in a more sustainable manner by promoting mass transit, improv- ing home delivery services and exploring other solutions that enable customers and co-workers to  use more environmentally friendly transport modes.  The toolbox helps stores evaluate their current situation before determining how they can help  and influence customers and co-workers to make more sustainable transportation choices. Tests in  the United States show that effective communication can increase the use of public transport, and  encourage car sharing and car pooling as well as the use of low-emission vehicles.  The U.S. experience will now be evaluated before the toolbox is implemented at IKEA stores  around the world.  Examples of toolbox content:  A checklist of opportunities for promoting sustainable transport  Guidelines for how to work with municipalities and external partners on improving alternative  transportation access to stores  A model for how to calculate the effect of implemented measures lOCAl INITIATIvES TO pROmOTE SUSTAINAblE TRANSpORT There are many local examples of initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable transport for custom- ers and co-workers.  Public transport solutions are an important consideration when planning new stores and  upgrading others. The store in Ancona, Italy, promoted the construction of a train stop in front of  the store. Some stores in Sweden, Austria and Australia have real-time electronic timetables for  local buses at the exits. Many stores offer free shuttle buses to and from the city centre. In Norway, the Furuset store  also offered free daily IKEA buses during the summer to two different cities 90 and 130 kilometres  away. A discount on home delivery, goody bags and a tour guide were part of the package to  ensure customers enjoyed the trip to IKEA while leaving the car at home. Helping customers and co-workers use  more sustainable transportation FREE ElECTRIC CAR CHARgERS AT IKEA HElSINgbORg The new IKEA store in helsingborg, Sweden, has electric car  charging stations in the parking lot, providing electricity from  renewable sources for customers cars free of charge. Some new  stores under development in other countries will have the same  offer, and more and more stores reserve their most attractive  parking spaces near the entrance for electric and hybrid cars. IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    81 ENvIRONmENT: ClIMATE / TRANSPORT OF PEOPlE  Some IKEA stores run public transport campaigns aimed at customers. Most stores in Italy offer  refunds for bus tickets used to reach the store, and some stores have had promotions for customers  arriving by public transport that included receiving a free lunch or discounted home delivery. There are also local initiatives to encourage co-workers to use public transport to and from work.  IKEA Czech, Slovakia and hungary have offered various solutions for providing co-workers with free  or subsidised public transport passes in the past two years – and today nearly 80 percent of co-workers  commute by public transport.  Green cars are a good solution when public transport is not an option; and in Italy, IKEA sponsors  co-workers buying hybrid or natural-gas cars with 150 euro. The Tempelhof store has accepted an  invitation from the German General Motors branch Opel to test the latest generation of fuel cell   powered cars. It will be used as an IKEA pool car and will be available for co-workers to use for business  purposes, such as after sales service. Yet, nothing could be more sustainable than riding a bike. This is why some IKEA locations, includ- ing three stores in Austria, offer pools of bicycles that co-workers can borrow to get to and from work. CONTINUED SUCCESS FOR mEETINg THE IKEA WAY The work to reduce IKEA business travel continued, and there has been a substantial shift from travel  to virtual meetings via video, web and phone in the past few years. The number of web meetings  jumped to 82,000 in FY10 from 52,000 the year before, and involved an average of 20,000 partici- pants every month.  During the year, the number of available locations for video meetings more than tripled. Regular  training and information sessions are being held on all locations to encourage use and make sure   participants get the best possible experience from video meetings. INCREASINg AWARENESS OF ClImATE ImpACT FROm TRAvEl All IKEA co-workers now have better opportunities to make informed choices of local travel alternatives  to and from IKEA units. When searching for information on the IKEA Intranet on how to get to a specific  location, the CO2 footprint for the various alternatives such as cars, trains and buses are listed. In close cooperation with our travel agencies, the work to improve the CO2 reporting and information  on air travel is ongoing, both on a corporate and on an individual trip level. Today, co-workers are not  routinely informed of the CO2 footprint from their air travel. however, the ongoing work to reduce the  number of travel agencies to larger ones with better reporting routines will in time provide conditions  for improved carbon-related information to travellers.  NEW COllAbORATION TO ImpROvE bUSINESS TRAvEl mANAgEmENT IKEA has been elected as a member of the Strategic Advisory board of the National business Travel  Association (NbTA) Europe.

The ambition for the coming  years is to improve the access to our stores and, whenever possi- ble, offer our customers more sustainable modes of transport. Our internal work to reduce business travel has progressed  well, and we have saved around 25 million euro annually in FY09  and FY10 compared to the 2007 base year. The number of web  meetings has increased substantially, and we see a continued pos- itive trend with more and more co-workers choosing virtual meet- ings before travel.

We strive to make good technological  solutions available at low prices and we have stepped up activities to inspire customers   to live a more sustainable life at home. gETTINg READY FOR COmmUNICATION pIlOT IKEA and WWF are working together in a climate-related project to promote a more sustainable life  at home by inspiring IKEA customers and co-workers to adopt more sustainable behaviours and thus  reduce their environmental impact.  The focus is on reducing energy and water consumption, preventing food waste and minimising  other household waste. The project aims to provide input to IKEA range development on solutions  that would have the biggest positive impact, and to develop communication that inspires co-workers  and customers to live a more sustainable life at home. During FY10, the project started with a workshop with WWF experts, various IKEA competencies and  some external designers to create a project platform and provide input to IKEA product development.  A project strategy for communication and customer engagement will be developed together with  two IKEA pilot markets during FY11. We want to engage customers through communication and  activities, showing that even small changes make a big difference to the environment and to house- hold expenses. promoting a more sustainable life at home CUSTOmERS SHARE IDEAS ON ENERgY,  WASTE AND WATER IKEA Spain celebrated environmental month  during June to inspire co-workers and customers  to change habits towards a more sustainable   life at home. Customers contributed 555 tips  and ideas on how to save energy, waste and  water on a special IKEA website. The ideas   that received the most votes from customers  received a kit containing IKEA products such as  a SUNNAN lamp and energy saving bulbs, and   a WWF membership.  IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    83 ENvIRONmENT: ClIMATE / SUSTAINAblE lIFE AT hOME  IKEA wants to adapt the food range in restaurants and Swedish Food markets to be more  sustainable, and we have taken the first steps to take greenhouse gas emissions into  account when developing new products. An estimate of food products carbon footprint  will help us prioritise the work in coming years. gUIDElINES FOR DEvElOpINg ClImATE-FRIENDlY FOOD pRODUCTS  IKEA cooperates with WWF in a project aimed at finding ways of adapting the IKEA food range to   be more sustainable, with a special focus on the climate. The initial goal is to identify short-term  greenhouse gas reduction potentials. The next step is to initiate and implement actions to reduce   the climate impact from all food-related operations and outline a strategy for long-term adaptation   of the IKEA food business.  In FY10, the project developed a set of internal guidelines for food product developers to help  select the most sustainable solutions and alternatives for new dishes. To facilitate the work to   minimise greenhouse gas emissions, a carbon calculator has been developed, enabling product  developers to calculate and compare estimated emissions from a wide range of common food ingre- dients. The guidelines and calculator will be introduced during FY11. Pilot projects to develop, test and communicate national low-carbon food dishes are expected   to start in the United States and Spain in FY11.  moving towards a more climate-friendly  food offer TURNINg FOOD WASTE INTO FUEl At some of our stores in Sweden, Norway,  Denmark and Austria, food waste goes  to a special treatment centre, where it  gets reused as biogas fuel for cars and  buses. In addition, a  number of countries sort  food waste for compost- ing and animal feed.  IKEA Sustainability Report 2010    84 ENvIRONmENT: ClIMATE / ClIMATE PERSPECTIvE ON FOOD PRODUCTS  We believe that turning waste into resources is an important step towards a more sustain- able society, and we are committed to improving the recyclability of IKEA products as well  as increasing the use of recycled materials in our range. This has the potential to reduce  our overall environmental footprint as well as our impact on the climate. pIlOT pROjECTS TO TEST FUll RECYClAbIlITY Closing the loops is a project that supports our Sustainability Direction goal to turn waste into  resources. This project, started together with WWF in 2010, aims to find new and innovative ways   to handle materials. During the project, we will investigate aspects of full recyclability and how cyclic  systems can save natural resources, minimise CO2 emissions and optimally have a positive impact  on the environment. We will explore how to close material loops, with specific focus on recyclable products and use   of recycled materials in new products. Especially interesting is the potential for upcycling, where   recycling can improve or maintain the quality and value of the materials. Still, increased traditional  recycling and controlled downcycling are also important ways to use materials in a more effective way. We are still in the early stages of this project, mapping the potential barriers and incentives for  closed loops of materials. In FY11, we plan to run pilot studies where material loops are to be closed  and evaluated. Products and packaging materials will, on a small scale, be collected in order to inves- tigate materials flows.  The pilot studies will help IKEA obtain more information about the end-of-life stage of products.   As a next step, IKEA plans to use this information to develop support tools for the consideration and  inclusion of end-of-life aspects necessary from the start of product design and development. project to improve the recyclability   of IKEA  products mAKINg mATERIAl ANTI-lOOpS  ExTINCT  One vision for IKEA is to make material  anti-loops extinct. An anti-loop is when   a product is not returned for effective recy- cling or when it is returned to nature with  negative environmental impact at the end  of its life. Instead, we want to make sure  that products and packaging materials are  part of efficient and effective material  cycles, either technical or biological.   External loops – when IKEA products are  returned to professional external parties and processed into  material for new products, that later can be used by IKEA   or other parties.   Internal loops – when material in the form of IKEA products   are returned to IKEA and turned into new IKEA products.   Bio-loops – when IKEA products are made from biodegradable  materials that are returned to nature without negative environ- mental impact.
