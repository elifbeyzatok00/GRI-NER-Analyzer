Aimed at NGOs, analysts  and investors, government and other opinion leaders, this re- port focuses on the sustainability issues of greatest concern to  our stakeholders and our business. The report also serves as  our Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact. Our reporting is guided by the three principles of the AA 1000  Assurance Standard: materiality, inclusiveness, and respon- siveness. We use leading standards and methodologies for  measuring and reporting impacts, such as the Greenhouse Gas  Protocol and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This report has  been assessed by the report auditor to meet GRI application  Level A+. We aim to report fully against the new sector supple- ment for the food processing industry in the 2011 report. Following stakeholder requests, we have reintroduced inde- pendent assurance of our sustainability reporting. In addition,  our environmental, quality, health and safety management  systems and data are audited annually by third-parties at all 77  bottling plants. At Group level, community investment data are  submitted to London Benchmarking Group (LBG) for checks,  while our compliance with industry codes on responsible sales  and marketing is periodically assessed by independent audi- tors. Suppliers are also independently audited for compliance  with our Supplier Guiding Principles. This report includes full data for calendar year 2010 pertaining  to the bottling, distribution and sales activities in all 28 countries  of operation. The following investments are not considered  here: our brewing interests in the Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia (FYROM) and Bulgaria, Greek snacks company  Tsakiris, and vending businesses in Hungary, Ireland and Italy.  None of these represents more than 1% of revenue.  To promote transparency and comparability, we have adopted  the 2004 baseline used by the global Coca-Cola System for re- porting environmental performance. We no longer report results  against our original baseline of 2002. More information about our  sustainability strategy and programmes – including Disclosures  of Management Approach - can be found on the corporate web- site. The growing number of local websites and country-level  sustainability reports are another source of information.  1 Dear Fellow Stakeholders, The year 2010 marked the  tenth anniversary of Coca-Cola  Hellenic. As we enter our sec- ond decade, we shall intensify  our efforts to ensure that our  business and our communi- ties continue to thrive. Sustainability is usually de- fined, following the Brundtland  Commission Report of 1987,  as the ability to meet the needs of the present without com- promising the ability of future generations to meet their own  needs. We have already made significant strides in our sus- tainability initiatives, but there is no room for complacency.  The hard decisions required of governments, companies  and individuals if we are to achieve a sustainable world are  soberly set out in the WWFs recent One Planet Report. At  Coca-Cola Hellenic we recognize our responsibilities.  We have therefore stepped up our climate commitments  and are now adding photovoltaic panels to factory rooftops  in addition to the construction of combined heat and power  (CHP) units. In 2010, we commissioned a further three units,  showcasing the technology with suppliers, customers, gov- ernments and others. On completion, the programme will cut  CO2 emissions from manufacturing. In addition, we are close  to completing construction of wastewater treatment plants  wherever municipalities do not or cannot treat wastewater to  Coca-Cola Hellenics standards. In 2010, 97% of our wastewa- ter was treated. We have developed further community water  partnerships, and received a second special commendation in  2010 for water stewardship efforts across our business. We are reinforcing our efforts to certify our plants against  internationally recognised standards for quality (ISO 9001),  environment (ISO 14001), food safety (ISO 22000 and FSSC  22000) and occupational health and safety (OHSAS 18001).  By 2012, we expect all plants to be fully certified. Given that we operate in many developing and emerging  markets, these achievements are significant. In Armenia,  we have gained certification for quality, food safety, environ- ment, health and safety and were the first company to in- stall wastewater treatment in full compliance with European  standards. Yet these ambitions not surprisingly brought with  them challenges. The scale of our CHP programme and its  innovative quad-generation technology caused administra- tive delays in some countries – as did our wastewater treat- ment plants. Perhaps the most significant way we are stepping up our  efforts is in managing our indirect impacts: the sustainabil- ity challenges inherent in our supply chain. Since the bulk  of our corporate water footprint is in sugar production, we  now work with sugar suppliers to understand and address  our indirect water use. Similarly, the largest contributors to  our carbon footprint sit in our value chain: the manufacture  of beverage packaging and use of cooling equipment. We  therefore partnered with suppliers to develop more energy  efficient coolers. We have made our packaging lighter and  included recycled content. In addition, we led the establish- ment of recovery organisations in 19 countries. Throughout the recession, we have worked to protect jobs  in our business and our supply chain, and we have offered  increased opportunities for training and development. En- couragingly, engagement levels in 2010 were 13 percentage  points higher than in the previous survey. The number of serious accidents continues to fall. Our safety  programme has led to a 39% reduction since 2009. Regret- tably, we continued to experience fatalities. We are doing all  we can to eliminate them.  Long-term strategic partnerships are essential to the success  of our sustainability efforts. At global level, we are a long- standing and active participant in the UN Global Compact – in  global platforms and local networks –which requires commit- ment to recognised principles of good corporate citizenship. Our sustainability goals are long-term, building value for our  business and our communities, and we already see benefits.  In addition to cost efficiencies, we gain reputational advan- tage as an employer, business partner, community member  and business in which to invest. In 2010, we retained our  listing on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (World and  STOXX) for the third consecutive year. As a result, we are  among the top 10% of companies worldwide and top four  beverage companies for sustainability. We were also includ- ed in the Ethibel EXCELLENCE Investment Register. We hope this report provides the information you seek. As  always, we welcome your comments.

Water use in our agricultural supply  chain accounts for the greatest share  of our water footprint. We and The  Coca-Cola Company are working with  sugar producers to better understand  its impacts. Packaging represents the greatest  source of CO2 emissions in our supply  chain. Through collaboration, we re- duce the weight of our beverage con- tainers, and increase recycled content. We also work with suppliers to de- velop low-carbon technologies, such  as our pioneering work to develop cli- mate-friendly refrigeration and com- bined heat and power (CHP) plants  that use quad-generation technology. Almost 90% of our supplier spend is  within our countries of operation, sup- porting local jobs and economies. Our  independently audited Supplier Guid- ing Principles programme aims to  ensure good workplace practices in  suppliers.   Bottling Plants We own and operate 77 plants and 365  warehouses and distribution centres,  in addition to corporate offices. Our  business employed 43,189 people at  the end of 2010. Since 2004, we have significantly re- duced the environmental impacts of  our operations. We have improved  our energy and water use efficiency  by 22% and 19% respectively. We also implement transformational  programmes such as the construction  of combined heat and power (CHP)  plants to reduce carbon emissions by  250,000 tonnes each year. We own 43  wastewater treatment plants, and 97%  of our wastewater was treated in 2010. There are 49 trade unions in 15 of our  country operations and work councils in  a further seven. Twenty countries have  a safety committee with joint manage- ment and employee representation.  We also invest significantly in develop- ing our employees to their full poten- tial. Across our operations, we gained  employer of choice awards in 16 coun- tries in 2010. Internationally recognised manage- ment system standards ensure that  our approach is rigorous and effective.  By 2012, we aim to have certified all  plants for quality, environment, health  and safety, and food safety. Fleet and  Transportation Coca-Cola Hellenic has a relatively  small transportation footprint. Our  plants are largely local, as are the ma- jority of our suppliers. In 2010, the Company owned or leased  3,109 haulage and delivery trucks,  3,452 management cars and 14,696  sales and other vehicles, which con- sumed 85 million litres of fuel. Road safety is a particular concern in  our emerging and developing mar- kets, as six of our nine fatalities re- sulted from road traffic accidents. Through our Safe and Eco-Driving pro- gramme and other initiatives, we have  reduced the number of accidents and  avoided 954 tonnes of CO2 since 2009. Our commitment to sustainability does not stop at the boundaries of our bottling plants. Today, we work to  address the impacts of our business throughout our value chain from suppliers to end-consumers. To do so, we work collaboratively with our business partners, The Coca-Cola Company in particular. In  addition, we contribute to broader initiatives that promote sustainable development in our communities.  Much of our business is in the developing and emerging markets, where our goal is to take a leadership role.  9   Sales The greatest share of our total carbon  footprint comes from the 1,508,000  coolers, vendors and fountains used  to chill our beverages for immediate  consumption. Our new cold drink equipment is up  to 63% more energy-efficient than in  2004 and most new models are now  free of hydrofluorocarbons. By retro- fitting energy management devices to  existing fleet, we are also improving  the efficiency of equipment already in  the marketplace. Increasingly, we work with customers  on joint sustainability projects, help- ing to educate their shoppers about  recycling or healthy lifestyles. We also  support small-scale entrepreneurs,  helping to set up and grow distribution  and retail businesses.   Consumers We respond to the changing health  and wellness needs of our consumers  by offering more reduced-calorie and  nutritionally enhanced beverages. We  have taken a leadership role in placing  front-of-pack nutritional labels and  adhere to stringent codes on respon- sible sales and marketing. More than 99% of production volume  comes from operations which are ISO  9001 certified. We also help consumers to recycle  their beverage packages. In 19 coun- tries, we have led the establishment of  systems which recycled or recovered  64% of packaging during 2010.   Communities We invest significantly in our local  communities, supporting environ- mental conservation and promoting  sustainable development. In 2010,  we invested more than 9.5 million  in community programmes and part- nerships, or 1.4% of pre-tax profits. We now have watershed protection  projects in 26 countries and covering  all major rivers. More than 1.2 million  people participate in our sports and  fitness programmes each year. In addition to raising public awareness  of sustainability challenges, we en- courage employees, local businesses  and communities to participate in our  initiatives.  Certifications of Bottling Plants (% of plants certified) ISO 9001 ISO 14001 OHSAS 18001 ISO 22000 FSSC 22000 10 Our Approach Our sustainability agenda has been, and re- mains, a journey. As a participant in the UN  Global Compact, we have integrated social and  environmental considerations into the way we  do business. With our commitment built into our corporate  mission and operating framework, we have focused on:   Establishing governance and management structures   Identifying and addressing material issues   Developing robust management systems and standards  Monitoring progress and ensuring compliance Now that our approach to sustainability is integrated through- out our business and we have made major progress in all fo- cus areas, we are reaching further into our value chain.  Addressing Material Issues We focus our efforts on the greatest sustainability challenges  for our business and our communities. These challenges  have been identified through risk management processes,  stakeholder feedback and ecological analyses of operations,  products and raw materials. In this report, we discuss the  seven most relevant and significant issues:   Managing our use of water and helping to protect wa- tersheds   Tackling energy use, reducing direct and indirect carbon  emissions   Reducing the environmental impacts of packaging  Helping consumers lead healthy lifestyles  Developing employees to their full potential    Working with suppliers to address indirect impacts   Investing in local communities Through bold and decisive action, we aim to turn business  risks into opportunities, stimulating innovation, driving cost ef- ficiencies, gaining reputation and competitive advantage. Systems and Standards To guide our sustainability programmes, we have built a robust  framework of policies and management systems. These help to  translate our commitment to the UN Global Compact into action- able requirements for our business.  The Coca-Cola Hellenic Code of Business Conduct underpins  our standards and outline the behaviour required of employ- ees and directors. Integrity is one of our Companys core val- ues and we have a zero-tolerance of corruption and aim to  comply with all applicable laws.  We have also developed a set of sustainability-related policies  and standards which are periodically reviewed and updated.  In addition, we help to develop industry codes and standards. Management Systems Our programme to certify all bottling plants to internationally  recognised management system standards is nearing com- pletion. These standards include: quality (ISO 9001), environ- ment (ISO 14001), health and safety (OHSAS 18001) and food  safety (ISO 22000 and FSSC 22000).  Since much of our business is in developing and emerging  territories, this has been an enormous undertaking. We aim  to take a leadership role and achieve full certification of all 77  bottling plants by 2012.  Governance and Management  Our sustainability agenda is driven from the top of the Com- pany. At Board level, the CSR Committee meets quarterly. The  Committee approves sustainability strategy and targets and re- views actual performance. Both the Board CSR Committee and  Integrating Sustainability Developing our business in a sustainable manner is part of the corporate mission of Coca-Cola Hellenic.   We must not only refresh consumers, partner with customers and reward shareholders, but do so while  protecting the environment and enriching the lives of our communities. We are on track to achieve full certification of all bottling plants by 2012.  11 the Operating Committee (OpCo) are briefed on sustainability  developments, as needed, to ensure that they are kept abreast  of changing risks and opportunities.  At corporate level, the cross-functional CSR Council also  meets quarterly. The Council identifies strategic risks and op- portunities, sets targets and reviews performance, as well as  assessing compliance. Each country operation has a manager  who oversees CSR activities, in addition to health, safety and  environmental coordinators at every bottling plant. New spe- cialist networks across our business help to advance specific  topics, such as health and safety; water stewardship; and en- ergy efficiency. Corruption-related risks are the responsibility of our Internal Audit  function, which reports directly to the Audit Committee. All opera- tions are assessed for corruption risks every two to three years,  with those in higher-risk countries audited more frequently. The Coca-Cola System As part of our global business system, we work closely on  sustainability programmes with The Coca-Cola Company and  other bottlers. In Europe, a joint Corporate Reputation and Sus- tainability Board meets twice a year to approve shared goals  and review progress.

Making It Happen  To bring our sustainability commitments to life, we clearly de- fine accountability and rigorously measure and monitor our  performance. Building Accountability Our Leadership Pipeline includes CSR as one of seven key re- sults areas in which Coca-Cola Hellenic leaders must excel to  progress through leadership layers. All managers therefore  have annual performance objectives related to sustainability;  these help to determine career progression, as well as vari- able compensation. Training and Awareness All Coca-Cola Hellenic employees are trained in the Code of  Business Conduct. Our various reporting channels – includ- ing a confidential hotline and email system – are widely pub- licised. We also make employees aware that if they do not  report a suspected violation, they themselves violate the Code.  Our people are also trained in other aspects of sustainability,  based on their roles. Commercial employees are trained in  competition law, for example, while drivers are trained in our  Safe and Eco-Driving programme. Ensuring Compliance We regularly review our compliance with laws, regulations and  internal standards. Compliance and continuous improvement are integral to our  management systems. In addition to regular internal audits,  third parties verify these systems on an annual basis.  Our confidential hotline and email system are another important  way to assess compliance. Concerns raised through these and  other reporting channels are independently investigated, with  findings reported to the Audit Committee. Violations of the Code  of Business Conduct lead to disciplinary action, even dismissal. In 2010, Coca-Cola Hellenic received no significant1 fines for  non-compliance with laws and regulations. A Culture of Sustainability We also encourage employee involvement and feedback. To  root sustainability into corporate culture, we communicate our  CSR strategy and progress through our company magazine  Journey and our internal TV channel. Training in the Code of Business Conduct A new e-Learning programme is helping to ensure  that our Code of Business Conduct is understood. The  programme includes a test which every employee must  pass in order to become certified. Already available in 11  languages, the programme will be translated into more.  During the first year, 73% of email-enabled employees  completed the course and achieved certification. This new initiative complements existing training and  communications. An annual letter from the Managing  Director to every employee reaffirms our zero- tolerance approach to corruption. In addition, we send  monthly tips by email and ensure that all new recruits receive in-person training. Third consecutive listing in DJSI For the third consecutive year, Coca-Cola Hellenic has  achieved listings on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index  (DJSI) and the DJSI Europe Index (STOXX). This makes us one of only four beverage producers worldwide on the 2010  DJSI World Index – one of two in the Europe Index. We are the only Greek-based company in the Index. In the face of  fierce competition and ever higher standards, we must work hard to retain our listing. 1. Fines of 1 million or more are deemed significant by financial auditors.  13 As we address our indirect impacts, working collaboratively  becomes even more important. Since we do not own or con- trol these other entities, we can only achieve progress by  working together. Our Approach We engage with our stakeholders in a variety of ways, in- cluding:   Integrating sustainability into core business relationships  and day-to-day engagement   Forming or joining strategic partnerships to address key  issues   Mobilising others – raising awareness and encouraging  involvement    Seeking expert input on our sustainability strategy and re- porting Working in Partnership Wherever we operate, we aim to establish long-term part- nerships with NGOs, UN agencies, government agencies and  others. From conserving watersheds to promoting healthy  lifestyles, working in partnership is central to delivering our  commitments. Set up in 2010, the European Water Footprint Sustainability  Assessment Sounding Board for Sugar is one such initiative.  This new coalition of European sugar producers, Coca-Cola  bottlers, NGOs and academia aims to address indirect water  use in agricultural supply chain.  Our longest-standing partnership, the Green Danube,  marked its fifth anniversary in 2010. Under this umbrella,  country-level partnerships with environment ministries,  NGOs and others conserve watersheds and raise public  awareness in eight countries. In addition, we join major partnerships and strategic initia- tives. We were founding members of the CEO Water Man- date and Caring for Climate and actively support 14 local  networks of the Global Compact. Dialogue and Engagement  During 2010, we continued to deepen our collaboration with key  stakeholders on sustainability issues. More details on the part- ners and projects below can be found in subsequent chapters. NGOs and IGOs – Partners such as the WWF, ICPDR, Water  Footprint Network and UN agencies provide the technical  expertise for our sustainability programmes. With strong  water stewardship programmes in place, we are broaden- ing the range of partners and issues we tackle, such as our  growing collaboration with the Red Cross.  Engaging Stakeholders Engaging with stakeholders - the people who affect our business or who are affected by it – is fundamental  to our business success. Engagement is also integral to our sustainability strategy. We cannot be  successful if we do not listen to others or work with them. Groupwide Partnerships UNGC United Nations Global Compact CEO Water Mandate Caring for Climate ICPDR International Commission for the Protection of  the Danube River Country Partnerships WWF World Wide Fund for Nature IFRC International Federation of Red Cross  and Red Crescent Societies UNDP United Nations Development Programme GWP Global Water Partnership UNESCO United Nations Educational, Scientific and  Cultural Organization  14 Engaging Stakeholders Governments – We work in partnership with government  agencies on water stewardship, packaging recovery and  active lifestyle programmes in many countries. In addition,  we work with industry associations to inform public policy  on sustainability challenges, sharing our experiences and  advancing practical solutions. We aim to be transparent  about our positions – calling for urgent action on climate  change; promoting integrated water resource management  and championing the producer responsibility principle, for  example. Our Code of Business Conduct governs how we interact with  politicians and authorities. No political contributions were  made by Coca-Cola Hellenic in 2010. Employees – Our overall engagement score rose 13 points  in our 2010 survey of employees. This was due to concerted  efforts to build trust and communication following previous  survey findings. As the recession continued, we tried to main- tain jobs and minimise redundancies, keeping employees in- formed of business developments. Volunteerism is a growing  part of engagement and in 2010, more than 6,000 employees  took part in our community projects. In 2010, Coca-Cola  Hellenic gained employer of choice awards in 16 countries. Suppliers – To address our indirect impacts, we have  stepped up collaboration with suppliers. We have shared the  results of water footprint studies and begun discussions to  reduce water use in sugar production. Work also continues  with suppliers to develop low-carbon and resource-efficient  technologies, such as our cold drink equipment and quad- generation CHP units. Our next step is to assess suppliers  carbon reduction programmes.  During the recession, we continued to support local suppli- ers. We commission independent audits of working condi- tions in our supply chain.  Customers – As part of our drive to place customers at the  heart of everything we do, we are increasing collaboration with  retailers and other customers on sustainability issues. Pro- grammes are at an early stage but we have already worked  together to raise shopper awareness of active lifestyles, pack- aging reduction and water stewardship in several countries.  We also support independent businesses and entrepreneurs. Consumers – To date, our greatest interaction has been in  two main areas: consumer health and recycling. We have re- sponded to demand for more reduced-calorie and nutrition- ally enhanced beverages; undertaken consumer research  and education about our nutritional labels; and developed  responsible marketing practices that respond to concerns of  parents and educators. We also urge consumers to recycle  their cans and bottles, providing the infrastructure and edu- cation to help them do so.  We are expanding such interaction, integrating sustainabil- ity into our brands and marketing programmes, such as the  award-winning Greek reforestation project of local mineral  water brand Avra.  Communities – We continued to invest significantly in com- munity programmes throughout the recession. We also en- gage with communities in other ways, facilitating employee  and community volunteerism in our programmes and ac- tively supporting local networks of the Global Compact. Bot- tling plants host visits from stakeholder groups and plant  managers are responsible for engaging with their commu- nity on local issues. Investors – Social and environmental performance is inte- gral to our engagement with investors, from roadshow pre- sentations to our Annual Report. In 2010, Coca-Cola Hellenic  was voted No.1 in the European beverage sector for investor  relations by Institutional Investor magazine. We also engage with ratings agencies, socially responsible  investors and analysts and discuss climate risks in our sub- mission to the Carbon Disclosure Project. The Fondation  Guil helps to guide our sustainability strategy and reporting  by assessing how well we meet our commitments to the UN  Global Compact. Seeking Expert Input To inform our approach, we periodically seek input from ex- perts on specific sustainability topics. Coca-Cola Hellenic is a  member of several sustainability working groups, including  the IMDs Center for Corporate Sustainability Management. In Greece, we involved consumers in our award-winning partnership  to restore forests devastated by recent wildfires. Together with the  environmental NGO Arcturos and retailers, we gave away samplings  in return for purchases of our mineral water. More than 22,140 young  trees were planted in forests and we have pledged to care for them  until they take root.  15 In 2010, we hosted multi-stakeholder meetings in Hungary  and Russia on packaging and recycling; while in Greece, a  major stakeholder survey helped identify the focus for our  new community programme I Care for My Health. Our Stakeholder Panel At corporate level, we benefit from the insights of our annual  Stakeholder Panel. In 2010, we expanded panel membership  to include customer and supplier representatives, in addition  to NGOs, academia, investors, trade associations and CSR  specialists. Furthermore, the Panel now provides a critique  of our report which we publish unedited (see Stakeholder  Review Statement). The Panel meeting in November 2010 generated constructive  feedback on our sustainability strategy and reporting. We also  received valuable input on our reporting from the Fondation  Guil, GRI and CSR Europe. Key points are listed below. Feedback from Our Stakeholder Panel What Stakeholders Said How We Responded Assurance – External assurance of our report would enhance  its credibility We reinstated external auditing of our sustainability reporting  (see Verification Statement) Compliance – We should describe more fully our approach to  compliance We include a separate section on compliance   (see Integrating Sustainability) Diversity – We should explain our statistics and of how we are  diversity-proofing Coca-Cola Hellenic We discuss research and projects underway to improve our  Companys diversity Anti-corruption – Although our reporting has improved, we  could provide more detail We describe anti-corruption activities in the relevant sections  of the report Suppliers – This chapter was weaker in past reports. It needs  more information We significantly expanded this chapter and added a section on  Sustainable Agriculture Global Compact – We should publish the Ten Principles,  showing how we support each We include a table showing how we implement and promote  each of the Ten Principles in our business, value chain and  beyond External commentary – A panel review of report would be  more valuable than commentaries by individual experts Our Stakeholder Panel has reviewed this report and we  publish their findings unedited In Italy, we are working with retailers to stage an interactive exhibition  on recycling. More than 5,500 people have already visited the exhibit  and over 4,000 copies of our childrens book on recycling have been  distributed. GREEN DANUBE PARTNERSHIP www.coca-colahellenic.com/sustainability/commitmentinaction/greendanubepartner/ I CARE FOR MY HEALTH www.en.coca-colahellenic.gr/Towardssustainabilit/MajorCSRPrograms/ICareforMyHealth/  The worlds available freshwater is limited and accounts for less  than 1% of water on the planet. Yet there are competing demands  on this finite resource: safe water and sanitation; agriculture and  industry, as well as maintaining ecosystems. 19% rise in water efficiency  since 2004 3rd consecutive year we have reduced  our absolute water use Operational water footprint is 48%  smaller than 2004 More than 97% of wastewater  treated in 2010 WATER  STEWARDSHIP                 Water Availability in Our Watersheds Location of bottling operations Extreme scarcity < 500 m3/person/year Scarcity 500-1,000 m3/person/year Stress 1,000-1,700 m3/person/year Sufficient 1,700-4,000 m3/person/year Abundant > 4,000 m3/person/year  17 Freshwater demands increase as populations grow and be- come more urbanised. In addition, poor or fragmented gover- nance has led to depletion and pollution of water resources. With climate change intensifying the problem, communities  and ecosystems suffer increasingly from water stress. Wa- ter scarcity and declining water quality are now recognised  as strategic challenges for businesses, too.  Our Approach Since 2003, Coca-Cola Hellenic has developed and evolved  a comprehensive approach to water stewardship. As a bev- erage company, we anticipated the growing water-related  risks to our business and have made significant progress  in managing them effectively. The ISO 14001 certifications of  our bottling plants (now covering 97% of produced volume)  are an essential process towards eliminating risks of pollu- tion and fostering continuous improvement. Our water stewardship strategy focuses on:  Ensuring the sustainability of our water extraction   Reducing water use within operations  Treating 100% of our wastewater    Working with suppliers and others to reduce our indirect  water use  Partnering with others to protect local watersheds  Our approach is underpinned by our support of the CEO Wa- ter Mandate (assessment available online), as well as our  new water stewardship policy. Developed in 2010, this policy  recognises that safe drinking water and sanitation are basic  human needs. Although provision of water is largely a gov- ernment responsibility, we ensure that our water use will  not negatively impact water available for the basic needs of  local communities. In 2010, we received a special commendation for Outstand- ing and sustainable contribution to international water stew- ardship at the Water Innovation Awards.  Understanding Water Risks As a beverage manufacturer producing locally, our business  depends on the availability and quality of local freshwater  sources. Most of our bottling plants are located within river  basins which are water-abundant. Some watersheds face  water stress, like the Vistula and Dniepr river basins, while  others experience seasonal water scarcity, such as the east- ern Mediterranean and northern Nigeria. Since 2007, each of our bottling plants has conducted com- prehensive assessments of local water resources, develop- ing an in-depth understanding of their inherent risks. Our most recent assessments of local water risk showed  that eight bottling plants are located in areas facing baseline  water stress. Approximately one-third of the water we use  is from municipal sources; the remaining two-thirds is from  our own wells. Seven plants are approaching the technical  or administrative supply limits, so that we are investigating  alternative supplies. In most countries of operation, both  public and private water supplies are strictly regulated. This  ensures that local communities are not disadvantaged by in- dustrial water use. Working with The Coca-Cola Company, we are developing  source water protection plans (SWPPs) for each bottling plant.  First, hydrogeology specialists help each plant complete a  Source Vulnerability Assessment. Potential risks to the quality  and quantity of local water supplies and the overall health of  the aquifer are identified. We also assess our water use vis- Annual Water Supply Levels.  Water Use Ratio (litres / lpb) 2.86 2.59 2.48 2.40 2.61 2.30 -3% vs 2010 -40% -19% vs 2004 Total Water Use (billion litres) Production volume 22.2 25.8 29.1 28.9 28 27.3 no  increase 5.7 3.2 1.3 -2% vs 2004 baseline 18 -vis the needs of other users, evaluating the plants engage- ment with local stakeholders on water issues. Following this assessment, the plants water resource man- agement team develops a plan to address the critical chal- lenges identified at catchment level, from hydrological vul- nerabilities to local government management capacity. By  2012, all bottling plants will have developed a Source Water  Protection Plan.  Improving Our Efficiency  Coca-Cola Hellenic has improved its water use efficiency by  19% since 2004. We now use 2.3 litres of water to produce  one litre of beverage. We have reduced our water use in absolute terms for the  third consecutive year. In 2010, Coca-Cola Hellenics bottling  operations used 27.3 billion litres of water. Since we cannot reduce the water content of our beverages,  we focus on reducing and recycling water in our manufac- turing processes. In 2010, we recycled and reused 1.2 billion  litres of water. To help plants identify opportunities, we have  conducted audits, developed toolkits and shared best prac- tice. As a result, technologies such as dry lube, air rinsers  and recycle and reclaim loops are being implemented. We also pilot new technologies. Using less water in clean- ing processes is an area in which we have made particu- lar progress. Switching to cold Cleaning-in-Place during  2010 yielded savings of up to 40% of water and energy while  achieving the same or better standards of cleaning. There are two parts of our business where water use is  relatively high. In certain countries, we use refillable bot- tles which need to be thoroughly washed before reuse.  Secondly, our aseptic production lines to produce juices  and teas without preservatives also require significantly  more water in their cleaning processes. To reduce this, we  piloted an innovative system to recover water from rinse  sections of aseptic lines. After encouraging results, we will  now move to commercial validation under normal produc- tion conditions. As our water-savings programmes mature, further im- provement will require significant capital investment. We  have therefore developed a process to evaluate and priori- tise projects by investment required and payback in terms  of water savings and return on investment. We have also  established a network of water experts across our business  to help guide the next phase of our water-savings strategy. Treating Wastewater In some countries, municipal facilities cannot treat our  wastewater to a level that supports aquatic life, the stan- dard required by our business system. In 2003, we there- fore committed to build on-site wastewater treatment plants  wherever municipal facilities were inadequate. This major investment programme is nearing completion.  During 2010, we constructed a further three on-site waste- water treatment plants, bringing the total to 43 across our  business. As a result, on average 97% of all wastewater in  2010 was treated, a figure which rose to 99% by year-end. We believe this to be is an unparallelled achievement in our  territories. Nevertheless, we narrowly missed our goal of  100% wastewater treatment by 2010. In FYROM, we did not  receive planning permission to construct our final plant in  time, but construction began in early 2011 and should be  completed later in the year. During 2010, 14,380 million litres of wastewater were re- turned to the natural environment. Total COD discharge was  1,044 tonnes, 70% below 2003 levels. Water Stewardship The water ratio (relative water use, normalised for production) in bottling  operations has considerably decreased due to water-saving activities. Coca-Cola Hellenics absolute water use in bottling operations has  increased less than production volume and has started to decrease.  Much of the increase resulted from the acquisition of businesses and the  internalisation of their water use. When correcting for this, the total 2010  water use is 2% below 2004 levels.  Wider Water Footprint of Our Supply Chain (million m3) Sugar water footprint (792 million m3) Packaging water footprint (196 million m3) Bottling operations water footprint (23 million m3) Blue water footprint Green water footprint Grey water footprint Water Footprint from Bottling Operations (million m3) Later acquisitions blue and grey water Blue water Grey water Production volume 6.9 2 1.1 34.9 21.1 15.4 13.3 12.1 9.8 9.9 12.3 15 14.2 13.8 13.6 -2% vs 2010 -50% vs baseline -48% vs 2004 baseline 19 Reducing Indirect Water Use  Coca-Cola Hellenics operational water use is significantly  smaller than that used in its supply chain. Our wider water  footprint reveals that our indirect water use is up to 43 times  that used in our own operations. This includes water used by  agriculture to grow sugar. Agriculture is the biggest user of freshwater resources globally,  therefore it is unsurprising that agricultural crops represent the  greatest share of our water footprint. We have started to address  this as part of broader efforts towards sustainable agriculture.  As sugar is the main agricultural commodity we use, this is our  initial focus. In Europe, we are founding members of the Eu- ropean Water Footprint Sustainability Assessment Sounding  Board for Sugar. This brings together our business system with  the Water Footprint Network, academia and leading European  sugar companies to better understand the water footprint of the  sugar we use. We are also working on a methodology to evalu- ate the sustainability of this water footprint in its local context.  At a global level, The Coca-Cola Company actively partici- pates in the Better Sugarcane Initiative and the Sustainable  Agriculture Initiative (SAI) on behalf of our business system  (see Supplier Engagement). Our Water Footprint  Coca-Cola Hellenics corporate water footprint represents the  freshwater consumed directly and indirectly by our business.  In 2010, this footprint was calculated to be 1,011 billion litres.  Most of this (97.7%) is due to our supply chain, agriculture in  particular, with water use by our own operations accounting  for only 2.3%. This footprint includes the three different types of freshwater  used by our business:    Blue water is freshwater extracted and not returned to the  watershed - the water in our products, as well as ground  or surface water used to irrigate sugar and other crops in  South European countries.   Green water is rain water used to grow crops, especially  sugar beet, in our supply chain. In temperate climates, sugar  beet crops use no more water than natural vegetation such  as grassland, so their net green water footprint is near zero.    Grey water is an indicator of water pollution. Our grey water  footprint has sharply declined as our programme to con- struct wastewater treatment facilities nears completion. Fer- tilisers and untreated wastewater in our agricultural supply  chain account for the remainder of our grey water footprint. Water footprints have also been calculated for core products  of The Coca-Cola Company. Community Partnerships Beyond our value chain, Coca-Cola Hellenic actively sup- ports community water programmes in almost every  country of operation. Since 2005, we have worked to build  long-term partnerships with NGOs, government and UN  agencies in 26 of our 28 territories. Together, we develop  programmes that benefit local ecosystems and commu- nities: conserving local watersheds; improving access to  clean water and sanitation; and raising local awareness  and involvement. We also support initiatives that promote  an integrated approach to water resource management and  better water governance. In absolute terms, the total water footprint of our bottling operations has  decreased by 48% since 2004, although production volume has risen 58%. As  the methodology was strengthened, we recalculated our baseline to a tougher  standard, which results in a higher baseline than published previously. Our own operations account for only 2.3% of our wider water footprint.  20 Water Stewardship Watershed Protection Rivers are a particular focus for our conservation efforts.  These vital waterways face threats ranging from excessive  water extraction and over-fishing to agricultural run-off, in- frastructure and dams. All major river basins in our territories are now covered  by Coca-Cola Hellenic watershed protection projects. The  most longstanding is our Green Danube partnership with the  ICPDR which in 2010 saw activities in eight countries. The  River Danube is the main source of water for millions but  is among the worlds most endangered rivers, according to  WWF. Since 2005, our partnership has helped restore wet- lands, providing critical habitat for flora and fauna, and sup- porting better river basin management as well as extensive  public awareness campaigns. Such water basins also offer important opportunities for in- ternational collaboration. Our project to reduce plastic pol- lution in the Tisza River, an important Danube tributary, has  involved collaborative activities between Ukraine, Slovakia,  Hungary and Romania. Other conservation programmes include:   Russia – Since 2006, our Living Volga programme partner- ship with UNESCO set up annual Volga Day celebrations and  riverbank clean-ups in nine major cities, Volga art and eco- contests, environmental education for schoolchildren, as  well as seminars on wetland biodiversity and eco-tourism.    Poland – Now in the fourth year of our project with WWF,  we have helped to restock the Vistula River with 1,400,000  salmon fry. The fish had been almost eliminated from the  river due to pollution, overfishing and dam construction.   Belarus – Our partnership with local NGO partner Birdlife  Belarus has been restoring Yelnya Bog since 2007. Block- ing the canals that artificially drain the Bog has allowed  groundwater levels to rise by a metre. As a result of this  and the cessation of forest fires, CO2 emissions from the  Bog have fallen and native birds and vegetation have be- gun to return. Education and Awareness We also build public awareness and understanding of local  water issues. High-profile annual festivals that celebrate indig- enous rivers are a particularly successful way to demonstrate  the importance of rivers to local ecological, economic and so- cial well-being. These events represent the annual culmination  of conservation, education and awareness-raising activities. The largest river festival in the world, Danube Day is now  celebrated in eight countries across the Danube Basin.  From NGOs to local authorities, more than 480 organisations  helped us run 140 events in 2010. These included scientific  seminars, roundtables and eco-camps, to community clean- ups and traditional cultural entertainment. Inspired by the success of Danube Day, we have launched  programmes to celebrate other rivers, including the Volga,  Dnieper, Sava, Tisza and Vistula. We continue to expand the  reach of these festivals. In Serbia alone, we extended cel- ebrations of Danube Day to 20 towns and cities in 2010. We also encourage communities to become actively in- volved in conservation. As a starting point, we engage vol- unteers from our workforce and communities in cleaning  up local watersheds. Ideally, we aim for programmes to be  community-owned. In Poland and the Ukraine, we give grants to community  projects to rehabilitate springs and engage local commu- nities. To date, 15 natural springs have been rehabilitated.  Similarly, our Kropla Beskidu fund in Poland gives grants to  projects that protect the local watershed. Across the island of Ireland, more than 100 groups of volun- teers care for rural beaches as part of the Clean Coasts initiative  we support. Our Green Coast Awards recognise their achieve- ments while our Clean Coast Week raises public awareness. Schools Education Teaching young people about water sustainability is an im- portant component of awareness-raising. In a growing num- ber of countries, we work with government and NGO part- ners to develop educational resources.   Our award-winning Danube Box tool-kit has now reached  more than one million schoolchildren in eight countries. It  was introduced to schools in Bulgaria and the Czech Re- public in 2010. In Belarus, we are helping to restore the endangered Yelnya Bog. As  a result, groundwater levels have risen by one metre and forest fires  have ceased.  21 The rainwater collected by the Mission Water programme in Greece  will yield an estimated 650,000 litres annually - enough to meet the  freshwater needs of more than 5,500 people. Our partnership with Global Water Partnership-Mediterranean has set  up 18 rainwater harvesting systems in public buildings on eight Greek  islands. ENVIRONMENTAL PARTNERSHIPS www.coca-colahellenic.com/sustainability/commitmentinaction/envpartnerships/ CLEAN COASTS www.coca-colahellenic.com/sustainability/commitmentinaction/envpartnerships/ RAINWATER HARVESTING PROGRAMME www.en.coca-colahellenic.gr/Towardssustainabilit/MajorCSRPrograms/MissionWater/   A Volga Box has been launched in Russia, where more  than 2,000 schoolchildren and students also take part in  our annual Green Team clean-up activities.   In Nigeria, our new Water Ambassadors programme en- gages schoolchildren and communities. On World Water  Day, children from 60 schools visited our plants and our  wastewater treatment facilities to learn about protecting  water quality, the theme for 2010.   In Italy, our childrens book, The Mystery of the Disappear- ing Water, has been used by more than 3,500 schools. The  book has been turned into an award-winning film and a  stage play which is touring 30 Italian cities. In addition, the  book has been translated and launched in Russia. Water and Sanitation Safe water and sanitation is essential to human health and  development, yet one-third of the worlds population still lacks  access. The problem is most acute in sub-saharan Africa. In Nigeria, our plants provide access to potable water, bore- holes and tanks. In 2011, we will take this support to a new  level, working with Coca-Cola Nigeria and WaterHealth In- ternational to deliver affordable, quality drinking water to  rural and disadvantaged communities nationwide. The pro- gramme is part of the broader Replenish Africa Initiative  (RAIN), a $30 million commitment by The Coca-Cola Company  and others to provide more than two million people in Africa  with access to clean water by 2015. In Nigeria, our local op- erations and Coca-Cola Nigeria have committed $1 million  for projects in 2011 and we are studying the placement of  Water Health Centres, a network of community-owned wa- ter purification micro utilities. We also support initiatives to improve the quality and avail- ability of water supplies and sanitation in a number of other  developing and emerging markets.  In established markets, too, we help address the growing  problem of water scarcity. In Greece, our rainwater harvest- ing programme with Global Water Partnership-Mediterranean  has established 18 systems in schools and public buildings on  eight islands. These systems will yield an estimated 650,000  litres annually – enough to meet the freshwater needs of  more than 5,500 people. The Mission Water project won a Eu- ropean Excellence Award in 2010. All 13 Nigerian plants now have on-site wastewater treatment units. On  World Water Day 2010, children from 60 schools visited our plants to  learn about protecting water quality. As part of our Water Ambassadors  programme, the pupils saw our treatment facilities, met local water  officials and received water treatment products for use at home.

As this  continues, hotter and drier summers are expected to dry up rivers and  jeopardise harvests, leading to increased food prices and economic  hardship. Milder and wetter winters will erode soil and cause floods,  threatening farming communities and cities. Everybody will be  affected by climate change – but the poorest people and countries  will suffer the most. ENERGY AND  CLIMATE CHANGE                 25 If we are to avoid catastrophic climate change, the earths tem- perature should not increase by more than 2C. Urgent and ex- tensive action is required by all sectors to achieve this. In 2010,  Coca-Cola Hellenic signed the Cancun Communiqu which  calls on world leaders to redouble their efforts to achieve a  climate deal and pursue an ambitious mitigation strategy. The private sector has a vital role to play. Through innovation  and long-term investments in energy efficiency and low-car- bon technologies, business must turn the climate challenge  into market opportunities. We reaffirm our commitment to transforming Coca-Cola  Hellenic into a low-carbon business. Carbon management is  a strategic priority for the Company and we are already see- ing business benefits resulting from ongoing investments in  energy efficiency and low carbon technologies. Understanding Our Climate Risks  Climate change presents significant risks to our business –  from rising energy costs to threats to our agricultural sup- ply chain and availability of water. Through innovation and  leadership, we aim to convert these risks into opportunities:  cost-savings, reputation benefit and competitive advantage  to name but a few (see table next page). Our report to the  Carbon Disclosure Project discusses these risks and oppor- tunities in detail. Our Approach As we transform Coca-Cola Hellenic into a low-carbon busi- ness, we have committed to take a leadership role. Since  much of our business is in developing and emerging mar- kets, we have a responsibility to promote the need for urgent  climate action.  We are tackling climate change in the following ways:  Improving our energy efficiency  Switching to cleaner energy sources   Working with others to reduce indirect emissions  Developing and promoting low-carbon technologies   Supporting climate adaptation We aim to reduce total emissions while growing our business.  As a founding signatory of the UN Global Compact Caring for  Climate platform, we publish a self-assessment of our perfor- mance against these requirements on our website. In the past few years, we have come close to stabilising  direct emissions, decoupling energy use from organic  growth. Nevertheless, we must still compensate for emis- sions associated with business acquisitions. By 2020, our  goal is to reduce emissions by 25% compared to 2004.  We also lead the European food and drink industry in de- veloping and deploying low-carbon technologies. Coca-Cola   Hellenic was the only non-alcoholic beverage company in- vited to showcase its CO2 reduction programme at CSR Eu- ropes Enterprise 2020 MarketPlace. Our innovative quad- generation CHP programme has also been designated an  Official Partner of the EC Sustainable Energy Europe cam- paign. Reducing Direct Emissions To reduce direct emissions, we are driving energy efficien- cy throughout our business: in manufacturing processes,  equipment, buildings and fleet. Our Carbon Footprint    Our direct emissions are largely due to manufacturing and fleet. In 2010, direct emissions were calculated to be  849,719 tonnes of CO2 a 0.6% increase compared to 2009, due to an increase in production sales volume.   Our indirect emissions mostly result from our cold drink equipment and our packaging. These indirect  emissions amounted to 5,13 million tonnes of CO2 in 2010. This is 0.6% higher than 2009, again due to higher  production volume. On-site Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units are now operational at  four bottling plants; a further five are due to become operational in 2011.  Energy Ratio (MJ / lpb) 0.73 -40% vs 2004 0.66 0.59 0.57 -3% 0.60 0.57 -23% vs 2004 Total Energy Use (billion MJ) 5.9 6.3 6.8 0.2 0.3 7 6.6 -25% vs 2004 6.7 +4% vs 2004 baseline 0.7 Production volume 26 Risks and Opportunities in Our Business Risk Opportunity Regulatory   We are not currently exposed because our  operations are not considered to be major  sources of emissions.    Future regulation may affect packaging, product  delivery and distribution.   Our investments in on-site CHP units and energy  efficiency may yield increased returns as energy  prices rise.   Our new cold drink equipment prepares us for  possible limitations on equipment or coolants. Physical   Production capabilities, supply chain, consumer  demand could be affected.   Water scarcity could limit availability for our  operations.   Water stewardship programmes protect our  physical and social licence to operate Economic   Price and availability of key crops (e.g. sugar  beet) could be affected   Poor/inclement weather conditions could reduce  demand for our beverages   Our new cold drink equipment is a competitive  advantage with customers tackling their own  footprint.    Warmer weather could lead to greater demand  for our beverages. Other   Lack of leadership in combatting climate change  could harm our reputation.   Helping customers and consumers reduce their  own footprint and promoting our efforts could  deliver reputation benefits. Quad-Generation Power The cornerstone of our carbon reduction strategy is our  commitment to build multiple combined heat and power  (CHP) units across our business. Representing an invest- ment of 200 million, this is the largest energy-efficiency  initiative in the industry. On completion, this programme will cut direct CO2 emissions  by more than 250,000 tonnes annually. By installing a CHP  unit, each bottling plant improves its carbon emissions by  40%. By using pioneering quad-generation technology to re- cover food-grade CO2, plants can reduce emissions by up to  a further 40% (see Supplier Engagement). To date, CHP units are operational in Hungary, Romania,  Northern Ireland and Italy. A further five are near completion  in Nigeria, Poland and Ukraine which are expected to be- come operational in 2011. Given the scale of the programme  and the technology involved, legal hurdles and administra- tive delays have been considerable. Nevertheless, we re- main fully committed to this project. Improving Energy Efficiency We are systematically identifying and capturing opportuni- ties to save or reuse energy in our plants. Following detailed  audits of energy use, we completed 233 energy-saving proj- ects across 63 plants during 2010.  Energy and Climate Change to Our Business Our bottling plants are now 23% more energy-efficient due to energy- savings programmes. The total energy use in our bottling plants has stabilised in the past three  years, following a significant increase due to business acquisitions. When  correcting for acquisitions, the total 2010 energy use is only 4% above the  2004 baseline.  Direct CO2 Emissions (tonnes CO2) -20% vs 2004 baseline -2% vs PY 740 785 847 845 850 895 +7% vs 2004 baseline Production volume CO2 Emissions from Operations (Bottling and Distribution) Total: 849,719 tonnes Electricity 38% Natural gas & LPG 17 % Diesel 17% Heating fuels 10% Petrol 9% Carbonation 9% CO2 Emissions Ratio from Operations (g CO2 / lpb) 98.7 79.5 75.3 75.2 72.4 -3% vs 2010 -40% vs 2004 71.6 -27% vs 2004 27 Initiatives range from technologies, such as CO2 evaporation,  to ensuring that basics are in place, such as insulating pipes,  preventing leaks and reducing boiler temperature. Lighting  and heat recovery projects were a particular focus in 2010.  We have also launched a new energy-saving software to  help plants identify and prioritise further improvement op- portunities, calculating the potential investment, energy sav- ings and payback period for projects. Energy efficiency is incorporated into building design, too.  Our new automated warehouses in Ireland, Italy and Roma- nia are more efficient than traditional warehouses. These  high-bay vertical warehouses occupy less space, require  less light, heat and energy and reduce road transportation  between production and warehousing. Fleet and Transportation  Fleet sustainability initiatives yielded savings of 954 tonnes of  CO2 emissions in 2010 - more than 15,300 tonnes since the  programme began in 2007. Our progress was recognised with  an unprecedented three awards from Fleet Europe for fleet  safety, environmental performance and fleet management. We have set a maximum fuel consumption for each vehicle, de- ployed route management systems, trained drivers in Safe and  Eco-Driving techniques, and monitored performance monthly.  We undertake trials with alternative fuels and vehicles, but to  date, these have not provided a solution for our purposes and  we therefore focus on small, clean diesel cars. We aim to pur- chase the smallest possible engines and vehicles, and almost  all purchases in 2010 complied with this requirement. We work to reduce our overall transportation footprint, too. Air  freight is not used for raw materials or finished products and  we continue to explore switching from road to rail where fea- sible. Approximately 90% of raw materials are sourced locally1.  Green IT Since 2007, our Green IT strategy has worked to change both  infrastructure and mindsets and has avoided 10,368 tonnes  of CO2 emissions.  To reduce business travel, we promote audio, video and webex  conferencing. Air travel is discouraged and an internal carbon  tax on corporate flights is used to off-set resulting emissions.  Consequently, we avoided at least 600 tonnes of CO2 in 2010 2. Other initiatives include our state-of-the-art energy-efficient  data centre and server consolidation. As we retire IT equip- ment, our purchasing specifications require that we deploy the  most energy-efficient devices. These infrastructure projects  are now largely complete. The CO2 emissions ratio from our operations (bottling and transportation) is  now 27% below 2004 levels. Total direct carbon emissions (bottling and fleet) has decreased for the third  year in a row, following an increase due to business acquisitions. When  accounting for these acquisitions, 2010 CO2 emissions are above 7% higher  than 2004 levels. 1. Within our countries of operation or the European Union. 2. Our conservative estimates include only 20% of all conferences and are calculated on the basis of only two people per meeting.  28 Energy and Climate Change Switching Energy Sources  Diminishing reserves of fossil fuels mean that we must seek  renewable energy sources. To increase the proportion of re- newables in our energy mix, we introduced our first solar proj- ect in 2010. In Italy, five plants now have photovoltaic rooftop  panels with a total capacity of 5.2 megawatts. We plan to ex- tend this project to other Southern European countries in 2011. Our CHP units use natural gas which, although cleaner than  coal or oil, is still a fossil fuel. We have explored switching to  biogas, but have not yet found reliable sources of sufficient  quantity in our territories. Renewable energy accounted for 17.6% of electricity use or  6.3% of total energy consumed in 2010.  Reducing Indirect Emissions More than two-thirds of our wider carbon footprint stems  from the cold drink equipment and beverage packaging.  Consequently, this is where we concentrate efforts to reduce  indirect emissions. We also continue to enhance our under- standing of indirect emissions. In 2010, the emissions asso- ciated with sugar use and sweeteners were calculated to be  391,000 tonnes of CO2 or 8% of total emissions.  Cold Drink Equipment Our carbon reduction programme for coolers and other cold  drink equipment focuses on three areas: supporting the de- velopment of new coolers that do not use hydrofluorocar- bons (HFCs); improving the energy efficiency of new equip- ment; and improving energy efficiency of existing equipment.  These initiatives avoided 46,843 tonnes of CO2 in 2010 (see  Supplier Engagement). We now own the largest range of HFC-free coolers in the  marketplace are on track to meet our goal that by 2015 all  new equipment will be HFC-free. In addition, intelligent en- ergy management devices and other energy-savings mea- sures have made our new equipment up to 63% more ener- gy-efficient than 2004 models. During 2010, we purchased  23,400 of those new coolers, which will reduce CO2 emis- sions by an annual 27,000 tonnes. We have also started to retro-fit existing equipment with en- ergy management devices, improving its energy efficiency  by up to one third. In 2010, we installed 12,500 devices which  will cut CO2 emissions by 4,300 tonnes for each remaining  year of their 10-year life-span. Packaging Our comprehensive packaging and recycling strategy elimi- nated an estimated 16,900 tonnes of embedded carbon in 2010  (see Packaging and Recycling & Supplier Engagement). In 2011,  we will start assessing the carbon reduction programmes of  packaging suppliers as part of our new supplier scorecard. Promoting Climate Action  Climate action in developing and emerging markets is par- ticularly important. Given our geographic spread, we have  a particular responsibility to promote climate mitigation and  adaptation in our territories. We therefore champion rapid  and extensive action by governments, businesses and others. At international level, we were a founding signatory of Car- ing for Climate and participate in other industry platforms.  During the Cancun Climate Summit in 2010, we signed the  two resolutions on climate action by the Consumer Goods  Forum. These major initiatives pledge to mobilise our collec- tive resources to work towards ending deforestation and to  phase out use of refrigerant gases with high global warm- Her Majesty The Queen visited the new and highly energy-efficient bottling  plant at Knockmore Hill, Northern Ireland. The on-site CHP unit – the  fourth across our business – cuts plant CO2 emissions by up to 66% while  supplying excess electricity to the local grid. The plant won the Sustainable  Ireland 2010 Energy Efficiency Award.  We have produced communications materials to promote the low- carbon technologies that we have developed.  29 CO2 Emissions - Saving Programmes Programme Start of  programme (baseline) CO2 reduced in  2010 vs 2009 (tonnes) CO2 reduced in  2010 vs baseline (tonnes) Sum of CO2 reductions  cumulated each year since  start of programme (tonnes) Energy savings activities in plants 2004 15,168 332,034 1,478,275 Combined Heat and Power 2006 7,000 25,000 89,000 Packaging reduction 2004 16,918 115,461 541,422 Corporate flights offsetting 2006 2,105 2,105 10,242 Eco-Driving 2007 7,000 7,554 15,354 Greener coolers 2008 46,843 62,746 78,650 Green IT 2007 600 3,940 10,368 Total 89,587 548,839 2,223,311 ing potential. We showcased our HFC-free refrigeration to the  Consumer Goods Forum and at a leading European sustain- ability conference with business, government and academic  delegates from across Europe.  Low-Carbon Technologies We not only invest in low-carbon technologies but actively  promote these solutions, too. We mark the opening of each  CHP unit with a climate-themed event for local stakeholders,  demonstrating the technology and emphasising the need for  action.  At the commissioning of the Nogara unit in Italy in 2010,  more than 500 suppliers, customers, officials, NGOs and em- ployees took part in events that included a roundtable with  business leaders and environmental agencies. In Northern  Ireland, the inauguration of our Knockmore Hill CHP unit by  HM the Queen generated international media coverage of  our quad-generation technology. Shaping Behaviours  We involve consumers and communities in reducing the car- bon footprint of their beverage by encouraging them to re- cycle the container. By playing their part in closing the recy- cling loop, consumers can reduce the associated emissions  by up to 8%. We therefore support recycling awareness and  education campaigns, as well as anti-littering and clean-up  initiatives (see Packaging and Recycling).  Supporting Adaptation In addition to pursuing a vigorous climate mitigation strat- egy, we must prepare our business for the reality of climate  change. We must also help our communities do the same.  The availability and quality of fresh water will be the main way  in which climate change affects us all. Our comprehensive  water stewardship strategy is therefore the most important  way that we address these growing risks to our business, our  communities and ecosystems (see Water Stewardship). New Solar Programme Starts in Italy During 2010, we installed 150,000 m2 of solar panels  on the rooftops of five Italian plants, with a capacity  of 5.2 megawatts (or 5.88 million kilowatt hours). In  our Nogara plant, this initiative, our new CHP unit and  other energy-efficiency initiatives, have already cut the  plants CO2 emissions by 66%.

As a result,  packaging contributes to overall sustainability, preventing breakage  and spoilage. Nevertheless, the cans and bottles themselves account  for significant environmental impacts which we work to reduce at every  stage of their lifecycle, from manufacture to recycling and disposal.

Our ultimate goal is to close the recycling loop, converting  used packages into new. We have committed to invest in bottle- to-bottle recycling plants wherever environmentally and econom- ically sustainable. We have done so in Austria, where we co-own  a plant which recycles up to 570 million PET bottles each year. Reducing Packaging Source reduction is the most significant way to diminish the  impact of packaging. By reducing the material content of our  packages, we reduce carbon emissions in manufacturing, as  well as subsequent transportation and recycling.  Our goal is that by 2012 we will reduce packaging used per litre  of beverage by 25% compared to 2004. In 2010, this packaging  ratio was 7% higher than in 2004 and we used 771,000 tonnes of  material, up 6.5% over the previous year. Much of this increase  was due to replacement of wooden pallets used to transport  cases of beverage, which must be periodically replaced.  For more than a decade, we have focused on lightweighting  and all key packages now use considerably less material.   Lighter PET bottles: During 2010, we established new bench- marks for PET bottles. Our 500ml bottles for waters now  weigh only on average 18 grammes, 36% less than in 2005;  while our 500ml bottles for carbonated beverages are 26%  lighter (see below). As a result of these efforts, we avoided  the use of more than 4,500 tonnes of PET in 2010. Since 2004  our continuous lightweighting efforts have resulted in PET  bottles that are now on average 16% lighter.   Short-height plastic closures: We continue to roll out shorter  bottle closures across our business. Not only do these clo- sures use less material, but they also allow bottle necks to  be shorter and lighter, further reducing material use. By using  these closures, we avoided 527 tonnes of material in 2010.   Light-weight glass bottles: In 2010 we introduced 55 million  light-weight glass bottles using up to one third less material.   Cans and cartons: Although these represent only 16% of our  primary packaging mix, we continue to work with suppliers  on sustainability projects that include lightweighting.   Secondary packaging: We minimise our use of cardboard,  shrink film and other materials to deliver products to busi- ness customers. Such projects benefit customers, too, reduc- ing their packaging waste and labour costs. We have significantly reduced the material used to produce each of our main packages. The amount of packaging material used to manufacture our products, per litre of  produced beverage, has remained broadly stable. In 2010 it was 7% above 2004. 1. Lowest achieved: 12.2 grammes.  32 Packaging and Recycling As we seek opportunities to remove material from our pack- ages, we work within constraints. If a package is not strong  enough to withstand transportation and storage, this will lead to  product waste, which typically accounts for considerably higher  CO2 emissions than packaging alone. Consumer appeal is an- other important consideration since the look, feel and conve- nience of packaging plays a significant role in brand preference  and purchasing decisions. Recycled and Renewable Content Using recycled or renewable content is another way we lessen  the impact of our packaging. These materials replace non-re- newable materials, and their production uses much less energy  – 85% and 95% less for recycled PET and aluminium respec- tively. While we focus on increasing the recycled content of our  packages, The Coca-Cola Company has developed packaging  made with renewable raw materials, such as the PlantBottle. Recycled PET Aluminium cans and glass bottles contain up to 60% recycled  content. By contrast, the maximum recycled content in our PET  bottles was 30% in 2010. We increased the recycled PET we  used in 2010 to approximately 6,500 tonnes. Nevertheless, this  still represents a small proportion of total PET usage and we  aim to increase this. The greatest obstacle is lack of a stable  supply of recycled PET feedstock. Around half of PET bottles  are recycled, of which approximately two-thirds2 are diverted  into the PET fibres and sheet industry which does not demand  food-grade quality standards. We must therefore enhance the  efficiency of PET collection (see below) and increase our share  of the recycled material produced. In 2010, we supported the  introduction of another production line at the bottle-to-bottle  recycling plant we co-own in Austria. With access to more re- processed PET, we aim to produce bottles with higher recycled  content. PlantBottle In 2011, Coca-Cola Hellenic will launch PlantBottle, the  award-winning PET bottle developed by The Coca-Cola  Company. Up to 30% of the PET in this package is de- rived from renewable plant-based material. The bottle  has a lower carbon footprint than traditional PET yet  maintains the same performance standards and is fully recycla- ble. Coca-Cola Hellenic will trial PlantBottle in Switzerland. Promoting Recycling  For our packages to be recycled or recovered, we work with in- dustry and government to achieve two important pre-conditions.  Firstly, we set up schemes to collect, recycle or recover pack- aging. Secondly, we encourage consumers to play their part in  closing the recycling loop; otherwise empty cans and packages  end up as landfill or litter, not valuable feedstock for recycling. Recovery Organisations In 19 countries, Coca-Cola Hellenic has led the establishment of  organisations to collect, recycle and recover packaging. In turn,  these bodies work with 29,000 municipalities to provide 135 mil- lion people with access to collection systems. In 2010, 64% of  our packaging was recycled or recovered in these countries.  The challenge is to bring all territories up to speed, as there are  still countries where collection and recycling are limited or non- existent. We promote producer responsibility schemes since  they facilitate both environmental and economic progress. During 2010, two new recovery organisations came into being.  In the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Pako- mak was officially approved, starting operations in 2011. In Ser- bia, Sekopak completed its first year of operations. Residential  collection systems have been set up in 21 municipalities and  campaigns to teach residents how to separate waste. First-year  results exceeded targets with almost nine tonnes of packaging  recovered. Since some municipalities previously had no resi- dential waste collection, this result is particularly encouraging. Other progress during 2010 included:   In Romania, we extended collection systems to include rural  households. Again, this marked the first collection of waste  of any kind. In 2010, 38,000 tonnes of PET were collected for  recycling. At the Pet-to-Pet Recycling plant in Muellendorf, Austria, a new processing  line has been installed. The state-of-the-art recycling plant has been  producing PET flakes from recycled PET bottles for many years and now  using the latest technologies to turn used PET bottles into granulate. 2.

By bringing together government agen- cies, authorities, suppliers, manufacturers and recyclers, we  developed comprehensive proposals for PET collection and  recycling for submission to the Russian Parliament.   In Hungary, we held a multi-stakeholder forum on PET pack- aging waste. This led to new projects, including a lifecycle  analysis with the Ministry of Environment, on-pack labelling  of recycled content and other consumer messaging. Where recovery systems are in place, we remain actively in- volved and retain an ownership stake in 18 organisations. Dur- ing 2010, we began a new initiative to review and improve their  performance. We paid almost 42 million in recovery fees in  2010. We continue to work with government and industry to pro- mote market mechanisms, technological and sorting innova- tions and creation of equitable closed loop packaging solu- tions. At an international level, we support efforts by industry  associations to work towards a global standard of producer  responsibility. Mobilising Consumers Since consumer participation is vital to the success of recycling  initiatives, we support education and awareness campaigns.  We also mobilise communities to support clean-up operations  and anti-littering campaigns. To stem the growing problem of plastic pollution in the Up- per Tisza river basin, we support new projects in Romania and  Ukraine. Lack of waste collection led residents to dump rubbish  in rivers, floodplains or landfills. In addition to pioneering rural  collection, we conducted education and awareness campaigns  and clean-up operations. Even where recycling infrastructure is established, consumers  often lack access when away from home. We therefore include  collection schemes at all events that we support, from sports  tournaments and music festivals to product sampling. In 2010,  we collected 141 tonnes of packaging at events. In-Plant Recycling Our goal is that all plants will recover or recycle at least 90%  of production waste by 2015. We are on track to achieve this  with 39 plants recycling 90% of waste and a further 14 plants  achieving rates of 80%. As a result, we diverted 103,000  tonnes of waste from landfill, an absolute reduction of 58%  since 2004. Tackling plastic waste pollution in Ukraine In the rural community of Drotyntsi, plastic waste had blocked a cross-section of the river and led to flooding. Our Green  Danube partnership worked with local authorities to address the source of the problem by installing residential waste  collection and setting up a collection centre where plastic waste is compressed and baled, ready for recycling. In addition  to tackling a local environmental issue, the project has also created jobs in the collection system. A local awareness  campaign is now underway. We also organised clean-up activities along the river.

This results from reducing total  waste and increasing recycling rates. Total waste from bottling plants that is sent to landfill is now 58% below 2004.   Front-of-pack calorie information on all sparkling beverages labels in EU 26% of sales volume is low-calorie 1.2 million people actively took part  in our fitness programmes in 2010 Our business success depends on meeting changing consumer  demands. As a result, we now offer more lower-calorie options,  natural ingredients and added health or wellness benefits. Consumers  also want more nutritional information about their food and drink. As  the recession continues, affordability is particularly important.

Already a major public  health issue in developed countries, overweight and obesity  are on the rise in developing and emerging countries, too.  By 2015, the World Health Organisation predicts that there  will be 2.3 billion adults overweight - more than 700 million  of them obese.  Our Approach We respond to the changing needs of our consumers in the  following ways:   Expanding our product range - especially reduced-calorie,  nutritionally enhanced or all-natural beverages  Providing highly visible nutritional information on labels   Ensuring that our sales and marketing is conducted re- sponsibly   Working with others to promote physical activity and  healthy lifestyles    Reformulating products The complexity of the obesity challenge requires the in- volvement of all stakeholders, from governments, NGOs and  business to schools, families and individuals. Our challenge  is to enable consumers to enjoy our beverages while help- ing them maintain a healthy weight and lead an active life- style. Children are a particular concern.  We work closely with The Coca-Cola Company which owns  many of the brands we produce. The Coca-Cola Beverage  Institute for Health and Wellness helps our business system  by assessing wellness trends and advancing development of  new beverages. A Wider Choice of Beverages Our growing range of beverages includes waters, juices and  juice drinks, iced teas, ready-to-drink coffees, sports and  energy drinks in addition to sparkling soft drinks. In addition, we are reducing the calorie content of many  beverages, using natural ingredients and adding health and  wellness benefits. We extend these benefits to lower-income  consumers, too, with juice drinks brands such as Dobry and  Su-Voce sold in Armenia, Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia  and Montenegro. Reduced Calorie Content Sugar gives the body energy in the form of calories – but if  more calories are consumed than expended through phys- ical activity, this can lead to weight gain. To help consumers  enjoy sparkling beverages while managing their weight,  we now offer low-calorie options, such as Coke Zero and  Coca-Cola light. Certain beverages have been reformulated to contain less  sugar. To allow consumer tastes to adjust, sugar content is  Low-calorie sparkling beverages, waters, juices, teas and other still  beverages now account for 42% of volume. Average calorie content has fallen 19% due to the growth of waters and  reduced-calorie beverages.

In 2010, we eliminated a further 3-4% of  sugar from Nestea beverages, depending on the flavour. To  date, Nestea, Fanta and Sprite have been reformulated to  contain up to 20% fewer calories. Low-calorie carbonated beverages and waters accounted  for 26% of our sales volume in 2010. The average calorie  content of our products by volume has decreased 19% since  2001. Smaller serving sizes also help consumers manage their  calorie intake. In some EU territories, our beverages are  available in smaller 200ml bottles and 250ml cans – in addi- tion to 250ml bottles and 330ml cans. Nutritionally Enhanced Beverages Our growing range of juices and juice drinks with added vi- tamins and minerals help consumers meet their nutrition  needs. In Nigeria, our 5Alive juice drink is now enhanced with Vi- tamins B1 and B2. In Russia, our Yasli-Sad juice is the  only juice for children with added calcium. In Poland, we  launched Cappy Multivitamin, as well as Amita Extra Vitamin  C in Greece. Other functional juices include benefits such as prebiotics,  fibre, omega-3, polyphenols and antioxidants.   Greece – Our Amita Ev Zyn range includes Omega-3 for  heart health; mastic for the immune system; fibre for the di- gestive system; and calcium and Vitamin D for bone strength.    Serbia – Expanding our neXt BodyTime functional juice  range, we launched Cardio, which is rich in natural poly- phenols to help the cardio-vascular system. Natural Ingredients All-natural Fanta was piloted in 2010 in response to consum- er desire to avoid additives. This reformulation contains no  artificial flavours, colourants or preservatives. Instead, the  flavours and colours are derived from fruits and vegetables. We also avoid the need for preservatives in our growing  range of juices by investing in aseptic technology. We now  have 58 aseptic production lines. Nutritional Information  In order to understand calorie intake, consumers need to  clearly see the energy contained in their food and drink. In the  first such global commitment in our industry, The Coca-Cola  Company pledged to place the calorie content on the front of  all packages worldwide by the end of 2011.  This builds on the front-of-pack labels in our European ter- ritories which show the Guideline Daily Amounts (GDAs) for  calories and other key nutrients. By the end of 2010, all spar- kling beverages and most other products carry front-of-pack  calorie information where practical in EU territories. These  allow consumers to easily identify the calories and other key  nutrients per serving, as well as how this fits into a balanced  Consumer Health We continue to launch new juices and juice drinks with health and wellness benefits. These range from added vitamins and minerals to antioxidants,  prebiotics and natural polyphenols. Juices, teas, waters and low-calorie beverages have become an increasingly  important part of our volume, growing more than five-fold since 2001.  37 diet. More detailed nutritional information can be found on  the reverse of packs. Our beverages do not contain salt1,  trans fats or saturated fats2. We continue to promote consumer understanding and use  of GDA labels. During 2010, we supported education and  awareness campaigns in countries as wide-ranging as Esto- nia, Poland, Bulgaria and Hungary. In non-EU countries, we are working towards our business  systems goal of placing calorie content on the front of all  packages. Consumers can find further information about  specific beverages, ingredients and nutritional content  through country websites and consumer response hotlines.  Responsible Sales and Marketing Children are a particular concern to us and our stakeholders.  To ensure that we market and sell our beverages in a respon- sible manner, Coca-Cola Hellenic helps to develop and imple- ment industry codes of practice. These include the EU Pledge  on advertising to children, as well as commitments made by  European beverages association UNESDA. This approach is  underpinned by Global Guidelines on Marketing to Children  of the International Council of Beverages Associations (ICBA). The underlying premise of these various codes remains the  same: we respect the authority of parents and caregivers  and do not target marketing at children under the age of 12.  Previously, this was defined as marketing communications in  which under-12s represented more than 50% of the audience.  In 2010, in consultation with UNESDA, we made this definition  more stringent, extending this prohibition to marketing com- munications where 30% or more of the audience are under 12. We have implemented these codes throughout our busi- ness. Independent audits verify industry compliance with  these codes.  During 2010, Accenture assessed compliance with the EU  Pledge in six markets including three in which we operate -  Greece, Hungary and Poland. Analysis of more than 580,000  TV spots found a compliance rate of 98.9%. Similar analysis  of online advertising across nearly 50 websites aimed at un- der-12s found just one case of non-compliance. Comparable  results were found by previous audits on behalf of UNESDA  and the ICBA. These commitments are periodically reviewed and updated.  During 2010, the UNESDA commitments were expanded to  include digital marketing communications since new tech- nologies now allow tangible and verifiable steps to ensure  compliance.  In 2010, our award-winning Wake Your Body programme in Hungary marked its fifth anniversary. More than 2.1 million people  have taken part in 500 sports and fitness events. 1. Except for sports drinks where salts help to replace those lost during strenuous exercise 2. Except when occurring naturally in beverages containing milk or milk products  38 UNESDA also adopted a Code for the Marketing and Label- ling of Energy Drinks in 2010. Since we recently introduced  such drinks, we are implementing these commitments  which include on-pack recommendations that they are con- sumed in moderation and are not suitable for children, preg- nant women and those sensitive to caffeine.  Promoting Active Lifestyles To prevent or reduce obesity, people must not only reduce  their calorie intake but also increase their levels of physi- cal activity. We therefore work with NGOs, authorities, sports  and nutrition bodies to help people become more active.  During 2010, more than 1.2 million people actively took part  in our sports and fitness programmes. Communities  Regardless of age or ability, we encourage people to try a  wide variety of sports and make exercise part of their lives. In  Hungary, our Move! Wake Your Body programme celebrated  its fifth anniversary in 2010. More than 2.1 million participants  have participated in 500 recreational fitness, sports and well- ness activities. To extend its reach, the programme is working  with strategic NGO and business partners, such as Tesco. For a third consecutive year, our Be Active programme on  the island of Ireland was awarded the prestigious Big Tick  Healthy Communities award from Business in the Commu- nity. Working with local sporting bodies and councils, the  programme had attracted 106,000 participants to Football  for You with the Irish Football Association, as well as to  many other sports.  Coca-Cola Hellenic has a longstanding commitment to foot- ball. The tournaments we support are often the largest youth  sporting competitions in the country. In Poland alone, 3,256  teams took part in the 2010 Coca-Cola Cup, including more  than 1,100 girls teams. We also support running – from  competitive marathons to community fun-runs.  A newer focus for Coca-Cola Hellenic is cycling with its  dual benefit of improving physical fitness while providing  a greener form of transport. During 2010, more than 9,000  people took part in our cycling activities in Romania, Croatia,  Hungary and Serbia. Schools  By working with government agencies, sports and nutri- tion experts, we support healthy lifestyle programmes in  schools. These programmes teach children the role that diet  and lifestyle play in health, aiming to instil positive habits at  a formative age. In Greece, we work with the Ministry of Health and Social  Welfare on the Moderation-Balance-Diversity programme  which integrates nutrition education and physical activity into  the school curriculum. By year-end 2010, the programme  had reached 61,500 students in 875 schools. For the third  consecutive year, the programme gained first prize at the  2010 Hellenic CSR Excellence Awards.  We also support broader industry initiatives. In Poland, the  Keep Fit partnership involved 780,000 pupils in 6,949 schools  during the 2009-2010 school year. Aimed at teenagers, the  programme emphasises personal choice and responsibility.  Surveys found that participants had more balanced diets than  Consumer Health During 2010, more than 9,000 people took part in our cycling activities in Romania, Croatia, Hungary and Serbia.  39 those who had not participated. Almost three million students  have taken part since the programme began in 2006. In Lithuania, we support a partnership between the food in- dustry, NGOs and the Ministries of Healthcare and of Educa- tion that is promoting the importance of balanced nutrition  and physical activity in schools. The project has involved  more than 11,000 children in 160 schools. In locations where children lack a safe, fun place to be ac- tive, we provide infrastructure. To date, we have provided  116 sports grounds and playgrounds in Russia, Ukraine, Be- larus and Bulgaria. Coca-Cola Hellenic encourages employees to participate in  these activities as well as organising wellness activities in  Company operations (see Employee Development).  Maintaining High Quality Standards The quality and safety of our beverages is fundamental to  maintaining consumer and customer trust. Of our 77 plants,  75 have been certified against the ISO 9001 quality manage- ment system standard. This represented 99.6% of produced  volume in 2010. An early adopter of the international food safety standard  ISO 22000, we are also implementing the Food Safety Sys- tem Certification standard FSSC 22000 following customer  requests for a system recognised by the Global Food Safety  Initiative. We have now achieved ISO 22000 certification at 60 plants  (78% of produced volume) and FSSC 22000 certification at 32  sites (42% of volume). We expect to complete certification of  all plants within 2012. Our ingredients and packaging come only from approved  suppliers and are tested in quality control laboratories. Fin- ished beverages are tested in our plants and in the market- place. If products do not meet our quality standards, they  may be removed although safe to consume. In 2010, we worked with government agencies to resolve  two instances of non-compliance due to isolated quality in- cidents. In Romania, a small piece of cardboard in a bottle  of mineral water led to withdrawal of that batch. In Belarus,  sales were suspended on a batch of juice after caramelisa- tion of natural sugars due to the summer heat caused the  juice to turn brown. In both cases, we worked closely with  the authorities and independent tests gave the beverages  the all-clear. No safety risks were involved in either incident. Consumer feedback also plays a key role in quality manage- ment. In 2010, we decreased complaints further, receiving  only 0.28 consumer complaints per million containers sold. Given continued concern among consumers in our territories,  we do not use ingredients that are genetically modified or de- rived from GMOs. Our position on nanotechnology is the same. Following our acquisition of Multon in Russia in 2005, the Schelkovo plant has  gained ISO 22000 certification and consumer complaints have fallen by 46%. Almost three million Polish teenage schoolchildren have taken part in  the Keep Fit programme since it began in 2006.

EMPLOYEE  DEVELOPMENT            Employee Engagement (% of engaged employees) 43% 56% 26% 65% 1 Coca-Cola Hellenic 2007 Coca-Cola Hellenic 2010 41 By developing a reputation as an employer of choice, Coca-Cola  Hellenic aims to attract, develop and retain the necessary tal- ent to succeed today and in the future. During 2010, we gained employer of choice awards in 16  countries. We were named Best Employer in Ukraine by  AON Hewitt and placed second for Best Employer in Central  and Eastern Europe 2009-10. Employee Engagement Throughout the recession, we have worked hard to keep  employees informed and motivated. Our 2010 engagement  survey provided valuable feedback on employee views of  Coca-Cola Hellenic as an employer and whether these had  changed since the 2007 survey. Approximately 87% of employees participated in the survey,  up from 78% . Even more encouragingly, our overall engage- ment score rose 13 points to 56%. This compares favourably  to the People Metrics database of approximately 50 organi- sations, in which the median score is 48%. To be considered engaged, employees must respond posi- tively in three key areas: Retention (how committed they are to  staying at Coca-Cola Hellenic); Effort (how motivated they are  to go the extra mile), and Advocacy (how likely they are to rec- ommend the Company as a great place to work). Our improved  score was largely driven by an increased rating for Retention,  although we also scored higher for Effort and Advocacy. Increased scores across all question categories showed that  employees feel more empowered and have a greater sense of  purpose. Critical questions relating to professional growth and  performance feedback improved significantly. In addition, 80%  of employees said that they really like working for Coca-Cola  Hellenic. There is, however, still work to do if we are to achieve the People  Metrics top performing norm of 65% engagement. Although trust  in senior management has improved, employees want their in- put to be more considered when major decisions are made.  Despite an eight-point improvement, work-life balance re- ceived one of the lowest scores. The roll-out of SAP has  added to the challenge because of additional training, busi- ness trips and stretching deadlines. To help employees  manage the transition, a tailored stress management pro- gramme was made available in the countries. We will con- tinue to listen and respond to changing employee expecta- tions to improve this measure.  Each business unit is now implementing action plans, with  employee focus groups providing ongoing feedback. The  next survey will be conducted in 2012. A Safe and Healthy Workplace  Our high-profile safety programme continues to yield results.  Serious accidents again declined, a 39% reduction since the  programme began in 2009. Operations in Latvia, Lithuania  and Estonia had no lost-time accidents during 2010, while 23  countries performed better than the industry average.  Championed by our Operating Committee (OpCo), our safety  programme aims to address systemic issues and build the  foundation for a world-class safety culture. Defining ac- countability and embedding safety into business processes  have been key to progress. Safety is now on the agenda of  every meeting of the Operating Committee; it is also built  into job descriptions and performance objectives, as well as  business planning and budget approvals.  Despite progress in 2010, we did not eliminate fatalities. Re- grettably, nine people lost their lives, six in road traffic ac- Our Workforce Coca-Cola Hellenic employed 43,189 people at the end of 2010. Almost 98% of our workforce is of local origin, with  more than 78% from emerging and developing economies. We are committed to developing local talent and almost  91% of our management are local nationals. Temporary labour only accounts for around 5% of positions. Our 2010 employee survey showed a 13-point increase in engagement  levels since 2007. This exceeds the median score of 50 organisations in  our survey providers database. 1. Based on PeopleMetrics client data from around 85,000 employees across a variety of industries and regions.  42 Employee Development cidents. Three incidents involved driver error, two unsafe  behavior and one in which our driver was hit by an oncoming  vehicle that had crashed through the median barrier. Two fa- talities were due to circumstances beyond our control includ- ing political violence and armed attack in Nigeria. The last fa- tality was as the result of the collapse of warehouse racking. No fatal accident or injury is acceptable to Coca-Cola Hellenic.  In-depth investigations are conducted; country General Man- agers present and discuss findings with OpCo; and lessons  learned are shared across our business. To learn why un- safe behaviours persist, we will audit compliance with our  Fleet Safety Policy. We are also trialling the active fleet safety  device Mobileye which alerts drivers to risky behaviours,  such as tailgating. Where vehicles are equipped with GPS  systems, we will monitor results centrally. In 2010, we enhanced the practical skills of frontline manag- ers and supervisors. We ran 33 two-day workshops helping  almost 750 participants develop action plans. These include  Toolbox Talks, short but regular team discussions about lo- cal safety issues, and Walk the Talk, whereby managers  observe safety practices in day-to-day activities and discuss  improvement opportunities. We will actively promote the  value of Near-Miss incident reporting.  In addition to internal communications and engagement, we  share our performance externally. Large notice boards out- side each plant now display site safety performance. We have made good progress in our OHSAS 18001 pro- gramme, with 65 plants (84%) now certified. By year-end 2012,  our goal is to certify all plants. Our progress received recogni- tion with the 2010 Fleet Safety Award from Fleet Europe. The  campaign Safety is My Responsibility too received the Serbi- an Association for Public Relations award for the second year. Health and Wellbeing We promote healthy, active lifestyles among our employees.  Preventative programmes include cholesterol and blood  pressure monitoring; flu vaccinations; diabetes and cancer  screening; and free on-site medical consultations. More than  20,000 employees in 22 countries have benefited from such  programmes. During 2010, we also staged health and wellness events in 17  countries, ranging from sports and fitness events, education  sessions, nutrition advice and lifestyle consultations. In Bul- garia, we launched a new programme to promote healthy and  active lifestyles with  tips, contests and personal consultations  with health and wellness experts. In Serbia, more than 1,200  employees and family members received advice from external  experts during an open day. In Austria, we have now set up  monthly Active Days, with 650 participants during 2010. In Swit- Fatalities  (Employees and Contractors) Incidence Rate Sickness Average Sickness Days (including to/from  work accidents) (excluding to/from  work accidents) (number of accidents  with >1 day absence  per 100 employees) (absence days) (per FTE) 2004 14 7 3.6 215,786 5.86 2005 18 9 2.9 220,608 5.75 2006 23 17 3.5 196,221 4.85 2007 15 13 2.4 231,210 5.34 2008 28 25 3.8 282,309 5.75 2009 5 5 1.4 262,537 5.76 2010 9 9 1.1 233,898 5.36 Each plant communicates its safety performance with new notice  boards prominently displayed outside each site.  43 zerland, smoking cessation courses for employees and their  partners helped 44 people stop smoking, 57% of attendees. Other programmes respond to local risks. In Nigeria, we  support the Roll Back Malaria partnership, providing insec- ticide-treated nets to employees, their families and com- munities. As part of our HIV/AIDS programme, over 1,000  Nigerian employees have chosen to be tested, while infected  employees and their dependents can receive free anti-ret- roviral treatment. Education programmes continue in Rus- sia, Armenia, Estonia, Poland and Bosnia, where awareness  remains relatively low. People Development We are committed to helping employees realise their poten- tial through training and development opportunities. Another  critical challenge is to create a pipeline of talented future  leaders for our business. Leadership Pipeline Given the complex challenges facing businesses today, we  have defined seven core areas in which our leaders must  excel. These include not only Business & Financial Results,  but also Management, People Development, Leadership,  Relationships, Growth & Innovation and CSR.  For each of these areas, we have identified the skills, knowl- edge and experience required at every layer of leadership.  This matrix forms the basis of our recruitment; performance  management system; training and development; assessment  and rewards.  Annual People Development Forums in each country ensure  that we have the necessary talent to fill key capabilities and  projects, as well as succession plans to ensure business  continuity. From team leader upwards, all employees create their own  development plan. We are also rolling out a new career plan- ning framework which identifies the performance standards  and critical experiences required for career development. Career planning is not limited to management. The newly  launched Operators Development Programme defines a  clear career path in manufacturing roles. From entry level  operator to team leader, the programme provides recogni- tion and reward for developing new skills.  Training and Development Despite the recession, Coca-Cola Hellenic continues to in- crease training opportunities. Employees received on aver- age 21 hours of formal training in 2010, compared to 20 in  2009. This increase was made possible by in-house train- ing capabilities which deliver accredited programmes from  AGORA, our Learning Centre of Excellence. By year-end  2010, 72% of frontline managers had participated in our core  leadership training programme, Passion 2 Lead. The newly  launched Leadership Excellence programme reached al- most 35% of the target population.  We also continue to develop coaching skills within our  Company. By year-end 2010, 63 managers had been exter- nally certified as coaches. Almost 300 more managers have  participated in our programme on developing a coaching  leadership style.  Equality and Diversity To build a pipeline of future leaders, Coca-Cola Hellenic  must draw from the widest pool of talent available. A di- verse workforce also helps us to mirror the diversity of our  consumers and customers. More than 70 nationalities were  represented in our workforce in 2010. Six nationalities are  represented on our Board of Directors; OpCo members are  also drawn from six different countries.  We are committed to developing local leaders in every coun- try and 91% of senior leadership positions are occupied by  people of local origin. Since we also offer international de- velopment opportunities for high-potential employees, 53%  of our expatriate managers are from emerging and develop- ing economies. In 2010, 24% of managers were female. At all levels and in  all functions, we are working towards a better gender bal- ance. We undertook studies and focus groups during 2010  to explore why women are less well represented in our  business and how we should remedy this. In particular, we  tasked participants in our Excel leadership programme for  During our first Active Week, 300 Austrian employees tried a range of new  sports and learned simple exercises. Based on the success of Active Week,  we have set up monthly activities and 650 employees took part during 2010.  44 Employee Development high-performers to study female under-representation in  our Russian business and we await their recommendations.  Women are also under-represented in Commercial functions  in many countries. New recruitment strategies that target  women are being piloted. In Switzerland, we are trialling tes- timonials from female market developers; gender-balanced  interview panels; advertising in womens media and align- ment workshops with commercial managers. In Serbia, 26%  of new hires in 2010 were female, an increase from 6% in  2009. This was the result of workshops with the commercial  management team and a gender balance objective for the  recruitment manager. During 2011, learnings will be shared  across our business and targets set for female representa- tion. There were no women on our Board in 2011. Despite under-representation, female employees earn es- sentially the same salary (within 2%) as men at the same job  grade. At Coca-Cola Hellenic, merit is the sole criterion for  selection, promotion and remuneration. Gender and other  diversity indicators play no role. There were no breaches of our Equality Policy or related  legislation in 2010.  A Fair and Ethical Workplace Internationally recognised labour and human rights standards  underpin our commitment to providing a fair workplace. Our  Code of Business Conduct describes our zero-tolerance ap- proach to corruption (see Integrating Sustainability). Human Rights Our policy clearly prohibits child labour and recruitment proce- dures verify that prospective employees are of legal working age. There can be potential conflict in countries where human  rights are compromised. We keep abreast of issues, using  such resources as Amnesty International, and ensure that  education on human rights and equality are integrated into  management training programmes.  In addition to annual self-assessment, our operations are inde- pendently audited. To date, 27 (35%) plants have been subject  to independent workplace accountability audits. During 2010,  audits of two Nigerian plants found non-compliance issues re- lated to overtime, payment procedures, excess overtime and  health and safety issues. These findings are being addressed  through corrective actions and both plants will be re-audited. Various reporting mechanisms, such as a confidential tele- phone hotline and email address, allow employees to raise  concerns. All contacts are investigated at the appropriate  level, with results reported to the Audit Committee of the  Board. We are committed to protect from retaliation employ- ees who raise concerns in good faith. In 2010, there were no breaches of human rights policy or  related legislation. Employee Relations We respect the rights of employees to join or not to join  unions or works councils. Almost half (48%) of employees  are covered by collective bargaining agreements and 27%  belong to independent trade unions.  There are 49 independent trade unions in 15 of our countries of  operation, with works councils in a further seven countries. In  all cases, a formal communications protocol ensures regular  and open dialogue and consultation. During 2010, we agreed a  new protocol with the secretary of the European Works Coun- cil (EWC), increasing the frequency of meetings and available  external expert consultancy days. Both measures exceed the  requirements of the EWC directive and our agreement. In five countries, representing 7% of our workforce, there are  neither unions nor works councils: Moldova, Armenia, Be- larus, FYROM and Hungary. In these countries, we consult  and communicate directly with employees. Independent au- Workforce Breakdown Managers Non-Managers Total (2010) Total (2009) Total 3,145 40,044 43,189 44,800 Male 75.7% 75.0% 75.0% 79.2% Female 24.3% 25.0% 25.0% 20.8% Nationals 91.3% 98.3% 97.8% 98.5% Non-nationals 8.7% 1.7% 2.2% 1.5% Under 30 3.0% 35.0% 33.0% 33.8% 30-50 90.0% 57.0% 59.0% 58.0% Over 50 7.0% 8.0% 8.0% 8.2%  45 dits in such countries have not revealed issues of concern.  In all of these countries, except FYROM, employee engage- ment scores improved in 2010, with Armenian operations  gaining the second highest score after Greece. Furthermore,  Belarus, Moldova and Hungary were among the countries in  which we gained employer of choice awards in 2010. Responsible Restructuring Throughout the recession, we minimised job losses by mak- ing other cost reductions associated with human resources.  Management salaries were frozen, company cars were not  renewed and non-essential travel and events were can- celled. We also instituted a freeze on new positions and fur- ther reduced temporary labour.  Despite this, 1,306 people were made redundant across 16  countries in 2010. In such cases, we aim to treat affected  employees fairly and with respect. We consult with unions,  works councils and, where appropriate, the Select Commit- tee of the EWC. We also help employees with CV prepara- tion, training and outplacement advice. Comprehensive  severance packages meet and, in the majority of cases, sub- stantially exceed statutory requirements.  In 2010, we closed our plant in Estonia, a country with some  of the highest unemployment levels in Europe. By provid- ing outplacement support, approaching local employers and  circulating CVs, we secured alternative employment for 40%  of affected employees.  Aside from some sporadic and short-lived industrial action  in Italy and Greece, restructuring in 2010 took place without  incident. Working time lost due to industrial disputes and  strikes was insignificant. Rewarding Performance Coca-Cola Hellenic aims to reward employees fairly and  competitively. We benchmark compensation packages  against leading companies. Even entry-level employees are  paid on average 50% more than the local minimum wage,  where one exists. Variable compensation rewards not only financial perfor- mance but all seven key results areas, including CSR, people  development and innovation. We are also committed to providing employees with pension  and retirement provisions that are sustainable, competitive  and appropriate for the long-term. In 2010, Coca-Cola Hellenic paid 1,163 million in salaries  and benefits. A breakdown of costs and pension plans can  be found in the Annual Report and Accounts. Building Trust and Two-Way Communication in Greece In Greece, employee engagement rose to 78% in 2010 – from 46% in 2007 – due to a three-year programme to build  trust, transparency and equality in the workplace. Developing effective two-way communication and involving  employees in decision-making have been particularly important. More than 20% of the workforce took part in focus  groups to determine action plans in response to previous survey findings. Over the following two years, 890 interviews  with individual employees helped to refine programmes underway. In addition, employees can put forward ideas to  drive innovation. Each year, the top 10 ideas receive awards, with the best adopted by the business. In 2010, the Greek  operation was voted the winner of the Best Place to Work for the second consecutive year in the annual survey by the  Great Place to Work Institute Hellas, as well as the sixth best place to work in Europe. In Italy, our road safety awareness programme is the first to be endorsed  by the State Traffic Police and Italian Association for Road Traffic Safety.  Police representatives conduct sessions for employees about driving  responsibly and feature in our Safe and Eco-Driving video which has been  distributed to all employees in Italy.

Agriculture represents the largest  part of our total water footprint; whereas cold drink equipment and  packaging together represent three-quarters of our total carbon  emissions. Furthermore, Coca-Cola Hellenic supports many times  more livelihoods in its supply chain than within its own operations. SUPPLIER  ENGAGEMENT            Cold drink equipment 41% Raw materials 37% Bottling plants 13% Distribution 7% Post-consumer waste 2% 47 Environmental Impacts in Our Value Chain Our bottling plants account for only 13% of our total  environmental impacts. By contrast, packaging,  agricultural crops and cold drink equipment represent  more than three-quarters. Coca-Cola Hellenic  calculates its broader ecological footprint using the  eco-indicator 99 method. The way that we manage and develop our supply chain  has potentially far more impact than sustainability pro- grammes in our own business.  With a total supplier spend of 4,029 million in 2010,  Coca-Cola Hellenic has significant influence with its sup- pliers. Since the Coca-Cola global business system is one of  the worlds top purchasers of sugar, citrus, tea and coffee,  we have an even greater responsibility to address the social,  environmental and social challenges in our supply chain. The sustainability of our supply chain is also critical to the  future growth of our business. This is particularly true of  agricultural raw materials; ensuring the security of sugar  and fruit juice supplies are now core business issues. Our Approach Addressing the environmental, social and economic chal- lenges posed by our vast supply chain is an enormous  task. We therefore take a phased approach, tackling the  most significant impacts and risks first. Our primary ef- forts are focused on:   Working with NGOs and suppliers to enhance under- standing of indirect impacts   Reducing water use in our agricultural supply chain   Developing low-carbon technologies with equipment  suppliers   Reducing impacts in our packaging supply chain and  closing the recycling loop Sustainability criteria have already been incorporated into  purchasing specifications - from coolers and packaging  to vehicles and IT equipment. Now we are expanding this  to evaluate suppliers themselves on their overall sustain- ability strategy. In 2011, we will pilot a new scorecard in  which sustainability criteria will account for up to 30% of a  suppliers total score.  Our Supply Chain Footprint Coca-Cola Hellenic sources ingredients, packaging and capital equipment from approximately 84,000 suppliers. Our  main suppliers are sugar refiners and manufacturers of PET preforms, glass bottles, cans and coolers. By working with suppliers, we can include recycled content into our  PET bottles as well as reducing their weight by an average of 16%.  48 Supplier Engagement In addition to addressing environmental issues, we aim  to improve economic and social conditions in our supply  chain – for the suppliers who work with us, their employ- ees and local communities. We do so by:   Making clear the workplace practices we require of  suppliers and assessing their compliance   Sourcing locally to benefit both our communities and  our business Agriculture and Water Use The main agricultural raw materials sourced by Coca-Cola  Hellenic include sugar and, to a lesser extent, fruit juice.  Although we do not source directly from farmers but from  sugar refiners and juice suppliers, we have a clear re- sponsibility to help manage the manifold sustainability is- sues in this sector.  Our first priority is to work with our agricultural supply  chain to conserve water availability and quality. Agricul- ture is the single biggest user of water worldwide, with  almost 70% of the worlds surface water supplies used for  farming. In our business, agriculture accounts for 78% of  our water footprint. Ensuring the security of supply is another priority for our  business. With the worlds population expected to reach  nine billion by 2050, production of food must double in the  next 40 years. Other sustainability challenges in our agricultural supply  chain include protecting soil fertility and biodiversity and  supporting the livelihoods of farmers and farm workers.  The Coca-Cola Company engages on behalf of our busi- ness system to support the development of international  standards for sustainable agriculture, which we will sub- sequently adopt. The Coca-Cola Company is also develop- ing sustainable agriculture criteria as part of the systems  long-term ingredient sourcing plans. Reducing Water in Sugar Production Of the sugar used by Coca-Cola Hellenic, 53% is local beet  sugar, 33% is imported cane sugar and the remainder is  high fructose syrup. As EU sugar reform continues to lead  to more efficient and sustainable sugar production, we  Internal communication promotes the benefits of HFC-free reduced energy  equipment. By working together with key suppliers, we have developed coolers that use natural refrigerant gases instead of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which have an  extremely high global warming potential.  49 work with local suppliers to increase the proportion of  local beet sugar we use and to reduce its environmental  impacts. At a global level, The Coca-Cola Company works  on behalf of our business system to address sustainability  in cane sugar production. In Europe, we are founding members of the European Wa- ter Footprint Sustainability Assessment Sounding Board for  Sugar. Set up in 2010, this new body has brought together  our business system with leading European sugar compa- nies, academia, NGOs, and the Water Footprint Network for  the first time to collaboratively work on understanding the  impacts of water use. The Board has already analysed the  water footprint of the sugar produced in several European  countries. We have also begun collaboration to evaluate  the sustainability of this water use in its local context. Developing Low-Carbon Technologies The greatest part of our carbon footprint lies in our value  chain – mainly in the use of coolers and the manufacture  of packaging. We therefore challenge these suppliers to  develop new technologies that are increasingly efficient  in terms of energy and resources. By supporting our sup- pliers, we help to make these technologies a commercial  reality.  Climate-Friendly Refrigeration By partnering with suppliers in recent years, Coca-Cola  Hellenic has helped bring about a step-change in cold  drink equipment. This includes developing a complete  range of coolers that are free of hydrofluorocarbons  (HFCs) and use natural refrigerant gases, which have a  significantly lower global warming potential. We believe  that we own the largest fleet of HFC-free equipment in the  marketplace and we are on track to meet our goal that by  2015 all new equipment will be HFC-free. Equally and importantly, this new equipment is now more  energy-efficient, has better insulation and uses LED light- ing. We also worked with suppliers to develop an energy  management device, the Eco Box, which improves the en- ergy-efficiency of coolers by around one-third. As a result  of all these developments, new coolers are now up to 63%  more energy-efficient than in 2004. Quad-Generation CHP Technology Working with ContourGlobal, we have pioneered quad- generation technology in our programme to build Com- bined Heat and Power (CHP) units across our business.  Not only do these on-site CHP units provide our bottling  plants with power, heating and cooling, but we also purify  CO2 emissions to the highest food-grade so that they can  be used in carbonation. By using this quad-generation  technology, our CHP units are more than 60% less CO2 in- tensive than traditional power plants. The CHP units produce excess electricity which is pro- vided to the national grid in each country. In addition, CHP  units in Romania, Ireland and Italy also produce surplus  CO2. In Ireland, we now supply our former supplier –  meeting the needs of their Irish customers. Packaging – Closing the Recycling Loop Packaging accounts for 40% of our carbon footprint and  we work with suppliers to lessen these impacts. We re- duce material used in packages, increase the proportion  of recycled and renewable content and help to increase  recycling rates in the marketplace. Since closing the re- cycling loop is our end-goal, we also work to increase the  recyclate available to our packaging suppliers (see Pack- aging and Recycling). Upholding Workplace Rights Coca-Cola Hellenic requires suppliers to comply with  its Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs). These principles  make clear our systems basic requirements with re- gard to human rights, labour rights and ethical business  in supplier workplaces. In particular, the SGPs explicitly  prohibit child labour and forced labour. By recovering heat energy, CHP units provide power, heating and  cooling. Innovative quad-generation technology also allows recovery of  CO2 for commercial use. As a result, the CHP units are more than 60%  less CO2 intensive than traditional power plants.  50 We assess how our suppliers meet these expectations,  commissioning independent audits as part of a joint pro- gramme with The Coca-Cola Company. In 2010, a further  61 sites in our territories were assessed. Since the pro- gramme began in 2007, 121 sites have been audited, in- cluding major suppliers of sugar, primary packaging and  equipment. Other suppliers have been screened by dif- ferent programmes. Higher-risk items (such as promo- tional and marketing materials) and higher risk markets  (such as China or India) have been subject to a separate  audit programme by The Coca-Cola Company. In addition,  our business system has begun to accept audits con- ducted on behalf of other AIM-PROGRESS members (see  below). Thirty-five of the 61 sites assessed in 2010 were fully  compliant; there were minor non-compliance issues at 13  sites and moderate issues at a further 13 sites. Findings  mostly involved relatively minor health and safety issues,  such as first aid kits. There were also four instances of  excess overtime and working hours. We will work with  these sites on corrective action and follow-up audits will  take place for the higher-risk sites. In 2010, re-audits took  place at two sites – a sugar supplier and a manufacturer  of plastic closures. Following corrective action, both sites  achieved full compliance. No critical non-compliance is- sues were found in supplier audits during 2010. An Industry Platform  Since the underlying goal of our SGP programme is to  achieve meaningful progress in overall supply chain per- formance, we believe that industry-wide standards are  the most effective way to do so.  On behalf of our system, The Coca-Cola Company actively  supports AIM-PROGRESS, an industry forum to promote  responsible and sustainable sourcing. As a first step to- wards industry standards, member companies agreed  to accept supplier assessments undertaken on behalf of  other members. As part of this process, the Coca-Cola  business system accepted 175 audits of suppliers under- taken on behalf of AIM-PROGRESS members during 2010. Bringing Economic Benefit Coca-Cola Hellenic aims to source as close to the Companys  bottling plants as possible. This is not only most cost-ef- ficient for our business, but also brings economic benefit  to local communities and reduces the environmental im- pacts of transportation. As a result, almost 90% of supplier  payments remain within our territories.  Throughout the recession, we have supported suppliers.  We actively develop new suppliers, and support invest- ment in our territories by international suppliers. In 2010, our operations in Bosnia signed a supplier agree- ment with the new STUDEN-AGRANA sugar refinery, the  first in the country. Technical support from The Coca-Cola  Company and STUDEN-AGRANA helped the supplier  reach our systems quality standards. As the countrys  largest industrial user of sugar, we purchased 3,000  tonnes of sugar from the refinery during its first year and  have agreed terms for future purchases. The new refinery  employs 150 people and represents an investment of ap- proximately 45 million, one of the largest food industry  projects in Bosnia in recent years. In 2010, our packaging supplier Crown opened the first  beverage can manufacturing plant in Slovakia. With a sec- ond line installed in 2011, the plant will have an annual  capacity of 1.6 billion beverage cans. We have signed a  long-term contract with the new plant and expect to pur- chase at least 50% of their total capacity. In Russia, we continue to work with the growing sugar indus- try to maximise our use of local beet sugar (see opposite). More than half of the sugar we use is from local beet and we work  with suppliers to increase this while reducing its environmental  impacts. Supplier Engagement  51 Supporting the Russian Beet Sugar Industry We are working with the Russian beet sugar industry  to replace as much imported cane sugar with local  beet sugar as possible. Local production has grown  in recent years, but still accounts for only about half  of the countrys annual demand. As a result, Russia is  the largest sugar importer in the world. In early 2011 we signed an agreement to progressively  increase the proportion of local beet sugar. Whether  our suppliers are able to provide the quantities we  intend to purchase remains to be seen, especially after  a drought led to a drop in beet production in 2010. Our Bosnian operations have signed a supplier agreement with the new STUDEN-AGRANA sugar refinery, the  first in the country. COCA-COLA HELLENIC SUPPLIER GUIDING PRINCIPLES www.coca-colahellenic.com/sustainability/ourapproach/sustainabilitypolicy/ TCCCS SUPPLIER GUIDING PRINCIPLES www.thecoca-colacompany.com/citizenship/supplier_guiding_principles.html  More than 1.2 million participants  in our sports and fitness activities Invested 9.5 million in community projects or 1.4% pre-tax profit 6,000 employee volunteers  supported Company projects Improving the quality of life in our communities is enshrined in our  corporate mission. Since Coca-Cola Hellenic is dependent on the  development and sustainability of our communities, we thereby  ensure the future of our own business, too. COMMUNITY  INVOLVEMENT            Focus of Community Investment Environment and water 31% Sports and physical activity 24% Youth development 13% Disaster relief 1% Other 31% Type of Contribution Community investment 81% Commercial initiatives 12% Charitable gifts 7% 53 Since Coca-Cola Hellenic operates in many developing and  emerging markets, we have a particular opportunity – and re- sponsibility - to contribute to their sustainable development. Our Approach Coca-Cola Hellenic aims to support local communities through  both core business activities and community investment pro- grammes. We bring benefit by:   Leveraging core business activities that generate local eco- nomic benefit   Developing community programmes that tackle locally rel- evant issues   Working in long-term partnerships that deliver measurable  results   Encouraging the participation of employees, communities  and others Creating Economic Benefit Our business model delivers local economic benefit. Across  28 countries, our operations employ 43,189 people. In addition  to manufacturing locally, approximately 90% of our supplier  spend is local, too. During 2010, we supported the establish- ment of the first sugar refinery in Bosnia and a can manufac- turer in Slovakia (see Supplier Engagement). In addition to the significant taxation payments we make,  our business promotes the transfer of technology, skills and  knowledge which are especially important in developing and  emerging markets. Supporting Our Value Chain Coca-Cola business indirectly supports employment for up to  10 times1 that number in our value chain. In a number of coun- tries, we have launched projects that further boost this indirect  economic benefit while delivering innovative solutions for our  business. In Nigeria, we have set up 381 small businesses to distribute  products in communities less easily reached by traditional dis- tribution. More than 85% of these business owners are women.  In just two years, this innovative route to market has led to a  300% increase in daily sales in this channel.  We also provide support to independent stores and kiosks  since they typically lack the business and marketing expertise  of international chains. In Poland, 2,228 stores and outlets have  participated in our business skills development programme. In  the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the Model Store Programme  has helped 1,023 customers remodel their premises and be- come more profitable. Community Investment Programmes In every country of operation, we invest in community projects.  Although each programme responds to local needs, there are  four priority areas of focus:  Water and environmental protection  Sports and physical activity  Youth development  Emergency relief The bulk (69%) of our investment is channelled into these four  areas, but our operations also support programmes that ad- dress important local needs.  1. According to previous economic impact studies.  54 Community Involvement Working in Partnership  For our community investment to be most effective, we work  in public-private partnerships with leading NGOs, government  agencies and others. Our focus is on creating long-term re- lationships and programmes that deliver measurable benefit.  Since 2005, our partnership with the International Commis- sion for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) has led  to significant projects to restore the River Danube, as well as  awareness-raising and education initiatives that have reached  millions of people (see Water Stewardship). We are stepping up our collaboration with the International  Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC),  the worlds largest humanitarian organisation. During 2010,  we collaborated on projects in nine countries. In addition to  disaster relief in Eastern Europe, we launched a new joint  programme in Greece (see opposite) to provide preventative  healthcare and health education to remote communities. We  also signed a three-year partnership with the Austrian Red  Cross and are a long-time supporter of the campaign to rid  Bosnia of landmines by 2019. These efforts are supported by a new global partnership be- tween The Coca-Cola Company and the IFRC to enhance col- laboration on disaster preparedness and response around  the world. The partnership aims to use the capabilities and  expertise of bottlers, such as Coca-Cola Hellenic, to maximise  the speed and effectiveness of disaster response while rais- ing awareness of disaster prevention and preparedness and  activities of the Red Cross Red Crescent. Maintaining Support  During 2010, we contributed more than 9.5  million to our community programmes. This  investment is calculated using the widely  recognised London Benchmarking Group  (LBG) model. Although less than the previous year, investment  represented 1.4% of pre-tax profits in 2010 and is in line with  other leading LBG members. In addition to financial support, we contribute other resources.  Using our marketing skills, we raise awareness of issues and  encourage involvement. Promoting employee volunteerism is another way that we en- gage and support our communities. We have set up volunteer- ing schemes in 22 countries and more than 6,000 employees  took part in 2010. Activities ranged from regular engagement  with childrens homes to environmental clean-ups and emer- gency relief.  Water and the Environment  Coca-Cola Hellenic supports community water projects in 26  countries. These range from conserving watersheds and im- proving access to water and sanitation to awareness raising  and education (see Water Stewardship). Youth Development From encouraging the development of future leaders to sup- porting at-risk young people, we help young people achieve  their potential and contribute to society. In Nigeria, we support local government initiatives to strength- en the educational infrastructure. In 2010, we helped renovate  two schools close to our plants in Lagos and aim to extend this  activity in other areas. We help refurbish schools in five other  countries, too. By partnering with leading youth organisations, we foster lead- ership, entrepreneurship and advocacy. We work with Junior  Achievement, SIFE and AIESEC in 13 countries. In Serbia, we  received special recognition from AIESEC in 2010 for our con- tribution to their platform Responsible young people - a sus- tainable future. At-risk young people are another focus. Given the high num- ber of children in care in our territories, we support childrens  homes in 17 countries. In the Czech Republic alone, we support  10 care homes. We also support the growth of SOS Childrens  Programmes National Partners Watershed  protection WWF, ICPDR, UNESCO, UNDP, local  NGOs, environment ministries Youth  development AIESEC, Junior Achievement, SOS  Kinderdorf, local NGOs Sports and  fitness Sports associations, education  ministries Disaster relief Red Cross, emergency services Our Nigerian operations have renovated two schools in Lagos and plan  to help schools in other areas, too. They were awarded the Lagos State  Government CSR award in 2010.  55 Villages, the worlds largest orphan and abandoned childrens  charity, which offers children a family-centred upbringing. In Russia, we have promoted awareness of adoption. In 2010,  we supported Gallery of Hearts, a photographic exhibition in six  cities which was visited by more than 700,000 people. This led  to increased interest in adoption in all cities visited. Almost 10%  of children whose portraits featured have since been adopted. We also offer careers guidance, supporting at-risk childrens  transition to independence. In Bulgaria, we extended our long- term involvement with children in a local care home to help high  school leavers with careers guidance. Similarly, in the Republic  of Ireland, we support the Schools Business Partnership, help- ing underprivileged students prepare for work. Our employees  give advice on job applications and hold mock interviews.  Sports and Physical Activity During 2010, more than 1.2 million people participated in our  sports and fitness programmes which encourage people of  all ages and abilities to become more active. From fun fam- ily events to competitive races and tournaments, we support  football, running, swimming, cycling or other sports.  In Hungary, our Wake Your Body programme celebrated its  fifth anniversary in 2010. Over five years, the programme has  involved 2.1 million people in 50 different sports. More than 500  fitness events have been held in 500 locations.  In Ireland, our Be Active programme was awarded the Busi- ness in the Community Big Tick award for healthy communities  for the third consecutive year. During 2010, 106,000 people took  part in our sports events across the country. We also support healthy lifestyle programmes in schools.  Working with government agencies and technical experts,  these projects promote physical activity and disseminate nu- trition education. In Greece, our Moderation-Balance-Diversity  programme provides 32 hours of interactive lessons during the  school year. In Poland, the pan-industry campaign Keep Fit has  reached almost three million students since it began in 2006.  Children also need a safe place to exercise and play. In Rus- sia, Ukraine, Belarus and Bulgaria, we have donated 116 play- grounds to local communities.  Emergency Relief As extreme weather events become more frequent due to cli- mate disruption, Coca-Cola Hellenic has committed to provide  swift emergency relief to local communities. We help to deliver  safe drinking water, one of the most critical needs, as well as  mobilising our delivery fleet and employee volunteers if needed. During 2010, seven of our central and eastern European ter- ritories experienced severe floods. In these countries, we  worked with local authorities, the Red Cross and others to de- liver more than 300,000 litres of safe drinking water. We also  provided emergency relief in Russia, after several hundred  wildfires brought death and destruction. This marked our first  collaboration with the Red Cross in Russia. Coca-Cola Hellenic supports longer-term rehabilitation efforts,  too. In Greece, our campaign Some Forests have their own  Aura is restoring forests following the devastating wildfires of  2007. Guided by a local NGO, we have adopted five forested ar- eas and planted 22,140 trees, pledging to maintain them over  three years. Working with the Ministry of Education, we devel- oped schools resources and seminars on preventing forest fires.  At the 2010 Global Bottled Water Congress, the programme was  named Best Environmental Sustainability Initiative. Healthcare for Remote Greek Communities In Greece, we stepped up our collaboration with the  Hellenic Red Cross in 2010, launching an eight-month  preventative healthcare programme with the Ministry  of Education and the Ministry of Health and Social  Welfare. I Care for My Health targeted communities  on the Dodecanese islands and the remote northern  mainland. Awareness of the importance of preventative  health is lower there, leading to higher mortality rates. A  team of Hellenic Red Cross paediatricians, dentists and  opthalmologists visited schools while a fully equipped  mobile health unit offered free medical examinations to local residents. More than 1,300 children and 700 adults were  examined while 800 parents and teachers attended seminars on healthy lifestyles and first aid. OUR COMMITMENT IN ACTION www.coca-colahellenic.com/sustainability/commitmentinaction/  56 Our Approach Coca-Cola Hellenic has participated in the Global  Compact since 2005. We meet our commitments by:  Integrating the principles into our business   Addressing the sustainability of our supply chain  Helping to develop local networks  Supporting the Compacts global platforms  Contributing to broader UN goals   Reporting transparently  Throughout this report, we demonstrate how we implement  the principles of the Global Compact (summarised opposite).  Below, we discuss how we promote the UN Global Compact  and broader UN goals. Promoting Local Networks As the Global Compact expands, its Local Networks play an  increasingly important role, rooting the initiative in different  national and cultural contexts.  Coca-Cola Hellenic is an active member of these networks in  14 countries1, having joined the Lithuanian network in 2010. In  each country, we help to advance the Global Compact and re- sponsible business practices through advocacy and outreach. Supporting Global Platforms As founding signatories of the CEO Water Mandate and Car- ing for Climate, we committed to address water conservation  and CO2 emissions in our operations and our supply chain.  These two leadership platforms also work collaboratively with  governments, NGOs and businesses to achieve broader un- derstanding and change. A self-assessment of our progress  against both initiatives can be found on our website. Supporting Broader UN Goals and Issues Coca-Cola Hellenic also partners directly with UN agencies  – including the UNDP, UNEP and UNESCO – to address sus- tainability challenges. These projects promote access to water  and watershed conservation; youth development and educa- tion; entrepreneurship and job creation; disaster relief and  rehabilitation. Directly or indirectly, such projects contribute to  the Millennium Development Goals. In Nigeria, for example, we are renovating primary schools; im- proving access to potable water and sanitation; and supporting ef- forts to tackle HIV/AIDS and malaria. We have also helped to set  up 381 entrepreneurs as small-scale distributors for our business. Reporting Transparently A longstanding Notable Reporter, we were further commended  in 2010 by a coalition of global investors for producing a high- quality sustainability report deemed useful for investors. The  group members, who manage more than US$2.1 trillion of as- sets, are all signatories to the Principles for Responsible In- vestment, which support the goals of the Global Compact.  We seek third-party feedback on how we can improve our sus- tainability reporting. Each year, the Fondation Guil assesses how  we implement our commitments to the UN Global Compact and  report our progress. Supporting the Top-Performing Local Networks At the 2010 Annual Local Network Forum in New York, the Serbian and Ukrainian networks were named among the  three best-performing in the world. Together with the Japanese network, they received awards for outstanding efforts  made to share knowledge and experiences in advancing the Global Compact locally. Coca-Cola Hellenic is proud  to have actively supported both networks since their early days. In Serbia, we lead both the Environmental Working  Group and the CSR Working Group, while serving on the Steering Committee and other working groups. Supporting the UN Global Compact As the worlds largest corporate citizenship and sustainability initiative, the UN Global Compact has unparallelled  importance. Now in its tenth year, the Compact now has more than 8,000 participants in 130 countries.

AWARDS www.coca-colahellenic.com/aboutus/awards/  64 Validation Statement Independent Assurance Report on the Report- ing for 2010  To the management and the stakeholders of Coca-Cola Hellenic  Bottling Company S.A. denkstatt GmbH has been commissioned by the Coca-Cola  Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. (thereafter, the Company) to  carry out an independent third party assurance engagement in ac- cordance with the AA1000 AS 2008 Assurance Standard (AA1000  AS (2008)) on the Companys 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility  (CSR) Report (thereafter, the Report) in its printed and download- able pdf formats. We have reviewed the Report of the Company  for the financial year 2010, which comprises the contents of the  Report as well as the data. The assurance engagement has cov- ered the nature and extent of the Companys incorporation of the  AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard (AA1000APS (2008))  principles (inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness) with respect  to stakeholder dialogue. Furthermore, the application level of the  Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G3 1.0) has been  checked.  Managements Responsibility  The Companys Management is responsible for preparing the  Report and related web-text, and the information and statements  within it. They are responsible for identification of stakeholders and  material issues, for defining commitments with respect to corpo- rate responsibility performance, and for establishing and maintain- ing appropriate performance management and internal control  systems from which reported information is derived. Furthermore,  establishing data collection and registration, internal control sys- tems to ensure reliable reporting, specifying acceptable reporting  criteria and choosing data to be collected for intended users of the  Report, as well as preparing the Report in accordance with the  Reporting Guidelines of GRI is the responsibility of the Companys  Management.  Assurance Providers Responsibility  On the basis of our work, our responsibility is:    To express a conclusion on as well as to make recommenda- tions for the nature and extent of the Companys adherence to  the AA1000APS (2008) principles.   To express a conclusion on the reliability of the information in  the Report, whether it is in accordance with the criteria of the  GRIGuidelines. Our team of experts is competent and experienced in assurance  engagements related to nonfinancial information. In addition, our  team is competent and experienced in assessing nonfinancial in- formation and sustainability management, thus qualified to con- duct this independent assurance engagement. During 2010 we  have not performed any tasks or services for the Company or  other clients which would lead to a conflict of interest, nor have  we been responsible for the preparation of any part of the Report.  Scope, Standards and Criteria Used  We have performed our work to obtain moderate assurance that  the information in the Report is free of material misstatements.  Furthermore, we planned and performed our work based on the  GRI G3 and in accordance with the AA1000 AS (2008). We used the  criteria in the AA1000APS to perform a Type 2 engagement and  to obtain a moderate level of assurance regarding the nature and  extent of the Companys adherence to the principles of inclusivity,  materiality and responsiveness.  Methodology, Approach, Limitation and Scope  of Work We planned and performed our work to obtain all the evidence,  information and explanations that we considered necessary in  relation to the above scope. Our work included the following pro- cedures using a range of evidence gathering activities which are  further explained below:    Inquiries and interviews with members of Executive Manage- ment, staff from the sustainability department, the reporting  department, as well as Management representing different  functions in the Group, regarding the Companys adherence  to the principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness.  This includes Managements commitment to the principles, the  existence of systems and procedures to support adherence to  the principles and the embedding of the principles at the cor- porate level.    Understanding of relevant documentation.    Site visits to 10 bottling plants, with a focus on developing and  emerging markets: Sarajevo (BosniaHerzegovina), Kostinbrod  (Bulgaria), Abuja, Apapa (both Nigeria), Staniatki (Poland), Ploi- esti (Romania), Moscow, Davydovskoye, Yekaterinburg (all three  Russia), and Kiev (Ukraine).   Inquiries and spot tests regarding evidence of implemented pro- cedures and processes, as well as the Companys policies (plant  and corporate level).   Requests and spot tests regarding selected evidence documen- tation, to assess the existing systems for data collection and  registration, and procedures to ensure reliable and consistent  reporting from the plants to the corporate level.   Checking the GRI index in the Report, to ensure consistency with  the GRI application level requirements of A+. The assurance scope covered the whole Report and focussed on  systems and activities of the Company during the reporting pe- riod, with the following exceptions:    The scope of work did not involve verification of financial data  (p. 2+3) and the sustainability milestones (p. 4+5).    The New Water Stewardship Policy is under development and  has not been considered during the validation.   65 Willibald Kaltenbrunner Lead Auditor, Managing Director denkstat Findings and Conclusions  Regarding inclusivity:   The Companys Management has a strong commitment to inclusiv- ity and stakeholder engagement. Also, the Company has effective  systems in place for stakeholders to participate in the development  of the organisations response to sustainable development issues,  particularly through the stakeholder panel at the corporate level.   However, processes at some bottling plants could be strength- ened to ensure the full range of stakeholders is identified and  appropriately engaged. The role and selection criteria for the  Companys departments at the national level could be clearer to  ensure balanced representation and focused feedback.  Regarding materiality:   The Company has a process in place to determine material is- sues at the management level. Also, the Company has in place a  number of relevant senior management level governance bodies  to discuss, evaluate and determine the materiality of sustainabil- ity issues on ongoing basis (CSR committee and CSR council).    However, the criteria for assessing materiality are more infor- mal, which could lead to inconsistent assessments across the  operating companies. Emerging issues could also be better ad- dressed within the materiality assessment.  Regarding responsiveness:   The Company is committed to being responsive to stakeholders  as is evident from the wide range of media, forums and com- munication channels used by the Company to communicate on  sustainability issues.    The Company was found to be responsive especially to exter- nal stakeholder concerns and expectations. This was achieved  through the Companys allocation of resources to stakeholder  engagement, the timeliness and accessibility of reported infor- mation, and the types of communication mechanisms regularly  used. The responsiveness to internal stakeholder concerns is  less structured and shows room for improvement.    The Companys group policies and guidance on management of  material issues are comprehensive; therefore most issues are  well managed across the business.  Regarding performance information:   The findings of the assurance engagement provide confidence  in the systems and processes used for managing and reporting  sustainability performance information. Data trails selected were  identifiable and traceable, and the personnel responsible were  able to reliably demonstrate the origin(s) and interpretation of data.    The majority of data and information presented were found to be  accurate. Some data inaccuracies identified were found to be at- tributable to interpretation and aggregation errors.    Data management within the group is on a high level of reli- ability. Furthermore, the Company shows perfect calculation of  indirect environmental impacts (such as CO2 emissions of cold  drink equipment) and community involvement projects (London  Benchmark Group).    The Company shows very good processes of sustainability man- agement with long term goals for water and energy. The Company  undertakes many efforts to work toward a low carbon industry  (climatefriendly refrigeration, QuadGeneration, CHP Technology).  Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes  us not to believe that the information presented in the Report of the  Company is free of material misstatements and has been stated in  accordance with the criteria mentioned. Furthermore, nothing has  come to our attention causing us to believe that the Company does  not adhere to the AA1000APS (2008) principles or with the GRI G3  guidelines application level requirements of A+. Recommendations  The following is an excerpt from the observations and opportu- nities reported back to the Management of the Company to en- courage continual improvement. However, these do not affect our  conclusions on the Report.  Regarding inclusivity:   We recommend the Company to develop a more structured  approach to stakeholder engagement at the local site level and  consider implementing a formalised materiality assessment  process that would assist in informing the content and prioritisa- tion of information reported.  Regarding materiality:   We recommend that the process and criteria applied to assess  materiality of nonfinancial issues is formalised and documented  to ensure a consistent process.  Regarding responsiveness:   We recommend improving the inclusion of internal stakeholder  concerns through the involvement of local unions and working  councils in the stakeholder panel and within CSR activities.    The amount of information on some relevant issues should be  increased, for example, the responsible sale and marketing  outside the European Union, as well as corruption prevention,  especially in emerging and developing markets.  Additional recommendations:   Implementation of long term goals for packaging, consumer  health, employee development, supplier engagement, and com- munity involvement.    Establishment of a formal process on the calculation of data to  ensure reliability throughout the Company, especially for waste  ratio and the waste recycling ratio, as well as for the data on  corporate volunteering. Vienna, 6 April, 2011 denkstatt GmbH  66 Stakeholder Review Statement Relevance of Reported Topics The Social Responsibility Report 2010 addresses all major  sustainability issues relevant to Coca-Cola Hellenic. We  welcome the introduction of a section on sustainable ag- riculture and water use in the chapter Supplier Engage- ment. The more detailed discussion on the challenges of  consumer health and obesity is positively noted. We also  found more information on compliance and diversity is- sues than in previous reports. We think, however, that the materiality analysis that de- fined the companys seven key focus areas should be  explained more clearly. How are priorities identified and  how do they drive the overall corporate agenda? Processes and Achievements The report describes all the principal processes by which  Coca-Cola Hellenics operations impact on its stakehold- ers and the environment. It adequately and quantitatively  assesses the magnitude of immediate impacts. The chap- ter on packaging reports according to all standard envi- ronmental parameters, including source reduction, recy- cling, recycled content and sustainable material sourcing.  Nevertheless, the importance of packaging optimisation  is not clearly communicated: using the right type and  amount of packaging to meet the needs of all stakehold- ers in the value chain, including consumers. In our view, water is the most difficult issue to analyse.  While Coca-Cola Hellenics reporting on water steward- ship is good, it would be interesting to learn in future re- ports about the companys role in defining standards for  corporate behaviour and performance related to water.  On social aspects, Coca-Cola Hellenic could adopt and  showcase a more pro-active attitude not only towards  current sustainability issues but also to major upcoming  trends, such as demographic changes. Such changes as  the ageing population impact the company not only inter- nally in terms of workforce, but also externally in terms  of consumers. Quality of Reporting The 2010 report is very clear and accessible to a wide  range of readers. It is well structured – each chapter con- tains challenges, key achievements and current efforts. In  addition, the UN Global Compact and GRI indices allow for  easy navigation. The use of plain language, clear charts  and graphs, a visually comfortable presentation style and  well-chosen illustrations and photography all combine to  deliver a comprehensive and positive report. More specif- ic case study boxes could illustrate and highlight achieve- ments or best practices. We particularly like the consistent presentation of targets  and progress, even though in some instances these could  be more concrete, such as supplier engagement. We ap- plaud the decision to reintroduce independent verifica- tion. With so much information in one report, this helps  to address the readers need for assurance that there is  transparency and clarity in reporting results. Since the  report contains mainly positive information, however, ad- dressing more challenges or non-achievements would  add to the credibility of the report. In future, sustainability reporting is likely to face the chal- lenge of meeting diverging information needs of inves- tors, consumers, academia and NGOs. We think that in its  current form, Coca-Cola Hellenics report will not meet  these expectations. For example, water experts may be  interested in a water balance map for each hydrological  Coca-Cola Hellenic invited a panel of external stakeholders to assess the content and quality of its  sustainability reporting for the first time. The statement below represents the panels assessment of  the companys 2010 Social Responsibility Report. We express our views as individuals, not on behalf of  our organisations.  67 system from which the company and its suppliers take  water, understanding how this is balanced against in- dustrial and domestic water use and how this affects the  vulnerability of individual catchments. We look forward  to discussing innovative ways to further evolve the com- panys reporting. Conclusion Coca-Cola Hellenics 2010 report includes the most mate- rial sustainability issues faced by the company. We believe  that the scope, depth, and achievement levels reported  are outstanding. Nevertheless, we encourage Coca-Cola  Hellenic to build on its strong reporting and to consider  these recommendations in preparing future reports. The aspiration for a sustainable global society depends  greatly on the responsibility and creativity of private in- dustry. If the potential of private industry is to be real- ized, powerful leadership will be required from major  companies. We urge the company to continue its efforts  in influencing, by example and persuasion, other major  companies and their supply chains to develop their strate- gies for sustainability. Participants and Process In November 2010, the Stakeholder Panel met to discuss Coca-Cola Hellenics sustainability programmes in  advance of the 2010 reports development. The panel then assessed the report in a two-stage process. Stage one  was an analysis of the initial draft, designed to identify errors or omissions and to suggest how the report could be  improved. Stage two was a formal assessment of the report that included a telephone conference in March 2011.  An honorarium was offered for our contribution to the review statement.
