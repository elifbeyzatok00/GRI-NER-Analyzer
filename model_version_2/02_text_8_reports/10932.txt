However, depending on the customer segment and region, there was considerable variation in the degree of market recovery.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 3  Despite the unstable market conditions, Cargotec was able to grow its operating profit and show its strength in several markets. The Marine business in particular showed very positive development, both in operating profit and sales. The Asian markets now represent a proportion of sales equal to that of Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Cargotec signed several new contracts covering equipment maintenance, modernisation and repair. For the benefit of its customers, Cargotec continued to invest in technology development. Development work was focused on more productive, safer and environmentally sound solutions. The capacity adjustment measures launched in 2008 and other restructuring measures were completed in early 2010. After this, the focus shifted to the impending market recovery and growth. This involved measures to strengthen personnel skills and competences as well as Cargotec's regional organisations. Service network expanded Cargotec continued to upgrade its service network by cross-training Hiab and Kalmar product specialists. The service network expanded as personnel learnt to service both product ranges. A new parts distribution centre was set up in Sweden to serve Scandinavian customers, while plans for worldwide spare parts logistics were relaunched. New units in Poland and Singapore Cargotec celebrated the opening of a new multi-assembly unit in Stargard Szczeciski in Poland. Part of Cargotec's global supply network, the new unit is located close to customers and the growing European markets. This unit handles the assembly of several different Cargotec cargo and load handling solutions. Cargotec also set up a new business location in Singapore, housing the company's local operations. Cargotec's supply units are located in China, Estonia, Finland, India, Ireland, Malaysia, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Part of manufacturing has been outsourced to partner plants, which are mainly located in Asia. Competence and technology centre in Tampere moving ahead Cargotec pursued its plans to convert the Tampere unit into a competence and technology centre, in order to improve the worldwide competitiveness of the company's products. New, state-of-the-art facilities are scheduled to be up and running in 2013, in the vicinity of Tampere University of Technology in the Hervanta district. Measures to develop corporate governance continued Cargotec took measures to develop its corporate governance and strengthened the role of the service business, by rearranging the company's business into three business areas: Industrial & Terminal, Marine and Services. One shared Cargotec Services organisation facilitates service development, both in the Industrial & Terminal and in the Marine businesses. Cargotec's financial reporting is based on two reporting segments, Industrial & Terminal and Marine. New visual look Cargotec launched a new visual look for the company in 2009. Harmonisation of the visual look was carried out step by step, picking up pace in 2010 with the renewal of service cars, workwear, signs and marketing materials. This work will continue in 2011. Strategy fuels growth Cargotec refined its strategy, announcing that it would target measures and resources at carefully selected focus areas, in order to strengthen its market leadership over the next few years. Cargotec aims to grow faster than the industry on average. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report.

Measures aimed at building a strong and unified organisation were finalised. Although the process was long and painful at times, it allowed us to build a strong foundation for Cargotec. As market conditions began to perk up, the new and improved Cargotec proved its ability to perform: our operating profit turned strongly positive, at EUR 131.4 (0.3) million. During the year, we also refined Cargotec's strategy. The key priority now is to pay more attention to customer needs. Several factors contributed to our strong performance. While the global economy was still struggling in 2009, we focused on driving our organisational overhaul forward and on adapting to shared processes across Cargotec. The completion of the "On the Move" internal change programme was highly conducive to creating a unified corporate culture. Operational development continues as a natural part of our daily work. Another key performance driver was the upswing in the global economy, signs of which could be seen at the beginning of 2010. Our Marine business that supplies solutions to shipowners, ship operators and shipyards, performed particularly well throughout the year. A significant proportion of sales were generated in the Asian markets. Similarly, the demand curve for Cargotec's load handling equipment used in inland logistics was positive. Meanwhile, the markets for port and terminal cargo handling solutions continued to show a degree of uncertainty. Comprehensivecustomerserviceisacompetitiveasset For Cargotec, the highlight of the year in 2010 was the implementation of an extensive strategy process. This process, carried out over the spring and summer, involved an assessment by our own experts and external consultants of the future of Cargotec's business environment and the trends affecting it. The result, a refined strategy for Cargotec, was published in the autumn. Although the strategy underlines the importance of emerging markets, services and internal clarity, the core of our strategy is the customer. We at Cargotec make constant efforts to better understand our customers through their business needs. Instead of individual products, customers increasingly expect complete solutions that include customised equipment, as well as a service concept covering their entire life cycle. This trend is reinforced by powerful consolidation, which creates bigger global players in the markets, with needs to match their size. Cargotec has a service and distribution network with unmatched coverage, which allows us to serve our customers wherever we are needed. Our global presence also enables us to be more perceptive of needs emerging from the customer interface. In this respect, our personnel working in all corners of the globe play a leading role in deploying our strategy. Within Cargotec, we can develop unique solutions by sharing experiences and knowledge of the customer needs recognised in different market areas. Competition is increasingly fierce in cargo and load handling equipment manufacture. Although Cargotec is renowned for its first-class products, the feature that truly sets us apart is the most extensive service offering in the industry, combined with the ability to create comprehensive solutions. I believe that these competitive assets will gain more importance in the future. We have therefore made a commitment to continuously improve them. Thewholeworldisourmarketarea Our customer-driven strategy includes a stronger focus on customer segments. More careful targeting allows us to identify our strongest areas, thereby promoting our market leadership in carefully selected business segments. A considerable part of Cargotec's clientele operates in growing markets. The world is changing, as evidenced by the fact that intra-Asian traffic, not intercontinental freight traffic, now accounts for the biggest container volumes. As the middle class becomes more affluent, buyers of products manufactured in the emerging markets can also be found nearby. Cargotec's major investments and new recruitment are focused on the emerging markets. Success requires a strong local presence. With the geographical shift in economic power, business can no longer be commanded from the other side of the world. In 2011, two of our Executive Board members will be located in China: the Executive Vice President for Asia-Pacific is responsible for operations in the region while the Deputy to CEO is promoting development projects in the Asia-Pacific. We are pursuing steady growth in the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China, and also in Africa, where we are seeking growth through our South African business location.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 5  Although the emerging markets are the driving force of global economic growth, mature markets will nonetheless retain their important position. In September, we launched operations at a new assembly unit in Poland â€“ Cargotec's most energy efficient unit. This unit is located close to our customers in Europe, which is an important market for us. Fullconfidenceinthefuture The world is in constant transition and there can be no return to the pre-recession era. We must face forward, into the future. Instead of preparing a tight five-year plan for Cargotec, we will follow our strategy and attempt to flexibly adapt to changing circumstances. The new Cargotec organisation is better equipped to react and take action. The future may be impossible to predict, but for us it is looking bright. Despite global political and economic developments, goods will always be transported - even more so due to globalisation. Our response to industry consolidation is to serve large and small customers in compliance with the same quality requirements. Creating new innovations is the Cargotec way. In 2010, a significant part of our research and development work continued to focus on ecological and energy efficient technologies. Providing sustainable solutions is for us the most efficient way to support sustainable development in accordance with the UN Global Compact principles. I would like to thank our personnel for our good performance in 2010. In difficult times, we were able to excel and create a foundation for a strong Cargotec. The year 2010 proved what we can achieve as one company. I would also like to thank all of our customer and business partners for their support, which encourages us to become a better provider of cargo handling solutions.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 10  Businessreview2010 During 2010, many industries where Cargotec's customers operate revived after the economic downturn. This had a positive effect on the demand for Cargotec's solutions. For example in Asia, Cargotec secured major orders for cargo handling solutions used in ports, merchant shipping and offshore logistics. Cargotec received significant orders also from other industries in different parts of the world. This review discusses Cargotecs business in different parts of cargo flow in 2010. The first stop is in industries, and the journey continues to distribution and further to ports and sea.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 11  Demand for Cargotec solutions increased in various industrial sectors. Industry Market Cargotec's customers represent various industrial sectors including heavy industry, waste handling and recycling, sawmills, pulp and paper, and forestry. World crude steel production at the end of 2010 was on a higher level than at the end of 2008 when the global economic crisis started to affect production. The price of scrap metal rose gradually during 2010, which led to increased recycling. Following the recovery within the sawmill segment and a gradually growing demand in the pulp and paper industry, the forestry business saw an upturn in 2010. Volumes in forest harvesting and transports grew. Demand for Cargotec's solutions For industrial applications, Cargotec offers Hiab loader cranes, Hiab Multilift demountables, Hiab Loglift and Hiab Jonsered forestry and recycling cranes, Hiab Moffett and Princeton PiggyBack truck-mounted forklifts, Kalmar forklifts and logstackers, and services. The increase in steel trade had a positive impact on Cargotecs forklift business in 2010. The majority of the increase came from Europe, which was the main market for forklift trucks. Forklift truck sales for the forest industry increased well when compared to 2009. In 2010, Cargotec received the first orders of electric light forklifts for industrial use from the United States. These forklifts run on electricity and do not create emissions. Cargotec also started to see more demand for truck-mounted forklifts across many applications. A new market for these products in 2010 was paper recycling in the United States with a small volume. Increase in the price of scrap metal positively affected the demand of heavy duty recycling cranes in the main recycling markets in Europe and Asia. As recycling grows, efficiency in transport and logistics will become increasingly important. High activity in the mining sector, especially in Australia and South America, increased the demand for related loader cranes. Sales of special loader crane applications for building oil and gas pipe lines improved as well in 2010. Growing volumes in forest harvesting and transports, combined with accumulated needs of renewal investments, resulted in increased sales of Cargotec's forestry cranes. The demand for logstackers returned to normal levels in 2010 after a year of high demand in 2008 and very low demand in 2009. Development in offering A special emphasis at Cargotec was put on developing solutions for waste and recycling logistics. Cargotec also undertook the representation of waste compactors for refuse collection vehicles and started the resale of waste bin washers and related services. A new loader crane model specially designed for underground waste collection was introduced. A new forestry crane model for chipper applications was also launched during the year.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 12  The demand for Cargotec's terminal tractors w as good.  Inland transport and distribution Market  Cargotec's load handling solutions are used in various sectors in inland transport and delivery, including construction, distribution, warehousing and defence. Construction activity started to increase in Europe, Middle-East and Africa (EMEA). The building sector remained weak in the Americas region. The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region continued strong and the recovery was aided by government stimulants to power the economy out of recession. The rise in consumerism and trade resulted in economic growth. The pressure to reduce emissions at ports and in urban areas is strongest in the United States. The new Machinery Directive (2006/42/EC) established requirements for cranes and demountables in the European market. Demand for Cargotec's solutions For inland distribution, Cargotec offers Hiab loader cranes, Hiab Multilift demountables, Hiab Moffett and Princeton PiggyBack truck-mounted forklifts, Zepro, Focolift, Del and Waltco tail lifts, and Kalmar terminal tractors and light forklifts. As construction activity started to increase in EMEA, there was a clear positive turnaround in the market demand of truck cranes and demountables, which started already at the end of 2009. However, the global recovery of the load handling markets was uneven, varying geographically and by customer segment. Australia was one of the growing markets for truck cranes in the APAC region. Cargotec received a large order for truck-mounted forklifts from a company specialising in home improvements in the United States as well as other orders from customers in Europe. The demand for terminal tractors was good. During the year, Cargotec received contracts for 200 terminal tractors from the United States for an intermodal operation. Also, dealers in the United States started to buy terminal tractor stock units, which is a clear sign of improving activity. Cargotec received a significant order for rough terrain container handlers from Tank-Automotive Armament Command, part of the US Department of Defense. Development in offering Cargotec delivered breakthrough liquefied natural gas-powered terminal tractors to a customer in California and introduced the industry's first hydraulic hybrid drive terminal tractor. These innovations will help customers meet the ever stricter regulations in this part of the world and combat expensive exhaust after-treatment solutions. Research and development in loader cranes was focused on meeting the new Machinery Directive requirements. Besides fulfilling the compulsory requirements, Cargotec also launched the new Variable Stability Limit (VSL) system increasing the safety and efficiency of crane operations. VSL is an electronic system that automatically monitors vehicle stability. Cargotec presented the first model in a new series of loader cranes with a new load sensing control system for small to mid-range cranes to improve working and fuel consumption efficiency. Cargotec also continued to develop its stiff boom cranes for emerging markets, mainly in the APAC region. In demountables, a new generation of the hooklift range was completed. Cargotec also launched a new truck-mounted forklift with a telescopic boom for easier loading and unloading. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report.

Enabling on site, on time delivery The building construction industry in the United States saw a moderate improvement in 2010 from the year before. Cargotecs long-time customer Ryan Building Materials, Inc serving the Detroit, Michigan metropolitan area in the United States successfully balanced the demand with its capabilities resulting in an order for a new Hiab XS 335 K crane. The unit was delivered in December 2010. Dedicated to providing its customers with reliable performance, Ryan Building Materials handles, for example, drywall, ceiling tiles, steel studding and insulation, with a fleet of Cargotec equipment. The building supply company operates with seven Hiab wall board cranes on flat bed trucks and three Hiab Moffett truck-mounted forklifts. "The equipment from Cargotec is the perfect solution for delivering materials at a job site," says Bill Johnston, CEO of Ryan Building Materials, Inc. "They handle quickly, smoothly and accurately which allows us to perform efficiently." A Hiab Moffett truck-mounted forklift detaches itself from the rear of a truck in less than a minute. The unit can traverse most terrain conditions allowing the operator to place materials where they are needed. Hiab wall board cranes reach safely and smoothly several stories high. Their optimised boom system affords greater lift capacity at higher levels and faster loading/unloading speeds. Operated by remote control, the operators have the freedom to survey the situation and perform with care and precision. "The equipment is extremely efficient and trouble-free," Johnston continues. "Over the years, Cargotec has improved the technology of its cranes with better safety and control features. Each machine continues to deliver consistent performance which enables us to provide the high level of service that our customers have come to expect from Ryan Building Materials, Inc." The level of difficulty varies between job sites so regular maintenance is a must. Cargotec performs all scheduled service on the units either at the customer's location or at its own workshop nearby.

Increased efficiency with a full Cargotec service contract When you are in the business of processing the waste generated by a nation of 16.5 million people, the demand for efficiency and sustainability is high. With its fleet of over 900 vehicles, SITA Nederland provides waste management solutions for businesses and municipalities in the Netherlands. SITA, a part of Suez Environnement, has relied on close collaboration with Cargotec for many years. It was over 15 years ago when Eddy De Jong, Fleet Manager at SITA Nederland, first contacted Cargotec (then Hiab) to discuss developing a total maintenance plan for a fleet of Hiab products used by SITA. Together, Cargotec and SITA designed a full maintenance contract that covers the entire equipment life cycle, which is typically 10 years. The current contract was signed in 2002. Within the agreement, the maintenance and repair work of Hiab skiploaders, demountables, hooklifts and loader cranes is placed firmly in the hands of Cargotec. A fixed monthly fee has eliminated SITAs worry of any additional service costs. Because all the maintenance activities are managed by the Cargotec maintenance contract, we are free to concentrate on improving the efficiency in our core activities of waste handling and logistics. This has contributed to us meeting our business targets and has played a major role in increasing the utilisation of the fleet, De Jong says. In 2010, 25 new Hiab products where included in the repair and maintenance contract. This means at least another decade of intensive collaboration between SITA and Cargotec. Cargotec has an extensive service network of around 160 technicians in the Netherlands. Operating from dedicated workshops or fully equipped service vehicles, the Cargotec teams are always ready to respond to the needs of the customer.

Energy efficiency and flexibility in cargo transport The Norwegian shipowner Grieg Shipping ordered cranes and hatch covers from Cargotec for ten general cargo ships. These orders totalled about EUR 55 million in value. The shared objective was to develop an innovative total cargo handling solution that is both energy efficient and flexible. Grieg Shipping's new 48,700 dwt (deadweight tonne) general cargo ships will be equipped with 40 variable frequency drive (VFD) MacGregor cargo cranes and a combination of MacGregor folding, pivoting and piggy-back hatch covers. Cargotec will supply the cranes and hatch covers to the Hyundai Mipo Dockyard in South Korea, where the ships will be built between 2012â€“2014. "The cargo handling design was created in close cooperation with the shipowner and Cargotec's cranes and dry cargo business lines. The result is a completely new, integrated cargo handling equipment arrangement which is more versatile. This enables the transportation of a wider range of project cargoes," says Ari Viitanen, Cargotec's Sales Director for dry cargo ships. Grieg's open-hatch vessels have traditionally employed a combination of gantry cranes and lift-away hatch covers. The new cranes are environmentally friendly. The flexibility of the cargo handling system enables the more efficient use of the vessels.  Three key factors contribute to the small carbon footprint of the new cranes: Faster and more accurate hook positioning during loading and unloading, reducing the loading cycle by up to 20 percent and therefore cutting down the time spent in port 30â€“35 percent lower power consumption Lower energy (bunker oil) consumption, due to low power consumption. "Our objective of reducing energy consumption was a key criterion in crane development work. Equipped with MacGregor cranes, the new vessels bring versatility to our fleet. We believe that this will open up new cargo transport opportunities and thereby raise our earnings potential," says Jan ivind Svardal, Vice President for Project Development, Grieg Shipping. "We work closely with our customers, which enables us to introduce innovations improving the safety, efficiency and sustainability of their operations," says PerErik Nilsson, Cargotec's Sales and Marketing Director for MacGregor cranes.

The strategic focus areas identified are customers, emerging markets, service business and internal clarity. Global trends Success requires adapting to changes in the global environment.  During the strategy process, Cargotec experts identified global trends estimated to have an influence on the company's future. Sustainable development Cargotec strove to minimise the environmental impacts of its supply chain and use of its products through research and development. Personnel The first global employee survey in Cargotec's history was conducted. Values and development discussions were included in the management process. Cargotec's people strategy was refined. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 31  Cargotec's strategic focus areas are customers, services, emerging markets and internal clarity. Strategy at work: driven by customer focus As a result of a two-stage strategy process, Cargotec has refined its strategy for the coming years. The objective was to identify changes in market conditions and anticipate future developments in Cargotec's business environment. In the first stage, top management outlined megatrends in the global economy that will have a major impact on the company's future success. In the second stage, a large number of Cargotec's own experts were invited to join the strategy process. They were encouraged to openly share their views on the company's customer and industry segments and growth markets.  Four focus areas emerged from the strategy process:  Customers: Customer perspective lies at the heart of the refined strategy. This means focusing on selected segments, while making a flexible transition towards a more customer-driven approach. Services: Stronger emphasis is put on service development, in line with the customers' value chain, and on seeking growth when customers outsource their service operations. Emerging markets: Mature markets are showing slower growth. A successful company must be strong, particularly in growing economic areas. Internal clarity: Enhanced efficiency and unity are pursued through process development. Cargotec came to the conclusion that, in a rapidly changing world, preparing a detailed five-year plan was not feasible. Instead, defining focus areas is crucial, since these would enable continued business development in line with the company's strategy. Based on the refined strategy, financial targets were reconfirmed. These targets reflect the industry's growth expectations, as well as actions already taken, or to be taken, by Cargotec. Cargotec's financial targets:  Annual sales growth exceeding 10 percent, including acquisitions Raising the operating profit margin to 10 percent Gearing below 50 percent (over the cycle) Dividend at 30â€“50 percent of earnings per share Skilled personnel a key success factor  Successful strategy implementation requires a customer oriented mindset and operating model across Cargotec. It is also the basis for creating sustainable competitive advantage. One way of promoting the strategy is to encourage the personnel to identify customer needs. Cargotec is flexible and able to respond to change. This is demonstrated by its ability to take account of needs which only become apparent when working with the customer. Because personnel plays a crucial role in strategy execution, Cargotec is investing in human resources and competence development globally. Such measures will secure the best talent in the industry that Cargotec needs to meet its strategic objectives.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 32  Strategicfocusareas The four focus areas identified in Cargotec's refined strategy are Customers, Emerging markets, Services and Internal clarity. Customers Operational integration is a growing trend among Cargotec's customers. Companies are becoming more efficient as they grow, forming global partnerships. To meet changing customer needs, Cargotec needs an extensive geographic presence, combined with a flexible, adaptive operating model. In this changed customer environment, a regional division of operations is no longer fit for purpose. Accordingly, instead of regional leadership, Cargotec is seeking leadership in selected segments. Performing well in Europe or America is not enough â€“ we need to do so worldwide. Our Marine business area is doing just that. Many of its products are industry leaders globally, explains MikaelMkinen, Cargotec President and CEO. Discovering growth potential is about identifying customer needs. "To serve our customers better and understand what they really want, we need to see things from their perspective," Mkinen points out. By understanding customer needs, Cargotec can target its resources and, for example, research and development investments effectively, while better serving the customer. Services Cargotec offers support throughout the customer's supply chain. Cargotec will maintain its competitive assets, such as outstanding and reliable technical services and spare parts delivery management, and develop them further. Shared business concepts and other forms of inter-company cooperation are becoming more popular, due to the increasingly networked nature of Cargotec's market environment. A prime example of this is service outsourcing, which offers considerable business growth opportunities, particularly in Asia. Service outsourcing provides customers with flexibility, since they no longer need to maintain their own servicing systems. This leaves them free to adjust their operations, to provide a better fit with changing conditions.  For Cargotec, outsourcing represents a business opportunity. Thanks to its customer-driven, truly global operations, Cargotec can offer its customers the total service and maintenance they need. Emergingmarkets Within the global economy, emerging markets continue to grow in significance. A presence in such markets is one of the key points of Cargotec's strategy. Growth is faltering in the North American and European markets, where Cargotec is focusing on consolidating its current position. In the emerging markets, especially China, the company is seeking a strong foothold, creating broad-based growth and striving to disseminate its existing know-how. For Cargotec, emerging markets mean the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China, and the African continent, in particular. In these regions, Cargotec is growing its business through acquisitions, partnerships and organic growth. The key issue is to tap into local resources and succeed in local competition. To generate growth, the company is investing in the dissemination of knowledge and competence from established markets into new market areas. For Cargotec, a changing market environment represents an opportunity as well as a challenge. Internalclarity During the years 2007â€“2010, the company completed major change initiatives designed to harmonise its operations and to create one Cargotec. In the coming years, Cargotec will continue to follow the One Company operating model by emphasising internal clarity and creating efficient, consistent processes. As the entire business becomes more process driven, Cargotec's refined strategy is focusing on the development of processes and shared practices. An extensive process development initiative is currently under way. This involved the definition of key business processes in 2010, while key support processes are to be introduced in 2011.  Defining a common way of working for the company's various processes will enable Cargotec to identify synergy benefits and create a uniform, customer-driven approach. "The objectives of this initiative include greater efficiency and quality, and a sharper response to customer needs," explains Mikael Mkinen.

By honing project management methods, projects can be standardised and prioritised. This allows resources to be allocated wisely, while ensuring that projects support strategy execution. It also involves identifying a consistent project management model for internal development projects. Whether striving to improve the company's processes or project management, the aim is the same: internal clarity and efficiency. In addition, integrating Cargotec's information management systems will help to achieve the transparency required for a global business. Since personnel is the key to strategy implementation, Cargotec uses various communication methods in the pursuit of its strategic goals. Clear and consistent messages are being used to communicate focus areas across the organisation. At the employee level, Cargotec will also draw up personal objectives in line with the strategy. Effective communication is needed to establish the common processes leading to efficient, harmonised operations.

However, in discovering the path to continued success, we need to read the signals given by the past and present. In 2010, Cargotec refined its strategic focus areas. The Cargotec strategy is based on understanding the customer, while flexibly adapting to changes in the world economy and Cargotec's industry. Read more on how four key global trends are impacting on Cargotec's business. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report.

Return to Asia The global economic focus is shifting from the west to Asia. This represents a historical cycle: global economic growth has returned to where it still lay two centuries ago. The economy is moving to where people, raw materials and knowhow are found Certain key factors, including people, raw materials and know-how form the basis of economic focus areas. Growth concentrates wherever resources are most readily available. Asia has become the hub of global production. Cargo flows from Asia to the rest of the world have shown steady growth, as production to feed Western consumption has centralised in Asia. Sea transportation is particularly affected by this. Asia's importance to the global economy is not only explained by the way in which production has centralised there. Growth in Asian countries' gross domestic product boosted their own wealth, which is reflected in increased consumption. This has created major local economies in Asia, with production and consumption concentrated in the same markets. As much as 37 percent of the world's container traffic can already be found within Asia. Growth in sea transportation is boosting demand for solutions supplied by the shipbuilding industry. A need for efficient container handling solutions is also being created by growth in Asian cargo flows, which is increasing the number of containers handled in local ports. Cargotec monitors, understands and grows Cargotec is keeping a close eye on the development of national economies in different regions. Economic growth is increasing both material flows and demand for cargo and load handling solutions. Within the world's economic growth areas, Cargotec has a significant market share in Asia. Understanding the changes underway and customer needs is vital to maintaining this position. In a tightening competitive situation, Cargotec's strengths lie in its ability to deliver complete solutions alongside the industry's most comprehensive customer service, in addition to individual items of equipment. Employee skills and competitive pay are essential to securing market leadership. A well-functioning subcontractor and supplier network also plays a key role in enabling Cargotec to perform as it does. Where customers are found and need arises â€“ that is where Cargotec is increasing its production, services and R&D. In the last few years, the company has increased its investments in Asia in particular. It is also seeking a stronger presence in other emerging markets, such as Russia and South America. Recruitment is balanced towards global economic growth areas. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 39  Sustainable approach For Cargotec, identifying and addressing the environmental impacts of its business is very important. The same applies to promoting health and safety. The environmental impacts of Cargotec's operations, that is, its assembly units, service units and offices, are primarily local. Environmental impacts are also caused by business travel and material deliveries. However, Cargotec's operations have a relatively minor effect on global environmental problems. Cargotec's supply chain and the use of its products represent the company's greatest indirect environmental impacts. As an industry leader, Cargotec strives to minimise these impacts through research and development aimed at creating environmentally friendly and energy efficient solutions. In managing the environmental impacts of its operations, as well as in issues concerning quality, health and safety, Cargotec relies on its certified environmental, quality and safety systems. In addition, an environmental and occupational health monitoring system is in place, providing companywide key indicators. Certified Cargotec units covered by the key indicator monitoring system in 2010, of 21 assembly units  ISO 14001  ISO 9001 OHSAS 18001 KPI* 13 20 4 21 *KPI = Key performance indicators, Cargotec's monitoring system for environmental and occupational health In the case of Cargotec's products, the greatest environmental impacts occur at the beginning and end of the value chain. Accordingly, Cargotec's environmental planning covers the entire life cycle of each product. Occupational health and safety form an integral part of planning work. Environmental planning The environmental load caused by our products is at its largest towards the end of the value chain. For this reason, our environmental planning covers the product's entire life cycle. Environmental impact management helps prevent the impact of operations on soil water systems the atmosphere surrounding natural environment communities Cargotec's environmental impact management focuses on internal transport direct and indirect energy use metal welding and cutting volatile organic compounds from painting seepage Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 40  The production facility in Poland is Cargotec's most modern and energy efficient assembly unit. Building operating systems for Cargotec's Polish assembly unit In September 2010, Cargotec began production in its new multi-assembly unit in Stargard Szczeciski, Poland. Focusing on the assembly of a number of Cargotec cargo and load handling solutions, this unit represents the cutting edge in sustainable production technology, processes and quality. During the one and a half years' time when the assembly unit was being designed and built, an integrated operating system was developed. This was ready for introduction upon the unit's completion. In practice, the system helps ensure the continuous execution and development of quality, environmental and occupational health and safety measures. In creating the system, Cargotec used the best practices employed in its other production facilities. In November 2010, the operating system was awarded a certificate for compliance with the ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards. In Cargotec's history, this was the first certification of an integrated operating system for compliance with three standards. ISO standards are the most commonly used worldwide. Such certification requires an inspection conducted by a third party to verify compliance with the standards in question. At the Polish assembly unit, a three-day audit was conducted by Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance. "From the very outset, our goal was to have all aspects of the Polish assembly unit's operating system in order at the first attempt. This required attention to the latest developments in the field and to Cargotec's commitments, such as the Code of Conduct. The project team did a fantastic job on a very tight schedule," reports Petri Palin, Quality Director within Cargotec's supply organisation. Other key drivers of the new system were Cargotec's values and its commitment to create outstanding solutions for its customers. Cargotec had to present the auditors with tangible evidence of how quality, environmental and occupational health and safety related reporting, corrective action and continuous improvement are organised at the Polish plant. Occupational safety, for example, is ensured by providing a spacious working environment. Training is provided to make sure that personnel comply with the certified systems and to ensure high-quality products. A carbon dioxide neutral wood pellet heating solution forms one of the environmental innovations used at the assembly unit. Similarly, the waste water system was designed together with leading experts in the field, bearing ecological aspects in mind. Furthermore, alternative power generation methods are being explored. Because Stargard Szczeciski is located close to the Baltic Sea, prioritising the environment supports the commitment Cargotec made in 2010 to the Baltic Sea Action Group to promote the wellbeing of the Baltic Sea. "In many ways, building an integrated operating system at the Polish facility was a highly positive project. However, there is always room for improvement. In addition to individual elements, we are making every effort to further develop the system as a whole," Petri Palin concludes.

ProFutureecolabel Cargotec's Pro Future marking is applied to Cargotec products that meet stringent criteria on energy efficiency, emissions and recyclability. The Pro Future solutions allow customers to choose a more environmentally friendly alternative. Fulfilment and compliance with these criteria also help Cargotec to achieve its goals as a participant in the worldwide Clinton Global Initiative. At the end of 2010, the Pro Future product family continued to grow, with the introduction of the world's first Kalmar terminal tractor to be based on hydraulic hybrid technology. Developed in cooperation with Singapore Technologies Kinetics Ltd and its subsidiary, Kinetics Drive Solutions Inc., the system provides on average 20% savings in fuel, as well as significant reductions in harmful nitrogen oxide emissions. Running on a hybrid system, this terminal tractor will first become available to customers in North America, whose urban areas and ports are under the greatest global pressure to cut emissions. In 2010, the Pro Future product range also expanded with MacGregor MacRack, a fully electric hatch cover opening and closing system. In the same year, this product also won the International Bulk Journal's (IBJ) environment protection award. In order to further develop the Pro Future criteria, Cargotec pursued its intensive research and development cooperation between different product lines. Closer attention was also paid to the impacts of equipment over its life cycle. A case in point is the hatch cover study conducted in the Marine business area. Its results will support the expansion and further development of the Pro Future criteria in 2011. The ultimate goal is to award the Pro Future label to all Cargotec equipment. "When opting for a product that meets the Pro Future criteria, customers know they are making a more environmentally sound choice than with a more traditional machine. Cargotec wants to enable its customers to select features that meet their specific needs," explains Development Manager HeikkiSalonen.

EcoService combines cost efficiency with environmental friendliness Cargotec's new EcoService concept provides customers with new levels of cost efficiency, productivity and reliability. Flexible equipment maintenance, rapid spare part deliveries and effective operator training are just some of the service's contents. "This new concept will bring major savings, both financially and in terms of environmental load," says Jason Smith, Director, Product & Concept Development. Economical driving boosts productivity Driving style has a major impact on fuel consumption, exhaust gas emissions and equipment wear or damage. Cargotec's Training Academy trains customers' own operators to adopt economical driving practices. A change in driving style can reduce fuel consumption by up to seven percent, while lowering emissions and increasing productivity. During a two-day training session, the operator learns how to cut fuel consumption and emissions. Training covers areas such as economical driving and lifting techniques and interpreting the information provided by the display. Cargotec's Training Academy offers courses in heavy-duty material handling operations â€“ from ports and terminals to specialist industrial applications. For example, the training programme provides skills in handling terminal tractors, forklifts, loader cranes, reachstackers, and empty and loaded container handlers. The driving course can also be tailored to individual needs. The customer can purchase an optional follow-up programme for maintaining the skills learnt during training. For estimating the financial savings from EcoDriving, a cost savings calculator is available on the Cargotec Training Academy website.

Identifying the lifecycle impacts of hatch covers Inspired by plans to expand Cargotec's Pro Future criteria for environmentally friendly products, in 2010 the Marine business area began to assess the overall lifecycle impacts of hatch covers. Cargotec sought a detailed picture of which factors during product life cycles could be rationally developed from the company's sustainability perspective. As part of the Innovation & Networks research programme of the Finnish Metals and Engineering Competence Cluster, the project was carried out in cooperation with the Lappeenranta University of Technology. It focused on studying the life cycle of hatch covers from the perspective of economic, social and environmental impacts. Cargotec wanted to develop a pioneering role in this little-researched area. Cargotec provided the university with, for example, hatch cover manufacturing materials and information on energy consumption. A standard method was used to calculate the Global Warming Potential, that is, the amount of greenhouse gases generated over the entire product life cycle. Although Cargotec is only responsible for some stages of the product life cycle, the analysis covered the entire cycle "from cradle to grave". The results revealed that, while the manufacture of a hatch cover generates about 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions across the product life cycle, its use generates only around six percent. More than 80 percent of these emissions are generated in the manufacture of materials, primarily steel. On the other hand, steel has the benefit of being fully recyclable when a vessel is decommissioned. "We now know which part of the life cycle is most energy intensive and responsible for the lion's share of emissions. Without this information, there would be no rational basis for engaging in further development work. The study also showed that the manufacture of certain paints generated a relatively large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Reassessing the use of such paints might be a future development area," says Product Development Engineer Jouni Lehtinen. Cargotec's hatch cover design is strongly dependent on raw material manufacturers, customers and international legislation. Over a hatch cover's life cycle, the majority of environmental impacts are generated in processes fully beyond Cargotec's control. From the sustainability perspective, Cargotec's product design should therefore focus on promoting the safety of cargo transportation and vessel personnel in particular. The results of the study identify four preliminary areas of sustainable development to which the hatch cover manufacturer should pay attention: Functionality Operational safety Materials Energy Cargotec's plans for the near future include research into the operating safety of hatch covers, particularly those of next-generation control systems.

In addition to several practical measures, development projects for 2011 were planned. Cargotec's annual Management Review was conducted with a greater emphasis than before. This process involves an assessment of managers and key experts, and successor planning in cooperation with management teams. Management Review allows the company to identify talent and future leaders in the organisation, and to assess the needs of different business and market areas. Cargotec's performance and development discussions were extended to cover more employees: this process was conducted in almost all personnel groups, in a total of 60 locations in 19 countries. A performance and development discussion process, based on identified needs, was specifically designed for supply personnel and its broad introduction is scheduled for 2011. In 2010, Cargotec values were included in performance and development discussions. Values were also discussed in value workshops arranged during the year. New workshops will be held in the future, in various Cargotec locations across the world. Value discussions are also part of the Cargotec Experience induction programme. Cargotec has developed effective ways of deploying its values in practice, one of these being the Cargotec Leadership Profile. This defines critical competence areas in leadership and explains what good value based leadership in Cargotec means. The profile contains the key competences required for strategic, operative, change and employee leadership. It will be used for a wide range of leadership assessment and development purposes, in 360 leadership assessments and for recruitment purposes. Human resources and competence development in 2010 The Managerial Finance training programme continued in 2010. This programme covers 50 managers with profit responsibility and is designed to improve their ability to assess the impacts of decision-making on company finances and performance. Programmes with smaller coverage were arranged for the management of the Marine business area in Norway, Singapore and China. One of the major innovations introduced in Cargotec was the mentoring programme launched during 2010. This programme attracted a great deal of interest, mentors with high motivation and the drive to help others being selected from a large group of candidates. The compatibility of the development needs of those to be mentored and the specific strengths of the mentors were the key criteria for determining the best fit. Some 25 pairs were formed from the candidates. The programme, which will continue until early 2011, is designed to support the development of the mentee's leadership skills. It should also offer both parties the opportunity to learn more about Cargotec across business area boundaries.

Based on statutory employee information and consultation requirements, Cargotec's employee cooperation system has been developed together with employees. At Cargotec, cooperation has been organised at corporate and location level. At the company's various locations, cooperation is carried out as provided for in national legislation. In Europe, the corporate cooperation forum is the Cargotec Personnel Meeting, attended by 18 employee representatives from 13 countries in 2010. Other forums include the Cooperation Committee in Finland and the Corporate Information Committee in Sweden. These forums, convening on an annual basis, are joint meetings for employees and management. In 2010, constructive discussions were conducted at these meetings.

Motivation from a multicultural working community Eduardo Calejero Job title: Vice President After Sales Technical Support, Truck-Mounted Equipment division Location: Zaragoza, Spain "You must be Mr. Crane'," a colleague recently said to Eduardo Calejero, by Mr. Crane' meaning the person to whom customers turn for an opinion they value. Eduardo thinks this applies to the entire Cargotec team. "You could replace Crane' with Forklift', Reachstacker', Terminal tractor', Demountable' , or Ship-to-Shore Crane'. We think of customers as colleagues in the same industry, or as friends," Eduardo explains. The Truck-Mounted  Equipment division covers a wide range of products and applications, such as loader cranes and demountables. On a daily basis, Eduardo and his team are responsible for various issues related to after sales technical support. Their work includes analysing any problems customers have encountered, and proactive quality improvement. "After sales is challenging and interesting due to the diversity of product use and users." In Eduardo's opinion, successful performance requires a commitment to teamwork, the ability to get along with people and an analytical mindset. Eduardo joined Cargotec in 1993 as a Hiab after sales engineer. His 17 years at Cargotec have included several roles, such as regional manager, sales manager, and head of several departments. Eduardo finds the challenging assignments and the working community the most motivating features of Cargotec. The best thing about his job is definitely people. "I am part of an excellent multinational and multicultural team, in which working together is called for every day. Through close cooperation, our job offers us the opportunity to become better acquainted with a certain customer, market area, multi-assembly unit or design engineering department."

A service engineer and a team player Dushyant Puthran  Job title: Service Engineer Location: Dubai, United Arab Emirates Dushyant Puthran, a Service Engineer in Cargotec's Hiab team based in Dubai, has busy days at work. But he does not mind. "I achieve better results when I have plenty to do. And for me, good results equal job satisfaction." He is indeed achieving good results â€“ according to Dushyant, customers have been highly satisfied with the services offered by Cargotec. He also says that Cargotec has become popular in the markets. "I hope that we will soon become the market leader in my region," Dushyant says. Under the leadership of his own managers, Dushyant's job is to supervise the daily operations of the Dubai service centre specialising in Hiab solutions. His daily duties include monitoring the costs and efficiency of installation and service operations, preparing production reports, suggesting improvements regarding service centres, and providing operating and maintenance training to customers. Although the Dubai-based team specialising in load handling is new, it is steadily growing. At the moment, there are eleven team members. Dushyant allocates assignments to his team and makes sure resources are used with maximum efficiency. He is convinced that a work community with no conflicts guarantees good results and job satisfaction. If there are problems, they are discussed openly and solved together. "We are good listeners," Dushyant points out. In his opinion, team members depend on each other. Through its strong working community, Cargotec is able to meet demands placed on quality, costs, equipment deliveries and responses to service requests. "We are an excellent team of engineers and other employees with great teamworking skills supporting each other. All my colleagues are friendly and helpful. That is the best thing about my job." Even the soaring Dubai temperatures with over 40 Celsius degrees do not discourage Dushyant. He feels that Cargotec is a one-of-a-kind employer because it cares about its people, and rewards and appreciates them.

Awin-winsituation EduardoPrat Job title: Area Director, South EMEA - Managing Director Cargotec Iberia, S.A Location: Madrid, Spain GanesanNatarajan Job title: Regional After Sales Manager, Middle East and North Africa Location: Dubai, United Arab Emirates In 2010, Cargotec launched a mentoring programme, with participants from all over the world. One of the 25 pairs participating is Eduardo Prat from Spain and Ganesan Natarajan from India. With a long track record and a vast amount of knowledge and skills in various sectors of industry, Eduardo is acting as the mentor. But there is no hierarchical separation between mentor and mentee â€“ quite the opposite. Both men have had much to offer each other. "I signed up to the programme because I am approaching seniority, both in terms of work experience and age. I thought this would be a great opportunity to share my experiences with others. Ganesan has shared his work experiences and history with me and provided an opportunity to learn more about another culture. We also compared our experiences of Cargotec, as we are both relatively new to the company," Eduardo explains. The opportunity for personal and professional development inspired Ganesan to join the programme. He was thrilled to be mentored by an experienced executive from the other side of the world. The programme was a real eye-opener for Ganesan. "When I visited Eduardo in Madrid, I realised there's another way of seeing things. It was exciting to see how Cargotec worked as one company in Spain." The goal of the mentoring programme is to offer both mentor and mentoree an opportunity for professional development and to acquire a broad spectrum of business skills and knowledge. The key objective is to foster a corporate culture of one Cargotec. "Our conversations convinced me that Cargotec truly does have shared values, vision, and strategy worldwide," Ganesan points out. When visiting Eduardo in Spain, Ganesan made effective use of the time available. In the breaks between discussions concerning Cargotec's future, he took an active part in the daily operations of the Madrid unit. Ganesan plans to spread the knowledge and skills he gained to Cargotec's unit in Dubai. The official closing of the mentoring programme is in spring 2011. Before that, Eduardo will visit Dubai and learn about the work of Ganesan's team on the spot. The men have no intention of ending their communication after the programme. "Ganesan is very professional, hard-working and enthusiastic. We have formed a good relationship and intend to keep in touch in the future," Eduardo says.

The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is held annually, within three months of the closing of the financial period, on a day designated by the Board. An Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting in respect of specific matters shall be held when considered necessary by the Board, or when requested in writing by an auditor of the company or by shareholders representing at least 10 percent of all the issued shares of the company. The issues decided on by the Shareholders' Meeting include the adoption of the financial statements, distribution of profit, granting of release from liability to the members of the Board of Directors and to the President and CEO, the election of the members of the Board and auditor, and their remunerations, amendments to the Articles of Association and other matters to be addressed at the Shareholders' Meeting under the Limited Liability Companies Act and the Articles of Association. The notice of the Shareholders' Meeting is published on Cargotec's website and in at least two daily newspapers, decided upon by the Board, appearing in the Helsinki region. This notice specifies the matters to be considered by the meeting as well as the proposals made by the Board and the Board Committees to the meeting.

In determining these remunerations, the Committee takes account of the Board members' responsibilities and obligations towards the company. Furthermore, the Committee compares the Board remunerations to those paid by other companies of the same size (sales) that operate in comparable business environment. Based on the decision of the AGM of 5 March 2010, the Board's annual remunerations are as follows: Chairman: EUR 80,000 Vice Chairman: EUR 55,000 Other Board members: EUR 40,000 In addition, a remuneration of EUR 500 is paid for attendance in meetings of the Board and its committees. Of the annual remunerations, 30 percent is paid in Cargotec's class B shares and the rest in cash. The shares will be purchased at market price on a quarterly basis. Board members must keep the shares they have obtained in remuneration under their ownership for at least two years from the day they obtained them. Board members receive only remunerations related to their Board and Committee memberships and Board work from the company. Board members are not included in Cargotec's short-term or long-term incentive plans. In 2010, remunerations were paid to the Board of Directors as follows: Member of the Board Total remuneration, EUR (incl. annual remuneration, meeting attendance fees and fringe benefits) No. of class B shares obtained as remuneration (value included in total remuneration) Ilkka Herlin, Chairman 89,740 905 Tapio Hakakari, Vice Chairman 62,740 622 Teuvo Salminen, member as of 5th March 2010 38,333 240 Antti Lagerroos, member 47,500 453 Karri Kaitue, member 46,500 453 Anja Silvennoinen, member 46,500 453 Peter Immonen, member 47,500 453 Total 378,813 3,579 President and CEO and the Executive Board Reward principles, which are based on Cargotec's core values, are applied in determining the total remuneration of the President and CEO and the Executive Board. The Board decides on the base salary, incentive plans, and other benefits of the President and CEO and the Executive Board on the basis of a proposal made by the Nomination and Compensation Committee. The total remuneration of the President and CEO and the Executive Board comprises a fixed base salary as well as incentive plans, for which both short- and long-term targets have been defined. The variable salary component consists of a share-based incentive programme and an option programme, both linked to long-term targets, and short-term bonuses. In 2010 the short-term bonus plan included financial (operating profit and working capital turnover) and personal goals. The President and CEO's maximum annual bonus level was 100 percent of the annual base salary, and for other members of the Executive Board, 50 percent. For the financial period 2010, the base salary of Cargotec's President and CEO Mikael Mkinen was EUR 531,325, including fringe benefits. The bonus paid to Mkinen in 2010 was EUR 184,632. The President and CEO is covered by Cargotec's share-based incentive programme 2010 and option programme 2010. Based on the share-based incentive programme 2010, Mkinen is entitled to receive 20,000 class B shares, if performance criteria for earnings period 2010â€“2012 is being met. Based on the option programme 2010, 20,000 2010A option rights were issued to Mikael Mkinen. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report.

Their retirement age is determined in line with the statutory pension scheme. Two members of the Executive Board are entitled to a supplementary pension benefit. The period of notice of the President and CEO is six months and he has the right to compensation amounting to 12 months' salary for termination of employment. Other members of the Executive Board have a period of notice of 6â€“12 months and are entitled to compensation for termination of employment corresponding to 6â€“12 months' salary. Long-term incentive plan Share-based incentive programme 2007â€“2011 The President and CEO and other members of the Executive Board have been part of Cargotec's share-based incentive programme for the period 2007â€“2011. The first earnings period lasted two years (2007â€“2008) and the following three periods one year each. Since the criteria set for the second earnings period (2009) was not met, no payments were made in 2010. In March 2010, Cargotec's Board of Directors decided that the remaining earnings periods (2010 and 2011) will be cancelled. Share-based incentive programme 2010 In March 2010, the Board of Directors decided to establish a new share-based incentive programme. The programme aims to ensure alignment of the objectives of shareholders and executives in order to increase the value of Cargotec, while committing the executives to the company, and offering them a competitive incentive programme based on ownership in the company. The programme includes three earnings periods, each of them lasting three calendar years, and they commence in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The Board of Directors will decide on the target group, earnings criteria and the targets to be established for them, as well as the maximum amount of the payable reward for each earnings period. The earnings criteria for the earnings period 2010â€“2012 are Cargotec's operating profit margin and sales of the fiscal year 2012. The Board of Directors decides on the target group for the earnings period and their maximum reward at the beginning of each earnings period. The first earnings period covers the members of Cargotec's Executive Board. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 the potential payment will be partly in Cargotec's class B shares and partly in cash. The proportion to be paid in cash is intended to cover taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward to the executives. The programme prohibits the transfer of the shares within approximately two years from the payment, i.e. the length of the programme is five years for each share lot. The rewards to be paid on the basis of the earnings period 2010â€“2012 will correspond to a maximum total of 100,000 Cargotec class B shares (including the proportion to be paid in cash). Continued employment at the Cargotec Corporation is a basic requirement for participation in the share ownership plan. If the employment terminates before the share payment, the participant will lose the right to the share reward. Option programme 2010 The Annual General Meeting of 5 March 2010 confirmed that stock options will be issued to the key personnel of Cargotec and its subsidiaries. This programme is intended to encourage key personnel to engage in long-term work in increasing the company's shareholder value, as well as to commit key personnel to the employer. The maximum total number of stock options issued will be 1,200,000. The Board will decide on the target group, earnings criteria and option issuance on an annual basis, in the spring of the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. In the spring of 2010, 2010A option rights were issued to 54 persons, including the members of Cargotec's Executive Board. With the 2010A option right, the share subscription price is EUR 21.35 per share (volume weighted average price of the company's class B share on NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd during the period 8â€“19 March, 2010). The annual Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 82  dividends paid will be deducted from the subscription price. The 2010A option rights entitle their holders to subscribe for a total of 400,000 class B shares of Cargotec, either new or treasury shares held by the company. A prerequisite for the commencement of the share subscription period related to said option rights is that the financial targets determined annually by the Board of Directors have been achieved. Insofar as such financial targets are not achieved, the related option rights will expire. Cargotec's Board of Directors has decided that if the company's operating profit for 2010 remains below EUR 100 million, the share subscription period for the 2010A option rights will not commence. If the operating profit equals or exceeds EUR 100 million but remains below EUR 120 million, the share subscription period will commence so that half of the 2010A option rights may be exercised. If the operating profit for the financial year 2010 equals or exceeds EUR 120 million, the share subscription period will commence and apply to all 2010A option rights. The share subscription period will be 1 April 2013â€“30 April 2015. Continued employment at the Cargotec Corporation is a basic requirement for participation in the option plan. If the employment terminates before the share subscription period has begun, the participant will lose the right to the options. Other matters related to remuneration The loans Cargotec has granted to Moving Cargo Oy for the financing of a top management incentive programme totalled EUR 3.5 million on 31 December 2010. Owners of Moving Cargo Oy include members of Cargotec's Executive Board. Cargotec has granted no other special benefits, nor has it made other corresponding arrangements with parties belonging to its inner circle.

Riskmanagementâ€“Fromreactivetoproactive The geographic and operational scope of Cargotec's business requires a holistic approach to risk management. In support of business goals, all potential threats and uncertainties are identified and assessed, and action is taken to prepare for them. This is done to ensure business continuance, regardless of changes in the environment. Revised in the autumn of 2010, Cargotec's Risk management policy provides a structured account of risks and risk management. The revision was made on the basis of the company's values with an objective to link risk management more tightly with key business and support processes and management systems, while creating proactive, systematic risk management practices.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 85  Revisedriskmanagement In autumn 2010, Cargotec presented a revised Risk management policy, which is currently being introduced. The policy, based on the company's values and strategy, contains more clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and an upgrade to risk reporting. Once fully introduced, the new policy will make risk management a natural part of Cargotec's business processes and risk reporting part of the units' operations. The policy is already in place with respect to strategic risks. Strategic risk management planning, reporting and follow-up will be included in strategy implementation. Valuesguidingriskmanagement Cargotec's operations are guided by three core values. These are reflected in risk management in a number of ways: Globalpresence-localservice: In addition to global insurance and business travel programmes, risk management runs its own local networks for information collection and cooperation. Workingtogether: In order to make risk management part of daily work, the new Risk Management Policy emphasises cooperation between key business and support processes. Sustainableoperations: Corporate responsibility is an important consideration in Cargotec's various risk indicators. Risk management-related and other audits focus both on the environment and occupational health and safety. Product safety, which can be affected through process development, is also part of sustainable performance. Risk management sectors involving corporate responsibility are shown in the diagram depicting Cargotec's overall risk process. Riskmanagementforinclusioninprocesses The key principle at Cargotec is to make risk management a consistent and systematic part of operations. Instead of simply reacting to problems, a more extensive proactive approach will be adopted, involving risk identification and assessment as a natural part of business processes. An extensive process development project is currently under way at Cargotec. This defines Cargotec's key business processes, which are to develop offering, create customer commitment, and provide solutions â€“ equipment, projects and services, as well as management processes and key support processes. The project is also designed to make risk management a part of key business processes. This makes predicting and managing risks much easier. It also accelerates information collection, reporting and consolidation at corporate level, while rendering them more systematic. Once the process development project has been completed, Cargotec will have succeeded in making quality, environmental and occupational health and safety management part of the management systems. Reportingandauditing In the future, units will prepare risk management reports in conjunction with their planning and budgeting, at least on an annual basis. In addition, synergies will be sought between risk management auditing and other Cargotec audits, for example, relating to the environment, quality, data security or subcontracting. Risk management at Cargotec's own assembly units having been audited once, audits will be extended to the partnership network. Cargotec's operations will be developed based on its own processes and in consideration of international standards. Certified ISO systems, quality and environmental systems as well as occupational health and safety systems and their audits also support the company's risk management. In addition, they support quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety management. External certifications help harmonise practices in different companies, thereby improving transparency and comparability. The objective of Cargotec's Risk management policy is to compile risk management practices and make them a more effective part of the company's core and support processes. Application of the policy began in 2010. Assessment of new processes for further development of risk management will continue in 2011.

However, recovery was uneven, varying geographically and by customer segment. Demand remained low in construction-related customer segments. The Americas saw the most powerful recovery. On the other hand, demand continued to revive, particularly for loader cranes, forklift trucks and truck-mounted forklifts, as well as tail lifts. More containers were handled in ports, with global throughput growth exceeding 13 percent, which was markedly higher than estimated in the beginning of the year. The recovery in demand for container handling equipment in ports began in smaller equipment. The second quarter saw the first orders for large equipment, with this positive development continuing during the second half. The market continued to be favourable for marine cargo handling equipment, being clearly more active than expected at the beginning of the year. In addition, shipyards succeeded in reselling capacity freed up by cancellations, which reflected positively in new orders received by equipment suppliers. In particular, demand for equipment for bulk vessels grew. The market for offshore equipment was active, despite customers still exercising caution in their decision-making processes. Demand for container ship equipment showed signs of recovery after a couple of inactive years. Due to improvements in customer capacity utilisation rates, the service markets saw a clear improvement after a quiet start to the year. The services market showed year-round steady growth in the Americas, while growth in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) mainly occurred towards the end of the year. Orders received and order book Orders received in 2010 grew 49 percent from the comparison period and totalled EUR 2,729 (1,828) million. 62 percent of the orders were received in Industrial & Terminal and 38 percent in Marine. Geographically, the same amount of orders originated from EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and Asia-Pacific. EMEA accounted for 40 (49) percent of all orders, Asia-Pacific for 40 (28) percent, while that of Americas was 20 (23) percent. At the end of 2010, the order book totalled EUR 2,356 (31 Dec 2009: 2,149) million, which was 10 percent higher than at the end of 2009. Industrial & Terminals orders received in 2010 grew to EUR 1,690 (1,260) million, which was 34 percent higher than in the comparison period. Strong growth in orders reflects the market recovery towards the year end. Orders secured by Industrial business mainly included small individual orders, whereas, Terminal business received orders for smaller equipment. At the end of the year, an order for two ship-to-shore cranes and 24 E-One rubber-tyred gantry cranes (RTG), worth around EUR 40 million, was received from Columbia. Other significant orders received by Industrial & Terminal in 2010 were orders for 350 terminal tractors from the US and an order for 14 environmentally friendly straddle carriers from a French terminal operator. An order for two ship- to-shore cranes from Turkey and an order for six zero emission RTGs from Vietnam. A Russian port operator ordered six RTGs and 10 terminal tractors. In addition, an order worth more than EUR 10 million for truck-mounted forklifts was received from a US based company specialising in home improvement. During the first half, Industrial & Terminal received orders worth USD 110 million for rough terrain container handlers from Tank-Automotive Armament Command (TACOM), part of the US Department of Defence. The orders were received under a five-year production contract signed in 2008. Orders received under this contract now total approximately USD 350 million. Industrial & Terminals order book at the end of 2010 totalled EUR 680 (31 Dec 2009: 546) million, which was 25 percent higher than at the end of 2009. Marines orders received in 2010 grew 83 percent from the previous year to EUR 1,040 (569) million. Demand for marine cargo handling equipment and orders received were clearly higher than expected at the beginning of the year. In 2010, shipyards managed to resell capacity vacated due to cancellations and postponements, and began to build new bulk ships with a short delivery time. Hence, demand for cranes and hatch covers for bulk ships was very brisk during the early part of the year, but tailed off as the year drew to a close. Marine received several important orders during the year. Orders for ship cranes worth over EUR 80 million from China and South Korea were received for a delivery of a total of 275 cranes for 64 bulk ships and eight general cargo vessels. Marine also agreed for a delivery for 68 cranes for 17 bulk carriers and design and key components for hatch covers for 26 bulk carriers with a Chinese shipyard. In addition, hatch covers for six bulk ships under construction at a Korean shipyard will be delivered in 2011. This contract follows an order from December 2009 for 24 cranes on the same vessels. Marine also agreed to deliver hatch covers and electric-drive cranes for ten general cargo vessels owned by a Norwegian shipowner. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 88  During the year, Marine also received orders for lashings for 17 mega container ships from South Korea and for 13 container ships owned by a Canadian shipowner. RoRo equipment will be delivered for four vessels under construction in Poland, for two car carries under construction in Japan as well as for four deepsea vessels and two pure car truck carriers under construction in South Korea. In 2010, Marine received orders for offshore solutions from among others Brazil, China, Holland, and Singapore. Subsea load and module handling systems worth around EUR 20 million will be delivered for Hallin Marine offshore vessel. Moreover, Marine signed contacts for deliveries for two active heave compensated knuckle-jib cranes for offshore vessels being built in Singapore and for one crane for a vessel being build in the Netherlands. Marine also received orders for anchor-handling systems for 20 vessels from China and an order for offshore equipment for two vessels from Brazil. In 2010, Marine also received an order from Lithuania for a self-unloading system and a range of transloading equipment will be delivered to the customers new terminal in Goa, India. Marines order book at the end of 2010 totalled EUR 1,675 (31 Dec 2009: 1,604) million. More than 70 percent of the order book is bulk, general cargo and container ship-related. Offshore support vessels-related orders comprise more than 10 percent of the order book. Orders cancelled in 2010 totalled EUR 145 million. These cancelled orders were removed from the order book. Services orders received in 2010 increased in all areas of service business. A large number of small contracts typical of the service business were signed. Major service orders received during the financial period included contracts to refurbish and upgrade ten ship-to-shore cranes with Malaysian port operator, three-year full service contracts for RoRo equipment for 25 vessels from Grimaldi Group and agreements for conversions of RoRo equipment on five Ropax vessels from the Swedish Stena Line. In addition, a refurbishment project for a cement ship unloader was received from a Singaporean cement terminal.  Sales In 2010, sales reached the level of year 2009 sales, amounting to EUR 2,575 (2,581) million. In 2010, currency rate changes had a positive impact on sales compared to 2009. Reported sales would have been approximately six percent less with comparable currency rates. In terms of sales, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) was the largest market, its share being 42 (46) percent of consolidated sales. Asia-Pacifics share of sales was 40 (36) and that of the Americas 18 (18) percent. Cargotecs strategic target is annual sales growth exceeding 10 percent. Industrial & Terminals 2010 sales were EUR 1,526 (1,573) million, 3 percent lower than in 2009. Thanks to a pick- up in demand and production ramp-up, delivery volumes clearly grew at the end of the year. In the beginning of the year, sales were burdened by a low order book as well as uncompleted transfers of production between assembly factories. Marines 2010 sales grew 4 percent from the comparison period, to EUR 1,050 (1,009) million. This sales growth was the result of a strong order book, successful project deliveries and new orders received with a short deliver time. Services sales in 2010 grew to EUR 706 (652) million, representing 27 (25) percent of total sales reflecting market recovery. The rebound in the services markets, and resulting growth in sales, began in spare parts during the first half of the year. Thereafter, it expanded to other service areas. Services sales amounted to EUR 505 (462) million at Industrial & Terminal, representing 33 (29) percent of the reporting segments sales. Services sales at Marine amounted to EUR 201 (190) million, which was 19 (19) percent of its sales.  Financial result Consolidated operating profit in 2010 turned strongly positive, at EUR 131.4 (0.3) million, representing 5.1 (0.0) percent of total sales. Much of this improvement was due to Industrial & Terminal returning to profit. Operating profit includes EUR 10.5 (61.1) million in restructuring costs, of which EUR 8.3 (43.2) million are related to Industrial & Terminal, EUR 0.1 (1.9) million to Marine and EUR 2.1 (15.9) million to corporate administration and support functions. Restructuring costs recorded in the result for Industrial & Terminal include a capital gain from the sale of the land area and properties in Tampere, Finland. Costs of corporate administration and support functions increased due to the change in the operating model, streamlining of operations and investments in global processes and ERP system. Operating profit in 2010, excluding restructuring costs, totalled EUR 141.9 (61.3) million. Operating profit for Industrial & Terminal, excluding restructuring costs, was EUR 37.1 (-10.3) million, representing 2.4 (-0.7) percent of its sales, and EUR 147.6 (105.2) million for Marine, representing 14.1 (10.4) percent of Marines sales. Cargotecs strategic target is to raise its operating profit margin to 10 percent. Industrial & Terminals profitability continued to improve throughout the year, due to a recovering market environment and growing volumes. The streamlined and more competitive supply structure and development done in sourcing led to improved product margins. In the beginning of the year, profitability was hampered by additional costs related to Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 89  challenges in ramping-up production. Although Marines profitability remained high, as expected it turned down during the second half, with a fall in the share of very high-margin deliveries on orders won during the boom. Net financing expenses were EUR -29.9 (-27.0) million in 2010.   Net income in 2010 was EUR 78.0 (7.1) million and taxes EUR 23.4 (-33.9) million, representing a 23.1 (126.7) percent effective tax rate. Earnings per share in 2010 grew to EUR 1.21 (0.05). Balance sheet, cash flow and financing The consolidated balance sheet total was EUR 2,916 (2,687) million at the end of 2010. Equity attributable to equity holders was EUR 1,065 (871) million, representing EUR 17.37 (14.20) per share. Tangible assets on the balance sheet were EUR 292 (301) million and intangible assets EUR 839 (784) million. The total equity/total assets ratio increased to 42.7 (37.5) percent. Return on equity (ROE) in 2010 was 8.0 (0.8) percent and return on capital employed (ROCE) 8.6 (0.2) percent. The dividend payment totalled EUR 27.9 (37.4) million in 2010. As in the previous year, cash flow from operating activities, before financial items and taxes remained very robust in 2010, totalling EUR 292.9 (289.7) million. Net working capital decreased to EUR 43 (123) million at the end of 2010. Gearing fell to 16.0 (38.0) percent at the end of the year. Cargotecs strategic target is to keep gearing below 50 percent over the cycle. Cargotecs financing structure and liquidity are healthy. Interest-bearing net debt at the end of 2010 was EUR 171 (335) million.

In September, Cargotec repurchased partly its euro-denominated domestic bond due in June 2012 as a part of active management of liquidity and loan refinancing risks. Cargotec agreed to repurchase a nominal amount of EUR 77.8 million from the note holders, which represents 77.8 percent of the original EUR 100 million bond issued in 2005.

Cargotec prepared to meet new engine emission regulations taking effect in 2011 in Europe and the US. New Kalmar products use engines with significantly reduced emissions but leave capacity unaffected. During the first half, integration testing of automatic stacking cranes with customers terminal systems was finalised in the Hamburg CTB terminal and the first three cranes of eight were handed over to the customer. New products were introduced to the market, such as a new empty container handler, which meets the strictest requirements for energy efficiency and ergonomics, and a new truck-mounted forklift with a telescopic boom allowing easier loading and unloading. Cargotec also continued product development projects in order to meet the new Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC safety regulations. In addition, the launch of the EcoService concept in February aimed at bringing new levels of cost efficiency, productivity and reliability to terminal customers operations. Three new hooklifts were added to the demountable product family. Emphasis at Cargotec was put on developing solutions for waste and recycling logistics. Cargotec also undertook the representation of waste compactors for refuse collection vehicles and started the resale of waste bin washers and related services. Cargotec has designed an innovative vehicle transfer system for the US Navy to transfer military vehicles including tanks between ships at sea. Sea trials were successfully completed during the first quarter. The aim is to provide the US military with the capability for large-scale logistics movements from sea to shore without dependency on foreign ports.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 90  In September, Cargotec celebrated the opening of its new multi-assembly unit (MAU) in Stargard Szczeciski in Poland. The investment decision was made in April 2009. Production began in rented premises and the transfer to own premises at the new site began at the end of the second quarter of 2010. Currently, load cranes, spreaders and terminal tractors are assembled in the factory. The cash flow impact of the investment cost was EUR 11 million in 2010. Total investment in 2009â€“2010 amounted to EUR 29 million. In 2010, Cargotec sold land areas and properties freed up by restructuring measures in the USA, Sweden, Austria and in Tampere, Finland. The impact on cash flow was EUR 26 million in total. Acquisitions and disposals In October, Cargotec acquired a 10 percent minority holding in a Singaporean MacGREGOR Plimsoll (Tianjin) Pte Ltd. Subsequent to this transaction, Cargotec owns all shares in the company. In July, Cargotec acquired a 10 percent minority holding in a Norwegian MacGREGOR Hydramarine AS. Subsequent to this transaction, Cargotec owns all shares in the company. In March, Cargotec signed a letter of intent to acquire the remaining 25 percent minority share holding in MacGREGOR-Kayaba Ltd in Japan. The transaction was closed in May, and subsequent to this transaction, Cargotec owns all the shares in the company. In January, Cargotec sold its US-based hydraulic cylinders manufacturing business Waltco Hydraulics to Ligon Industries, LLC. Waltco Hydraulics, situated in Ohio, was part of Waltco Lift Corp. belonging to the Industrial & Terminal business area at Cargotec. Waltco Hydraulics employed 25 people. Personnel Cargotec employed 9,954 (9,606) people at the end of 2010. The number of personnel increased towards the end of the year as business volumes grew. Industrial & Terminal employed 7,310 (6,989) people, Marine 2,191 (2,286) and corporate-level support functions 453 (331). The average number of employees in 2010 was 9,673 (10,785). Part- time personnel represented 2 (3) percent of employees. 16 (16) percent of personnel were female and 84 (84) percent male. At the end of 2010, 20 (19) percent of the employees were located in Sweden, 10 (11) percent in Finland and 30 (30) percent in the rest of Europe. Asia-Pacific personnel represented 25 (26) percent, North and South American 11 (11) percent, and the rest of the world 2 (2) percent of total employees. Salaries and remunerations to employees totalled EUR 364 (351) million in 2010. Cargotec refined its company strategy in 2010. Alongside the business strategy, the HR strategy was also re- examined. As a result, four focus areas were identified for the HR strategy: leadership, competence management, competence development and securing strategy deployment. In addition, Cargotec also focused on promoting shared operating methods and processes across the organisation. In 2010, Cargotec conducted its first global employee survey, Cargotec Compass. This electronic survey was addressed to the entire Cargotec personnel. The response rate was high: 75 percent of Cargotec employees responded. The survey revealed that overall job satisfaction was relatively high, even if the results reflected the changes currently underway within the company. A few areas in need of improvement were identified, including the flow of information, communicating changes and cooperation. Working together was identified as a key theme for further action to be taken under Cargotec Compass. Adjusting capacity to demand and other restructuring measures Capacity adjustments and other restructuring measures that began in 2008 were finalised during the first quarter 2010. As a result, the number of employees fell by approximately 3,200. Above-mentioned restructuring initiatives, including structural capacity adjustment measures, were estimated to create total annual cost savings exceeding EUR 150 million. This savings estimate includes all cost structure streamlining actions announced since the beginning of 2008. At the end of 2010, Cargotec proceeded with its plans to transform its Tampere unit in Finland into a competence and technology centre. The plan is to change the focus of the Tampere unit from traditional manufacturing to the development of new products and solutions. Consequently, Cargotec initiated employee cooperation negotiations with current supply personnel in Tampere, on possible workforce reduction. Concluded in November, these saw a reduction of 90 employees from the production organisation in Tampere. This will be implemented in stages over the next 1.5 years. In addition, the decision was taken to continue the temporary lay-offs of production employees in Tampere. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 91  Strategy and financial targets In September, Cargotec refined its strategy. Cargotec will have a clear focus, meaning a prioritised set of actions and resource allocation in order to strengthen its market leadership in the coming years. Cargotec aims to grow faster than the industry average. Cargotec is determined to grow its business through customer focus, with segmentation guiding future business development. In addition, growth will be achieved by expanding Cargotecs presence and offering, particularly in emerging markets and the service business. Cargotec will also continue to develop its working practices, through aligned processes and greater internal clarity.  Strategic focus areas: - Customers: Customer perspective lies at the heart of the refined strategy. This means focusing on selected segments, while making a flexible transition towards a more customer-driven approach. - Services: Stronger emphasis is put on service development, in line with the customers' value chain, and on seeking growth when customers outsource their service operations. - Emerging markets: Mature markets are showing slower growth. A successful company must be strong, particularly in growing economic areas. - Internal clarity: Enhanced efficiency and unity are pursued through process development. Cargotec reconfirms the financial targets based on its refined strategy. These targets reflect the growth expectations of Cargotecs industry as well as actions already implemented, or which the company intends to implement. Cargotecs financial targets are as follows: - Annual sales growth exceeding 10 percent (incl. acquisitions) - Raising operating profit margin to 10 percent - Gearing below 50 percent (over the cycle) - Dividend 30â€“50 percent of earnings per share Process development As part of what has become a strategic focus to increase internal clarity, Cargotec embarked on a major process development project in 2010. This will define core business processes: product portfolio development, customer relations development, equipment, project and service solution delivery, as well as management and key support processes. Common processes will also support the enhancement and improvement of information flows as well as the clarification of the responsibilities cited as development areas in the employee survey. Environment The environmental principles are specified in Cargotecs environmental policy. The environmental impacts of Cargotecs operations, i.e. its assembly unit, service units and offices, are primary local. Environmental impacts are also caused by business travel and material deliveries. However, Cargotecs operations have a relatively minor effect on global environment. Cargotecs supply chain and the use of its products represent the companys greatest indirect environmental impacts. As an industry leader, Cargotec strives to minimise these impacts through research and development aimed at creating environmentally friendly and energy efficient solutions. In 2010, with a view to assessing the environmental impact of all its products, Cargotec continued developing its Pro Future environmental criteria. This involved a study of sustainable development criteria for hatch covers, drawn up alongside the Lappeenranta University of Technology, Finland. Information from this project will be used to asses other products and in developing the Pro Future criteria. In managing the environmental impacts of its operations, as well as in issues concerning quality, health and safety, Cargotec relies on its certified environmental, quality and safety systems. In addition, an environmental and occupational health monitoring system is in place, providing company-wide key indicators. Cargotecs latest achievements include the certification of its Polish assembly factory for its environment, occupational health and quality systems. As part of its process development project, Cargotec began to unify and develop its environmental and occupational health and safety processes in line with the One Company operating model. The expertise existing in Cargotecs various organisations was brought to bear on this project, and common targets were set. Almost all assembly units are using the key environmental, occupational health and safety indicator monitoring system. Describing the environmental impacts of Cargotecs own operations, these key indicators are published each year on Cargotecs website. Occupational health and safety indicators are used for internal development. Internal control and risk management The objective of Cargotecs internal control is to ensure that management decisions are implemented, that decision making is sound and appropriate and that personnel comply with company policies as well as non-company regulations and laws. Cargotecs internal control is based on its values and the Code of conduct. In Cargotec, risk management is part of internal control operations. Revised in the autumn of 2010, the Risk management policy provides a structured account of risks and risk management. The objective of the value-based Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 92  revision was to link risk management more strongly with key business and support processes and management systems, while creating proactive, systematic risk management practices. Responsibility for risk management is distributed within Cargotec as follows: The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring the organisation of sufficient risk management and control. The President and CEO and Executive Board are responsible for the implementation of this risk policy and for the risk management process of Cargotec as a whole. Risk management is conducted as far as is possible and practical in the business units and support functions, when running day-to-day processes. Identification, assessment, treatment planning and reporting are incorporated in planning and decision-making processes. The Corporate Risk Management functions role is to develop and coordinate the overall risk management framework and process. The Risk Management function also is responsible for facilitating the final risk assessment and consolidation of risk reports, as part of the annual planning and budgeting process and the strategy process. Financial risks are centrally managed by Corporate Treasury. Strategic and business risks are related to business cycles in the world economy and Cargotecs customer sectors, the availability of raw materials and components and the related price trends, mergers and acquisitions, and the operations of dealers and subcontractors. In addition, the ever clearer shift in operations towards developing markets requires risk management, not only concerning the shift but also actual operation in these markets. Operational risks relate to persons, property, processes, products, information technology and practices. The materialisation of operational risks may result in bodily injuries, property damage, business interruptions or product liability claims. First and foremost, Cargotecs main operational risk management measures involve better product safety and business processes in order to ensure business continuity. With respect to key person risks, succession plans for leadership and key assignments are updated on an annual basis for the purpose of ensuring continuity in operations. Main hazard risks include risks related to personnel, property, business interruptions and logistics. Cargotec has worldwide insurance covering all units. For more detail description of financial risks, see Note 3, Financial risk management of the Financial statements. Changes in the organisation and management Cargotecs governance model was further developed, resulting in changes in the responsibilities of three Executive Board members as of 1 April 2010. Pekka Vauramo was appointed Chief Operating Officer (COO) and will continue as Deputy to CEO. In his new role, Mr Vauramo is responsible for Cargotecs three business areas and three regions.

As of 1 April 2010 Cargotec's businesses was reorganised into three business areas: Marine, Industrial & Terminal and Services. Cargotecs financial reporting is based on two reporting segments: Marine and Industrial & Terminal. In financial reporting, the Services business is included in the figures of these two reporting segments, while its sales will continue to be reported as additional information. The development of services in both Marine and Industrial & Terminal segments is driven by a joint Services organisation. Stefan Gleuel was appointed Executive Vice President, Services. Unto Ahtola was appointed to lead the Industrial & Terminal business area as Executive Vice President. Other members of the Cargotec Executive Board are: Mikael Mkinen, President and CEO Olli Isotalo, Executive Vice President, Marine business area Axel Leijonhufvud, Executive Vice President, Supply Eeva Sipil, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Kirsi Nuotto, Executive Vice President, HR and Communications Matti Sommarberg, Executive Vice President, Chief Technology Officer Harald de Graaf, Executive Vice President, EMEA region Ken Loh, Executive Vice President, Asia-Pacific region and Lennart Brelin, Executive Vice President, Americas region.

No own shares, however, were repurchased in 2010. Share-based incentive programme 2010 In March 2010, the Board of Directors decided to establish a new share-based incentive programme. The programme aims to ensure alignment of the objectives of shareholders and executives in order to increase the value of Cargotec, while committing the executives to the company, and offering them a competitive incentive programme based on ownership in the company. The programme includes three earnings period, each of them lasting three calendar years, and they commence in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The Board of Directors will decide on the earnings criteria and on targets to be established for them, as well as the maximum amount of the payable reward for each earnings period. The target group of the first earnings period is Cargotec Executive Board members and the earnings criteria are Cargotecs operating profit margin and sales of the fiscal year 2012. The potential reward will be paid partly as Cargotecs class B shares and partly in cash in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The proportion to be paid in cash is intended to cover taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward. The rewards to be paid on the basis of the earning period 2010â€“2012 will correspond to the approximate value of a maximum total of 100,000 Cargotec class B shares (including also the proportion to be paid in cash). The remaining earnings periods 2010 and 2011 of the former share-based incentive programme 2007â€“2011 were not commenced as the new programme replacing the current programme was implemented as from the beginning of 2010.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 95  Loans, liabilities and commitments to persons belonging to the companys inner circle The loans Cargotec has granted to Moving Cargo Oy for the financing of a top executive incentive programme, totalled EUR 3.5 million on 31 December 2010. Owners of Moving Cargo Oy include members of Cargotec Executive Board. Cargotec has granted no other special benefits, nor has it made other corresponding arrangements with parties belonging to its inner circle. For further information on the terms of the loan, see note 35, Related-party transactions. Board of Directors and the President and CEO The election of the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor and their remunerations as well as changes in the Articles of Association, are decided by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The Board of Directors elects Cargotecs President and CEO and determines the terms of his/her employment. The period of notice of the President and CEO is six months and he has the right to compensation for termination of employment of 12 months salary. Short-term risks and uncertainties Developments in the global economy and cargo flows have a direct effect in Cargotecs business environment and customers willingness to invest. Although the global recovery has reflected positively on Cargotecs business environment, there is still uncertainty and sudden changes cannot be ruled out. If these materialise, they may have a negative impact on Cargotecs short-term outlook, should the company prove unable to adapt its operations accordingly with sufficient speed.  Cargotecs wide group of customers and suppliers requires active and continuous monitoring, in order to minimise risks associated with credit losses or supply chain disruptions. Credit loss risks typically diminish as markets recover. On the other hand, with all parts of the supply chain ramping up production, recovering markets can be subject to occasional problems in component availability. The resulting supply problems could weaken the development of sales and profitability. Cargotec estimates that the recovery of shipbuilding market has begun and the cancellation risk in the order book has decreased. On the other hand, cancellations could occur in the form of postponed deliveries. This would have a negative impact on the development of short-term sales and operating profit. An estimated EUR 200 million of Marines order book involves a risk of cancellation. Events after financial period At the end of January 2011, Cargotec announced an acquisition of a US based terminal operating systems provider Navis. The transaction value is approximately USD 190 million (approximately EUR 140 million). By acquiring the leading TOS provider Navis, Cargotec will further strengthen its ability to provide total solutions for its terminal customers. The company has more than 300 employees of which the majority is located in the United States and India. Its sales are expected to be around USD 70 million in 2011, with around 40 percent recurring sales. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals from competition authorities, which are expected to be received during the first quarter of 2011. In January, Cargotec signed a EUR 300 million five-year revolving credit facility. It replaces an undrawn EUR 300 million facility maturing in May 2012. With refinancing and prolonging the maturity, Cargotec strengthens its long-term liquidity and takes advantage of the favourable market conditions.   In December, Cargotec become a majority shareholder in Kalmar (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. by increasing its ownership in the company from 50.0 to 69.9 percent. The deal was closed in early January 2011. In November 2010, Cargotec acquired the assets of a Swedish installation and service company, Hallberg-Ivarsson Hydraulik & Pbyggnad AB, located in Gothenburg. The company specialises in installation and services for on-road load handling equipment and heavy vehicles. The deal was closed in early January 2011. Board of Directors proposal on the distribution of profit The parent companys distributable equity on 31 December 2010 was EUR 900,630,347.75 of which net income for the period was EUR 49,943,386.27. The Board of Directors proposes to the AGM convening on 8 March 2011, that of the distributable profit, a dividend of EUR 0.60 for each of the 9,526,089 class A shares and EUR 0.61 for each of the 51,819,304 outstanding class B shares be paid, totalling EUR 37,325,428.84. The remaining distributable equity, EUR 863,304,918.91 will be retained and carried forward. No significant changes have occurred in the Cargotecs financial position after the end of the financial year. Liquidity is good and the proposed distribution of dividend poses no risk to the companys financial standing. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report.

Accounting principles for the consolidated financial statements Generalinformation Cargotec Corporation is a limited liability company domiciled in Helsinki, Finland. The registered address is Srnisten rantatie 23, 00501 Helsinki, Finland. Cargotec Corporation and its subsidiaries form the Cargotec Group (later referred to as Cargotec or company).

These consolidated financial statements were approved for publishing by the Board of Directors on 3 February 2011. Pursuant to the Finnish Limited-Liability Companies Act the shareholders have the right to approve or reject the financial statements in the Annual General Meeting held after their publication. The Annual General Meeting also has the right to amend the financial statements. A copy of the Annual Report is available on the Internet at www.cargotec.com or from the address Cargotec Corporation, Investor relations, PL 61, 00501, Helsinki, Finland. Accountingprinciplesandnewaccountingstandards Cargotec Corporation's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The IAS and IFRS standards as well as SIC and IFRIC interpretations valid on 31 December 2010 have been used in preparation of the financial statements. Financial information is presented in millions of euros and business transactions are based on historical cost conversion unless otherwise stated. All figures presented have been rounded and consequently the sum of individual figures may deviate from the presented sum total. Cargotec has applied the following new and amended standards and interpretations as of 1 January 2010: IFRS 3R, Business Combinations (revised). The scope of the revised standard is broader than earlier. The revised standard includes several significant changes, which have impact on accounting of goodwill and sales profit or loss resulting from disposal of businesses. The changes have an impact on profit and loss in the acquisition year and in the years when additional earn-outs are paid or additional acquisitions performed. Assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations whose acquisition dates preceded the application of revised standard will not be adjusted. The revision does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. IAS 27: Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (amendment). The amended standard requires that the changes in a parent company's ownership interest that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. If the control is lost, the remaining investment should be measured at fair value at the date that the control is lost and any resulting gain or loss should be recognised in profit or loss. The respective accounting will be applied to associated companies (IAS 28) and jointly controlled entities (IAS 31). Due to the standard amendment, subsidiary loss can be allocated to minorities even in a situation when the loss exceeds the non-controlling's investment. The amendment does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (amendment): Eligible Hedged Items. The amendments are related to hedge accounting and define the hedging of one-sided hedged risk and inflation as a hedgeable component. The amendment clarifies the guidance of the hedge accounting. IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 (amendment): Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives on Reclassification. The amendments clarify that on reclassification of a financial asset out of the at fair value through profit or loss' category all embedded derivatives have to be assessed and, if necessary, separately accounted for in the financial statements. The amendment does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. IFRS 2: Share-based Payment â€“ Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions  (amendment). The amendment to IFRS 2 clarifies that an entity that receives goods or services from its suppliers must apply IFRS 2 even though the entity has no obligation to make the required share-based cash payments. The amendment does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. New interpretations: IFRIC 12: Service Concession Arrangements, IFRIC 15: Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 16 Net Investment in a Foreign Operation, IFRIC 17: Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners and IFRIC 18: Transfer of Assets from Customers. The interpretations do not have a material impact on the financial statements. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 105  Additionally, Cargotec has adopted the amendments related to the IFRS 2008 and 2009 Annual Improvements, which have been endorsed by the EU. Aforementioned changes do not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Restatementofreportingsegments'comparablefigures As of January 1, 2010 Cargotec has two reporting segments, Industrial & Terminal and Marine. Reporting segments' financial information for comparable periods has been restated accordingly. Consolidationprinciples The consolidated financial statements include the parent company Cargotec Corporation and the subsidiaries, in which the parent company holds more than 50 percent of the voting rights or in which it otherwise exercises control, as well as joint ventures and associated companies. Subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred for acquisitions realised after 1.1.2010. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Cargotec recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsidiaries acquired during the financial period are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of control, and divested subsidiaries up to the date of control ceasing. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. All inter-company transactions, receivables, liabilities, unrealised profits and distribution of profits within Cargotec are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Distribution of net income for the period to the equity holders of the parent company and to non-controlling interest is presented in the statement of income. Equity attributable to non-controlling interest is disclosed as a separate item in the equity. Investments in associated companies (in which Cargotec holds 20â€“50 percent of the voting rights or exercises significant influence, but has no control) and Joint Ventures (in which Cargotec holds 50 percent of the voting rights or exercises joint control with the other owners) are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method.  The investments in associates and joint ventures include the goodwill identified on acquisition. Transactions with non-controlling interests are treated as transactions with equity owners of the group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains and losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.  When the group acquires control in an associate or joint venture, the previous equity interest is valued at fair value and the difference to book value is recognised in profit and loss. Foreigncurrencytransactions Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Open foreign currency-denominated receivables and liabilities at the end of the financial period, both intragroup and external, are translated using the exchange rate of the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses related to normal business operations are treated as adjustments to sales or costs. Exchange rate differences on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of future cash flows are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, until transferred to statement of income simultaneously with the underlying cash flow. Exchange rate differences on other hedges relating to business operations are recorded in other operating expenses. Foreign exchange gains and losses associated with financing are included in financial income and expenses. Exchange rate differences arising from investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in translation differences in equity. Some intracorporate loan agreements form part of a net investment as their settlement is not planned, and it is not probable in the foreseeable future, and thus the exchange rate change of these contracts is also recognised in translation differences under equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed or sold, exchange differences that were recognised in equity are recognised in the statement of income as part of the gain or loss on sale. Foreignsubsidiaries Items of each subsidiary included in the consolidated financial statements are measured using the currency that best reflects the operational environment of that subsidiary ("the functional currency"). The consolidated financial Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 106  statements are presented in euros, which is the functional and reporting currency of the parent company. The statements of income and cash flow of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the euro are translated into euros using the average exchange rate of the financial period. Balance sheet items, with the exception of net income for the financial period, are translated into euros with the balance sheet date exchange rate. Translation differences caused by different exchange rates are recorded in the consolidated comprehensive statement of income. Translation differences from elimination of net investments in subsidiaries outside of the euro area and from the loans and other instruments designated as hedges to the net investments are recognised in the consolidated  comprehensive statement of income. When the foreign entity or a part of it is disposed, accumulated translation differences which were recorded in other comprehensive income are recognised in the statement of income as a part of the gain or loss on sale. Segmentreporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors of Cargotec together with the President and CEO. Revenuerecognition Sales includes revenues from goods and services sold net of sales taxes, discounts and translation differences from foreign currency denominated revenues. Revenues from goods sold are recorded after the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer and the company no longer has authority or control over the goods. Usually this means the moment when goods have been handed over to the customer in accordance with the agreed contractual terms. Revenue from repair work is recognised when the work has been carried out and revenues from short term services when the service has been rendered. Income from the leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. Revenue from separately identified long term contracts is recorded as sales under the percentage of completion method when the outcome of the project can be measured reliably. The percentage of completion is determined by reference to the individual contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs (cost to cost -method) or  by completion of a certain physical milestone (milestone method). When the conditions for percentage of completion method are not met, costs are recognised as incurred and revenues to the extent that corresponding costs are expected to be recovered. Possible contract losses are recognised as an expense immediately. Researchanddevelopmentcosts Research and development costs are primarily expensed when incurred. However, development costs are capitalised when certain criteria related to economic and technical feasibility are met, and it is expected that the product will generate future economic benefits. Capitalised development costs include mainly materials, supplies and direct labour costs. Earlier expensed development costs are not capitalised later. Capitalised development costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life. Unfinished development projects are impairment tested annually. Incometaxes Tax expenses in the statement of income includes taxes on the taxable income of the companies for the period, tax adjustments for previous financial periods and the changes in deferred taxes.The consolidated statement of comprehensive income includes taxes on items presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between financial reporting and the taxation calculated with effective prevailing tax rates. Temporary differences arise for example from defined benefit plans, provisions, elimination of inter-company inventory profits, depreciation differences on tangible assets, untaxed reserves, tax losses carried forward and fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities of acquired companies. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.   Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not depreciated but tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment testing is described in detail in the section Impairments. Goodwill is recognised at cost, decreased by potential impairment. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of income. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 107  Otherintangibleassets Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks, licenses, software, capitalized development costs, the acquired order book and customer relationships. These assets are originally valued at historical costs, except for intangible assets acquired in a business combination which are valued at fair value at acquisition date. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisations and impairment losses, if any. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which typically do not exceed 10 years. Trademarks with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but they are tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment testing is described in detail in the section Impairments. Property,plantandequipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciations and impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected economic useful life of assets as follows: Buildings 5â€“40 years Machinery and equipment 3â€“10 years Land and water areas are not depreciated. The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted when necessary, at each balance sheet date. The cost of major renovations is included either in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be distinguished for ordinary maintenance and repair costs.   Gains and losses on sales of property, plant and equipment are included in the operating income. Financingcosts Financing costs are charged to the statement of income during the financial period in which they incur, with the exception that the borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as a part of the cost of the asset in question. Impairments The book values of non-current tangible and other intangible assets and that of other assets are reviewed for potential impairment at each date of financial position. Should any indication arise, the asset is tested for impairment. An impairment test determines the recoverable amount of an asset. The recoverable amount is the fair value less costs to sell or the higher cash flow-based value in use. If the recoverable amount of a single asset cannot be reliably determined, the impairment is considered at the level of cash generating unit (CGU), which is independent from the other units, and whose cash flows are separately identifiable and independent from cash flows of the other units.   An impairment loss is charged to the statement of income when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a significant change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, however, not to an extent higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised in prior years. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment when any indication of impairment exists, however, at least annually. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGU) of the company for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash generating units or group of units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which they arose, identified according to the operating segments. The testing of other intangible assets with indefinite useful life is either performed as part of a cash- generating unit or separately if the asset generates independent cash flows. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by value-in-use calculations. In assessing the recoverable amount, estimated future net cash flows are discounted to their present value based on the weighted average cost of capital prevailing in the company for the currency area, where the cash-generating unit can be considered to be located. The weighted average cost of capital reflects current market view of the time value of the money and risks relate to the unit to be tested. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill in the statement of income are not reversed. Leases,Cargotecasalessee Cargotec has rented property, plant and equipment. Lease agreements in which the lessor bears the ownership risks and rewards are classified as operating leases. Operating lease expenses are charged to the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the lease period. Lease agreements in which the Company has substantially all of ownership risks and rewards are classified as finance leases. Finance lease agreements are entered into the statement of financial position as assets and liabilities at the inception of the lease period at the lower of the fair value of the leased equipment or the estimated present value of the minimum lease payments. Assets acquired under finance lease agreements are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease period. Lease payments are allocated between repayment of the Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 108  lease liability and finance charge, so as to achieve a constant interest rate on outstanding balance. Lease obligations, net of finance charges, are included in interest-bearing liabilities. Leases,Cargotecasalessor Cargotec rents out container handling equipment under non-cancellable operating leases with varying terms and renewal rights. In operating leases the risks and rewards incident to ownership of an asset remain with the lessor. The leased asset is recognised in the statement of financial position according to the nature of the asset. Income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciation of the leased asset is consistent with the normal depreciation policy of similar assets. In a finance lease the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. The selling profit is recognised similarly to profit from an outright sale. Finance lease receivables are recognised in the statement of financial position at present value. The financial charge relating to the finance lease contract is recognised in the statement of income over the lease term so as to achieve a constant interest rate on outstanding balance. Customerfinance Trade finance arrangements are used in certain customer segments, distribution channels and geographical markets. In these arrangements the company is involved in arranging financing for the customer and/or the dealer with a financing partner. Trade finance contracts are classified as operating or finance lease contracts, hire purchase contracts or loans with similar features. Revenue recognition and balance sheet treatment of sales transactions that include end customer or dealer financing depend on the true nature of the transaction, i.e. how risks and rewards related to ownership are divided between the Company, the customer and the financing partner. Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or estimated net realisable value. Cost is primarily determined using the weighted average method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and a proportion of both indirect costs related to manufacturing and overheads. An allowance is recorded for obsolete items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Non-currentassetsheldforsale Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. Financialassetsandliabilities Financialassets Financial assets are classified as financial assets recorded at fair value through profit or loss, loans and other receivables, and financial assets available-for-sale. The classification of assets is done at the initial purchase and is determined by the aim of the asset. The assets with maturities under 12 months are included in the statement of financial position in current assets, and those with maturities over 12 months in non-current assets. The financial assets recorded at fair value through profit or loss category includes derivative instruments on which hedge accounting is not applied. The changes in fair value are recognised in the statement of income. Loans and other receivables are not quoted in the market and they are not kept for trading purposes. Loans receivable are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset are included in the initial recognised amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of income if the book value of the loan receivable is greater than the estimated recoverable amount. Accounts receivable are recorded at the original invoiced amount less an estimated valuation allowance for impairment. An allowance is recognised when there is objective evidence that Cargotec will not be able to collect all amounts due. The financial assets available-for-sale consist of shares not quoted in the market and are carried at cost, as the fair value of these assets cannot be measured reliably or the fair value would not significantly differ from the acquisition cost. If there is objective evidence that the fair value has decreased, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of income. Impairment on investments in shares cannot be reversed. Purchases and sales of derivative instruments are recognised on the trade date, while the settlement date is recognised for other financial asset categories.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 109  A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to cash flow from the asset expires, or are transferred, and when material risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to another party. Cashandcashequivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances, short term deposits with banks and other short term liquid investments with maturity up to three months. Bank overdrafts are included in other current liabilities. In the statement of cash flows bank overdrafts are deducted from cash and cash equivalents. Financialliabilities Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost, and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Liabilities with maturities under 12 months are included in the statement of financial position under current liabilities and those with maturities over 12 months under non-current liabilities. Financial liabilities recorded at fair value through profit or loss consist of derivative instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied. They are measured at fair value without the impact of possible transaction costs. Changes in fair value are recognised in the statement of income. Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost are initially recognised in current and non-current liabilities at fair value, net of any transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, the liabilities are valued at amortised cost. This category includes interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing payables. Interest and transaction costs are accrued and recorded in the statement of income over the period of the loan payable using the effective interest rate method. Derivativefinancialinstrumentsandhedgeaccounting Derivative instruments are initially recognised on the statement of financial position at cost, which equals the fair value, and are subsequently measured at fair value on each balance sheet date. Fair values of currency forward contracts are based on quoted market rates at the balance sheet date. The fair values of cross-currency and interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Derivative instruments with maturities over 12 months, are recorded in non-current assets and liabilities, and those with maturities under 12 months in current assets and liabilities. Hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 is applied to hedges of operative cash flows and hedges of cash flows associated with foreign currency denominated borrowings. To qualify for hedge accounting the Company documents the hedge relationship of the derivative instruments and the underlying items, the Company's risk management targets and the strategy of applying hedge accounting. When starting hedge accounting and at least in every interim closing, the Company documents and estimates the effectiveness of the hedge by measuring the ability of the hedging instrument to offset changes in fair value of the underlying cash flow. Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. However, for currency forwards only the exchange rate difference is deferred into fair value reserve and the fair value changes due to interest rate difference is recognised in the statement of income. Cumulative gain or loss on the hedge deferred to reserves is recognised in the statement of income as adjustment to the underlying cash flow when the underlying cash flow is recognised. If the underlying cash flow is no longer expected to materialise, the deferred gain or loss is immediately recognised in the statement of income. If the hedging instrument is sold, the contract is revoked or exercised or the relation of the hedging instrument and the underlying item is revoked, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is booked as a separate item in the fair value reserve and is recognised in the statement of income when the underlying operative item materialises. In effectiveness testing results in ineffectiveness, the ineffective portion of the hedges is recognised immediately in the  statement of income. Changes in the fair values of hedges, for which hedge accounting is not applied, are recognised in the statement of income, either in operative income and expenses, or financial income and expenses depending on the underlying exposure. Dividends The dividends proposed by the Board of Directors are not recognised in the financial statements until approved by the Cargotec Corporation's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Pensionobligations Cargotec operates various pension plans in accordance with local conditions and practices. The plans are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged directly to the statement of income in the year to which these contributions relate. Defined benefit plans are funded through payments to insurance companies or pension funds as determined by actuarial calculations. The liability of defined benefit pension plan is the present value of future obligations less the fair value of plan assets together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses together with Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 110  adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs. Pension costs assessed by annual actuarial calculations, are recognised in the statement of income over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees. The liability of a defined benefit pension plan is determined by the projected unit credit method. The yield of a high-quality bond issued by a corporation or a government is used as a discount factor in net present value calculations. Unrecognised actuarial gains or losses are booked in the statement of income over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees to the extent that they exceed the greater of 10 percent of the liability or 10 percent of the fair value of plan assets. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Provisions Provisions are recognised when Cargotec has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are accounted for using the best estimate for the costs required to settle the obligation on the balance sheet date. In case the time value of money is significant the provision is stated at present value. Provisions for warranties cover the estimated costs to repair or replace products still under warranty on the balance sheet date. Provision for warranty is calculated based on historical experience of levels of repairs and replacements. A provision is recorded for a loss-making contract when the necessary costs required to fulfil the commitment exceed the gain to be received from the contract. A restructuring provision is recorded when Cargotec has prepared a detailed restructuring plan and started the implementation of the plan or communicated the plan. A restructuring plan shall include the following information business which is affected, the main units and personnel affected by the restructuring, as well as the costs to be incurred and the timetable of the plan. Treasuryshares When the parent company or its subsidiaries purchase shares of Cargotec Corporation, the consideration paid and directly attributable costs are recognised as a deduction in equity. When such shares are sold, the consideration received, net of directly attributable transaction costs and income tax effect, is included in equity. Share-basedpayments Cargotec has share-based incentive plans which include an incentive paid as shares, options or in cash. The benefits granted in accordance with the incentive plan are valued at fair value at the granting date and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the earning period. The fair value of the equity settled incentive is the market value at the granting date. The fair value of the options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. These share- based payments are booked as an equity increase. The cash settlement is valued at fair value and recognised as a liability at each annual closing until the settlement of the liability. The expensed amount is based on the estimated future benefits at the end of the earning period. The non-market criteria, like profitability or increase in sales, are not included in the fair value of the benefit but taken into account when estimating the total benefits. The estimate is updated at every annual closing, changes in estimates are recorded through the statement of income. When the option rights are used for subscription of the shares, the consideration received, net of transaction costs, is credited to the reserve for invested unrestricted equity. Possible transaction costs are deducted from the consideration received. AdoptionofneworamendedIFRSstandardsandinterpretations In 2011, Cargotec will adopt the following new and amended standards and interpretations by the IASB: IAS 24 (revised): Related Party Disclosures. The revised standard simplifies the disclosure requirements for government-related entities and clarifies the definition of a related party. IAS 32 (amendment): Financial instruments: Presentation â€“ Classification of Rights Issues. The amendment addresses the accounting for rights issues (rights, options or warrants) that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer. IFRIC 19: Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments and IFRIC 14 (amendment) Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement. IASB published changes to 7 standards or interpretations as part of the Annual Improvements to IFRS's project in July 2010.* Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 111  The following standards, interpretations and amendments will be applied in 2012 or later: IFRS 9: Financial Assets â€“ Classification and Measurement*. The standard represents the first milestone in the IASB's planned replacement of IAS 39. It addresses classification and measurement of financial assets. The next steps involve reconsideration and re-exposure of the classification and measurement requirements for financial liabilities, impairment testing methods for financial assets, and development of enhanced guidance on hedge accounting. The standard will probably have an impact on accounting for financial assets in the company. IFRS 9: Financial Liabilities â€“ Classification and Measurement*. The second part of IFRS 9 was published in October 2010. It complements previously issued IFRS 9, Financial instruments' to include guidance on financial liabilities. The accounting and presentation for financial liabilities shall remain the same except for those financial liabilities for which fair value option is applied. IFRS 7 (amendment) Disclosures â€“ Transfers of Financial Assets*: The amendment adds disclosure requirements related to risk exposures derived from transferred assets. Additional disclosures, where financial assets have been derecognised but the entity is still exposed to certain risks and rewards associated with the transferred asset, are required. IAS 12 (Amendment) Deferred taxes*: Currently IAS 12 requires an entity to estimate, which part of the carrying value of an item measured at fair value is recovered through use (for example, rental income) and which part through sale (capital gain). The amendment introduces a rebuttable presumption that certain assets measured at fair value are recovered entirely by sale. Presumption applies to deferred tax arising from investment properties, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets that are measured using the fair value model or revaluation model. Management is assessing the impact of the above mentioned standards and interpretations on the consolidated financial statements.   * The mentioned standards, interpretations or amendments have not yet been endorsed in the EU.

Organization of responsibilities and principles of financial risk management, monitoring and reporting are defined in the Treasury Policy. Treasury Committee, appointed by the Board, is responsible for Treasury Policy compliance and for organising and monitoring treasury functions. Detailed guidelines for financing functions are defined in Treasury Instructions, approved by the Treasury Committee. The objective of treasury management is to secure sufficient funding for business operations, avoiding financial constraint at all times, to provide business units with financial services, to minimise the costs of financing, to manage financial risks (currency, interest rate, liquidity and funding, credit and operational risks) and to provide management with information on the financial position and risk exposures of Cargotec and its business units. Cargotec Treasury is responsible for funding at corporate level, for managing liquidity and financial risks, for providing efficient set up of financing operations and for monitoring business unit financial positions. Cargotec Treasury reports on these issues monthly to the Board of Directors. The business units are responsible for hedging their financial risks according to the Treasury Policy and instructions from Cargotec Treasury. Currency risk Cargotec operates in approximately 120 countries and is, due to global operations, exposed to risks arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. A significant proportion of Cargotec sales and costs are generated in foreign currencies, mostly in US dollars and Swedish krona. Cargotec also operates in countries in which hedging of currency risks is restricted, such as China and South Korea. The objective of currency risk management is to hedge operations against exchange rate fluctuations, thus allowing time for the business units to react and adapt to changes in exchange rates. Foreign currency positions, which include sales, purchases and financing related contractual cash flows, are fully hedged. Other highly probable cash flows may be hedged, if deemed necessary by corporate treasury and the business unit. The business units report their risk exposures to Cargotec Treasury and hedge the positions via corporate internal forward contracts. In countries, in which hedging is restricted, foreign currency denominated loans and deposits may be used as hedging instruments. Cargotec applies hedge accounting under IAS 39 to the majority of its hedges. A change in the fair value of a hedge future cash flow is recognised in the hedge reserve under equity until the cumulative profit or loss is recorded in the statement of income simultaneously with the underlying cash flow. Hedge accounting is not applied in cases where its impact on the consolidated statement of income is deemed insignificant by Cargotec Treasury. Cash flows of the USD 300 million Private Placement corporate bonds, funded in February 2007 and maturing in years 2014 to 2019, are converted into euro flows through long-term cross currency and interest rate swaps. Resulting from the hedging, Cargotec effectively holds EUR 225 million long-term fixed rate debt. Investments in non-euro-area subsidiaries cause translation differences, recorded in consolidated equity (translation risk). In addition to equity shares, Cargotec holds intracorporate loan contracts regarded as net investments. Exchange rate gains and losses arising from these loans are recorded as translation differences. On 31 December 2010, Swedish krona denominated net investment loans totalled EUR 862 (31 Dec 2009: 740) million and Norwegian krona denominated net investment loans EUR 68 (31 Dec 2009: 62) million. The objective of managing the translation position is to hedge the capital structure so as to balance the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on debt and equity. The capital structures of foreign subsidiaries may be hedged through cross currency and interest rate swaps or foreign currency denominated debt instruments. For the moment, no hedging requirements have emerged due to the capital structure. Sensitivity analysis, in accordance with IFRS 7, aims to represent the sensitivity of the consolidated income and equity with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The statement of income sensitivity is due to foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position, the hedges assigned to the statement of financial position items and the hedges to which hedge accounting is not applied, i.e. to which changes in fair values are recognised through profit or loss. The sensitivity of equity arises from hedges under hedge accounting, as exchange rate differences are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in other comprehensive income. A foreign exchange rate impact on the hedge reserve is expected to be offset by the corresponding impact on the underlying cash flow and the statement of income as the cash flows materialise. Majority of the hedges and underlying cash flows mature within 2 years, except for the interest flows of the US dollar denominated corporate bonds, and their respective hedges, which materialise within 9 years. If the US dollar had strengthened/weakened 10 percent against the euro, the effect on the pre-tax profit would have been EUR 1.3 million negative/positive (31 Dec 2009: 1.3 positive/negative), and on other comprehensive income Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 115  EUR 13.2 million negative/positive (31 Dec 2009: 2.7 positive/negative). If the Swedish krona had strengthened/weakened 10 percent against the euro, the effect on the pre-tax profit would have been EUR 0.2 (31 Dec 2009: 1.6) million negative/positive, and on other comprehensive income EUR 30.3 (31 Dec 2009: 33.2) million positive/negative including financial instruments as defined in IFRS 7, or EUR 116.5 (31 Dec 2009: 107.2) million positive/negative including also corporate internal loans contracts regarded as net investment, for which the exchange rate differences are recognised in translation differences.   If the Swedish krona had strengthened/weakened 10 percent against the US dollar, the effect on the pre-tax profit would have been EUR 0.3 million positive/negative (31 Dec 2009: 0.3 negative/positive), and on other comprehensive income EUR 29.8  (31 Dec 2009: 20.4) million positive/negative.   Interest rate risk Fluctuations in market interest rates have an effect on consolidated interest outflows and the fair values of interest- bearing receivables, loans payable and derivative instruments. The objective of interest rate risk management is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on the statement of income, statement of financial position and statement of cash flows, also taking account of the market value of net debt. To manage the interest rate risk, the duration of the financial portfolio is maintained within the limits set by the Treasury Committee, by balancing between fixed and floating rate debt and by derivative instruments. On 31 December 2009, Cargotec consolidated interest-bearing debt totalled EUR 500.3 (31 Dec 2009: 594.3) million, of which EUR 246.2 (31 Dec 2009: 307.6) million consisted of fixed rate corporate bonds, EUR 99.9 (31 Dec 2009: 99.9) million of other long term fixed rate loans, EUR 2.4 (31 Dec 2009: 5.7) million of finance lease liabilities and rest, EUR 151.7 (31 Dec 2009: 181.1) million of floating rate loans, short term loans and bank overdrafts. On 31 December 2010, the average duration of interest-bearing debt, excluding bank overdrafts, was 38 (31 Dec 2009: 42) months. The EUR 330.3 (31 Dec 2009: 277.0) million investment portfolio consisted mainly of short term deposits and bank account balances. Interest-bearing loan receivables totalled EUR 12.7 (31 Dec 2009: 10.4) million. The average duration of the deposits was one month (31 Dec 2009: less than one month), and that of the loan receivables 8 (31 Dec 2009: 15) months. Following the sensitivity analysis in accordance with IFRS 7, per one percentage point increase/decrease in interest rates the effect on consolidated interest would be EUR 0.5 million positive/negative (31 Dec 2009: EUR 0.4  million negative/positive). The statement of income sensitivity is due to variable rate loans, bank account balances and bank overdrafts. During 2010 Cargotec started to recognise fair value changes of all currency forward contracts due to interest component immediately in financial income and expenses; hence changes in market rates may affect financial result also via currency hedging. In sensitivity analysis, these effects are not accounted for, since the effect of one percent change in interest levels is not significant, assuming similar change in all currency pairs and that current currency position remains.

The business units are responsible for identifying these risks and determining the required hedging measures. These risks are managed by thorough supplier selection process and long-term relationships with strategic suppliers. Liquidity and funding risks Liquidity risk is managed by retaining long-term liquidity reserves and by exceeding short term liquidity requirements. On 31 December 2010, the liquidity reserves, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term unused credit facilities, totalled EUR 903 (31 Dec 2009: 852) million. Short term liquidity requirements include the repayments of short and long term debt within the next 12 months, as well as strategic liquidity requirement, defined by the Treasury Committee, which covers the operative funding demand within the following 12 months. On 31 December 2010, repayments of short and long term interest-bearing liabilities due in the following 12 months totalled EUR 82.3 (31 Dec 2009: 68.9) million.   On 31 December 2010, the committed unused long-term credit facilities, included in liquidity reserves, totalled EUR 585 (31 Dec 2009: 585) million, of which EUR 535 million matures in the year 2012 and EUR 50 million in 2013. According to the facility agreements, Cargotec has a right to withdraw funds on 3 days notice on agreed terms. Additionally, to fulfil short-term cash management requirements, Cargotec has available short term bank overdraft facilities of EUR 181 (31 Dec 2009: 188) million and a EUR 150 million Commercial Paper facility, which was unused in 2010 and 2009. Funding risk is defined as risk of an untenably high proportion of loans or credit facilities maturing at a time when refunding is not economically or contractually feasible. The risk is minimised by balancing the repayment schedules of loans and credit facilities, as well as retaining flexible credit facility agreements. Cargotec loan agreements include a covenant restricting the corporate capital structure. According to the covenant, Cargotec gearing must be retained below 125 per cent. On 31 December 2010 gearing was 16.0 (31 Dec 2009: 38.0) per cent. According to management assessment, Cargotec is in a good position regarding liquidity and there are no significant concentrations of risks relating to refunding.

Credit and counterparty risks The business units are responsible for managing the operational credit risks. On account of the diverse and global clientele, Cargotec is not exposed to significant credit risk concentrations. Credit risks are managed through contractual clauses including advance payments, bank guarantees or other guarantees. Risks of default or fraud are controlled by monitoring the creditworthiness of customers. Credit risks relating to major contracts are shared with financial institutions, insurance companies or export guarantee boards, when feasible. More information on trade receivables is presented in Note 23, Accounts receivable and other non-interest-bearing receivables. Cargotec holds no significant amounts of external loan receivables. Deposits of liquidity reserves and trading in financial instruments are only accepted with counterparties confirmed by the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee examines counterparties and sets counterparty limits based on their solvency and creditworthiness. Cargotec Treasury actively reviews counterparty risks and may reject a counterparty on immediate notice. During 2010, only Cargotec main relationship banks were accepted as counterparties. The maximum risk relating to investments corresponds to their carrying amount. However, according to the management assessment no credit losses are anticipated on the investments of liquidity reserves. Operational risks of the treasury functions The management of operational risks aims to eliminate losses or increased risk levels due to errors in procedures or insufficient monitoring. The risks are minimised by maintaining a high level of proficiency, identifying and documenting Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 118  routine procedures and organising responsibilities.   Risks relating to transactions are minimised by conducting regular general assessments and monitoring trading limits, market valuations and daily trade confirmations. Capital structure management The goal of Cargotec capital structure management is to secure operational preconditions at all times and to maintain the optimum capital cost structure. The target capital structure is determined by Shareholders and is regularly monitored by the Board of Directors. Total capital is calculated as the sum of equity and net debt. Gearing, calculated as the ratio of net debt to equity, is the key figure monitored for capital structure management. Net debt is calculated as net of interest-bearing liabilities and assets, including cash and cash equivalents. Cargotec long-term target is to retain gearing below 50 percent. The elements of gearing are presented in the table below.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions 2010 In October, Cargotec acquired a 10 percent minority holding in a Singaporean MacGREGOR Plimsoll (Tianjin) Pte Ltd. Subsequent to this transaction, Cargotec owns all shares in the company. In July, Cargotec acquired a 10 percent minority holding in a Norwegian MacGREGOR Hydramarine AS. Subsequent to this transaction, Cargotec owns all shares in the company. In March, Cargotec signed a letter of intent to acquire the remaining 25 percent minority share holding in MacGREGOR-Kayaba Ltd in Japan. The transaction was closed in May, and subsequent the transaction, Cargotec owns all the shares in the company. The business combination of Socit Maghrebic S.A:n and Arne Holst & Co A/S were accounted as preliminary at the end of 2009, as the determination of fair values was unfinished. The accounting of these acquisitions was finalised in 2010. This had no impact on the previous year's figures. Disposals 2010 In January, Cargotec has sold its US-based hydraulic cylinders manufacturing business Waltco Hydraulics to Ligon Industries, LLC. This transaction had no material impact on Cargotec's result or cash flow. Acquisitions 2009 In 2009, Cargotec completed two acquisitions. In December, Cargotec acquired the port service and equipment related part of Moroccan Socit Maghrepic S.A.'s business operations. Maghrepic has been Cargotec's dealer representative in Morocco and has a long experience as a service and spare parts provider. According to the deal, Cargotec employed 44 persons, most of whom are service technicians. In August, Cargotec acquired the assets of a Danish sales and services company Arne Holst & Co. A/S. This acquisition included the takeover of business assets and customer contacts as well as the transfer of four employees to Cargotec. In addition, Cargotec acquired an 18 percent minority holding in Kalmar Espaa S.A. and 20 percent minority holdings in Italian Officine Cargotec Ferrari Genova S.r.l and Officine Cargotec Ferrari Prato S.r.l. as well as in Australian Hiab Australia Pty Ltd. Subsequent to these transactions, Cargotec owns all shares in the companies. In 2009, Hiab established a small joint-venture focusing on the environmental segment in China. The transaction price of the acquisitions completed in 2009 amounted to EUR 7.2 million and the related goodwill in Cargotec's balance sheet to EUR 3.1 million. Goodwill amounting to EUR 2.2 million is related to the acquisition of the minority interests. Management estimates that the consolidated sales for 2009 would have been EUR 2,588 million if the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2009. The business combinations of Socit Maghrepic S.A. and Arne Holst & Co. A/S were accounted as preliminary as the determination of fair values to be assigned to the assets, liabilites and contingent liabilities was yet not finalised. The business combinations of Equipos y Servicios Terminales y Puertos SRL, CVS Technoports S.r.l. and CVS Service S.r.l. were accounted as preliminary at the end of 2008, as the determination of fair values was unfinished. The accounting of these acquisitions was finalised in 2009. This had no impact on the previous year's figures. Disposals 2009 In November, Cargotec agreed on the termination of the 2006 signed cooperation agreement with the Chinese company Goodway. The cooperation agreement will be terminated in early 2010. In October, Cargotec agreed to transfer its off-road forestry cranes business to the Finnish Mesera Salo Oy. The transfer agreement also included stationary mounted off-road crane models. As part of the deal, some key employees in the off-road crane business transferred to Mesera. The real estate related to the business and located in Salo, Finland, was sold to the Finnish Rakennus-Jrvi Oy in December. These transactions had no material impact on Cargotec's result or cash flow. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the effect of all potential dilutive shares. The options have a diluting effect, when the exercise price with an option is lower than the market value of the company share. The diluting effect is the number of shares that the company has to issue gratuitously because the received funds from the exercised options do not cover the fair value of the shares. The fair value of the companys share is determined as the average market price of the shares during period. The option programme 2010 does not have dillutive effect to earnings per share for year 2010. Further information on the option programme is available in Note 27, Share-based payments. 1Jan31Dec2010 1Jan31Dec2009 Net income attributable to the equity holders of the company, MEUR 74.2 3.1 Weighted average number of shares during financial period, ('000) 61,345 61,338 Basicearningspershare,EUR 1.21 0.05 1Jan31Dec2010 1Jan31Dec2009 Net income attributable to the equity holders of the company, MEUR 74.2 3.1 Weighted average number of shares during financial period, ('000) 61,345 61,338 Effect of share options, ('000) - - Diluted weighted average number of shares during financial period, ('000) 61,345 61,338 Dilutedearningspershare,EUR 1.21 0.05 Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report.

Impairment testing of goodwill MEUR 31Dec2010 31Dec2009 Industrial and Terminal 456.3 422.5 Marine 292.6 267.1 Total 748.9 689.6 Goodwill is impairment tested always when there is an indication that the current value may be impaired, or at least annually. Impairment testing of goodwill is carried out by allocating goodwill to the lowest level which generates independent cash flows. These levels have been identified according to the operative business organisation to be reporting segments. Due to the way the reporting segments are managed and organised, it is not possible to define independent cash flows for lower level product line divisions. Following the reorganisation of the operations, Hiab and Kalmar, which were impairment tested separately in 2009, have been merged into Industrial & Terminal segment. Operational integration of Offshore business into Marine has been finalised during 2010 and thus Offshore goodwill is no longer tested separately but is included to Marine goodwill. The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (CGU) are determined on the basis of value-in-use calculations. Cash flow projections cover 5 years, of which the last year is used to define the terminal value. The cash flow projections are based on next year's budget and the following three years' strategic forecasts approved by the Board of Directors and top management. The fifth year is added to the forecast period by extrapolating it on the basis of average development in the past and during the forecasted planning horizon, taking into account the cyclical nature of the CGU's business. Cash flows beyond the forecast period are projected by using a 2 percent long-term growth rate, which does not exceed the forecasted long-term growth rate of the CGUs. The key assumptions made by management in the projections relate to market and profitability outlooks. When estimating future growth, information available by external market research institutions on market development and timing of business cycles is used. Additionally, past performance, market share and growth potental in the market have been taken into account when defining sales growth. Keyfactors affecting profitability are sales volume, competitiveness and cost efficiency. The better average profitability of service business means that its relative share of sales also has an impact on profitability. Additionally in Industrial &Terminal segment the utilisation rate of factories and their cost competitiveness has a significant impact on profitability. When estimating profitability the significant restructuring measures implemented during 20082010 have been taken into account. Cash flow projections also reflect Industrial & Terminal's working capital build-up in upturns and release during downturns. Marine's business model ties very limited working capital, but timing of orders and related advances received have been taking into account in cash flow projections. The discount rate used in the impairment testing is weighted average pre-tax cost of capital (WACC) defined for each segment. The discount rate reflects the total cost of equity and debt and the market risks related to the segment. The WACC components are risk-free rate, market risk premium, comparable peer industry beta, gearing and credit spread. The discount rate used in 2010 impairment tests has been defined in the same way as for 2009. The increase in credit spreads was compensated by a decrease in risk free interest rate. The pre-tax discount rate (WACC) used for Industrial & Terminal is 10,1 (2009: 9,8 for Hiab and 10,8 for Kalmar) percent and for Marine 9,5 (2009: 9,7) percent. As a result of the impairment tests no impairment loss has been recognised in 2010 nor in 2009. Sensitivity analyses of the key assumptions have been prepared as part of the impairment testing process for each CGU separately. The key variables in the calculations are discount rate, sales, operating profit margin and a combined effect of all these. A summary of the assumptions and the effect of changes in are presented in the table below. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report.

You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 150  27.Share-basedpayments Share-basedincentiveprogramme2007-2010 In January 2007 Cargotec published a share-based incentive programme for the key management for the period 20072011 covering approximately 60 persons. The first earnings period lasted two years (2007â€“2008) and the following three periods one year each. In March 2009 a reward was paid for the achievement of the targets in earnings period 20072008. The criteria set for the second earnings period (2009) was not met and the remaining earnings periods (2010 and 2011) were cancelled. According to the program the reward for the first earnings period was paid in both class B shares and cash. The cash payment covered taxes and tax-related payments resulting from the reward. The reward was based on the achievement of sales and operating profit targets for the earnings period. A total of 31,356 class B shares of the maximum 135,825 shares were rewarded for the achievement of the targets. The maximum amount of class B shares originally reserved for the programme was 387,500. A prohibition applied to shares distributed as reward, on handing over or selling the shares within one year of the end of the earnings period in question. The shares were also lost if the holder left the company before the prohibition period ended and a total of 118 shares were returned to the company by the end of 2009. The share price at the grant date was EUR 45.14. Share-basedincentiveprogramme2010 In March 2010, the Board of Directors decided to establish a new share-based incentive programme for the executives of the company. The programme includes three earnings periods, each of them lasting three calendar years, and they commence in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The Board of Directors will decide on the target group, earnings criteria and on targets to be established for them, as well as on the maximum amount of the payable reward for each earnings period and for each participant. The potential payment will be paid in 2013, 2014 and 2015 partly in Cargotec's class B shares and partly in cash. A maximum total of 150,000 class B shares and a cash payment for taxes and tax-related costs arising from the rewards shall be given as reward on the basis of the entire Programme. The amount of cash payment shall correspond to the registration date value of the shares to be given, in the maximum. The reward from the programme shall be paid to the executives as a combination of shares and a cash payment after the end of an earning period, by the end of April. If the employment terminates before the share payment, the participant will lose the right to the share reward. Additionally a prohibition applies to shares distributed as reward, on handing over or selling the shares within two years after the end of an earning period in question. The shares are also lost if the holder leaves the company before the prohibition period ends. The target group fot the first earnings period covers the twelve members of Cargotec's Executive Board. Earnings criteria for the earnings period 2010â€“2012 are Cargotec's operating profit margin and sales of the fiscal year 2012. The reward to be paid on the basis of the earnings period 2010â€“2012 will correspond to a maximum total of 50,000 Cargotec class B shares, of which 47,000 have been granted by the end of the financial period 2010. The fair value of the share at the grant date 9 March 2010 was determined to EUR 18.15. As the option holder is not entitled to receive dividend payments during the earnings period, expected dividends have been deducted from the grant date share value when determining the fair value. Share value at grant date was EUR 21.27. Fair value of the cash payment is estimated at each closing date until the end of the earnings period and thus the fair value of the liability will change according to the changes in Cargotec's class B share value. Optionprogramme2010 The Annual General Meeting of 5 March 2010 confirmed that stock options will be issued to the key personnel of Cargotec and its subsidiaries as part of Cargotec's incentive and commitment system. Option rights are given free of charge. The maximum total number of stock options issued will be 1,200,000, and they entitle to subscribe for a maximum total of 1,200,000 new series B shares in Cargotec or existing series B shares held by Cargotec. Cargotec shall, prior to the beginning of the share subscription period, announce whether the subscription right is directed at a new share or an existing share. Of the stock options, 400,000 are marked with the symbol 2010A, 400,000 are marked with the symbol 2010B and 400,000 are marked with the symbol 2010C. The Board of Directors will decide on the option issuance on an annual basis, in the spring of the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The beginning of the share subscription period requires attainment of targets established for a performance criterion determined by the Board of Directors annually. Those stock options, for which the targets have not been attained, will expire. Continued employment at the Cargotec Corporation is a basic requirement of participating in the option plan. If the employment terminates before the share subscription period has begun, the participant will lose the right to the options. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 151  The share subscription period with the option rights is: - for stock option 2010A 1 April 201330 April 2015 - for stock option 2010B 1 April 201430 April 2016 - for stock option 2010C 1 April 201530 April 2017. The share subscription price with the stcok options is: - for stock option 2010A, the trade volume weighted average quotation of the share on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd. during 8 March19 March 2010 (EUR 21.35) - for stock option 2010B, the trade volume weighted average quotation of the share on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd. during two full weeks following Cargotecs Annual General Meeting in 2011 - for stock option 2010C, the trade volume weighted average quotation of the share on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd. during two full weeks following Cargotecs Annual General Meeting in 2012 From the share subscription price of the stock options, shall be deducted the amount of the dividend or the amount of the distributable unrestricted equity decided after the beginning of the period for determination of the share subscription price but before share subscription, as per the dividend record date or the record date of the repayment of equity. In the spring of 2010, 2010A option rights were issued to 54 persons, including the members of Cargotec's Executive Board. With the 2010A option right, the original share subscription price is EUR 21.35 per share. The annual dividends paid will be deducted from the subscription price. The 2010A option rights entitle their holders to subscribe for a total of 400,000 class B shares of Cargotec, either new or treasury shares held by the company. At the financial period closing date 31 Dec 2010, the number of granted stock options rights was 359,500. Cargotec's Board of Directors decided that if the company's operating profit for 2010 remains below EUR 100 million, the share subscription period for the 2010A option rights will not commence. If the operating profit equals or exceeds EUR 100 million but remains below EUR 120 million, the share subscription period will commence so that half of the 2010A option rights may be exercised. If the operating profit for the financial year 2010 equals or exceeds EUR 120 million, the share subscription period will commence and apply to all 2010A option rights. The operating profit target for 2010 having been fullfilled, share subscription will begin in April 2013 covering all 2010A stock options issued, as per programme terms and conditions. The fair value of the option right has been determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value for 2010A option right was determined to EUR 8.82. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value for the option rights granted in financial period 2010 are listed in the table below: 2010 Class B share value at grant, EUR 20.34 Subscription price, EUR 21.35 Expected volatility, % 48.4 Vesting period, years 5.12 Riskt-free interest rate, % 2.12 Expected dividends, EUR - Fair value of the option, EUR 8.82 Expected volatility, % 7.0 Optionrights2005Aand2005B Share subscription period with 2005A option rights ended on 31 March 2008 and with 2005B option rights on 31 March 2009. During the subscription period 216,555 Cargotec's class B shares were subscribed with 2005A option rights and 333,570 shares with 2005B option rights. The unused option rights were expired and they were removed from the holders' securities account. The weighted average share price at the dates of exercise of share options in financial period 2009 was EUR 7.27.

Accounting principles for the parent company financial statements Basis of preparation Cargotec Corporation financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS). Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables outstanding at the end of the financial period are revalued at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Exchange rate gains/losses relating to operations are treated as adjustments to sales and costs. Exchange rate gains/losses associated with financial instruments are included in financing income and expenses. Revenue recognition Sales include primarily intra-group service charges. The sale is recognised, when the services have been rendered. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities, due to temporary differences between the financial statements and tax accounting, are calculated using the future period's tax rate valid at the closing date. Total deferred tax liability is included in the balance sheet and deferred tax assets as estimated probable asset value. Tax expense in the income statement consists of the taxes based on taxable income for the period. Intangible and tangible assets, depreciation and amortisation Intangible and tangible assets are stated at cost less impairment losses and accumulated depreciation and amortisation. Depreciation and amortisation are determined based on expected useful economic life as follows: Intangible rights 3â€“10 years Other capitalised expenditure 5â€“6 years Buildings 25 years Machinery and equipment 3â€“5 years Derivative instruments Derivative instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost, which equals the fair value, and subsequently measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of forward contracts are based on quoted market rates at the balance sheet date. The fair values of cross-currency swaps are calculated as present value of estimated future cash flows. Derivative instruments maturing after 12 months are included in non-current assets and liabilities. Other derivative instruments are included in current assets and liabilities. Hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 is applied to hedges of cash flows associated with foreign currency- denominated borrowings. To qualify for hedge accounting the company documents the hedge relationship of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item, the company's risk management targets and the strategy of applying hedge accounting. When starting hedge accounting and at least in every interim closing, the company documents and estimates the effectiveness of the hedge by measuring the ability of the hedging instrument to offset changes in fair value of the underlying asset or cash flow. Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognised in equity in fair value reserve. Ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Cumulative gain or loss on the hedge deferred to equity is recognised in the income statement as adjustment to the underlying cash flow when the underlying cash flow is recognised. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments relating to operative items that no longer are expected to materialise are recognised immediately in the income statement in other operating expenses. If the hedging instrument is sold, the contract is revoked or exercised or the relation of the hedging instrument and the underlying item is revoked, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is booked as a separate item in the equity and is recognised in the income statement when the underlying operative item materialises. Changes in the fair values of hedges, for which hedge accounting is not applied, are recognised in the income statement, either in operative income and expenses, or financial income and expenses, depending on the underlying exposure. Changes in all forward contract fair values due to interest rate changes are recognised in financial income and expenses. Cargotec's annual report 2010 This page is generated from Cargotec's online annual report. You can find the complete report at www.cargotec.com/annualreport 174  Equity Equity consists of share capital, share premium account, fair value reserves and retained earnings, deducted by dividends paid. The amount exceeding the accounting par value of shares received by the company in connection with share subscriptions was recorded in share premium account under the old Limited Liability Companies Act (29 Sep 1978/734). Fair value reserves consist of the cumulative change in the fair value of the derivative instruments defined as cash flow hedges. The net income for the period and changes in treasury shares are recorded in retained earnings. Restatement of previous accounting period information Previous accounting period presentation format has been changed to correspond to this accounting period's presentation format. Items in income statement and balance sheet have been merged in order to clarify the presentation of figures. Merged items have been specified in the notes.

The programme aims to ensure alignment of the objectives of shareholders and executives in order to increase the value of Cargotec, while committing the executives to the company, and offering them a competitive incentive programme based on ownership in the company. The programme includes three earnings period, each of them lasting three calendar years, and they commence in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The Board of Directors will decide on the earnings criteria and on targets to be established for them, as well as the maximum amount of the payable reward for each earnings period. The target group of the first earnings period is Cargotec Executive Board members and the earnings criteria are Cargotecs operating profit margin and sales of the fiscal year 2012. The potential reward will be paid partly as Cargotecs class B shares and partly in cash in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The proportion to be paid in cash is intended to cover taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward. The rewards to be paid on the basis of the earning period 2010â€“2012 will correspond to the approximate value of a maximum total of 100,000 Cargotec class B shares (including also the proportion to be paid in cash). The remaining earning periods 2010 and 2011 of the former share-based incentive programme 2007â€“2011 were not commenced as the new programme replacing the current programme was implemented as from the beginning of 2010. On the basis of the former programme, a total of 31,356 class B shares were paid as reward to key personnel for the first earning period 2007â€“2008. No rewards were paid for the second earning period 2009 as the targets established for the earnings criteria were not attained.

The financial statements comprise the consolidated statement of financial position, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, as well as the parent company's balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and notes to the financial statements. Responsibility of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, as well as for the preparation of financial statements and the report of the Board of Directors that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of the financial statements and the report of the Board of Directors in Finland. The Board of Directors is responsible for the appropriate arrangement of the control of the company's accounts and finances, and the Managing Director shall see to it that the accounts of the company are in compliance with the law and that its financial affairs have been arranged in a reliable manner. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements, on the consolidated financial statements and on the report of the Board of Directors based on our audit. The Auditing Act requires that we comply with the requirements of professional ethics. We conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Good auditing practice requires that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and the report of the Board of Directors are free from material misstatement, and whether the members of the Board of Directors of the parent company and the Managing Director are guilty of an act or negligence which may result in liability in damages towards the company or whether they have violated the Limited Liability Companies Act or the articles of association of the company. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the report of the Board of Directors. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of financial statements and report of the Board of Directors that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and the report of the Board of Directors. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU.
