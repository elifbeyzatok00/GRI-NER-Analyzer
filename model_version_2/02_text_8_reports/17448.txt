The electronic edition has saved approximately 102,18 tons of paper, with an estimated reduction of  the environmental impact of 1,737.2 trees and 1,737.2 tons of CO2.    2 Letter from  the Chairman   3 Gamesas transformed  mission is the  key driving force to  provide a response to a  very rapidly  changing global  scenario, which new and  more demanding con- sumers are joining every  day in a variety of mar- kets having  different needs that  demand more  competitive energy for  their own development Letter from the Chairman Dear friends, Gamesa construes sustainability as a business impe- rative and links responsible behavior to benefits that  result in greater competitiveness. The purpose of our  work lies in creating value, gaining access to a larger  number of customers and markets, innovating and  offering new and better products and services, along  with incorporating sustainability into our opera- tions, products and supply chain through the proper  management of regulatory, operating and reputation- related risks.  Gamesas transformed mission, to which quite a  few references can be found in this report, is the key  driving force to provide a response to a very rapidly  changing global scenario, which new and more de- manding consumers are joining every day in a variety  of markets having different needs that demand  more competitive energy for their own development.  Local, inexhaustible, clean and safe energy provides  a response to the global increase in demand and the  constant onslaught of climate change. Gamesa ended the year by meeting forecasts in terms  of volume, profitability and financial strength. It also  maintained profitable growth due to its globaliza- tion strategy – which enables us to take advantage  of the growth in emerging markets and to diversify  market risks – and a rigorous efficiency program that  allowed us to post double-digit improvements in our  main operating figures and maintain margins despite  operating in a complex macroeconomic and industry  environment in highly competitive markets. In 2011,  Gamesas consolidated sales totaled 3.033 billion  (+10%). EBIT amounted to 131 million (+10%) and net  profit rose to reach 51 million (+2%).  During the year, we also made advances along the  three vectors upon which our business plan is based:  	the Cost of Energy was reduced by 10% -15%, depen- ding on the platforms and regions, by launching new  products and services;  	despite the complex economic situation we are  facing, the company grew with a 16.5% increase in the  MW sold in 23 countries to 46 customers, broke into  new markets and increased its portfolio of MW under  maintenance and wind farm sales; and 	became more efficient by adjusting production ca- pacity to demand, increasing localization of the supply  chain in new markets and optimizing construction and  logistics costs.  Our investments in R&D, which amounted to 117 mi- llion in 2011, along with the opening of new technology  centers, continue to be geared at the development of  new product families in order to continue reducing the  Cost of Energy, while making a contribution to caring  for our environment. All of this was achieved without  putting a stop to innovation: the Gamesa G10X-4.5  MW platform has continually beaten records since its  recent launch. This is not only because it provides the  greatest amount of power in the onshore wind power  market or because its technological developments are  allowing us to launch other platforms more quickly, but  also because it is the first eco-designed wind turbine  in the world. These circumstances not only place us at  the cutting edge of wind turbine design and develop- ment, they are also a good showcase for the companys  business philosophy.  The Gamesa Sustainability Report for 2011 brings us a  little closer to our approach and ways of dealing with  topics like corporate governance, reporting transpa- rency, environmental and social aspects, as well as our  relationships and ways of communicating with our  main stakeholders. It also highlights our interest in  measuring, analyzing and having the necessary tools  to improve. In the environmental area, for instance, the more than  24,000 MW we have installed over the course of our  history today allow us to prevent the emission of more  than 36 million tons of CO2 per year, a figure which is  equivalent to offsetting the annual CO2 emissions of 12  million vehicles. This capacity to generate electricity    4 This corporate culture  constitutes  a differentiating  management element  which should underlie  an organization geared  for success in a  working environment  characterized by high  performance and  ethical behavior Letter from the Chairman would be sufficient to cover the annual consumption of  17 million families, a key contribution to the reduction  of greenhouse gases, thereby mitigating climate chan- ge and creating a more sustainable future.  The existence of environmental management systems  likewise ensures our behavior is suitable in this area.  We presently maintain complete environmental  management system coverage in accordance with the  ISO 14001 standard at our production centers in Europe,  the United States, China and India and have initiated  the implementation of energy efficiency management  systems in accordance with the ISO 16001 standard.  From a social standpoint, Gamesa continued to provide  quality jobs to 8,357 people around the world in 2011  (+15% compared to 2010), without giving up any of its  management priorities. Safeguarding our professio- nals physical integrity and health constitutes one of  these priorities. The constant reduction in the accident  frequency and severity rates (by 22% and 43% respec- tively over the last three years) or the fact that such  rates form part of the ratios used to measure target  management for many Gamesa personnel are a good  example of the two-fold relationship between sustai- nability and production activities in our company. Our  recruitment, development and talent management pro- cesses are governed by the principles of equality, merit  and capacity, and always respect the principle of equa- lity between men and women. Through our Corporate  University, we have provided intense training activities,  and talent management has become a key element for  professional development and employability.  We have also performed intense awareness raising  activities within the organization on our values and  attitudes for success. Respect, teamwork, sustainabi- lity, excellence and innovation constitute the essential  values of reference behind the conduct of a global  organization with a vocation for leadership and driven  by customer needs. This corporate culture – shared in  over 300 work sessions at which practically the entire  workforce took part – constitutes a differentiating  management element which should underlie an orga- nization geared for success in a working environment  characterized by high performance and ethical behavior,  as well as the greatest motivation to develop the pro- fessional capacity of our people.  Respect for human rights and public freedoms, the  application of the United Nations Global Compacts  contents, the natural environments preservation,  collaborating in the development and well-being of  the communities with which we have established a  relationship and respect for international standards on  fundamental rights and freedoms are also firm under- takings made by Gamesa.  This report highlights our rigorous management of  environmental, social and governance risks and op- portunities, which has additionally been recognized by  some of the most prestigious sustainability indexes like  the FTSE4Good or Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes,  in which we have appeared continuously over the last  five years. I hope that this Sustainability Report 2011, which Ga- mesa places at the disposal of its stakeholders for the  eighth consecutive year in accordance with the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines version G3, is of  interest, not only because it reflects a balanced view of  our economic, social and environmental performance,  but also, and more importantly, because it contains our  vision and stance on the main factors that will determi- ne our companys development in the near future.

Gamesa's sustainability impacts   7 New global scenarios The world we know is undergoing a rapid tho- roughgoing transformation. From the standpoint of its  mission to provide technology solutions which allow  clean everlasting energy to be produced anywhere, Ga- mesa recognizes and analyzes the great challenges we  are facing. The role Gamesa can play in this new model  of society is based on the need for leading the debate  on changing the energy model towards a competitive  low-carbon economy, thereby reducing the uncertain- ties surrounding future energy solutions and increasing  the credibility of renewable energy sources.  Social changes:  Over the last few decades, a significant advance has  been detected in welfare indicators, such as: life expec- tancy, reduction in poverty, energy consumption, inco- me, health, access to basic services, etc. At the same  time, a global trend of steady growth in the population  has been detected (7 billion in 2011), especially in Asia,  accompanied by a greater concentration of the popu- lation in urban areas, including the incorporation of  developing middle classes, which incentivize greater per  capita consumption, principally in emerging countries. A long-term view (over the next 40 years) therefore  suggests that this growth will bring with it millions of  new and more demanding consumers, who will need  access to the most basic services, more infrastructures  and particularly, a greater amount of more competitive  energy. Along with this growth, a change is expected in the ba- lance of power between the new communities and the  companies which operate in them. Even today, a license  to operate depends on the contribution such companies  make to consolidating the societies comprised by these  increasingly prosperous middle classes. 01     Urban and Rural Population by Regional Development  (millions) Concentration of the Population in Urban Areas  (millions) Source: United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs,  Population Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities   8 Wind energy  has thus become  a strategic element  which has evolved  at a steady rate of  growth to reach  238 installed GW  in the world in 2011 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities Environmental changes:  The scarcity of resources in the planet and potential  changes in the climate will, however, limit the capacity  of around 9 billion inhabitants in 2050 reaching or  maintaining a level of consumption in keeping with  the wealth generated by todays developed markets.  Greenhouse gases will continue increasing as the  population and energy needs increase to reach a figure  approaching 60 gigatons of CO2 eq in 2030. Some cou- ntries like Australia, China, India, Poland or South Africa  still generate between 68% and 94% of their electricity  and heat by burning coal. Two-thirds of global CO2 emissions are generated by  ten countries, mainly China and the United States,  which produced 12 Gt CO2, accounting for 41% of global  emissions in 2011. More specifically, according to OECD  forecasts, it is expected that primary energy consump- tion in Brazil, Russia, India and China together will grow  by 72% between 2005 and 2030, compared to 29% in  the thirty countries which make up the OECD. Green- house gas emissions from only these four countries  will increase 46% by 2030, exceeding the levels of the  thirty OECD countries combined. According to this scenario, the global concentration  of CO2 is expected to reach 530 ppm of CO2 eq in the  middle of the century and 780 ppm of CO2 eq in 2100.  As a result, the average global temperature will rise  between 2.0C and 2.8C in the middle of the century  and between 3.7C and 5.6C at the end of the century2.  The long-term demand for energy continues to grow in  an economy currently based on fossil fuels, in which the  price of oil is increasing and approaching the maximum  levels seen in 2008 and nuclear investment plans have  been temporarily or permanently suspended in several  countries. According to the International Energy Agency  (IEA), primary energy demand will grow by 47% until  2035, driven by consumption in emerging countries. Within this context, renewable energies are crucial, as  they are cleaner, safer, cheaper and more competitive,  which would allow for a stable scenario of 450 ppm of  CO2 in 2030. Wind energy has thus become a strategic  element which has evolved at a steady rate of growth  to reach 238 installed GW in the world in 2011.

Globalization likewise  constitutes  an important factor  behind the growth in  the demand for energy Almost 1.6 billion  people today  (1/4 of the worlds  population) lack  access to electricity,  and those that do have  it gain access to  an expensive and  irregular supply 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities Economic changes:  The last decade has been characterized by a shift of  economic power, along with the scenario of economic  crisis and the difficulties of gaining access to financing  mainly affecting the western world. New economic  powers like China, India, Brazil and Russia are playing  an increasingly important role and exerting greater  influence on the rules of international trade, finance,  innovation and the model of governance, along with  the group of nations that became successful over the  last few decades. Globalization likewise constitutes an important factor  behind the growth in the demand for energy. As mar- kets are becoming global, demands are growing for ac- cess to energy, transport and other services needed to  set up businesses and trade. These factors are transla- ted into a substantial need for global investments over  the next few years, to which the public administrations  are responding through different stimulus measures. New investment needs in infrastructures, basic services  and energy have thus been identified in recent years,  along with a greater concern for the environment. Almost 1.6 billion people today (1/4 of the worlds popu- lation) lack access to electricity, and those that do have  it gain access to an expensive and irregular supply. The  rate of growth in global energy demand will determine  the investments needed in supply infrastructures.  However, reports on demand indicate that the need for  total cumulative investment in electricity infrastructu- res throughout the world will amount to 9.8 trillion USD  until 2030, a figure equivalent to 350 billion USD per  year. Developing countries account for more than half  of this investment and China in particular accounts for  the greatest increase, exceeding 2 trillion USD3.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that  electricity demand in China will rise to reach 9,594 TWh  in 2035 at an annual growth rate of 5.3%. The main  source of electricity supply today is coal (80%), which  accounts for more than 70% of installed capacity. The  electricity mix in 2020 will include 150 GW of installed  wind energy capacity, from the current figure of 60 GW  (2011).   10 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2.

The slowdown  in the market caused by the world crisis economic  has changed the needs of stakeholders. However, the  fundamentals for the industrys growth continue to be  solid. The security of energy supplies, on the one hand,  needs to be ensured in terms of both the indepen- dence of energy supplies (local) as well as in terms of  the resources abundance (renewable) by means of an  energy source which allows for the diversification of  energy supplies and to mitigate any possible adverse  geopolitical situations through a local source of supply. On the other hand, the competitiveness of energy in  terms of price per MWh is becoming a key factor.  Within this context, wind energy is one of the local re- newable sources of energy which is closest to reaching  grid parity with the generating costs of conventional  sources. As a matter of fact, it is calculated that the  cost of energy attributable to a wind farm with average  wind-resources will be fully competitive with carbon,  natural gas and nuclear energy in 20164. In fact, the  cost of energy per MWh without subsidies at sites with  good wind power resources has fallen from 200/MWh  in 1984 to 52/MWh today. This figure is currently  just 6 more expensive than the energy produced by  gas combustion. In areas with excellent wind power  resources, like Brazil, wind energy can already compete  on costs with fossil fuel technologies. Forecasts point  to a 12% reduction in the cost of wind energy over the  next five years, based on the following facts: 	The costs of an average turbine have fallen from the  2 mill./MW (1980s) to 0.88 mill./MW in 2011; 	Wind turbines are progressively becoming larger and  efficiency improvements contribute to increasing wind  farm capacity. The energy from onshore wind farms is  becoming progressively cheaper due to the fact that  the price of wind turbines is reduced by 7% each time  installed capacity is doubled and because of designs  which have improved efficiency by 34% (21% in 1984).  As means of collecting energy in low-wind conditions  are learned through experience and innovation, effi- ciency improvements under normal wind conditions and  the construction of larger wind turbines having higher  towers to take advantage of higher-speed winds have  come about; 	Operating and maintenance costs have fallen in real  terms from 50/MWh in the 1980s to 11/MWh today. Source: The Economics of Wind Energy, EWEA Report 2009; Bloomberg New Energy Finance   Evolution 1980's - 2011 Evolution in coming years Areas of continuous innovation   11 No less importantly, the objective of fighting and  putting a stop to climate change has made wind power  an essential energy source. Wind energy is clean, hardly  consumes any natural resources and is inexhaustible.  It does not generate hazardous waste, nor does it emit  CO2, while creating jobs and purchases in local supply  chains. The forecasts made by the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change (IPCC) indicate substantial growth in  renewable energies by 2030, 2050 and thereafter. The  scenarios which include a greater weight of renewables  suggest 43% growth by 2030 and 77% by 2050. A  consensus therefore exists that wind energy, despite  the current economic climate, will play a predominant  role in electricity generation in the world. This is based  on long-term growth in demand due to: 	a normalized wind energy industry in Eastern Europe; 	growth in Asia and other emerging markets; 	the deployment of offshore wind energy, especially in  the United Kingdom, Germany, France and China in the  medium to long-term; 	a positive regulatory outlook in most markets, despi- te the uncertainties surrounding the economic support  provided to these energy sources. The growing competitiveness of wind energy combined  with governmental commitments to combat climate  change will in the long-term offset the current deficit  in demand in mature markets. Nonetheless, it is impor- tant to highlight in this regard that lower wind energy  demand in mature markets like Europe or the United  States will be offset in the short-term by growth in the  emerging markets of Asia, Latin America and Africa.  These new markets have made a commitment to  renewable energies which is not based on the need to  combat climate change, but rather on the need to com- bat structural energy deficits or an excessive dependen- ce on a single source of domestic energy. Changes have also been detected in relationships with  customers. Professional operators – utilities and inde- pendent power producers (IPP) – are making progress in  the industrys consolidation by accumulating portfolios  in local markets to meet their renewable energy  commitments and seeking wind turbine manufacturers  as reliable long-term partners which offer knowledge  across the value chain through an integrated model.  Likewise, the globalization of wind energy needs the  global support offered by manufacturers. Competition  in the industry is based on offering the best Cost of  Energy (CoE) as a combination of investment, opera- ting and maintenance costs (O&M), performance and  availability throughout the useful life of a wind farm. As regards competition in the industry, an increase in  the market share of large industrial groups has come  about, displacing pioneering firms. A reduction in the  presence of small/local operators has been observed,  as has the technological differentiation of western  operators. Companies in the industry have chosen two  ways to differentiate themselves: western operators  have placed a wager on technological differentiation,  while at the same time an increasing number of com- panies are appearing in low-cost regions. In order to  deal with this situation, it is essential to place a wager  on technological innovation and the continuous search  for cost efficiency. A consensus exists that  wind energy,  despite the current  economic climate,  will play a  predominant role in  electricity generation  in the world, based on  long-term growth  in demand 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2.

Global Wind Report – Annual Market Update 2010 6 Cumulative market share at 2011 year-end (Source: GWEC) Source: GWEC, Study on the wind energy market 2010 Despite the effects the economic slowdown has  had on business activity, many organizations are  rapidly moving towards sustainability as a business  imperative linked to their ability to generate trust.  According to the United Nations Global Compact  study for 2010 entitled A New Era of Sustainabili- ty, 93% of CEOs stated that sustainability will be  critical for the survival and success of their busi- nesses and 72% cited brand, trust and reputation  as one the top three factors driving them to take  action on sustainability issues. It is no less true  that fully integrating sustainability into business  strategy, the complexity of its implementation and  its deployment across the supply chain are the main  difficulties faced when developing sustainability  issues. Detailed ongoing assessment of long-term inves- tments by socially responsible investors (SRI) is  added to all of the above. It is therefore necessary  to ensure that the value of sustainability activities  can be evidenced by traditional metrics like cost  reductions or increases in revenue. Thus, business behavior is being subjected to a  detailed analysis which takes into account global  intergovernmental standards that allow a greater  control over the economic activity of companies to  be exercised, along with their social and environ- mental initiatives to strengthen the protection of  human rights in all their dimensions.  A good example of this is the Communication  from the Commission to the European Parliament,  the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions - A  renewed EU strategy 2011-2014 for Corporate Social  Responsibility (October of 2011) through which the effort to promote Corporate Social Responsibility  renewed by creating conditions which favor sustai- nable growth, responsible corporate behavior and  lasting job creation in the medium and long-term. Among the elements deemed as priorities for sustai- nability, the need to develop business ethics, codes  of good governance and practices to combat fraud,  corruption and bribery is considered as a key factor  to implement an appropriate view of responsibility in  organizations. Employees are demanding processes to manage  talent and promote employability, sustainable job  opportunities, along with working conditions which  exceed market standards in variables like salary, job  satisfaction, safety, professional career expectations  and assurances on non-discriminatory treatment. Due to globalization and the complexity of logistics  resulting from the localization/manufacturing of  components in certain countries, suppliers are raising  concerns to companies aimed at improving control  over CSR and the security of all the elements making  up the supply chain. Society and communities are calling for the creation  of shared value in a scenario in which the company  makes a contribution to consolidating societies by  respecting the pressure on natural resources and  minimizing impacts, along with a contribution to  improving the quality of life of citizens by applying  standards of transparency and inclusive communica- tion processes.

The sustainability of management to  reach this objective contemplates the creation of value  through a model which takes into consideration: 	Growth: gaining access to new customers and mar- kets through innovation and the momentum provided  by new products and services, as well by putting  together an integrated business portfolio. 	Return on capital: incorporating sustainability into  operations, sustainability in the value chain and crea- ting sustainable products/services. 	Risk management: undertaking programs which allow  for the control of regulatory, operating and reputation- related risks. The levers of sustainability which allow this integrated  value proposition to be reached are as follows: 1 4 3 2 Mission, values and attitudes Business Plan Sustainability strategy Business risk control   14 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities  Mission, values and attitudes In terms of the deployment of its 2011-2013 Business  Plan, 2011 was a key year for Gamesa. It was also impor- tant in terms of the mission, values and attitudes for  success which Gamesa has defined in the Gamesa Way  project to set strategic objectives and involve the entire  organization in the corporate culture and in its own way  of conducting business.  All Gamesa employees (numbering 7,903 as at May  2011) were invited to take part in one of the more than  300 workshops organized around the world on the ba- sis of sessions led by members of senior management  or managers, who were backed by ambassadors chosen  for their commitment through their performance and  alignment with the spirit of the Gamesa Way program.  The sessions were aimed at encouraging participation  – one of the aspects most valued by participants – and  open to debate. The inputs from the more than 12,000  hours of training given were recorded and assessed in  over 1,000 hours of work. These were in turn evaluated  to analyze measure and understand the programs  impact. By the end of 2011, 84% of Gamesa employees  had taken part in this program, which was carried out  after a new mission, values and attitudes were defined  in 2010.

Gamesa reduced the Cost of Energy in 2011 by 10-15%.  In 2012, the company will continue working on the  availability and reliability of its wind turbines, placing  special emphasis on reducing the cost of materials. It  will likewise develop two new wind turbines within the  G9X-2.0 MW platform: the G97-2.0 MW Class II and the  G114-2.0 MW wind turbines. In the O&M services area,  the company will continue to focus on the continuous  improvement of its fleets availability, with the aim of  improving the current level of availability, which already  exceeds 98%, through maintenance programs like the  GPA (Gamesa Premium Availability) program. Within the vector of growth, Gamesa expects to inten- sify its sales efforts in new geographic areas and custo- mers, such as electricity utilities in northern and central  Europe and markets like South East Asia, Australasia,  South Africa and the Middle East.  In these markets Gamesa will leverage its presence  in China, India and North Africa. It will also play an  increasingly important role in the services area, both in  terms of sales growth and sustainability, as well as in  margins. In 2012, the O&M services activity will intensi- fy its sales effort outside Spain with regard to its new  added value programs and its large component repair  and enhancement programs. For its part, the wind farm  development and sales activity will carry on with the  strategy of realizing the value of its portfolio, with a  focus on the American market in 2012. 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities Vector 1: Cost of Energy Objectives Product range  and machine  performance Launching new product families in five years, including two new  offshore wind energy platforms among them New technologies applied to all product platforms (e.g. permanent  magnet generators, average speed gearbox, full converter,  segmented blade design, etc.) 20% reduction  in the Cost of  Energy by 2013 30% reduction  in the Cost of  Energy by 2015 Optimal  availability and  performance  of the service  fleet Maintenance improvements to reduce costs Innovation to minimize idle periods and losses of energy Programs to extend the useful life of wind turbines Vector 2: Growth Objectives Wind turbine  sales Access to new product segments (Multi MW, offshore) Expansion of sales to new geographic areas and new customers Tailor-made offering Presence in 33  target markets Wind energy  project  development Complete wind farm development and sale projects through  Gamesa Energa (>5 GW known) - access to new customers, i.e.  industrial energy consumers Moving the business model forward from mere development and  extending the sales approach to all markets Delivery of 700  MW/year by 2013 Services Framework O&M agreements (electricity utilities and IPP) Repair and reconditioning of large components 24 GW of O&M  by 2013 2   16 Vector 3: Efficiency Objectives Supply chain Localization to reduce manufacturing/logistics costs (China, India, Brazil) Reduce costs of materials by optimizing the supply chain Joint development with manufacturers to optimize cost effectiveness of  designs Increase in pro- duction capacity  and autonomy  in key emerging  markets Adjusting indus- trial capacity Objective: re- duce structural  costs per MW by  15% in 2013 Industrial  base Adapt industrial capacity to markets Key advantages of combining internal resources with subcontracting Construction  and logistics  costs Global integrated logistics model Optimized construction processes to reduce construction lead times Flexibility  linked to  demand Adjustment of structural costs to demand in each region: ensuring allocation  of resources to growth areas by readjusting resources in areas of lower  growth (employability) The vector of efficiency has increasing gained weight in  the current market environment. Gamesa will continue  to adjust capacity to demand. As the capacity reduction  program in Spain was practically completed in 2011, the  company will work on consolidating and adapting such  capacity to new products, while in Brazil and India the  localization of the supply chain for the new G9X-2.0  MW platform will be completed. A centralized logistics  department will be set up in the construction and  logistics area to make procedures uniform and optimize  costs. Progress will also be made in the reduction of  construction lead times through the WOSS (Wind Farm  Optimization Supply Sequence) and the use of open- field sites will be optimized. In addition, new procure- ment tools will be deployed to simplify and speed up  supplier certification, while maintaining strict quality  criteria, lead times and cost reductions in supplies. In a complex short-term economic and market environ- ment, Gamesa will give priority to the balance sheets  solidity and profitability by subordinating sales volumes  to these objectives and bringing forward its target of  reaching a balance in net free cash flow by a year.

Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities   17 3 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities   Sustainability strategy Gamesas attention on the new business environment  is focused through a sustainability strategy whose ob- jectives include creating value among its stakeholders,  attaining business objectives and making a contribu- tion to risk management. Through it and its action  plans, recognition is sought for an in-house business  and management model which is committed to the  creation of value and sustainable development. Gamesa wishes to play a leading role in the transition to  a sustainable world and wants to take advantage of any  opportunities the markets will offer as a result of it.  This approach is based on three pillars: 	Being exemplary: ensuring the coherence of our com- mitment to sustainable development 	Personality: Materializing the Gamesa hallmark, the  structure of our relationships with third parties, which  is geared at generating trust 	Presence: Making ourselves seen and heard as we  accompany the development of the communities in  Strategic line of action Objectives Start End Being  exemplary Development of ethical principles of  reference – integrity framework Strengthening the ethical framework in order to consolidate and encourage  exemplary behavior 2011 - 2nd Quarter 2014 - 2nd Quarter Incorporating undertakings made Ensuring that incentives are in line with the companys values and undertakings  and peoples behavior 2011 - 1st Quarter 2015 - 2nd Quarter Keeping one step ahead of changes  - institutional work Ensuring the company remains aware of social, environmental and ethical chan- ges which are important for the company and the businesses in which it operates 2012 - 2nd Quarter 2014 - 4th Quarter Leadership in sustainable  management - climate change Strengthening performance in matters connected with commitments on and the  management of greenhouse gas emissions 2011 - 1st Quarter 2015 - 4th Quarter Sustainability-driven actions Ensuring coherence between the companys practices and its business model  based on sustainable development. 2011 - 1st Quarter 2014 - 2nd Quarter Personality Alignment with employees - culture Strengthening the ethical framework on labor practices and health and safety in  all operating areas 2011 - 1st Quarter 2014 - 2nd Quarter Strengthening the supply chain Strengthening the companys ethical framework on practices in the supply chain 2011 - 2nd Quarter 2015 - 4th Quarter Promoting integration and inclusion Strengthening Gamesas practices regarding the incorporation of groups having  different needs in growth areas 2011 - 1st Quarter 2014 - 2nd Quarter Presence Committed globalization – local  presence Using social commitments as a lever in the process of opening the company up to  foreign markets 2011 - 3rd Quarter 2014 - 3rd Quarter Partaking in commitments -  volunteering Offering all employees the possibility of collaborating in social initiatives carried  out by the company 2012 - 1st Quarter 2014 - 2nd Quarter Generating trust - dialog and  education Establishing stable platforms for dialog and education with relevant opinion  makers and groups in key markets 2011 - 3rd Quarter 2014 - 4th Quarter Gamesa Sustainability Master Plan    18  Business risk control Gamesas Risk and Opportunity Control and Mana- gement Policy sets forth the bases and the general  context upon which all risk control and management  components lay, providing discipline and structure to  aspects like the management policy, the risk identi- fication model, the assessment, measurement and  control of risks/opportunities, accepted risk levels,  communications, reporting and oversight by the Board  of Directors, integrity, ethical values, competences and  the assignment of responsibilities.  This policys main aims are: to ensure compliance with  applicable laws, regulations and standards and the ful- fillment of agreements; to attain the objectives set by  the Board of Directors; to provide maximum guarantees  to shareholders; to protect profits and equity, as well as  preserve the companys assets and reputation; to exer- cise optimal control over business areas and companies  by ensuring the reliability and integrity of reporting  systems; to defend the interests of shareholders, cus- tomers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders  having an interest in the way Gamesa is run; and to  ensure the companys stability and financial strength in  a sustainable fashion over time. Control over the uncertainty surrounding legislative  changes, the speed with which they come about and  their effect on the business constitute an ongoing cha- llenge which Gamesa handles with an overall approach.  Due to this and as a result of the undertaking to comply  with all regulations, control was strengthened in 2011  through the implementation of a new procedure and  the specific Regulatory Compliance area, whose purpo- se is to facilitate compliance with legal requirements  which apply or may potentially apply in the future. There are additional specific policies and/or procedures  geared at maximizing and protecting economic, social  and environmental values within a controlled degree of  variability. Changes in the economic climate or reviews  of objectives and strategies, among other aspects,  may lead to the need to approve new policies/rules/ controls or to the amendment of existing ones. In 2011,  the review and updating of the Code of Conduct, the  approval of Crime Prevention and Anti-Fraud Policy  and a preventive program based on several principles  of action stood out, as did the progress made in the  development of the SCIIF8. The latter forms an integral  part of Internal Control and aims to provide reasonable  security on the reliability of the financial reporting Ga- mesa discloses to the markets as a listed corporation.  8 Abbreviation for Sistema de Control Interno de Informacin  Financiera (Internal Financial Reporting Control System). 4 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities   19 Governance mechanisms Gamesa has a Risk and Opportunity Management and  Control System in place across the entire organization  (divisions, departments and companies). It follows the  strategic guideline of globalizing industrial, technologi- cal and commercial activities in the different geogra- phic areas where the company operates. The system  provides a global integrated overview that contributes  to achieving business objectives, in addition to crea- ting value for different stakeholders and aiding the  organizations sustainable and profitable development. The Gamesa risk and opportunity management system  and its policy complement one another. They are imple- mented using an organizational structure, a model, se- veral procedures and information systems that enable  Gamesa to identify, evaluate, prioritize and manage the  opportunities and risks to which it is exposed.  It is equipped with a structured risk management and  control organization which includes:  	Board of Directors: oversees the risk identification,  control and management policy; 	Executive Committee: to which all of the Board of  Directors powers are delegated, except any legal and  bylaw powers which cannot be delegated; 	Audit and Compliance Committee: periodically  supervises the internal control and risk management  systems, sets and reviews of the risk levels which the  company deems acceptable; 	Management Committee (General, Corporate and  Geographic Areas): holds responsibility for identifying,  assessing, mitigating/eliminating risks with the sup- port provided by the Risk Controller Network; 	Internal Auditing: conducts independent supervision  of the control system and reports to the Audit and  Compliance Committee; 	Regulatory Compliance Unit (RCU): supervises and  oversees compliance with the Internal Code of Conduct  Regarding the Securities Markets and in general terms  the companys rules of Governance. Furthermore, it is  the collegiate body (General Counsel, Internal Auditing,  Regulatory Compliance and Legal Department) en- trusted with overseeing and monitoring the regulatory  environment affecting the activity and it reports to the  Management Committee and the Audit and Complian- ce Committee;  	Business Risk Control (BRC) Department: sets guide- lines and coordinates activities with the Risk Controller  Network and BRC managers in the different geographic  areas. The risk management methodology forms an integral  part of Gamesas strategic activities and operations in  accordance with the Risk/Opportunity Management  and Control Procedure approved in 2008 and included in  the certified management system. Gamesa considers  and groups together risks into the following categories: 	Situational risks which arise as a consequence of  external factors that are beyond the companys ma- nagement and which could have a significant direct or  indirect influence on the attainment of its objectives  and strategies; 	Process risks arising from the companys own  operations. These are in turn classified into Operatio- nal Risks, Management Risks, Technology/Reporting  Process Risks, Integrity Risks and Financial Risks; 	Decision-making information risks. These risks arise  from the information used for decision-making on  operational, financial and strategic matters not being  reliable and/or complete 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2.

YES Business Risk control model NO The methodology applied is translated into a corporate  risk/opportunities map, which is updated on a quarterly  basis. Financial, tax-related, operating, strategic and  legal risks/opportunities are monitored, as are risks  associated to key processes, projects, products and  services to assess whether or not it is appropriate to  make changes to the map as a result of changes in  impact trends, likelihood and/or controls, as well as to  establish the corresponding action plans. In addition, a more thoroughgoing annual review is  conducted to coincide with the update/change of  the objectives for each annual period. Specific maps  are likewise drawn up for the main geographic areas  with an industrial/commercial presence. The maps for  Europe, the United States, China and India were drawn  up throughout 2011 and it was determined whether any  risks of a similar nature should be added to the corpo- rate map or whether a geographic risk on the corporate  map should be monitored on an individualized basis. 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities   21 Long-term sustainability trends, risks and  opportunities. Following along the lines of the 2011-2013 Business  Plan and the Sustainability Strategy, special attention  was placed in 2011 on controlling any risks/opportu- nities which could have either a negative or positive  effect on the attainment of business or sustainability  targets. Risks maps were drawn up, not only on a glo- bal scale, but also for the main areas in which Gamesa  operates and the corresponding action plans (mitigate,  cover, prevent and assume) were put into place, as  appropriate. 	Regarding the Strategic Plan 2011-2013, any risk fac- tors that could affect the plans three strategic vectors  are monitored, that is to say growth, CoE and efficiency.  The development and launch of new platforms (G97/ G10X/Offshore) and new services (GPA, lengthening the  useful life of wind farms, etc.) are controlled in line with  market/customer demands, as well as with austerity,  cost optimization and investment programs. The main  risks and opportunities controlled in 2011 relating to  the three strategic vectors as well as the main actions  taken to mitigate them and/or enhance control are set  out below: 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities   22 Vectors Main risks/opportunities monitored Main actions GROWTH The slowdown in the recovery from the financial crisis and regulatory uncertainty in certain geographic areas stand out  as the main situational risks. These affect the evolution of wind energy demand in the short term and, as an opportunity,  lower onshore wind energy demand in mature markets is being offset by growth in emerging markets like Asia, Latin  America or Africa. Specific risk factors: 	Evolution of regulations and legislation in areas where Gamesa targets growth: The situation is particularly relevant in  the USA and in European countries like Spain, Italy or Portugal, where economic incentives have been or are being reviewed  downwards. 	Uncertainty about the progressive recovery of demand: On the one hand, lower energy demand arising from economic  weakness leads to lower electricity prices and reduces the immediate need to add generating capacity, which is already  in surplus in some western markets. On the other hand, budget deficits in southern European countries and the United  States are lowering governments capacity to finance support programs for different renewable energy sources, thereby  reducing the profitability of projects. 	Customers financing capacity: In a context in which the lower profitability of wind energy projects is linked to limited  access to finance and higher financing costs, wind energy developers and large European and American electricity utilities  are reviewing their investment plans for the immediate future. 	Price and competition pressures which operators, other wind energy manufacturers, conventional energy sources and  other sources of renewable energy exercise on wind energy.  	Country risk in new markets: Other factors have also been monitored throughout 2011, such as geopolitical changes,  social movements and natural events/disasters, to ascertain their possible influence on the business. Despite this context, in 2011 Gamesa managed to meet the guidelines communicated to the markets for the year by carrying out  actions, among which the ones set below stand out: 	The implementation of its commercial strategy adapted to the most suitable model for each geographic area, breaking into new  markets and new customers, taking advantage of attractive opportunities in emerging markets and introducing more efficient  products into the market like the G97-2.0 MW wind turbine, which was simultaneously launched in four regions (Europe, China,  India and the United States). This new turbine was well received by the market, as is evidenced by the supply agreements for 356  MW reached in 2011. 	The commercial launch of new O&M added value services: GPA (Gamesa Premium Availability) to enhance availability (up to  99%), programs to lengthen the useful life of wind farms and maintenance of wind farms owned by third parties. 	The revitalization of the wind farm business with strong commercial activity in 2011 through the signing of agreements for 417  MW. 	Controls conducted by making ongoing comparisons with the competition of both onshore and offshore wind turbines and the  possibility of gaining access to new customers and wind energy development plans being put into place by governments are some  of the guarantees for maintaining a position of leadership in the industry. COST OF ENERGY REDUCTION In the face of the pressure being exercised by the situation, internal risks are continuously controlled: appropriate se- lection of markets and suitable product/service characteristics (technology, regulatory requirements, product specifica- tions), adapting them quickly to the necessary demands and requirements to achieve safe, reliable and environmentally  friendly products throughout their life cycle and with the lowest CoE.  Excellence in the development of new products and services launched in keeping with the Business Plans roadmap, thereby  contributing to the progressive improvement in the CoE demanded as a combination of investment, O&M costs, performance and  availability throughout the useful life of wind farms. The following are among the developments which should be highlighted: 	The new G97-2.0 MW turbine launched in 2011 has a swept area which is 16% greater than the current G90 turbine and increases  energy production by almost 14%.  	The IEC WT01 Type Certification from GL Renewables Certification was obtained for the G128-4.5 MW wind turbine and pre- series production began in 2011. 	The GPA program, which is aimed at achieving an average availability rate of 99% and at reducing wind farm operating costs by  10%. 	Monitoring the effects of the strategies and cost improvement actions in the results and reaching CoE optimization of between  10% and 15%, depending on the platform and region. EFFICIENCY The vector of efficiency has gained increasing weight in the current market environment. In this demand scenario, work  has continued on making operations flexible. Special emphasis was placed on logistics and the supply chain by contro- lling the organizations adaptation, planning, manufacturing and/or procurement to meet demand in terms of quantity,  quality, costs and deadlines through, among other measures, industrial restructurings, the synergies achieved through  the globalization strategy and a presence in different geographic areas. Within this context, the alignment of stocks  with customer orders is subject to special monitoring. The following are among the actions geared at improving efficiency: 	Production capacity and autonomy in key markets: Industrial production of the Gamesa G97-2.0 MW wind turbine has been  simultaneously launched in four main regions, Europe, China, India and the United States, thereby accompanying its commercial  launch. 	Adjusting capacity to demand and supply chain localization: Reduction in blade capacity by 43% when compared to 2009; recon- verting capacity at O&M centers and large component repairs; Indian market supplied with 65% of local contents (for the G5X-850  kW turbine). 	Reduction programs for fixed costs/MW sold (reaching a 5% reduction) and construction and logistics cost reduction programs  (OTD has risen from 95% to reach 97.6%). 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities   23 	Concerning the Sustainability strategy which supports  the Business Plan, any risk factors which could affect  the Sustainability Plans strategic business lines are  monitored, namely Being Exemplary, Personality  and Presence. All of this is considered by taking into  account the context and new scenarios in the areas of  climate change, respect for the environment, business  ethics, talent and employability management and con- sidering Gamesas Sustainability approach (Products/ Services and Sustainable Company), which contributes  to improving the global and local footprint   Managing products through technology develo- pment, offering sustainable and highly competitive  product/services, which include ecodesign and pro- duct safety from the early stages of development.   Honest, transparent and globally sustainable  company management by continuously optimizing  the economic, social and environmental cycle. Gamesa  enjoys strict, solid, sustainable financial management  and a healthy balance sheet, making future growth  opportunities possible.    Some of the risks and opportunities monitored  in 2011 in relation to the strategic sustainability gui- delines as well as the main actions taken to mitigate  them and/or enhance control are set out below: 01 Sustainability strategy  and analysis 2. Sustainability trends, challenges and opportunities   24 CSR  Lines Main risks/opportunities monitored Main actions BEING EXEMPLARY The strengthening of lines of work aimed at excellence is controlled,  thereby ensuring that the same levels of control are applied across all  business units and geographic areas. Management systems certified in  accordance with the OHSAS18001, ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 standards. 	Risk management in the areas of prevention, the environment and  quality is integrated into the management of the different units/ geographic areas and serves as an example for newly set up areas/ processes.  	As a result of internationalization, the setting up industrial production  and the localization of components to optimize the supply chain, Gamesa  performs activities in countries having different cultures and perceptions  of the risks related to CSR. It was therefore deemed appropriate to gain  further knowledge on such perceptions and to assess them. Maintenance of the ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 certifications and progressive implementation of the EMAS as the path to excellence in environmental protection. Excellence in health and safety by maintaining the OSHAS 18001 certification and extending the control culture and levels to all business units and geographic areas through  different health and safety management projects. All of this contributed to a reduction in both the Frequency and Severity Rates when compared to 2010 despite the companys  greater exposure as a result of internationalization, the growth in activity and the number of employees. A greater contribution to minimizing energy consumption and CO2 emissions after having implemented and certified the energy efficiency system according to the UNE ISO 50001  standard as a pilot scheme at the Gamesa Lerma plant and carrying on with the project to extend the UNE ISO 50001 standard to other of the groups plants. Application of the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) tool and different standards to integrate safety and the minimization of environmental aspects on the basis of product design. Gamesas  participation in the setting up of the Basque Ecodesign Center eco-innovation pole in 2011 should be highlighted. Gamesa leads the commitment made to the eco-innovation pole and the creation of safe environmentally friendly products from the early stages of development, as was  demonstrated in 2011 when it was the first company to obtain the ecodesign certification for the G128-4.5 MW wind turbine from the TV certification agency in accordance with  the ISO14006/2011 standard (Environmental Management Systems – Guidelines for Incorporating Ecodesign), a certificate which bears witness to its minimal environmental  impact throughout its life cycle. Control is exercised from this moment to ensure its extension to other developments. Gamesa is carrying on with the project to extend ecodesign  to other developments in accordance with the ISO 10606/2011 standard. PERSONALITY Ensuring the company is at the cutting-edge of corporate governance  and transparency best practices before third parties Ensuring that the preventive culture regarding CSR best practices is  perceived as an added value In order to strengthen the ethical framework, the Code of Conduct has been reviewed and updated and a Crime Prevention and Anti-Fraud Policy has been approved, the purposes  of which are: 	To convey to all the Groups executives and employees, as well as to third parties who have established a relationships with the company, that Gamesa ensures its activities are  based on the principle of respect for the law and on the promotion and defense of Corporate Values and the Principles of Corporate Social Responsibility, which include the fight  against corruption in all its forms. 	To establish the general framework for the Crime Prevention and Anti-Fraud Program geared at preventing crime and fraud within Gamesa (including administrative infringements  and serious irregularities). As a means of strengthening the companys ethical framework regarding practices in the supply chain, the following actions should be highlighted: 	 Enhancement in the control exercised over reputation-related risks by progressing towards greater knowledge about CSR behavior among components and services suppliers  through one of the initiatives contained in the CSR Plan, which involves conducting a supplier CSR assessment survey as a starting point to identify risk factors and areas of  improvement. 	 Gamesa encourages its partners to join it in the commitments it has made to respect the environment. In order to do so, it is implementing a supplier environmental traction  project aimed at getting them to progress towards environmental management systems certified in accordance with the ISO 14001 standard. PRESENCE Ensuring that a contribution is made to improving the global and local  footprint as a committed company which generates trust and is capable  of educating communities and relevant stakeholders in key markets  about: 	Health and safety  	Respect for the environment  	Preventing the effects of climate change 	Safety of people and assets 	Quality 	Business ethics  	Value of reputation 	Respect for human and labor rights  	Talent and employability management 	Strengthening the supply chain Management transparency and strengthening performance on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission management: Gamesa improves the GHG inventory in accordance with ISO 14064-1  standard, as it has drawn up a GHG report in order to facilitate the GHG inventorys verification and transparently report on Gamesas emissions to all customers and stakeholders  in keeping with the environmental commitments set out in its Environmental Policy. This report was verified by the TV certification agency. Preventing/resolving social conflicts and impacts on image and reputation through dialog.

This  year it has once again been drawn up and validated in  accordance with the contents of the Global Reporting  Initiatives (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines  (G3) and sets out a balanced and reasonable description  of the groups economic, social and environmental per- formance. The period covered by this document reflects  Gamesas activities in 2011 and provides information on  some significant events in the first quarter of 2012. The  previous Sustainability Report was published in April  2011 [3.2].  We likewise point out that this report – which is publis- hed on an annual basis [3.3] – can be completed with  other publications Gamesa publishes and distributes  annually, as it makes reference to them, particularly  the Annual Consolidated Report 2011 and the Annual  Corporate Governance Report (ACGR) 2011, which are  available on the corporate website:  www.gamesacorp.com For any general question regarding the report, please  contact [3.4]: Gamesa Corporacin Tecnolgica, S.A.

Report scope and boundaries Report content [3.5] Gamesas Sustainability Report 2011 contains informa- tion intended for shareholders, customers, employees,  suppliers, governments, analysts, local communities  and finally to the society as a whole, in the broadest  sense. Nevertheless, it attempts to specifically cover  those areas related to sustainability that are relevant  for the organization. Requests made by stakeholders are dealt with and  considered as a key factor for defining the reports con- tents. These requests are combined with societys bro- adest expectations, any risks identified and Gamesas  strategic priorities, which are then represented in the  materiality matrix, taking into consideration:  	Topics which are of major interest for Gamesas diffe- rent stakeholders; 	 Topics which have a current or potential impact on  the company; 	Topics over which Gamesa is able to exercise a reaso- nable degree of control. Gamesa has followed the Global Reporting Initiative  guidelines for defining the report content, to ensure a  balanced and reasonable presentation of the perfor- mance of the company. The principles of materiality,  stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context and  completeness have been applied for the identification  of contents. This approach concludes with a selection  of more than 150 potentially material issues, which  were later consolidated into sets of topics (see matrix  of materiality), a consolidation aimed at simplifying  the process of data processing and exposition of final  conclusions.   35 Priority setting has been made in a second phase, by  evaluating each of the sustainability issues identified  and taking into account the following factors: 	External Relevance: the degree of interest shown  on specific sustainability aspects of by the group of  stakeholders 	Internal Relevance: potential impact of a certain as- pect about the company, and degree of control over it. On the basis of this assessment, a materiality matrix  was developed, whose vertical axis is composed of ex- ternal criteria, and the horizontal axis internal criteria.  Based on these criteria, the location of each item in the  array determines its materiality, and therefore its rele- vance. Depending on the final positioning of each case  within the matrix, it will be considered: High Material /  Relevant / non-material.

This report therefore does not include any qualitative  or quantitative information on joint ventures or asso- ciated companies in which Gamesa is not the majority  shareholder, information on subcontracted activities or  data on leased facilities in order to ensure clear year- on-year comparability. [3.8] The boundary of the Gamesa Sustainability Report 2011  includes all the companies identified in section 2.3,  except any which are deemed as associated companies. Gamesa therefore considers that this report presents a  reasonable and balanced view of the groups economic,  environmental and social performance. Should there  be any limitations on the information reflected in this  report due to not completely entering quantitative data  into the management systems, they are considered  to have little influence on the overall data on the  group and, in Gamesas judgment, do not affect in any  relevant way the assessment the reader may make  about the companys performance. Nonetheless, the  company is working continuously to develop controls  which would enable complete coverage and scope to be  achieved. Tcnicas de medicin de datos y recopilacin de indica- dores [3.9] As regards the means employed to account for  practically all the performance indicators described  in the GRIs G3 Guidelines, Gamesa is equipped with  management applications that consolidate the data  from branches, production centers and wind farms.  These applications ensure the accuracy, truthfulness  and exhaustive nature of the information presented in  this Sustainability Report 2011. Additionally, the environmental indicators on energy  consumption and their associated emission factors,  scope, limitations and conclusions have been verified  by third parties, as reflected in section 6.5 Emission  Verification Report 2011. Gamesa does not consider it necessary to re-state  any information from prior reports owing to corporate  restructurings [3.10]. However, there could be minor  deviations with respect to the quantitative data disclo- sed in 2009 and 2010 as a consequence of updates and  adjustments. Likewise, there were no significant changes from  previous reporting periods in the scope, boundary or  measurement methods applied in the report.

[3.12] Assurance Gamesa Corporacin Tecnolgica is working on internal  policies and measures that enable it to guarantee  the accuracy, exhaustive nature and veracity of the  information disclosed in the Sustainability Report.  The individual and consolidated annual accounts were  audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers in accordance with  the accounting standards which apply to each case.  For the fifth consecutive year, an independent external  organization was asked to verify the information on  social and environmental practices contained in the  Sustainability Report 2011 and its compliance with the  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 Guidelines of 2006,  along with the suitable traceability of all the informa- tion and data on the main and additional indicators  contained in the aforementioned guidelines. This task  was entrusted to the Spanish Standards and Certifi- cation Association (AENOR - Asociacin Espaola de  Normalizacin y Certificacin) in 2011 and its assurance  report is included in section 6.1 of this report. [3.13] The methodology used to perform the verification  is based on AENORs General Sustainability Report  Assurance Regulations. The purpose of the assurance  process is to analyze and verify that the report has  been drawn up in accordance with GRI guidelines and  that its content is true and complete.  Following the guidelines set forth in the G3 Guidelines,  Gamesa self-assessed this report with an A+, which  corresponds to the scores given by expert organizations  that also verified its Sustainability Report externally.  For its part, the auditing firm also confirmed the A+  application level. Lastly, the review conducted by the  GRI likewise gave the report this same application level,  as is reflected in section 6 herein. 03 Sustainability Report Parameters  Ttulo del  Captulo 01  38  38 Governance, commitments and stakeholders engagement 04   39 04 Governance,  commitments  and stakeholders  engagement Gamesas governance structure is based on two main  bodies, namely the General Shareholders Meeting and  the Board of Directors. [4.1] The General Shareholders Meeting is the meeting of  the companys shareholders that, duly convened, shall  decide by majority voting on the issues within its com- petence. All shareholders, including those that do not  take part in the General Meeting or who have expressed  their disagreement, are subject to the resolutions taken  at the General Meeting, without prejudice to their legal  right to challenge such resolutions. The General Meeting takes resolutions on all issues  that lie within its competence in accordance with the  Law, the Bylaws and the General Meeting Regulations,  particularly:  a. Appointment, re-election and removal of directors  and liquidators, as well as the ratification of any direc- tors appointed by cooption and setting the number of  directors within the limits set forth in the Bylaws; b. Approval, if appropriate, of company remuneration  schemes consisting of the delivery of shares or stock  options which are benchmarked to the share price; c. Appointment, reappointment and removal of the  auditor of accounts; d. Censure the companys management and approval,  as appropriate, of the prior years annual accounts and  the proposal for distributing the result; e. Increase and reduce share capital, as well as delega- ting the power to increase share capital to the Board of  Directors, including the power to do away with or limit  preferential subscription rights; f. Issue bonds and other tradable securities and delega- te the power to issue them to the Board of Directors; g. Authorize the derivative acquisition of treasury  stock; h. Approval and amendment of the General Sharehol- ders Meeting Regulations; i. Amendments to the Bylaws; j. Structural changes: mergers, spin-offs, transforma- tions, winding up, global assignment of assets and  liabilities, moving the registered address abroad, subsi- diarization and segregation of the company; k. Wind up the company; l. Transactions whose effect would be equivalent to  winding up the company; m. Approval of the final liquidation balance sheet; n. Acquisition or divestment transactions involving  essential operating assets, whenever they involve an  effective modification of the corporate purpose. The Board of Directors mission is to promote the  companys interests, represent the company and its  shareholders in the management of its assets, manage  the business and direct the businesss administration. Apart from the matters reserved for the competence of  the General Shareholders Meeting, the Board of Direc- tors is Gamesas highest representative and decision- making body. It has no substantial constraints apart  from those laid down in legislation and the Bylaws,  particularly in the corporate purpose. The Board of Directors carries out general oversight and  sets general strategies and policies. It likewise deals  with the companys relevant issues and its responsibili- ties (Art. 5 of the Board Regulations). The criterion which must at all times govern the Board  of Directors actions is Gamesas corporate interest,  which is materialized in maximizing the companys  value in a sustainable fashion (Article 6 of the Regula- tions). Regarding such issues, it is particularly impor- tant that the Board of Directors adopts all the neces- sary measures to ensure that corporate management  and the Chief Executive Officer are under the effective  oversight of the Board of Directors and that no single  individual or a small group of people hold decision- making powers not subject to checks and balances. Governance   40 Table on the Board of Directors  composition (2011): Information on the Board of Directors composition, as  well as the personal and biographical profiles of its mem- bers can be found in section B.1.3 of the Annual Corporate  Governance Report and on the companys website. The Board of Directors of Gamesa has an Executive  committee endowed with general decision-making  powers and two specialized committees to deal with  specific areas of activity entrusted with powers to  report, advice, put forward proposals and exercise over- sight and control, the Audit and Compliance Committee  and the Appointment and Remuneration Committee.  Information on the Committees can be found in the  Annual Corporate Governance Report. Executive committee At its meeting held on January 10, 2012, the Board of Di- rectors resolved, after having received a favorable report  from the Appointments and Remuneration Committee,  to set up an Executive Committee comprised of five (5)  members to which all powers are to be delegated, except  those which cannot be delegated under the Law and the  Bylaws. The details on its regulations and functioning  are set forth in Article 17 of the Board Regulations.

The Board of Directors shall  endeavor to ensure that the members of the Audit and  Compliance Committee, and particularly the indepen- dent director appointed to it, have knowledge and  experience of accounting, auditing or risk management  matters. The Audit and Compliance Committees basic respon- sibilities are set forth in Article 18.4 of the Board Regu- lations and Articles 6 to 11 of the Audit and Compliance  Committee Regulations. The new revised text of the  Board of Directors Regulations and the new revised text  of the Audit and Compliance Committee Regulations  have both reinforced the competences of the Audit  and Compliance Committee in accordance with the new  responsibilities set forth in Act 19/1988 of 12 July on  the Auditing of Accounts as a result of the amendment  made by Act 12/2010 of 30 June. Thus, new competen- ces are required of the Audit and Compliance Commit- tee, such as reviewing the weaknesses of the internal  control system together with the auditors, overseeing  its effectiveness and the obligation to issue an annual  report prior to issuing the audit report expressing an  opinion on the auditors independence. The Audit and Compliance Committee may seek exter- nal professional advice to better fulfill its functions. The Audit and Compliance Committee issues its own  annual activity report, which is made publicly available  on the companys website12. In keeping with international best practices that require  a majority of independent members, this committee is  currently comprised as follows:  Appointments and Remunera- tion Committee The Appointment and Remuneration Committee  shall have a minimum of three (3) and a maximum  of five (5) non-executive directors. The Board of  Directors shall endeavor to ensure that the members  of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee  are appointed taking into account their knowledge,  capacity and experience in the matters entrusted to  the Appointment and Remunerations Committee. The  basic responsibilities of this committee are set forth in  Article 19 of the Board Regulations. In keeping with international best practices that require  a majority of independent members, it is currently com- prised as follows: Name Office Type Representing Vzquez Egusquiza, Jos Mara Chairman Independent Non- Executive Director N/A Rubio Reinoso, Sonsoles Member Non-Executive  Proprietary Director Iberdrola, S.A.

[4.2] After receiving a favorable report from the Ap- pointments and Remunerations Committee, Gamesas  Board of Directors unanimously resolved to appoint Mr.  Jorge Calvet as Chairman of the Board of Directors and  as the companys CEO at its meeting held October 8,  2009. It delegated all powers to him that according to  Law and the Corporate Bylaws correspond to the Board  of Directors, except those that may not be delegated.  The appointment was accepted by Mr. Calvet at the  same meeting. The following basic powers correspond to the Chairman  of the Board of Directors: 	To convene the Board of Directors, either himself or  through the Board Secretary, and set its agenda which  is obligatory, as well as to include in the agenda any  matters requested by the lead independent director or  at least three directors; 	To direct the Board of Directors deliberations; 	To organize and coordinate with the Chairmen of the  relevant committees the Board of Directors periodic  assessment, as well as of the CEO or highest ranking  executive; 	To bring proposals before the Board which he may  deem appropriate to ensure the company is properly  run, especially concerning how the Board itself and  other corporate bodies are run, and to propose people  to hold the offices of Deputy Chairman, Secretary and  Deputy Secretary of the Board. In his office as the companys highest ranking officer,  he holds responsibility for the effective management  of the companys business in accordance with the  resolutions and criteria adopted by the General Share- holders Meeting and the Board of Directors within their  respective spheres of competence. The aforementioned  operations shall be brought before the Board of Direc- tors or the Executive Committee, as appropriate. Regarding the reasons justifying an Executive Chair- man, the following considerations should be taken into  account: 1.- When assessing the advantages and disadvanta- ges of joining or separating the offices of CEO and  Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Unified Code of  Good Governance does not oppose joining both powers.  It only indicates that it should be accompanied by the  necessary checks and balances (Recommendation 1713). Gamesa has taken various measures along these lines  to reduce any risks arising from concentrating power in  a single person, which are as follows: 	Appointing one of the companys independent direc- tors as a specially empowered director (lead indepen- dent director); 	Absence of the Chairman and CEO at the meetings  held by the Boards consultative and supervisory  committees (Audit and Compliance Committee and  Appointments and Remuneration Committee); 	Competences of the Board of Directors and reserving  certain competences for the Executive Committee as a  collegiate body; 	Assessment conducted on the Chairman and Chief  Executive Officer by the Board of Directors, a process  which is led by the Appointments and Remuneration  Committee. 2.- It reflects Spanish tradition, as only 20% of Ibex-35  companies have chosen to separate these offices.  This originates from the high percentage of business,  financial or family groups that are major or controlling  shareholders in Spanish companies. This situation is  not unknown to Gamesa, where there is an important  shareholder which exerts a controlling interest and  limits the risk of excessive power being vested in an  executive chairman. 13  Recommendation No. 17 of the National Securities Market Commissions  (CNMV) Unified Code of Good Governance of Listed Companies sets forth  that where the Chairman of the Board is also the CEO of the company, one  of the independent directors is to be empowered to request the calling of  a Board meeting or the inclusion of new items on the agenda, to coordina- te and take note of the concerns of non-executive directors, and to direct  the evaluation of the Chairman by the Board. 04 Governance,  commitments  and stakeholders  engagement Governance   43 3.- In some countries highly developed in the area of  corporate governance, the reality of this issue does not  in all cases suggest the separation of offices. In United  States, 59% of companies listed on the S&P500 have  an executive chairman. In addition, Section 972 of the  Dodd-Frank Act (July 2010), like the Spanish Unified  Code of Good Governance, requires an explanation for  joining the offices and the reasons behind it. In France,  the two main codes or principles of good governance  which can be taken as a reference (Code of Gouverne- ment Denterprise des Socits Cotes and Recom- mandations sur le Gouvernement dEnterprise) have  taken different stances regarding the recommendation  to separate or join the offices. They either do not take  a stance in favor of either option or recommend the  separation of offices. However, the accumulation of  these offices is allowed, as long as it is duly justified,  explained and accompanied with the appointment of a  lead independent director. 4.- Lastly, regarding the reasons for having an Executi- ve Chairman, if adequate control and oversight of the  risk, as well as the best management of any possible  conflicts of interest are among the main arguments  used to promote the separation of offices, there are  equally valid and more efficient alternatives. Gamesa  has such solutions: a. A risk control system: Gamesa is equipped with a  well-honed organizational structure that provides value  by working on risk control and management (for further  details, see Business Risk Control/Governance Mecha- nisms on page 16).  b. Appropriate regulations and oversight of potential  conflicts of interest and transactions with signifi- cant shareholders that require, on the one hand, an  obligation of internal communication, abstention of  the affected parties from all deliberations and deci- sions and lastly a prior report issued by the Audit and  Compliance Committee, along with a justified decision  by the Board of Directors (Article 35 of the Board of  Directors Regulations) Information on the Executive Chairman can be found in  sections B.1.2, B.1.3 and B.1.21 of the Annual Corporate  Governance Report. Information on the risk control  system can be found in section D of the Annual Corpo- rate Governance Report and information on conflicts of  interest in section C.6 of the aforementioned report. Independent or non-executive  directors [4.3] The information requested is included in the section 4.1.  In accordance with its internal rules, Gamesas Board of  Directors shall be comprised in such a way so that non- executive directors, with the presence of independent di- rectors, represent a majority over executive directors. The  Board of Directors shall likewise attempt to ensure that  the majority group of non-executive directors includes  proprietary and independent directors. In keeping with the definitions set forth in the Unified  Code of Good Governance, the Board of Directors Regula- tions (Article 8.1.b) considers the following as non-execu- tive directors: 	Proprietary directors: directors who hold a stake which  is equivalent to or exceeds the figure legally deemed as  significant or appointed due to their status as a sharehol- der despite the fact that their shareholding does not reach  such figure; or whose appointment has been proposed by  shareholders set forth in the preceding case. In this case,  it shall be assumed that a director has been proposed  to the company by a shareholder whenever he/she: has  been appointed through the right of representation being  exercised; is a director, senior executive, employee or  non-occasional service provider of such shareholder or  companies belonging to its same group; it can be deduced  04 Governance,  commitments  and stakeholders  engagement Governance   44 from corporate documents that the shareholder assumes  that the director represents or has been appointed by  such shareholder; is the spouse or a related party of the  shareholder through an analogous personal relationship,  or a relative up to the second degree of kinship. 	Independent directors: any directors appointed due  to their personal or professional qualities and ability to  perform their functions without being conditioned by rela- tionships with the company, its significant shareholders or  its senior management; 	Other non-executive directors: any directors not deemed  as proprietary or independent directors. Likewise, Article 8.2 of the Board of Directors Regulations  sets forth that the following shall under no circumstances  be appointed as independent directors:  	Anyone who has been an employee or executive director  of group companies, except when three (3) or five (5) years  have respectively elapsed since they stood down from  such offices. 	Anyone who receives from the company or its group any  amount or benefits for an item other than remuneration  as a director, except where such amount or benefits are  insignificant. For the purposes set forth in this paragra- ph, neither dividends nor pension scheme complements  received by the director arising from his/her previous pro- fessional or employment relationship shall be taken into  consideration, as long as such complements are uncon- ditional and consequently the company paying them out  may not do so discretionally without breaching obligations  or suspending, amending or revoking entitlements. 	Anyone who is or has been a partner of the external  auditor or those holding responsibility for the audit  report during the last three (3) years, whether it be of  the companys audit or that of any other group company  during the aforementioned period. 	Anyone who is an executive director or senior executive  of another company in which some executive director or  member of senior management of the company is a non- executive director. 	Anyone who maintains or has maintained during the  past year a significant business relationship with the  company or with any of the companies of its group, be it  on their own behalf or as a significant shareholder, director  or senior executive of an organization that maintains or  has maintained such a relationship. The provision of goods  or services, including financial and advisory or consulting  services, shall be construed as business relationships. 	Anyone who is a significant shareholder, an executive  director or a senior executive of an organization that  receives or has received during the last three (3) years sig- nificant donations from the company or its group. Anyone  who is merely a governing board member of a foundation  which receives donations shall not be included among  those set forth in this paragraph. 	Spouses or related parties through an analogous  relationship of an executive director or member of senior  management of the company, as well as their family  members up to the second degree of kinship. 	Anyone whose appointment or renewal has not been  put forward by the Appointments and Remuneration  Committee. 	Anyone finding themselves in any of the circumstances  set forth in items a), e), f) or g), as regards a significant  shareholder or a shareholder represented on the Board of  Directors. In the case of the family relationships set forth  in item g), the limitation shall not only apply as regards  the shareholder but also to proprietary directors appointed  at the proposal of such shareholder. Proprietary directors whose status as such ceases to be  the case as a result of the shareholder who put forward  his/her appointment selling their stake may only be  reappointed as independent non-executive directors  when the shareholder that has put forward his/her ap- pointment has sold their entire interest in the company. Directors who own a stake in the company may be con- sidered as independent directors, as long as they meet  all the conditions set forth in this paragraph and when  their stakes do not constitute a significant shareholding.  Information on the composition of the governing body  can be found in the Annual Corporate Governance Report  in sections B.1.2 and B.1.3 and on the companys website. 04 Governance,  commitments  and stakeholders  engagement Governance   45 Mechanisms of dialog with  shareholders and employees  [4.4] The company has a Shareholder Information Office that  responds daily to questions from shareholders. It serves  as a mechanism for shareholders to pass on recommen- dations or suggestions to the highest body of governance.  The aforementioned Shareholder Information Office  is coordinated by the Investor Relations Department,  which reports directly to the Chairman. Shareholder can  ask questions by telephone, traditional mail or e-mail.  The various addresses and numbers are posted on the  companys website. In accordance with Article 22 of the General Shareholders  Meeting Regulations, on the day the General Sharehol- ders Meeting is held, the Shareholder Information Office  responds to any questions raised by shareholders or their  proxies regarding the meetings proceedings prior to the  meeting itself without prejudice to their right to speak,  table proposals and vote granted to them by the Bylaws.  It also informs them about their right to intervene and  compiles the texts of their interventions, if they are  available in writing. In accordance with prevailing legislation, any shareholders  representing at least five (5) per cent of the companys  share capital may request the publication of an addition  to the General Shareholders Meeting announcement  that includes one or more points on the agenda. This  right shall be exercised by means of giving irrefutable  notice thereof, which must be received at the companys  registered address within five (5) days from the date the  announcement of the General Shareholders Meeting is  published.  The Board of Directors shall do everything that may be  required to verify, justify and publish the addition to the  announcement and shall resolve as many questions or  issues as may arise in relation to the addition and the  publication thereof.  Likewise any shareholders representing at least five (5)  per cent of share capital may table grounded proposals  for resolutions on any issues already included or which are  to be included in the agenda of the General Sharehol- ders Meeting within the same time limit set forth in the  preceding paragraph. In accordance with Article 528.2 of Capital Companies Act,  the company set up an electronic shareholders forum  when the 2011 General Shareholders Meeting was called  in order to facilitate communications among Gamesa  shareholders between the date of the call and the date of  the General Meeting. Registered users will be able to send  communications, which will be posted on the forum solely  for the following purposes: 	Proposals they would like to put forward as additions to  the agenda published in the General Meeting announce- ment. 	Requests for support to such proposals. 	Initiatives aimed at reaching the necessary percentage  to exercise minority rights provided for by Law or in the  internal regulations of Gamesa Corporacin Tecnolgica,  S.A.  	Voluntary proxy offers or solicitations. It should likewise be highlighted that any contents which  must be published are accessible from the websites  home page, as well as in the Shareholders and Investors  section in accordance with Act 26/2003 of 17 July on the  Transparency of Listed Corporations and Circular 1/2004  of 17 March of the National Securities Exchange Commis- sion (CNMV). 04 Governance,  commitments  and stakeholders  engagement Governance   46 Compensation for the Board of  Directors, senior management  and executives [4.5] The company rules which govern the remuneration of  members of the Board of Directors are set forth in Article  46 of the Corporate Bylaws and in Article 31 of the Board  of Directors Regulations. The remuneration of members of the Board of Directors  for their work as directors consists of a fixed annual  remuneration item for sitting on the Board and on the  Audit and Compliance and Appointments and Remune- ration Committees, along with an attendance allowance  for attending Board of Directors meetings and the  meetings of the above-mentioned committees.  As a general rule, directors do not receive compensation  benchmarked to the organizations performance. The  Chairman does not receive this fixed remuneration item  or attendance allowances and has an executive compen- sation plan instead. In this regard, the remuneration of directors for merely  performing their duties is independent of any remune- ration, whether general or individual, which members  of the Board of Directors may receive for performing  executive functions or professional tasks. The remuneration received by the Chairman and CEO for  performing his executive duties therefore includes the  following items: fixed remuneration and variable remu- neration items: annual and/or long-term and/or Bylaw  allowances and coverage for risks. The fixed remuneration item is in keeping with market  rates and is based on the principle of moderation. Key indicators and targets to meet the companys  strategic objectives on growth, the cost of energy and  efficiency, which are defined in the 2011-2013 Business  Plan, are set as a point of reference when setting the  variable remuneration item.  Indicators on consolidated EBIT and financial stren- gth (NFD / EBITDA) were adopted for 2011 in line with  guidelines released to the markets in February 2011,  along with non-financial indicators like Corporate Social  Responsibility and Health and Safety indicators, which  took the results of the Dow Global Sustainability Index  and OSHAS and ISO certifications as a benchmark. The Gamesa General Shareholders Meeting held on  May 25, 2011 resolved to approve the establishment of  a Long-Term Incentive Program through the delivery  of company shares to the companys Chairman, senior  executives, managers and employees. This scheme is  benchmarked to the attainment of the strategic objecti- ve set out in the 2011-2013 Business Plan. Consequently,  the Appointments and Remuneration Committee of  Gamesas Board of Directors resolved to settle in advance  the Long-Term Incentive Program 2009-2011, which was  duly authorized by the General Shareholders Meeting on  May 29, 2009. The new plan includes approximately 175 employees  as beneficiaries and is benchmarked to the strategic  objectives set out in the 2011-2013 Business Plan, which  include: Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in relation to  a comparison group, growth, Cost of Energy (CoE) and  efficiency. Regarding compensation for senior management, other  managers and employees not subject to a collective  agreement, they have a variable remuneration item the  amount of which is likewise benchmarked to personal  performance and that of the organization. According to  the scheme, this includes financial indicators and group  targets approved for the Chairmen, along with specific  indicators for the area of which they form part. The Gamesas internal regulations on remuneration  should be viewed in the context of Act 2/2011 of 4  March on the Sustainable Economy. Article 27 of this  Act sets forth that listed corporations shall improve  transparency regarding the remuneration of their  directors and senior executives, as well as on their  04 Governance,  commitments  and stakeholders  engagement Governance   47 remuneration policies in accordance with the provisions  set forth in Article 61 bis of Act 24/1988 of 28 July on  the Securities Market.  Consequently, in 2011 Gamesa drew up a Report on the  Remuneration Policy for the Board of Directors for 2011  and its Application in 2010. This report was approved  by the Board of Directors and submitted to a consul- tative vote at the 2011 General Shareholders Meeting.  The company voluntarily submitted it to a consultative  vote at the last General Meeting, as such submission  will not be mandatory until 2012 according to the Act.  The report was approved by the Shareholders Meeting  with the 94.09% votes in favor. Both the report, which  reflects the individualized remuneration of the mem- bers of the Board of Directors, as well as the detailed  outcome of the consultative vote are available on the  Gamesa website in the section entitled Documents of  the 2011 General Shareholders Meeting. Conflicts of interests [4.6] Section C.5 of the 2011 Annual Corporate Governance  report includes details on the conflicts of interest  which affected directors in 2011. Section C.6, for its  part, describes the mechanisms implemented to detect  and resolve any possible conflicts of interest between  Gamesa and its directors, executives and significant  shareholders. The company has had specific rule entitled Rule on  the Prevention of Conflicts of Interest and/or Cases  of Corruption and/or Bribery to complement this  information since 2009, which was reviewed in 2011,  and is set forth in sections 3.7 (Fight against fraud.  Rejecting corruption and bribery) and 3.8 (Avoiding of  the conflicts of interest) of the Code of Conduct. The  rule is comprised of a set of guidelines addressing  honesty, impartiality and professionalism. They serve  as a guideline for the behavior of Gamesas entities and  people, placing special attention on third parties. The  rule enables the company to take a firm stance in the  relevant markets based on respect and consideration  for shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers,  contractors and collaborators of the company, along  with public authorities and the community as a whole  through the Gamesas actions. In general, the mechanisms used to detect, identify  and resolve possible conflicts of interest between the  company and/or its group and its directors, executives  and significant shareholders are based on the following  rules of competence:  a. The basic responsibilities the Board of Directors  include: authorizing operations or transactions that  may involve conflicts of interest (i) with the company or  group companies; (ii) with directors or their related par- ties; (iii) with shareholders holding significant stakes or  represented on the Board of Directors and their related  parties; (iv) with senior management and executives;  as well as (v) regarding any other relevant transaction  concerning the same, except where it is not necessary  pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article 41.5 of  the Board of Directors Regulations. b. The basic responsibilities of the Audit and Complian- ce Committee include providing information about tran- sactions that entail or could entail conflicts of interest  or about transactions with shareholders owning a  significant stake and, in general terms, concerning the  matters set forth in Chapter IX of the Board of Directors  Regulations. Likewise, the Audit and Compliance Committee is as- signed with the basic responsibility of approving tran- sactions entailing a conflict of interest or transactions  with a shareholder holding a significant stake under the  04 Governance,  commitments  and stakeholders  engagement Governance   48 terms set forth in Articles 35.6 and 41.4 of the Board  of Directors Regulations and in compliance with them,  when it is so charged by the Boards Chairman. Gamesa provides information about any transactions  it may effectuate with directors, major shareholders  and related parties in the periodic financial reporting  process and within the scope laid down by the Law. This  likewise includes information about the transactions of  the company or group companies with administrators  and related parties, as well as with whoever may act  on their behalf, where such transactions are not within  the normal course of business or are not carried out  under normal market conditions. This information is  also available in section C.2 of the Annual Corporate  Governance Report. The information on the mechanisms to deal with  possible conflicts of interest can be found in section C.6  of the ACGR, where considerations on the following are  set out in detail: 	Possible conflicts of interest between the company  and/or its group and its directors; 	Possible conflicts of interest between the company  and/or its group and its executives; 	Possible conflicts of interest between the company  and/or its group and its significant shareholders; 	Relationships of directors and/or significant sharehol- ders with group companies. Qualifications and expertise of  directors [4.7] Article 24 of the Board of Directors Regulations  governs the appointment process for directors and  specifically states that the Board of Directors and the  Appointments and Remuneration Committee shall  make an effort within the sphere of their competences  to ensure that the proposal and appointment of candi- dates shall fall on individuals of renowned honorability,  solvency, competence and experience. They shall take  special care regarding the individuals called upon to fill  the office of independent director. In the case of directors who are legal persons the indi- vidual who represents them to exercise the functions  of the office shall be subject to the conditions of hono- rability, solvency, competence and experience set forth  in the preceding paragraph and shall be held personally  accountable for the directors duties set forth in these  Regulations. The Board of Directors of Gamesa complies with the  principle of diversity, as it is comprised of both men  and women. There was an increase in the number of  women which form part of the Board in 2011 to reach a  total of two (2), which accounts for 20% of the Boards  composition.  As is set out in the Spencer Stuart Spain Board Index  2011, the number of women sitting on the Boards of  Directors of Ibex-35 companies only accounts for 10%  of the total number of directors, a percentage which  Gamesa doubled in 2011.  The Board of Directors is comprised of renowned spe- cialized professionals, as can be seen in further detail  in their curricula, which are available on the corporate  website. Furthermore, the members of Gamesas Board  of Directors have experience and knowledge in the area  of corporate social responsibility garnered from their  experience in companies recognized as leading firms by  the main international sustainability indexes.    04 Governance,  commitments  and stakeholders  engagement Governance   49 Mission, values, codes of  conduct and relevant principles   [4.8] Gamesa proceeded to review and update its values in  2010, which were established on the basis of Tea- mwork, Innovation, Excellence, Respect and Sustaina- bility. The following attitudes for success were likewise defi- ned: leadership, a global company and being customer- driven. Gamesas corporate principles and values apply  across the entire company in all its different regions  and to all the businesses which comprise it. Gamesa carried out three processes on these matters  in 2011: 	Gamesa Way: Gamesas corporate culture program  has disseminated the business plan and its mission,  corporate values and attitudes for leadership, which  define both the organizations objectives and its style  and way of doing things that characterize it, across the  entire organization. All employees have been given the  chance to take part in this initiative, which is aimed  at ensuring the organizations alignment, dialog and a  better understanding of Gamesa through management  teams and key groups within the company. A total of  6,644 employees (84%) took part in the program and  323 work sessions were concluded. Employees stated  a high level of satisfaction with the program (4.18 out  of 5) and a high level of commitment to the companys  mission, which reached 58.2% (an increase of 12%  compared with the data for 2008).  	Review of the Code of Conduct: Gamesa proceeded to  review of the Code of Conducts text in 2011, which was  approved on November 10, 2011 by the Board of Direc- tors. The code was placed at the disposal of employees  through the Internet  and the intranet, along with a  presentation explaining the main changes and scope of  some of the rules. It was also posted on bulletin boards  and specific explanatory chats were given to employees  lacking connections to the corporate intranet. In order  to facilitate comprehension of the codes text and ta- king into consideration the multicultural nature of the  company, it was published in five languages (Spanish,  English, Chinese, Tamil and Portuguese). An improve- ment in general knowledge about the Code of Conduct  has come about, as is demonstrated by the fact that  74% of employees believe they are well informed about  this issue (compared to 49% in 2008) according to the  results of the latest opinion survey conducted in 2011. 	Gamesa Opinion Survey: An opinion survey conducted  every two years on employees which measures indica- tors on satisfaction with the organization and on many  labor-related topics. It also identifies areas needing  improvement and analyzes the knowledge employees  have about the company. Quantitative participation  indicators are analyzed along with qualitative aspects  on satisfaction, relationships and commitment, thus  offering a better understanding of the topics assessed  or considered susceptible to improvement. The action  plans defined after the information is analyzed allow  the personnel management strategy to be focused  through programs or initiatives centered on the topics  assessed by employees. Additionally, some of the  questions broached in the survey allow perceptions  on Gamesa to be analyzed in relation to international  benchmarks, which facilitates the task of the external  consultancy firm with expertise in these matters. 14 See the heading Gamesa Way: in section 1.2 for further details. 15 See link: http://www.gamesacorp.com/recursos/doc/accionistas-inver- sores/gobierno-corporativo/reglamentos-estatutos/codigo-conducta.pdf Gamesa Way: a total of  6,644 employees (84%)  took part in the program  and 323 work sessions  were concluded  Employees stated a  high level of satisfaction  with the program (4.18  out of 5) and a high  level of commitment to  the companys mission 04 Governance,  commitments  and stakeholders  engagement Governance   50 Procedures for overseeing the  identification and management  of economic, environmental  and social performance [4.9] Gamesas governance model is structured on the  following bases:  	The Board of Directors: the highest body of go- vernance which sets and approves the companys  strategies and general policies, the business plan  and annual budgets, and oversees their attainment.  The general policies approved by this body are the  connected with the Crime Prevention and Anti-Fraud  Policy, Risk and Opportunity Control Management, the  Dividend Policy, the Corporate Social Responsibility  Policy, the Treasury Stock Policy, the Financing and  Investment Policy and Corporate Governance.

It also  maintained profitable growth due to its globalization  strategy – which enables it to take advantage of the  growth in emerging markets and diversify market  risks – and a rigorous efficiency program that allowed  the company to post double-digit improvements in its  main operating figures and maintain margins despite  operating in a complex macroeconomic and industry  environment in highly competitive markets.  Gamesas consolidated sales in 2011 reached 3.033  billion (+10%), which were driven by the recovery of ma- nufacturing activities. EBIT amounted to 131 million  (+10%) and net profit rose to reach 51 million (+2%).  The wind turbine activity increased its sales (in MWe)  by 16.5% to reach 2,802 MW, a major part of which  (92%) were made abroad, thereby consolidating its  international expansion strategy.  Gamesa managed to diversify its sales in five geogra- phic areas: sales in India were 2.6 times higher (accou- nting for 19% of total sales), while sales in LATAM and  the Southern Cone (Honduras, Mexico and Brazil) were  3.8 times higher (to reach 15% of total sales).  Europe (excluding Spain) consolidated its contribution  with 20% of total sales, with a notable contribution  made by Eastern European countries, mainly Poland  and Romania, which contributed to 14% of sales. China  accounted for 23% of sales and the USA 14%. For the  second consecutive year, Spain did not exceed 8% of  total sales. While the company consolidated itself in  regions with great wind energy potential, it also broke  into new markets and managed to make its first sales  in New Zealand, Algeria and Azerbaijan.  The recovery of in the wind turbine manufacturing  activity and the focus placed on cost controls situated  the EBIT margin of wind turbines at 4%, in line with the  forecasts for 2011. The operations and maintenance (O&M) service area  played a key role in Gamesas profitable growth due to  its contribution to the generation of recurrent revenue,  the improvement in margins and cash flow generation.  Gamesa held a total portfolio of 16,300 MW – after in- creasing its portfolio by 2,700 MW during the financial  year –, generating recurrent revenue of 250 million.  In 2011, Gamesa continued to focus on creating value in  its wind farm development and sales activity through  sales agreements for 417 MW with some of the worlds  most important of electricity utilities and the delivery  of 177 MW in Spain, Germany, France, Greece and the  USA. Gamesa is also in the final stages of building and  commissioning 734 MW.  During the period, Gamesa allocated a total of 229  million to investment in international expansion, the  launch and manufacture of new products and R&D in  new platforms. Consolidated net financial debt (NFD)  stood at 710 million, a figure which is equivalent to  twice EBITDA and in line with forecasts for the year.  In 2011, Gamesa moved forward along the three main  vectors of it 2011-2013 Business Plan: reducing the  Cost of Energy by 10%-15% in 2011, depending on the  platforms and regions, and launching new products  and services; growth, posting a 16.5% increase in the  MW sold in 23 countries to 46 customers, breaking into  new markets and an increase in the portfolio of MW  under maintenance and wind farm sales; and efficiency  by adjusting production capacity to demand, localizing  the supply chain in India and Brazil and optimizing  construction and logistics costs. 16Summary of Gamesas economic and financial results in 2011.

The company has endorsed several agreements like the  Cancun Communiqu (also the Copenhagen and Poznan  Communiqus previously), which strengthen this com- mitment calling for action to: 	Promote energy efficiency in all sectors: including  financial support as well as energy efficiency policies on  buildings, transport and industry;  	Promote low carbon emission energy systems and  the development of infrastructures and research in this  area; 	Promote emission collection and storage systems; 	Strengthen efforts in the fight against emissions of  other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous  oxide. These objectives constitute a stance to encourage  technological change and favor energy generation with  cleaner technologies. Gamesa has made a worldwi- de commitment to tackle climate change through a  reduction of CO2 emissions. Apart from the Copen- hagen Communiqu commitments, its targets also  include, among others: the European Union 20/20/20  05 Performance indicators 1. Economic dimension   64 Target; policy incentives, Production Tax Credits (PTC),  Investment Tax Credits (ITC) and Treasury Grants in the  United States; and the five-year plan in China, which  has set a target of 150-200 GW of wind energy capacity  for 2020. Gamesa operates in a market seeking a mature  technology which is in demand around the world and  undergoing continuous growth. Wind energy facilities  increased by 41.2 GW in 2011 according to the figures  published by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC).  Total wind energy installed capacity reached 238.3 GW  in 2011, an increase of 20.6% compared with 197.6 GW  installed at the end of 2010.  Thus, the transition towards low-carbon economies  makes wind energy – and Gamesa – a key player for the  worlds economies, as it provides energy free from CO2  emissions, reduces dependence on fossil fuels, increa- ses the security of energy supplies and makes a contri- bution to stabilizing energy prices. It also contributes  to providing incomes to local economies, developing  local suppliers and generating sustainable jobs while  introducing technology into the market. Social benefits [EC3] Gamesas philosophy contemplates social benefits  as instruments that offer protection and guarantee  its employees standard of living. Different levels of  coverage are set and different products and services  are offered on the basis of their professional cate- gory. The following should be highlighted among the  elements contemplated by the companys Compen- sation Policy: 	Preventive Medical Service and periodic health  screening: Company medical service that mana- ges annual check-ups and health and prevention  programs. 	Life insurance for management personnel: As part  of their compensation, Gamesa offers life insurance  to management personnel. Its guaranteed principal  is based on different remuneration levels.  	Flexible Compensation Plan (Gamesa Flex): Offers  managers at Gamesa Spain the chance to adjust  part of their compensation to obtain tax savings and  economic advantages in tax rates. The products offe- red as part of this plan are health insurance, home  rentals, restaurant vouchers, computer equipment  and nursery vouchers.   The group of people can potentially benefit  from this plan was progressively extended in  2011. This, along with a greater knowledge about  its advantages, has led to an increase in those  who have decided to acquire some kind of FLEX  product or service by 25% when compared to the  second window in 2010.   A total of 628 employees decided to acquire  one or more FLEX products in the last window  in 2011.   The three most popular products offered in the  flexible compensation package in the last win- dow were health insurance, followed by nursery  vouchers and thirdly restaurant vouchers.   The savings amounted to almost 900 per year  for each employee. 	Shopping Club (Gamesa Club): Offers special shop- ping conditions to Gamesa employees. This is an area  of social benefits for Gamesa employees that deals  with certain products and services. Due to geogra- phic differences, the offers may not be available in  all regions. These advantages include discounts at  travel agencies, mortgage benefits, discounts on  rental cars, hotels, etc. Thirty-six different products  were offered in 2011. 	Family Plan: This plan encourages collaboration  with companies that facilitate striking a balance  between professional and personal life and is specific  to the Wind Farm Development and Sales area. 	Company Canteens: Restaurant services at some  of the main work centers that are wholly or partly  subsidized by the company. 	Flexible Work Day: Flexibility in clocking-in and  The transition towards  low-carbon economies  makes wind energy  – and Gamesa –  a key player for the  worlds economies,  as it provides energy  free from  CO2 emissions,  reduces dependence on  fossil fuels, increases  the security of energy  supplies and makes a  contribution to  stabilizing  energy prices 05 Performance indicators 1. Economic dimension   65 clocking-out times in order to make it easier to strike  a balance between personal and professional life. 	Share Ownership Plan (Equity Plan): In 2011, the  Share Ownership Plan in Gamesas capital offered  the opportunity to become a shareholder in the  company to all employees of any company in the  Gamesa group whose employment contract could  expire before the end of the plan on June 1, 2012. The  amount each employee decided to allocate to acquire  shares, up to a maximum of 1,200, was financed by  Gamesa and was proportionally deducted from their  net salary in monthly installments between the date  the plan was launched, April 28, 2011, until the end of  the period. In exchange for this commitment made  by employees under the framework of this plan, they  will be given one free share for every two shares they  acquire, as long as the employee continues forming  part of the Gamesa team and holds on to the shares  until the date the plan comes to an end.  	Retirement Plans / Pensions: As a general rule,  the company does not offer pension or retirement  schemes beyond those required by obligations  arising from corporate acquisitions. It is specifically  indicated that:   Gamesa manages pension plans for its emplo- yees according to the law in some geographic  areas through the company making a salary- based contribution;   In the case of executives in Spain, the company  offers them the opportunity of optimizing the  tax rate on their salaries through employee  contributions to pension schemes;   In the specific case of the United States,  employees may make contributions to their reti- rement plan through investment funds of their  choice and receive the corresponding tax advan- tages. In this case, the company matches 100%  of the employee contribution up to 4% of the  employees salary. Employees are immediately  vested with company contributions. This means  that they can take the company contributions  with them if they decide to leave the company.  Likewise, all employees in the United States  have access to our medical and dental services,  as well as to life insurance. In this case, workers  make contributions amounting to 16% and  Gamesa covers the remaining 84%. Regarding  other kinds of services, employees pay 24% and  the company the remaining 76%. 	Long-Term Incentive: At its meeting held on May  30, 2011, the Appointments and Remuneration Com- mittee of the Board of Directors of Gamesa resolved  to:   Settle the Long-Term Incentive Program 2009- 2011 in advance, which was authorized by the Ge- neral Shareholders Meeting at its meeting held  on May 29, 2009 (Relevant Disclosure 109164).  	Number of beneficiaries: 136 people,  05 Performance indicators 1. Economic dimension   66 including the Chairman and CEO (no other  member of the Board of Administration is  a beneficiary of the Program), executives  and key personnel in accordance with the  Programs terms and conditions19;  	Number of shares to be delivered:  460,90320. It is specified that 35,755 shares  correspond to the shares assigned to the  Chairman and CEO. The total number of  shares in the program account for 0.19%  of share capital. Origin of the shares to be  handed over: treasury stock.   The share delivery program linked to the  attainment of the objectives set forth in the  2011-2013 Business Plan, approved by the  General Shareholders Meeting on May 25, 2011  (Relevant Disclosure 144470), was established to  strengthen the commitment of the key mana- gement team and to bring it line with Gamesas  objectives aimed at reaching the main objec- tives set by the 2011-2013 Business Plan. The  Plan consists of an extraordinary multi-annual  incentive payable in company shares in the form  of an initial assignment to the beneficiary of  a number of theoretical shares which, after  applying certain coefficients based on the  attainment levels of some strategic objectives,  may give rise to the delivery of effective Gamesa  shares on the payment date foreseen. Gamesa  does not guarantee any minimum value for the  shares thus assigned. Should it be necessary or  convenient for legal, regulatory or other reasons  of a similar nature, the share delivery mecha- nisms may be changed in specific cases, without  altering the maximum number of shares linked  to the Plan or the essential terms and conditions  upon which the delivery of such shares depends.  Replacing the delivery of shares by the handover  of cash amounts of an equivalent value on the  delivery date is among these possibilities. In  this case, the cash equivalent will be calculated  by multiplying the number of shares that would  have corresponded on the payment date by the  share price at the close of trading on such date. Financial assistance received from government  [EC4] New R&D investment subsidies granted to Gamesa  in 2011 amounted to 10.8 million. The grants came  from European, national and regional organizations,  both Spanish and from other countries, including:  the European Commission within the FP7 fra- mework, the Center for Technological and Indus- trial Development of the Ministry of Science and  Innovation, the Government of Navarre, the Basque  Government, the Regional Development Society of  Cantabria, the Government of Scotland, the Gover- nment of Singapore and the Department of Mines,  Minerals and Energy of the State of Virginia in the  United States. In addition, Gamesa obtained low-interest credits in  2011 exceeding 12.8 million from the Technological  and Industrial Development Center of the Ministry  of Science and Innovation; the Ministry of Industry,  Tourism and Commerce; and the Basque Govern- ment. Gamesa has no record of any public administrations  holding an interest in the share capital of compa- nies comprising its group. 19  The Chairman and CEO and senior management will issue the prior  report on market abuse as set forth in Article 9 of Royal Decree 1333/2005  of 11 November implementing Act 24/1988 of 28 July on the Securities  Market as from the delivery by the company of the shares, which will be  done no later than June 30, 2011. 20 In accordance with the Programs terms and conditions, any beneficia- ries unable to receive the incentive in shares due to national legislation  will receive their equivalent in cash. Such circumstance may affect benefi- ciaries with Chinese nationality for a total of 16,844 shares. 05 Performance indicators 1. Economic dimension   67 Market Presence Remuneration and compensation policy [EC5] The Gamesa remuneration and compensation policy is  a key management tool used to bring the actions and  behavior of our leaders in line with the organizations  culture and objectives. Compensating employees in order to attract, develop  and motivate them involves implementing a fair and  competitive remuneration strategy, which provides an  opportunity to fully reward all employees and includes  a suitable well-targeted combination of intrinsic and  extrinsic rewards that contemplates all aspects of  compensation and benefits which our employees may  demand. Within this context, Gamesas compensation system  ensures that pay is in keeping with professional levels  and market rates, allowing the company to offer its  employees a fair and competitive salary in all cases. With regards to the range of ratios corresponding to  the standard entry level wage as compared to the local  minimum wage, it is indicated for the purposes of the  calculations mentioned below that groups not expressly  covered by collective agreements are taken into consi- deration, given that the former includes requirements  and guarantees agreed upon with trade unions.  This ratio amounts to 2x in Spain, 1.8x in the United  States, 2.3x in China and 1.2x in Brazil. In the case of  India, rules are applied according to the specific market,  industry and position, as it is a highly competitive  market.  Procurement and relationship with locally-based  suppliers [EC6] Gamesa made further progress in its growth strategy in  2011 by consolidating its presence in markets where it  had already been operating, breaking into new regions  and, as appropriate, installing and strengthening its  industrial presence in expanding markets in order to  provide a response to increasing demand. This has obli- ged the company to rapidly identify, develop and train  the supply chain in each of the geographic areas where  it has a presence.  The supply chains globalization has been achieved  through: 	the contribution made by global suppliers with a local  presence; 	the development of new locally-based suppliers; 	the globalization of the supply base which accompa- nies Gamesa in its expansion. All of the above have not affected either quality or  performance. Gamesa made purchases from suppliers around  the world totaling more than 2 billion in 2011. The  company seeks to generate wealth in areas where it  conducts industrial activities and allocates its own  resources to work done at suppliers facilities in order to  ensure their technological development and compe- titiveness. In India, for instance, fiber glass structure  suppliers like Venkateshwara Fibre Glass were deve- loped in 2011, while in China foundries like Wuxi Faw  Foundry were developed. In addition, important suppliers accompanied Gamesa  in its international expansion in order to attain rapid  localization. This was the case for Hine (hydraulic  components), which has established a presence in India  and Brazil after having done so in China and the United  States. 05 Performance indicators 1. Economic dimension   68 Procurement localization levels in 2011  were as follows: In line with the Business Plan 2011-2013, supply mana- gement makes a major contribution to Cost of Energy  (CoE) reductions by working on the technology and qua- lity areas in order to: redesign the product within the  Costwise Product Evolution program and successfully  carry out 133 projects aimed at generating alternative  suppliers. Both factors contributed to cost reductions in 2011  when compared to the 2010 year-end in an environ- ment marked by prices increases in raw materials.

At the same time, it enables all recruitment  process milestones to be identified and defined to  guarantee the optimization of its different phases, in- cluding: recruitment, applicant assessment tools, hiring  and incorporation of outstanding professionals in their  areas. The process makes sure that no applicant will be  discriminated against in any phase of the recruitment  process due to reasons of gender, age, race, religion,  beliefs or opinions.  Assessment criteria deal exclusively with professional  requirements, guaranteeing that knowledge, capacities  and abilities are assessed. Compliance with prevailing  legislation on the recruitment of the disabled is likewi- se ensured and actions are taken to do away with any  kind of forced or compulsory labor by eliminating child  and compulsory labor to return debts and ensuring no  other kind of coerced labor exists. 05 Performance indicators 1.

Likewise, internal mobility, whether local or internatio- nal, is being strengthened within the business group,  thus encouraging globalization and the transfer of  knowledge.  Based on the integrated management of the talent  cycle, a wide range of complete activities on orga- nization, recruitment and assessment, along with  knowledge, training and professional experiences are  offered through the Gamesa University. Proof of this is  the international development program (i-STEP).  Taking into account the dimension of professional  experience, it is essential to include international  experience in the talent development process in order  to strengthen the globalization culture of companies,  increase the employability of people and ensure their  motivation, commitment and professional develop- ment. The i-STEP program is an annual tool aimed at deve- loping talent which consists of providing international  experience through high-impact projects lasting an  average of three months. The first i-STEP program was  implemented in 2011 and covered 19 projects. Gamesas International Office provides support to the  Human Capital Management area in the international  mobility of Gamesa personnel by ensuring the stan- dardization of conditions, internal equality between  people, the quality of processes and making criteria  objective. This office managed a total of 759 short and  long-term assignments in 2011 across all the geographic  areas where the company operates.

This also applies for those who design and oversee the implementation of  any general strategies defined with responsibility for developing specific  strategies, policies, rules and procedures for their own business unit or  division. i-STEP program  Sales and Projects Campus (project destination) N. of projects Human Capital Management United States    China   India (1) China  Brazil  Poland(1) 2 Internal Auditing Spain 1 Business excellence China  India 1 Management Control China (2) / India (1) 3 Operations  China (2) / Brazil (1) / India (1) 4 Services Brasil  United States  China  India (1) China (5) 6 Servicios United States (1) / India (1) 2 05 Performance indicators 1. Economic dimension   71 Indirect economic impacts Impact of investments in communities [EC8] In addition to generating and distributing economic  value, Gamesa exerts an influence on the commu- nities where it operates which goes beyond its own  business operations and is extended into long-term  commitment. These activities were especially relevant in India and  Brazil in 2011, where Gamesa carried out initiatives  in the areas of health, education and care for the  communitys environment.  Gamesa conducted other development cooperation pro- grams aimed at mitigating socio-economic deficiencies  in deprived areas and channeled funds in 2011 to carry  out project of this kind in India and Brazil. It promoted  these initiatives in Tamil Nadu and Anantpur (India), as  well as in So Paulo and Belm (Brazil). These projects  benefit from funding under the You choose, you deci- de program set up by the Navarre Savings Bank (Caja  de Ahorros de Navarra - CAN).    Additionally, the company also carries out numerous  programs with the community in the areas of health,  education, the environment and infrastructure develop- ment, especially in India.  	 In the area of health, Gamesa India offered preventi- ve healthcare and diagnostic services to the community  by managing general and specialized health campaigns  in several towns, including: Thadichery (Theni District),  Iluppanagaran (Tiruppur District), Giudimanagalam (Ti- ruppur District) and Pazham Kottai (Tuticorin District ). These programs covered 2,155 people, who were offered  healthcare by specialists (gynecologists, cardiologists,  pediatricians, dentists and ophthalmologists). All  patients were given blood pressure, electrocardiogram  and blood test check-ups. The prescriptions resulting  from these check-ups were fully funded by Gamesa. At  the same time, 139 Gamesa employees took part in a  blood donation campaign. 	 In the area of education, Gamesa took part in a sup- port program for two primary and secondary schools in  the town of Shirgaon (Chidoki Talud, Belgaum District,  State of Karnataka) where 439 children study. The  Gamesa Gram Jyankari Kendra (Gamesa Village Infor- mation Center) was set up and a program to fund the  purchase of computer equipment was put into effect  in order to provide the students with quality education.  It likewise sponsored with 3.5 lakhs (350,000 rupees =  5,345) the promotion of fund collection programs in  Chennai (Concerts with a Cause), which are aimed at re- furbishing classrooms, hostels and toilets for the Shri  Sharada Devi Home for the Differently Valued. 	 In the infrastructure development area, Gamesa  collaborated in the refurbishment of the Union Primary  School (Vadamalaypalyam, Tiruppur District) and has  taken part in personal hygiene and facility maintenance  programs. It also supplied electrical equipment (1,500  W) to the Gudimangalam primary healthcare center,  allowing the center to provide continuous healthcare  without outages, thus preventing the community from  having to travel to the central hospital in Tiruppur.

In the environmental area, a ground breaking initia- tive consisted of setting up a wood recycling unit at the  Chennai nacelle plant to recover wood, nacelle packa- ging materials and other supply materials to subse- quently transform them and produce school furniture.  This unit was set up in 2011 and expects to build 2,500  benches and desks in 2012. 	 The green wind turbine project is implemented at  all the wind farms in Tamil Nadu, India. The company  plans to plant trees at each wind energy site in order to  reduce the carbon footprint linked to the manufactu- ring, assembly, commissioning and maintenance of the  wind turbines, as trees absorb a considerable amount  of carbon each year. Given that 6,656 kg of carbon  emissions are linked to the manufacture of an 850 kW  wind turbine, it is calculated that 115 trees (Gliricidia  sepium) are necessary for each 850 kW turbine to  absorb their carbon footprint over twenty years. A  total of 84,600 trees were planted in 2011 (an excess of  8,850 trees to ensure their survival), which will offset  the carbon footprint linked to the 650 850KW wind  turbines installed in India in 2011. These wind turbines  are therefore deemed as carbon neutral. 	 The school uniform donation program by Gamesa  India employees to pupils of rural schools in the town  of Vadamalaipalayam should be added to this list. Each  pupil received two sets of uniforms, socks and shoes. A toy collection program was carried out in the United  States as a Thanksgiving Day food collection initiative,  which received a letter of thanks from the Catholic  Social Services. A total of 1,887 pounds of food were  collected for the Church of St. Marys Cupboard. Gamesa expects to continue with these and other community development activities in 2012 through new  social welfare projects.

The campaign has come to a very successful end with a  high degree of participation. Gamesa collected 58,500,  half of which was donated by Gamesa workers around  the world through bank transfers and donations made at  work centers. Indirect economic impacts  [EC9] Gamesa 2011-2013 Business Plan is based on three  strategic vectors: Cost of Energy reductions, growth  and efficiency. Its execution produces an indirect economic impact  generated by wealth creation in the economy through  changes in the productivity of companies, industries  and the local economy. At the same time, it improves  qualifications and knowledge in the professional com- munity and creates jobs dependent on the supply and  distribution chains. The company has continued to make progress in its  strategy of combining internal manufacturing with  external key component supplies, which maximizes  operational flexibility and optimizes investment. Consi- derable progress was made in the outsourcing of blades  and cast components by December 2011 in accordance  with the 2011-2013 Business Plan.

Economic dimension   74 Environmental management  approach Continuous improvement and collaboration in the  achievement of sustainable development are among  Gamesas commitments. From a prevention stand- point, it manages and applies good practices geared at  environmental protection and encourages information  and training on this culture. Section 3.5 of the general standards of professional  conduct also states that preserving the environment  is one of the companys guiding principles, which is  guaranteed through the approval of an appropriate  environmental policy and the implementation of an  environmental management system. Everyone who works at Gamesa should know about and  assume said policy in the area in which they operate  and should always act in accordance with the criteria of  respect and sustainability, adopt environmental best  practice habits and behavior and contribute positively  and effectively to achieving the objectives which have  been set. They should make every effort to minimize  the environmental impact arising from their activities  and from the use of the facilities, equipment and work  resources placed at their disposal, endeavoring to make  efficient use of them. Through its Integrated Occupational Health and Safety  Policy, Gamesa has set the full satisfaction of internal  and external customers as a target for all its processes,  including design, manufacturing, assembly, on-site  assembly, commissioning and after-sales service. In  order to achieve this, it has established a safe work  environment, guaranteed maximum respect for the  environment throughout the life cycle of its products  and adheres to an advanced quality system. Gamesas path to excellence is based on the following  pillars: 	Occupational health and safety is more than a priority,  it is a value. 	Commitment to responsible action regarding the  health of both people and the environment. Aware of  its interaction with its surroundings, the company is  committed to complying with prevailing legal require- ments dealing with occupational health and safety, the  environment and energy efficiency, as well with any  product regulations which apply. 	Creating and distributing wealth among shareholders,  employees, suppliers, customers and the communities  where it performs its activities.

Gamesa introduced the necessary requirements into its  management system in 2011 in order to comply with the  14064 standard on the verification of greenhouse gases  and the 14006 standard on ecodesign. As part of its environmental commitment materialized  through certification in accordance with ISO 14001 stan- dard, Gamesa conducted a verification in accordance  with the ISO 14064 standard on the base year for its  greenhouse gas emissions, 2010.  The new Gamesa G10x wind turbine platform was also  certified in ecodesign in accordance with the 14006  standard, making it the first wind turbine in the world  to be certified for ecodesign. The electric vehicle rechar- ging post developed at the Benissan plant in Valencia,  one of Gamesas non-wind energy projects, was also  certified under the same standard. Gamesa has established a system to identify the envi- ronmental and energy-related aspects of its activities,  products and services it can control and influence  within the scope defined for its Integrated Manage- ment System.  The system takes into account new or planned projects,  as well as new or modified activities, products and  services. In this regard, the company is equipped with  a multi-site system maintained in accordance with the  ISO 14001:2004 standard, which includes procedures  to monitor company indicators (IBE-1-003) and analyze  the root cause of deviations, including non-conformi- ties, in the supply chain (PBE-1-008).  Timely corrective action and the extension of any les- sons learned to the rest of the organization result from  this root cause analysis. The detection of areas needing  improvement and the launching of preventative action  are based on the PMA-1-004 procedure. Training and  awareness raising activities among Gamesa personnel  are conducted following internal procedure PRH-1-001.  Other relevant specific procedures (not an exhaustive  list) include documentation management (PBE 1-002),  control of legal and other requirements (PMA 3.2.01),  the environmental control system (PMA 4.6.01) and  the internal auditing procedure for both the health and  safety system and the quality system (PBE-1-002).

As in the case of the majority of orga- nizations, electricity is the companys only significant  form of intermediate energy, because Gamesa does not  consume other energy products such a steam or water  from external water heating or cooling plants, refined  or synthetic fuels, bio-fuels, etc.   79 Energy savings [EN5] Regarding costs and benefits, the search for ener- gy efficiency is an aspect to reduce carbon dioxide  emissions, encourage competitiveness and stimulate  an advanced technology and product market in order to  improve energy efficiency. Gamesa has the resources  and capacity to identify and optimize its own processes  from an energy-related standpoint through energy  audits on both in-house and external customers. The energy audits conducted on Gamesa by the energy  efficiency team during the year identified potential  energy cost savings amounting to 361,548 by avoiding  16,156 GJ/year, which is equivalent to a saving of 1,354  tons of CO2. Initiatives to provide energy-efficient products and  services [EN6] Gamesa reached important milestones in the area  of Cost of Energy (CoE) optimization in 2011 through  the development of more efficient products and new  operations and maintenance (O&M) services. A reduc- tion of 10%-15% in the Cost of Energy was achieved,  depending on platforms and geographies. It was granted Type IEC WT01 certification by GL Re- newables Certification (GL) for the G128-4.5 MW wind  turbine, thus facilitating financing for this turbine and  for the wind energy projects that include it. The G128- 4.5 MW wind turbine is the first product resulting from  the new technologies fully developed by Gamesa, which  will in the future make the new G10X-4.5 MW product  family the leading product in the Cost of Energy. These  technologies include: MultiSmart, Innoblade, Com- pacTrain, GridMate and Flexifit.  The platform has demonstrated its environmental lea- dership by making the G128-4.5 MW wind turbine the  first to obtain an Ecodesign certification from TV cer- tification agency in accordance with the ISO14006/2011  (Environmental Management Systems – Guidelines for  Incorporating Ecodesign) standard, a certificate which  proves its minimal environmental impact during its life  cycle.  Progress continued in 2011 on the new G9X-2.0 MW pro- duct platform, which optimizes the preceding platform  (G8X-2.0 MW) and manages to provide double-digit  productivity enhancements to the wind turbine. After  managing to go from the design phase to the prototype  in only eighteen months and industrializing the product  in four regions simultaneously, two prototypes were  assembled in Navarre, Spain and Colorado, USA. The  first commercial units were installed for customers in  Baitugang, China and Tamil Nadu, India. By December  2011, Gamesa had entered into a framework agreement  for 1,300 MW of the G97-2.0 MW turbine in India and  firm agreements for 356 MW in the USA, Europe, China  and India. This wind turbine contributed to more than  5% of the groups sales in 2011. The design of new operations and maintenance (O&M)  services also played an essential role in the Cost of  Energy optimization which Gamesa offers to its custo- mers through the commercialization of new products  like the GPA (Gamesa Premium Availability) program.  Gamesa offers the highest availability warranty in  the market at a lower price to customers through this  program. The GPA program also aims to achieve a 99%  availability rate in the Gamesa fleet and has already  managed to reduce operating costs by 10% in the wind  farms where it has been implemented. In the area of  CoE improvements, the company launched a project  in 2011 aimed at lengthening the useful life of the  G4X fleet through an enhancement implementation  program and maintenance task adaptations, which will  allow the fleet to reach a useful life of 35 years under  the best operating conditions whilst keeping operating  costs at current levels.  The G128-4.5 MW  wind turbine  has demonstrated  its environmental  leadership by being  the first to obtain an  Ecodesign certification,  which proves  its minimal  environmental impact  during its life cycle   2. Environmental dimension 05 Performance indicators   80 Initiatives to reduce indirect energy consumption   [EN7] In the area of CoE optimization, Gamesa continues to  work on improving the availability and reliability of its  wind turbines and placed special attention on reducing  the cost of materials in 2012.  It will likewise develop two new wind turbines during  the year as part of the G9X-2.0 MW platform: the G97- 2.0 MW Class II and the G114-2.0 MW wind turbines.  In the O&M services area, the company will continue  to focus on the continuous improvement of its fleets  availability in order to improve the current level of  availability, which already exceeds 98%, through main- tenance programs like the GPA program. A variety of actions aimed at reducing energy consump- tion were implemented and carried out in different  areas of the organization (see the Emission Verification  Report included in section 6.5 of this report). It was cal- culated that the emissions prevented by these actions  totaled 148 tons of CO2 eq. In order to offset the carbon footprint, the 1,000,000  Trees project was carried out it India. This project  consists of planting trees of different species, which  are suitable for each area like Gliricidia and Jatropha, in  collaboration with the Tamil Nadu Agriculture Research  Institute. The aim is to plant 115 trees for each wind  turbine installed so that the emissions generated  during its manufacturing and maintenance are offset  over the machines average useful life of twenty years.  A total of 84,600 saplings had already been planted by  the end of 2011. Water Total water withdrawal by source [EN8] The withdrawal of groundwater is also included in the  case of Europe and the rest of the world. This is a cha- racteristic which does not occur in the other geographic  areas, where water consumption comes from the water  supply network. There is no record of any water sources being signifi- cantly affected by water withdrawals made by Gamesa  in 2011 [EN9]. This means that there were no with- drawals which amounted to more than 5% of the total  annual average of any water mass or withdrawals from  water masses recognized by experts as being especially  sensitive due to their relative size, function or unique  nature, or because they are a threatened or endangered  system (or because they shelter protected plants or  animals), or from Ramsar wetlands or from any other  locally or internationally protected area. As regards the volume of recycled and reused water,  all sanitary effluents from the Chennai plant in India  are treated at a reverse osmosis treatment plant and  reused to water the facilitys own green areas.

Environmental dimension 05 Performance indicators   85 Emissions of ozone-depleting substances  [EN19] Chlorofluorocarbon substances (CFCs) and halons, tradi- tionally used as coolants and propellants, affect the  ozone layer if they are released into the atmosphere.  The presence of these substances at Gamesa is margi- nal and found mainly in fire extinguishing equipment  and cooling systems. Maintenance of this equipment,  which works in closed circuits, is done in accordance  with prevailing legislation. NO, SO and other significant air emissions [EN20] The calculation of these emission indicators, measured  in tons, is obtained by adding the emission values of  each of the parameters and sources. In order to do  so, quantitative measurements were conducted at  each source by an Authorized Control Entity and the  total emission factor was applied by considering each  sources throughput and hours of operation. This table excludes emissions from Gamesas factories  in China, as the emission parameters subject to control  at these plants are different according to prevailing  Chinese regulations.

Environmental dimension 05 Performance indicators   86 Total wastewater discharge [EN21] The only discharges that come about at Gamesa are  linked to the use and consumption of sanitary water.  Discharge values are calculated by taking into account  overall water consumption at each facility and subtrac- ting water for industrial use, which in most cases is  evaporated through cooling towers. A factor of 80% is  applied.  As regards pollutants in discharges, the method of  calculation contemplates values for the different  parameters measured by an Authorized Control Entity  and the flows discharged at each Gamesa center. The  value shown is obtained from the statistical average of  all the measurements.

Environmental dimension 05 Performance indicators   87 Total weight of waste managed [EN22] The increase in waste generation in the United States  is linked to an increase in production at both centers  (blade and nacelle manufacture), which grew by 30%  and 37% respectively. Similar behavior can be seen in Gamesas production  centers in China, which is linked to the increase in acti- vity, as well as to the initiation of CR20 wind generator  assembly and the assembly of G8X platform nacelles,  which respectively rose by 50% and 40%. Blade produc- tion also rose significantly by 20%. The environmental management system implemented  in the Gamesa group prevents accidental spills through  technical control elements (spill trays, loading and un- loading areas, storage of chemical products, protection  of the rainwater network, etc.), along with manage- ment mechanisms. Likewise, there are methods to  detect, report and correct any environmental anoma- lies.

Environmental dimension 05 Performance indicators   88 There were no significant spills at Gamesa in 2011.  Significant spills are construed as spills that cause da- mage to the facilitys external surroundings and require  giving notice to the appropriate public administration.  However, fifteen (15) small spills of hydraulic and lubri- cation oil having a total volume of 1.5 m3 (1,500 liters)  were recorded. All of these were recorded, notified and  corrected in accordance with internal management pro- cesses. It was not necessary to adopt any exceptional  corrective measures.  Furthermore, Gamesa does not transport, import,  export or treat any waste classified as hazardous ac- cording to the Basle Convention. Likewise, none of the  waste generated by Gamesa is shipped internationally.  [EN24] No spills or run-offs into aquatic habitats that could  have a significant impact on water resource availability  were recorded in 2011.

Environmental dimension 05 Performance indicators   89 Products and services Initiatives to mitigate environmental impacts [EN26] Gamesa made progress in the attainment of its annual  sustainability targets in 2011.  The Gamesa G10X - 4.5 MW wind was granted an  Ecodesign certification by the TV certification agency  in accordance with the ISO 14006/2011 Environmental  Management Systems – Guidelines for Incorporating  Ecodesign standard, which proves its minimal environ- mental impact and makes it the first wind turbine to  have obtained the Ecodesign certification in the world. This certification has placed Gamesa at the cutting  edge of sustainability and environmental excellence,  making it the world leader in technology. It is the  first renewable energy company in the world to have  obtained a certification in this standard international  and the first to have developed an eco-designed wind  turbine. Gamesa has also designed and developed an electric  vehicle recharging post as part of its non-wind energy  product range, an area in which the company wishes to  continue with its technological diversification. Developing the first eco-designed wind generator in  the market constituted a demanding challenge for the  company. This project was led by a multidisciplinary  team of 24 people belonging to different units and  areas of the company. The challenge culminated in  success and required the participation of approximately  400 people. During the year, Gamesa also worked on designing and  developing an electric vehicle recharging post at the Ga- mesa Electric factory in Valencia. This is an innovative  product for both the market and the company. It forms  part of its technological diversification strategy and  one of its initial starting point requirements was that it  should be an eco-designed device. Other activities connected with mitigating the environ- mental impacts of products and services include: 	Setting up a materials testing laboratory in Aoiz; 	Gamesas participation in the Company and Environ- ment Program; 	Gamesa being a founder-member of the Basque Eco- design Pole in Spain and the Bilbao Ecodesign Center  (BEC);  	Drawing up an Environmental Product Declaration  (EPD) on kWh of wind energy generation based on a  Gamesa G90-2.0 MW wind turbine is one of the targets  for 2012. Products sold and packaging materials [EN27] Each wind turbine is made up of a large number of  structural, electrical and control components. The ty- pes, shapes and materials which comprise the different  components are likewise diverse. A large part of these  are essentially recoverable materials having considera- ble added value like steel and other materials, making  them highly attractive when it comes to their recycling.  Ninety per cent of the materials used to manufacture  the Gamesa G5X-850 kW and Gamesa G9X-2.0 MW  wind turbine models are made of different kinds of  steel. This information makes it possible to take decisions  on and plan for the disposal of the waste generated  when wind generators and wind farms are dismantled.  It likewise enables the recycling percentage of said  materials to be calculated using weight. Regarding the  current wind turbine dismantling plan, the end-of-life  options for the main wind turbine components will  serve to delve further into these issues and bring the  current dismantling plan up to date.

Environmental dimension 05 Performance indicators   91 Management Approach  The companys human capital management model and  therefore its value proposition to its employees are  based on respecting and complying with universally  recognized international standards, both of a general  nature as well as related to human rights and labor.  Their most essential principles are included in Gamesas  Code of Conduct and its Principles of Corporate Social  Responsibility.  Safeguarding the health and physical integrity of  people is a corporate priority and is implemented  through a variety of the companys policies and pro- cesses, as well as through the resources allocated for  such purpose. The constant reduction in the accident  frequency and severity rates form part of the targets  which apply to all people who manage their targets in  accordance with the Gamesa Management by Objecti- ves (GMBO) procedure.  Gamesa promotes the equality of people. The first  actions defined in the Equality Plan were carried out in  2011. This plan was agreed upon with the CCOO, UGT  and ELA trade unions in Spain in 2010 as a framework  of reference for equality management within the  company. In this regard, work is being carried out to  adequately monitor indicators which take into account  gender-related issues and means to ensure the inclu- sion of equality principles in key personnel manage- ment procedures, along with the inclusion of cultural  aspects related to values like respect for or sensitivity  to Gamesas key stakeholders.  The Harassment Prevention Committee has likewise  been formally set up and has its own internal regula- tions. It holds responsibility for safeguarding complian- ce with the Harassment Prevention Protocol to prevent  sexual or moral harassment and mobbing. Gamesa  United States has its own regulations on these issues.  Gamesa signed a framework collaboration agreement  with the FSC ONCE Foundation in March 2011 to encou- rage the participation of the disabled, as well as to work  on raising awareness among the companys employees  on issues related with disability. The agreement has  allowed any disabled people with suitable professional  profiles, experience and technical qualifications to take  part in the companys recruitment processes.  All talent recruitment, development and management  processes are governed by the principles of equality,  merit and capacity. Nobody should be subject to discri- mination due to their gender, age, race, religion, beliefs  or opinions. All applicants are assessed by using criteria  that exclusively deal with professional requirements,  thereby ensuring proper assessment of their knowled- ge, capacities and abilities.  The sustainable Human Capital Management value  proposition that has imbued our processes between  2009 and 2011 is the best synthesis of our policies,  which are based on the creation of a human team  capable of delivering maximum performance and only  possible from a standpoint of business-driven priori- ties. These are grounded in the development of quality  jobs, employability management, talent management  and commitment, along with models of relationships  with the surroundings focused on exerting a positive  influence on the basis of a solid corporate culture.  The guiding principles of the three-colored company  continue to permeate our policies: Blue wind: means high performance and  commitment to the company  Green planet: means a positive  influence on our social and  environmental surroundings Orange people:means spe- cialization as differentiation  and entrepreneurial spirit as  growth 3. Labor practices Performance indicators Human Capital Management Sustainable value proposition: the three-colored company 05   92 Gamesa redefined its corporate values in 2010 from  the perspective offered by the Business Plan and in  keeping with it. Work was carried out during the year  to implement them across the organization with the  involvement of senior management. The company  believes that a solid corporate culture constitutes a ma- nagement element that differentiates successful com- panies, underlying an organization driven by success,  a highly efficient working environment and an ethical  commitment. It also leads to the creation of a good  working environment and is the best motivation for the  development our employees professional capacities.  Respect, teamwork, sustainability, excellence and inno- vation constitute the essential values of reference behind  Gamesa's conduct within a global organization having a  vocation for leadership and driven by customer needs.  These values and attitudes for success were conveyed to  all employees through the Gamesa Way project in 201128.  This global corporate program covered more than 80% of  the companys professionals around the world. It is cen- tered on the business plans deployment, as well as on  the companys mission, vision and attitudes for success.  It is centered on the business plan's deployment, as well  as on the company's mission, vision and attitudes for  success and has allowed the style Gamesa wishes to im- press on the performance of its activities to be conveyed  through the organization's executives and key groups. The commitment to these ways of doing things and  understanding the companys activity are reflected by  the fact that 10% of senior managements individual  activities have undergone assessment on compliance  with the values and attitudes for success. In addition,  the Gamesa Way program now forms part of the wel- coming process put into place for the companys new  employees. The Gamesa Opinion Survey allowed the level of  satisfaction among employees around the world to be  known in 2010. It also measured the evolution of their  commitment levels when compared to the previous  survey conducted in 2008. Between both surveys, Ga- mesa carried out 120 action plans, which have allowed it  to improve overall satisfaction and commitment levels,  in addition to having a clearer idea of how human  capital management processes are viewed from within  the organization. Gamesa manages the performance assessment process  affecting 4,540 employees as an essential link between  the work done by professionals and the companys  business objectives. This process includes: 	The Gamesa Management by Objectives (GMBO)  system enables the strategic guidelines set in its  Business Plan and annual budgets to be translated into  operating actions by reaching agreement on annual  targets. The assessment of these targets outcomes  has a direct impact on Gamesas annual variable remu- neration system. 	The assessment of performance factors enables our  personnels degree of alignment and performance with  regard to strategic competencies and the companys  corporate values to be measured.  The process has an impact on annual salary rises and  likewise serves as a point of reference to define trai- ning activities and professional development actions  established by employees and their corresponding  managers. In addition, there is also a Remuneration and Compen- sation Policy, which is used as a key management tool  to bring the actions and conduct of personnel into line  with the organizations objectives and culture. Rewarding people at Gamesa in order to attract, de- velop and motivate them involves implementing a fair  and competitive remuneration strategy, which provides  an opportunity to fully reward all employees and inclu- des a suitable well-targeted combination of intrinsic  and extrinsic rewards that contemplates all aspects of  compensation and benefits which our employees may  demand.  28 See page 14 for further details Respect, teamwork,  sustainability,  excellence  and innovation  constitute  the essential values  of reference behind  Gamesa's conduct Gamesa has a  remuneration  and compensation  policy as a  key management tool  to bring the actions and  conduct of  personnel into line with  the organizations  objectives and culture 3. Labor practices Performance indicators 05   93 The basic elements of our remuneration include: 	Fixed remuneration: determined by position and level  of responsibility, as well as by individual contributions  to performing the job. Gamesa has a system of salary  bands, the purpose of which is to bring each jobs  level of responsibility in line with market rates and/or  knowledge/skills;  	Annual variable remuneration: recognition of the  attainment of each persons individual targets and  directly benchmarked to the attainment level of key  business results; 	Share ownership plan: designed to strengthen emplo- yees commitment to and trust in the Gamesa project; 	Long-term incentives: benchmarked to the Business  Plans attainment. 	Benefits: aimed at providing protection and ensuring  the standard of living in the short to medium-term  depending on the needs of each person on the basis  of his/her lifestyle. Initiatives like the Gamesa Flex  program make compensation flexible and offer services  which are of interest to our employees.   Likewise, reward schemes are set forth in the collective  agreements which apply to Gamesa personnel. Full compensation includes recognition schemes, which  are not just financial. The Gamesa Patent and Inventors  Competition is worth mentioning in this regard. Employability is another of the essential pillars upon  which Gamesas value proposition rests by offering pro- fessional development opportunities through training  and work experience as essential aspects of the talent  management cycle managed from the companys  Corporate University. Gamesa launched its Corporate University in 2010,  an initiative through which the company expects to  contribute to the employability of its employees and to  the rest of the value chain, thereby encouraging com- mitment to and alignment with its corporate strategy  and culture. A consolidation process took place in 2011  covering all the processes connected with talent mana- gement, including: organization, recruitment, knowled- ge assessment and management, training, professional  careers and the management of key groups. The social dialog model facilitates relationships bet- ween Gamesa and workers representatives. Initiatives  like employability management in Spain, the processes  aimed at continuing with downsizing plans in 2010,  employability management of the teams at Bergondo  and Sigeiro in 2011, the Equality and the Diversity  Committees, the guarantees afforded to trade union  elections and the negotiations to update specific agre- ements at our work centers should all be highlighted as  milestones. Human capital management activities placed special  emphasis on international issues in 2011. The setting up  of two important new facilities in Brazil and the United  Kingdom made it necessary to define their organizatio- nal structure and to implement all our processes for the  new Gamesa teams in these countries.  	Brazil: central headquarters in So Paulo with 33  people from a variety of business areas, along with  a nacelle and hub assembly plant in Camaari, which  employed 34 people at the end of December 2011.  	United Kingdom: in addition to the O&M services cen- ter in Cumbernault and the Wind Farm Development  and Sales branch in Newport, the Offshore Technology  Centre in Glasgow started up its activities in July 2011.  This center had 46 employees as at December 31, 2011,  of which 21 were expatriates. The corporate office in  the United Kingdom is located in London and currently  employs seven people.

The personnel included under a collective agreement  are governed by the aspects set forth in their collective  agreement. For their part, management personnel are  entitled to specific benefits and an effort is being made  to extend these benefits to include staff covered by  collective agreements. Thus, Gamesa offers different social benefit packages  in order to adapt itself to best market practices in each  country. That is why a single benefit package does  not exist, but rather as many packages as countries  where Gamesa has a presence. In an effort to ensure  a minimum level of uniformity, the Compensation and  Benefits Policy guarantees an identical remuneration  scheme (Fixed Remuneration, Variable Remuneration  and Social Benefits) for all management personnel.  Detailed information on social benefits can be found  under EC3 indicator of the report.

In addition, fifteen trade union election  processes were held in Spain in 2011, which gave rise  to the representation set out below (the elections are  held approximately every four years and most of them  coincided in 2011): Labor/Management Relations Employees covered by collective agreements [LA4] Gamesa conceives the freedom of association and co- llective bargaining as essential tools in the relationship  with stakeholders, which help to build stable  frameworks for institutional relationships and possibly  consolidate the key pillars of any prosperous society. Gamesa offers different  social benefit packages  in order to adapt itself  to best market practices  in each country   That is why a  single benefit package  does not exist,  but rather as many  packages as countries  where Gamesa has a  presence 3. Labor practices Performance indicators 05   97 In Spain, forty Works Councils or Trade Union Delegates  have been constituted and the company holds regular  meetings with these representatives. More specifically,  a total of 130 ordinary meeting, 61 agreement nego- tiation meetings and 67 other meeting on a variety of  topics were held in 2011. Regarding the workforce downsizing scheme (ERE)  2011, ten negotiation meetings and two follow-up  meetings were held. In Brazil, for example, a country where Gamesa initiated  its activities in 2011, there are different trade union  counterparts depending on the area. Thus, in Bahia, the  employers representative is the Sindicato das Inds- trias Metalrgicas, Mecnicas e de Materiais Eltricos  da Bahia (SIMMEB). The workers, for their part, are  represented by STIM-Camaari, the workers trade union  in the metallurgical, steel, automotive, automobile  spare parts, electrical and electronic materials and  computer industries, as well in repair, maintenance and  assembly services companies.  In So Paulo the counterparts are the Sindicato das  Industrias Eltricas, Eletrnicas e Similares do Estado  de So Paulo (SINAES) for the employers and Fora  Sindical, the trade union which represents workers in  the metallurgical mechanical and electrical material  industries of So Paulo. Concerning the minimum prior notice period for organi- zational changes in Europe and Spain, legislation lays  down very strict criteria concerning serving notice about  such organizational changes [LA5]. Despite this, Game- sa goes beyond its legal obligations and gives notice of  such changes before the statutory minimum notice pe- riods. In the United States, the only legal requirement  is to give two months prior notice in the event of group  layoffs. This entitlement has not only been recognized  but improved upon in the collective agreement.  Although there are no requirements in this regard in  China and India, employees are appropriately informed  about any relevant organizational change which applies  to them in keeping with the companys standards. Occupational health and safety  Gamesa is equipped with formal procedures of a global  scope to communicate environmental, energy efficiency  and occupational health and safety matters (Standard  PBE-1-004). As regards health and safety, the company  has set up Health and Safety Prevention Commit- tees [LA6] organized by work centers. Their goal is  to promote initiatives on methods and procedures  aimed at preventing risks and to take part in planning,  putting into place and assessing the prevention policy,  along with any other matters entrusted to them by  prevailing legislation. These committees are governed  by regulations, the purpose of which is to regulate the  committees and their members in a systematic, orderly  and precise fashion at all work centers.  The entire (100%) workforce at Gamesa centers in Spain,  other countries in Europe and the rest of the world,  United States, China, India and Brazil – where industrial  facilities have been started up this year – are represen- ted by their own health and safety Prevention Commit- tees. Percentage coverage in 2010 was likewise 100%. The setting up of these committees ensures joint  participation in the design of the occupational hazard  prevention policy and in control over the execution  of measures aimed at promoting improvements in  working conditions. The following functions, among  The entire (100%)  workforce at Gamesa  centers in Spain,  other countries in  Europe and the rest  of the world,  United States,  China, India and  Brazil – where indus- trial facilities have been  started up this year –  are represented by  their own health  and safety Prevention  Committees  3. Labor practices Performance indicators 05   98 others, are the responsibility of the health and safety  Prevention Committees: 	Take part in identifying any risks that should be  assessed and controlled. 	Provide advice on the preparation, implementa- tion, assessment and review of prevention plans and  programs. 	Take part in preliminary studies on the impact on  occupational health of projects dealing with planning,  work organization and the introduction of new techno- logies. 	Be consulted on the procedures, contents and orga- nization of worker information and training activities  dealing with health and safety. 	Take part in initiatives to improve working conditions  and initiatives aimed at correcting existing deficiencies  suggested by either of the parties. 	Be consulted on the appointment by the company of  workers to be in charge of preventive functions, deter- mine such functions and assess their performance. 	Take part in the appointment of the centers emer- gency teams. 	Be consulted on the recruitment method, compo- sition and type of experts needed to make up the  Prevention Service, along with planning the activities  such service should perform and the assessment of its  performance. 	Be consulted on the hiring, sanctioning or dismissal of  the in-house preventive services members.

Be consulted on the design of health monitoring pro- grams which are adapted to risks and the assessment  of their outcomes within the constraints laid down by  the relevant legislation. 	Any others entrusted to them by specific legislation. Absenteeism rates and occupational diseases [LA7] Accident indicator management is governed by  an internal management regulation (PBE-1-007),  which lays down standard criteria for classifying,  recording, notifying, investigating and analyzing  incidents in order to determine underlying deficien- cies in the prevention system and any other factors  which may cause or contribute to incidents arising,  identify the need to implement corrective actions,  and identify opportunities for preventive action and  continuous improvement. Gamesa recorded the lowest accident rates in its  history in 2011. Along with attaining the health and  safety targets which had been set, a significant fall  of 8% in the accident frequency rate came about  during the year and, more importantly, there was  also a 29% reduction in the associated severity  rate. The frequency and severity rates only include  accidents resulting in sick leave. The hazard rate in- cludes all incidents (with or without sick leave). The  calculation of days lost makes reference to working  days, which are counted as from the day following  the accident. No labor-related fatalities were recorded among  Gamesa employees or unsupervised contractors in  2011. Gamesa recorded the  lowest accident rates in  its history in 2011 3.

The assessment of the training actions efficiency  reached 92%; 	the efforts made to investigate all accidents and inci- dents led to a total of 2,539 health and safety improve- ment actions in 2011 through programs in different sta- ges of completion, of which 79% were fully completed; 	a total of 21,549 safety inspections and 3,020 pre- ventive observations where scheduled which, together  with the risk notifications and audits conducted in  2011, identified 2,345 new improvement actions, whose  attainment rate currently stands at 90.4%. 	all the health screening check-ups were completed in  accordance with the schedule laid down. 	a global ergonomics action program, which includes  training on the prevention of muscular and skeletal  diseases and an improvement in working conditions  through the incorporation of work stations, changes  of layout or changes of tasks, among others. These  actions are aimed at reducing the accident frequency  and severity rates. 	a weighted attainment level of 90% of the annual  health and safety management plan – which contem- plates 73 lines of work around the globe – for each of  the operating and geographic areas. This program has become a point of reference for the  industry and the sector. For instance, Gamesas health  and safety team gave training to technicians working  for the National Institute for Occupational Health and  Safety and was given an award at the Occupational  Medicine and Safety Congress in 2011. The company likewise collaborates with the Global  Wind Organization (GWO), a non-profit organization  comprised of wind turbine manufacturers, in order to  achieve an incident-free working environment by jointly  setting common working standards, safety training  programs and emergency procedures with other  members. Gamesa also collaborates with the European Agency for  Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) in the Healthy  Workplaces program, developing a European campaign  on safe maintenance, assessing and improving the  preventive culture in maintenance, raising awareness  among personnel and encouraging employees to make  a commitment to the basic rules and procedures of  health and safety. 3. Labor practices Performance indicators 05   101 Absenteeism Calculation of the absenteeism rate is defined as the  number of hours lost / number of hours worked. This  criterion is applied in Europe and the rest of the world,  China and India. In the case of the United States,  absenteeism is defined as the total of scheduled hours  of work which have not been worked due to particular  market characteristics. The most significant increase in absenteeism rates in  2011 came about in India due to the increase in activity  in this country. This increase was proportional to the  net rise in the workforce in 2011, which amounted to  177%. Education, training, counseling, prevention and risk- control programs [LA8] The company has standardized systems (PHS-1-010 and  derivatives) and general criteria to ensure health scree- ning for all the companys personnel and establishes  actions which allow it to: 	detect the effects of working conditions on health  early; 	draw conclusions on the suitability of jobs for people; 	determine the need to apply or improve protection  and prevention measures; 	identify workers who are especially sensitive to  specific risks. Firstly, health screening is scheduled (through specific  protocols and annual scheduling). Medical check-ups  (initial, specific, periodic and/or after a prolonged  absence) are then carried out. Lastly, the results are  assessed and the aptitudes of employees for each  work post are adapted. This is done for all the groups  employees.   Given the characteristics and locations at which Ga- mesa operates, it has not been deemed necessary to  implement any serious disease assistance programs for  workers, their families or members of the community. The last program of this kind was carried out by the  company in 2009 as a result of the avian influenza  pandemic declared by the World Health Organization. Formal agreements and negotiations with the unions  are, as a general rule, established locally, not globally.  These agreements cover topics connected with occupa- tional health and safety, either because such issues are  regulated in the country in question or because the cri- teria, indicators and requirements of Gamesas health  and safety management model have been included in  the negotiation process. [LA9] In addition, trade union representation exists through  Health and Safety Prevention Committees, as explai- ned in indicator LA6, whenever the labor legislation  framework allows it (i.e. Spain). In their absence, there  is always workers representation when the following  issues and agreements are dealt with, among other  topics: 	workplace accident data; 	personal protection equipment; 	participation of workers representatives in inspec- tions, audits and accident investigations connected to  health and safety; 	training and education on occupational health and  safety; 	complaints mechanisms, observation of unsafe condi- tions, etc.; 	right to reject dangerous work; 	periodic inspections. Occupational health and safety plans are submitted to  the Health and Safety Prevention Committees.

Two modules of the three-module course Global Out- look & Strategic Vision were carried out in the United  States in 2011. This course was given in-house by the  IESE Business School for 22 participants. The program  focuses on understanding Gamesas business context  in the United States, analyzing financial metrics con- nected with the definition of performance and the role  of executives in strategic decision-making. For its part, the Gamesa University developed two  self-development tools for its management employees  in 2011: 	A library of management book summaries contai- ning more than 5,000 summaries, which has already  reached a total of 6,147 downloads; 	An online language platform which makes the  learning of seven languages available at different levels  and with more than 15,500 hours of learning in 2011. Gamesa maintains a specialized training center, the  Gamesa Department, within its Corporate University. It  is a training resource aimed at: customers: for training required by agreements or on- demand training; internal personnel: for employees and/or new recruits; subcontractors: external personnel subcontracted by  Gamesa and/or suppliers. This tool has different training centers in Spain, the  United States and China and is expected to expand  to the United Kingdom and India in the near future. It  has a catalog of more than 50 different courses and  held more than 200 course registration processes in  2011 specializing in the Gamesa G5X, G9X and G10X  platforms and their mechanical, electrical, electronic,  hydraulic, construction and assembly, maintenance  systems, etc. The centers can count on a team of almost fifty  trainers, including full-time specialists in the area of  each component, and the participation of Gamesas  suppliers. The balance for 2011 recorded 2,000 hours  of face-to-face training attended 323 external people  (mainly customers and subcontractors). Training to support employability [LA11] Gamesa has had a strategic Human Capital Manage- ment program since 2009. Its aim is to support the  employability of its personnel, one of the objectives of  the Companys senior management. The need to provide a response to increasing produc- tivity and efficiency needs includes improving the  employability of employees, which on the one hand is  based on training-driven professional development and,  on the other, on professional experience. From the standpoint of training, Gamesa offers a wide- ranging catalog, where the organizations technical  knowledge is structured and clarified. The new Training  Catalog containing 381 courses was released in 2011. Its  contents are taught both internally by in-house staff,  as well as externally at the companys cost. The catalog  supports the drawing up of Training Plans and is organi- zed into Campuses (geographic areas), Departments  (business units) and Schools (corporate matters).  Access is free and done online through the intranet. There are also management skills programs aimed at  executives, managers, specialists and supervisors. The  methodology and depth of knowledge of each of the  management skills are tailored to each group (total  training in this area amounted to 45,253 hours, 14% of  total training in 2011). The Gamesa University  developed two  self-development tools  for its management  employees in 2011: a library of  management books  and an online  language platform 3. Labor practices Performance indicators 05   104 The internal mobility program took on special relevance.  In 2011, 752 processes where managed (33% more than  in 2010), which can be broken down as follows: Mobility program 2011 Transversal mobility Vertical mobility International mobility Europe and the rest of the world 306 190 70 Gender balance (M/W) 214 (70%) / 92 (30%) 129 (68%) / 61 (32%) 63 (90%) / 7 (10%) United States 26 46 1 Gender balance (M/W) 20 (77%) / 6 (23%) 38 (83%) / 8 (17%) 1 (100%) / - China 42 53 1 Gender balance (M/W) 25 (59%) / 17 (41%) 38 (83%) / 15 (17%) 1 (100%) / - India 15 2 0 Gender balance (M/W) 13 (87%) / 2 (13%) 2 (100%) / - - / - Total mobility 389 291 72 Other initiatives included under employability ma- nagement and focused on adapting the structure to  production needs were as follows: 	merging of the Bergondo and Sigeiro work centers:  due to the fall in demand and the adaptation of plat- forms, a decision was taken to restructure the business  towards large component repairs and providing assis- tance at a facility (Sigeiro). This merger has allowed  the employability of 41 workers at Sigeiro and 33 at  Bergondo to be ensured; 	adaptation of the blade units capacity (people from  different plants were moved temporarily), which led  to the assignment of fifteen people to India to provide  start-up support and training, six people to China to  provide start-up support and training and one person to  the United States for the beam process workshop; 	other movements between plants in Spain to deal  with production needs and to manage employment  better meant that 20% of the direct labor force at  Cuenca (six people) moved to Valencia for eleven  months, eight people from Somozas were assigned    to Tudela to provide production support and two  people from Somozas were assigned to Compass  Transworld Logistics (CTL) to provide support to  repairs; 	two people from the nacelle unit were moved to India,  two were assigned to China, another two were moved  to Brazil and another fifteen people were assigned to  other areas and plants; 	it should be pointed out that 38 employment relief  contracts were signed in Spain, a formula agreed upon  with social partners in work centers having an elderly  workforce (only from the age of 62); 	lastly, 61 Indian employees were assigned to China for  several months at the beginning of 2011 until November  2011. The average length of these assignments was five  and a half months. Their task was to receive technical  on-site training on the Gamesa blade manufacturing  process, so as to be capable of manufacturing blades at  the new factory in Halol, India where operations were  started up in October/November 2011. The recruitment procedure implemented at Gamesa  includes a process which allows the reasons behind  people voluntarily leaving the company to be known.  This process is conducted through an interview held  between a Human Capital Specialist and the person  wishing to leave the company. The information provi- ded at this interview is then used to improve human  capital management processes. In 2011, Gamesa has  managed 752 internal  mobility processes, a 33% more than  in 2010 Other initiatives  included under  employability  management  have been focused  on adapting  the structure 3. Labor practices Performance indicators 05   105 The company has policies and procedures (i.e. PRH-1- 004) in place that determine the Integrated Perfor- mance Management Processs framework and criteria.  These policies and procedures enable the performance  of people to be assessed during a specific period of  time, as well as to design the necessary development  activities with a view to employee performance in the  future and to set a fair level of remuneration which  ensures internal equity. [LA12] On the one hand, this process enables performance to  be assessed based on a small number of competencies  and, on the other, GMBO target attainment levels to  be evaluated, linking the outcome to the remuneration  variable. This conceptual process also includes a perso- nal development dimension through the setting of an  Individual Development Plan for each employee. The monitoring of individual commitments made to  the Gamesa Way corporate culture program were added  to performance assessment in 2011. As part of this  program, each employee makes a commitment to start  doing, stop doing or continue doing certain aspects con- nected with corporate values and attitudes for success.

Labor practices Performance indicators 05   106 Diversity and equal  opportunities Composition of governance bodies and the workforce   [LA13] The increase in the workforce corresponding to ma- nagers and specialists is in line with the real increase  of the average workforce in 2011 (a difference of 1,095  employees between December 2011 and 2010) and is  due to the companys globalization strategy and its  consolidation in the Indian market, where Gamesa grew  by 177% in 2011. Gamesa incorporates equality, cultural diversity, the  fight against discrimination and the promotion of equal  opportunites in its human capital management. In  keeping with this commitment, the basic salary ratio  between men and women is 1:1 (taking as a reference  the base salary, not including additional remuneration  due to seniority, social benefits and other benefits).  [LA14] There are over fifty nationalities at Gamesa, mostly  Spanish, Chinese, Indian, American and Brazilian, co- rresponding to the geographic areas where the greatest  number of employees are located.

Labor practices Performance indicators 05   107 Management Approach  Gamesa and the companies which comprise it are com- mitted to respecting human rights and public freedoms  through the application of the contents of the United  Nations Global Compact, which Gamesa formally en- dorsed on December 21, 2004. They are also committed  to preserving the natural environment in which they  perform their activities, collaborating in the sustainable  development and well-being of the communities with  which they have established relationships and cons- tantly promoting equal opportunities. As such, they  are committed to respecting minimum international  standards on the protection of the fundamental rights  and freedoms of the people affected by their opera- tions and, more specifically, the United Nations Norms  on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations  and Other Business Enterprises with regard to Human  Rights, the OECD Guidelines, the Tripartite Declaration  of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and  Social Policy of the International Labor Organization  (OIT/ILO) and the Womens Empowerment Principles  of the United Nations Development Fund for Women  (UNIFEM). Gamesa is likewise committed to doing away with all  kinds of forced or compulsory labor, as well as to the  elimination of labor done under harsh, extreme, inhu- man or degrading conditions, child labor and compul- sory labor to return debts and to the disappearance of  any other kind of coerced labor. In order to ensure equal opportunities and avoid any  kind of discrimination, employee recruitment and  promotion are done on the sole basis of the principle  of merit and based in each case on the requirements of  capacity and, in particular, respecting the principle of  equal treatment for men and women. Gamesa likewise  carries out a personal and professional training policy  for its employees, encouraging an atmosphere in which  equal opportunities reaches each of them by ensuring  there is no discrimination due to reasons of race, gen- der, ideology, disability, beliefs or any other personal,  physical or social trait and rejecting any manifestation  of harassment or any other kind of behavior which  generates an intimidating or offensive environment for  the personal rights of employees. These and other principles and rules of action are set  forth in the Code of Conduct33, a breach of which would  give rise to infringements laid down in legal, corporate  and labor provisions. Irrespective of the office or hierar- chical position they may hold, no person thus affected  may request, require or order actions or behavior which  contravene the provisions of the Code of Conduct.  Furthermore, none of the people thus affected shall  accede to requests, requirements or orders contrary to  the Code of Conduct, nor may they seek justification for  illegal behavior in them. Investment and procurement  practices There were no significant investment agreements34  in 2011 that could endanger the protection of human  rights, affect the companys reputation or the stability  of such investments. For further details, see the 2011  Legal Report section 2g). [HR1] Likewise, Gamesas General Procurement Conditions  explicitly include provisions on the respect for human  rights and labor practices, as well as an evident stance  against fraud and corruption. Gamesa is now working  to ensure they are fully implemented across its entire  supply chain. Among other aspects, the terms and  conditions: 33The Code of Conduct of Gamesa Corporacin Tecnolgica, S.A. and its  group companies (revised text approved by the Board of Directors on Nov- ember 10, 2011) (3rd review) is available at: http://www.gamesacorp.com/ es/accionistas-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/normativa-interna/ 34Significant investments are construed to be any that must be disclosed  as Relevant Disclosures to the National Securities Market Commission  (CNMV), and any information the knowledge of which could reasonably  affect an investor to buy or transfer securities or financial instruments  and which could therefore noticeably affect their listing in the secondary  market will be deemed as such. 4. Human rights Performance indicators 05   108 Among other aspects, the terms and conditions  require suppliers to avoid employing minors directly  or indirectly pursuant to the agreement contained in  Convention 138 of the International Labor Organization  (OIT/ILO); and lay down the suppliers commitments to  not employ forced or compulsory labor, to not punish  or threaten their employees and to avoid any kind of  discrimination. Similarly, these terms and conditions set forth that  suppliers must impede any kind of fraudulent activity  by their representatives concerning any amount of  money received from Gamesa or from the companies  comprising its group. Gamesa governs its relationship with suppliers through  its General Procurement Conditions or agreements.  The coverage levels of direct procurement volumes and  related suppliers serving the nacelle, blade and tower  units were as follows in 2011: One of the priority lines of work in 2011 consisted of as- sessing compliance with matters connected to human  rights in the global supply chain [HR2]. An internal mul- tidisciplinary team conducted a human rights diagnosis  and the corresponding analysis on the supply chain  (Gamesa 2011 CSR Survey) on a total universe of 4,828  suppliers as part of a complex process, which includes  adapting internal procurement processes, certification  requirements and supplier monitoring.  This survey had a representative response rate of 30%  of total procurement volume (referring to 2010) and its  results were as follows: 	almost 100% of Gamesas suppliers stated they  complied with universal principles and international  conventions on child labor regarding the minimum  working age, guarantees on access to education and  the prohibition of assigning dangerous work to minors  under the age of eighteen. The exceptions identified  were considered as not significant; 	almost 100% of suppliers stated they maintained  practices against compulsory labor and indicated that  their employees may leave their workplace at the end  of their shifts and their jobs after the minimum notice  period; 	almost 100% of suppliers stated they reached fair and  transparent agreements. However, 24 companies (2%)  reported they held on to workers personal documents; 	regarding working conditions, practically 100% of  suppliers stated that their employees were entitled to  a decent wage and that working overtime was not ne- cessary to obtain it. Almost 6% of suppliers stated that  they did not comply with the minimum number of paid  holidays and 3% likewise indicated that they exceeded  the number of weekly working hours. This process of analysis led to an action plan on the  global chain, which is working on the following strategic  lines: 	adapting policies on relationships with suppliers; 	consolidating supplier registration processes through  the endorsement of specific commitments on the  supply chains sustainability; 	supplier auditing and assurance processes; and 	conducting periodic campaigns aimed at analyzing  human rights issues in the supply chain. One of the priority lines  of work in 2011  consisted of assessing  compliance with  matters connected  to human rights  in the global  supply chain  4.

The sessions  covered the social and business context of equality, the  situation of women in the labor market, the interna- tional and Spanish legal frameworks, and sexual and  moral harassment, in addition to conducting a detailed  review of Gamesas Equality Plan and the Harassment  Prevention Protocol to prevent sexual or moral ha- rassment and mobbing. Thirteen workers representati- ves from the Pamplona works councils took part in the  one of the sessions, along with another 39 people from  the human capital management teams. Furthermore, Gamesa has conducted a significant  ongoing training activity on the Code of Conduct in  general and on human rights, particularly since 2009.  More specifically, in 2011 the training was focused on  two highly important and complex geographic areas:  China (583 employees) and India (457 employees).  E-learning has been used to conduct the training with  contents lasting approximately an hour, which are  reviewed and authorized by the Regulatory Compliance  Unit. In addition, the Code of Conducts text was reviewed in  2011. Such review was approved by the Board of Direc- tors and placed at the disposal of employees (via the  Internet and the intranet), along with a presentation  explaining the main changes and scope of some of the  rules. It was also posted on bulletin boards and a spe- cific explanatory chat was given to employees lacking  connections to the corporate intranet. In order to facilitate comprehension of the Codes text  and taking into consideration the multicultural nature  of a global company, the text of the Code was published  in five languages (Spanish, English, Chinese, Tamil and  Portuguese). The contents of the Code and its scope were also  explained at meetings held with the different works  councils. The training set out above was complemented with  other activities conducted in 2011, including: 	approval of Gamesas Crime Prevention and Anti- Fraud Policy; 	approval of Gamesas Ethics and Compliance Program; 	express endorsement of the Crime Prevention and  Anti-Fraud Policy by the different management com- mittees at Gamesa (Gamesa Management Committee,  Gamesa China Management Committee, Gamesa India  Management Committee and Gamesa United States  Management Committee); 	dissemination of the Ethics and Compliance Program.

Human rights Performance indicators 05   110 As part of the task to disseminate the Ethics and  Compliance Program, several visits to the different  geographic areas and business units were made: Dissemination of the  Ethics and Compliance  Program 2011 GEOGRAPHIC AREAS BUSINESS UNITS (global-ww) United  States China India Brazil Business  excellence Wind Farm Dev.  & Sales Security Sales and  Projects Number of employees  trained  154 61 27 30 61 26 7 123 Total 2011 489  These training actions were focused on one of the  main principles contained in the United Nations Global  Compact, which Gamesa signed in 2004, namely Princi- ple 10 concerning the fight against corruption, extortion  and bribery. In 2011, work was also done through a working group  (comprised of the Procurement, Health and Safety,  Environment, Quality, Sustainability and Regulatory  Compliance management teams) which concluded in  the proposal to include a commitment to sustainability  (concerning human rights, ethics and business integri- ty) in the supplier registration process. This proposals  implementation is expected to come about in 2012. Lastly, members of the Management Committee re- ceive a newsletter (Compliance Unit Newsletter) every  two weeks on the topics, issues and/or trends observed  in the world of business from a standpoint of business  ethics. The information contained in the newsletter  comes from public and/or private sources to which the  Compliance Unit has access and specific authorization  for its internal use.  The outcome of these actions was reflected in an em- ployee opinion survey (Gamesa People Survey), which  showed that 74% of employees (as against 49% in the  preceding survey) stated they had sufficient informa- tion about the companys Code of Conduct and 67%  stated that Gamesa was a responsible company with a  suitable Code of Conduct in 2011. Non-Discrimination Incidents of discrimination and actions taken [HR4] The company is equipped with mechanisms aimed at  detecting potential incidents of discrimination. 	Regulatory Compliance Unit: During the course of  2011, the Regulatory Compliance Unit did not detect any  incidents of discrimination due to race, color, gender, re- ligion, political opinions, origin or social origin based on  the International Labor Organizations (ILO) definition,  or any other kind of discrimination affecting internal or  external stakeholders. Nonetheless, it should be stated  that there were two complaints on possible situations  of discrimination, which were received through the  confidential reporting channel (as opposed to three in  2010). The two complaints mentioned above invoke  Rule 3.3 of the Code of Conduct – which sets forth the  companys commitment to equal opportunities – as the  rule which had allegedly been breached. In each case,  the Regulatory Compliance Unit conducted the relevant  formalities and investigation and found that there was  no evidence of conduct in breach of the aforementioned  rule in either case. In the first few days of 2012, a complaint was received  through the reporting channel of an incident which  could constitute discriminatory behavior. In this  Un 74% de los  empleados manifiesta  disponer de suficiente  informacin sobre el  Cdigo de Conducta y  un 67% cree que  Gamesa es una  compaa responsable 4. Human rights Performance indicators 05   111 case, the person affected also brought legal action, a  situation which led to the suspension of any actions  by the Regulatory Compliance Unit until the relevant  court ruling was issued. The court case brought by the  person thus affected came to an end with a judgment  in the first instance against the defendants. After the  relevant labor proceedings were conducted, they were  dismissed from the company. 	Harassment Prevention Committee: In 2011, six  incidents were received through the reporting channel  linked to the Harassment Prevention Protocol to pre- vent sexual or moral harassment and mobbing for Eu- rope and Asia, which were rigorously dealt with by the  Committee in keeping with the principle of confidentia- lity. In the case of United States, which is governed by a  different action protocol, four incidents were dealt with  during the year. All these cases are duly documented  in the minutes and/or reports held by the Committee  members, as are the decisions which were taken. The following should be stated regarding the measures  aimed at preventing incidents of discrimination during  the year: 	Equality Plan: Gamesa approved, signed and publis- hed its Equality Plan, which was agreed upon with the  CCOO, UGT and ELA trade unions, in 2010. Likewise a  Standing Monitoring Committee was set up as part of  the Harassment Prevention Protocol to prevent sexual  or moral harassment and mobbing, which applies  across Gamesa (apart from the United States, where  Gamesa has a specific already established regulation).  Regular meetings of the Equality and Diversity  Committee were held throughout 2011 and work was  done along the lines of raising awareness and the pilot  training actions which will be deployed in the organi- zation in 2012, as well as to ensure that equality and  non-discrimination are present and ensured in all the  processes managed by Human Capital Management.  One of the main efforts was aimed at data repor- ting mechanisms in order to be able to appropriately  segment information by gender. An improvement in  employees perception of equal opportunities (between  both genders and concerning the disabled) was also  detected through the employee opinion survey. 	Gamesa has also endorsed the Womens Empower- ment Principles, an initiative led by the United Nations  Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), as well as the  United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).  	Gamesa has also initiated collaboration with the  ONCE Foundation on March 18, 2011 through an  awareness raising program on disability and the  recruitment of disabled people at Gamesa. By means of  an agreement, the parties seek to coordinate their own  resources, knowledge and experience, thereby driving  forward projects aimed at achieving the social and labor  integration of the disabled. The areas of collaboration  of this relationship include:   promoting direct access to employment for  the disabled through the recruitment of disabled  people at Gamesa;   promoting training among the disabled;   encouraging indirect labor integration of the  disabled through the procurement of goods and  services from the Special Employment Centers  belonging to the ONCE and its Foundation;   driving activities in the area of improving accessi- bility to goods and services;   including the disabled in its social responsibility  plan and strategies;   promoting dissemination and social awareness  raising activities;   other projects that contribute to improving em- ployment and social inclusion of the disabled. Gamesa  has continued  working on  its Equality Plan  and on awareness raising  program on disability 4. Human rights Performance indicators 05   112 Freedom of association and  collective bargaining The International Labor Organization Declaration on  fundamental principles and rights constitutes the  companys main standard of labor management. The  four fundamental elements are: the elimination of all  forms of forced or compulsory labor; the effective abo- lition of child labor; the elimination of discrimination in  respect of employment and occupation; and freedom of  association and the effective recognition of the right to  collective bargaining. [HR5] Gamesa has reflected its respect for and the promo- tion of labor rights in its Code of Conduct and sustainabi- lity principles, including: freedom of association, trade  union membership and the right to collective bargai- ning by working to do away with forced and compulsory  labor, child labor or any other form of coerced labor. Gamesa is aware of the role played by trade unions, not  just in internal mediation to negotiate workers labor  conditions, but also as strategic entities that exert an  important influence on the economic, social, national  and transnational spheres.  Building positive relationships with the trade unions,  as is done by the company at is centers in the United  States and Spain, requires: 	placing a firm wager on such relationships with the  support of the companys senior management and  their inclusion across the supply chain; 	establishing relationships at the appropriate level: a  national and local standpoint; 	incorporating the trade unions stance into the deci- sion making process; 	good faith, communication and trust. In China, the Trade Union Act recognizes the right of  workers to form a trade union and request support  from the employing company to do so. The National  Trade Union is currently working so that employees  may set up their own trade unions. Gamesa is coordina- ting with the National Trade Union on all the initiatives  aimed at making this proposals evolution possible. In this process, Gamesa provides coverage through  its Human Capital Management area to the activities  which would normally be provided by the trade unions  to the companys employees, such as performing social  activities, canteen services and transport services to  the work center. In India, trade union activities are set forth as a legal  right for workers and opposing them is against the law.  In this country, Gamesa is therefore not against the  formation of a trade union and no verbal or written con- dition has been stated to the workers restricting trade  union membership. The company obviously rejects any  form of reprisals against workers due to trade union  membership. As a matter of fact, it firmly supports  any measure geared at creating a positive barrier-free  working environment between management and wor- kers and is in favor of all negotiation processes. There  are currently thirty workers at the nacelle plant in India  and committees have been set up to deal with aspects  like the canteen, safety and procedures to make  suggestions and queries. The blade plant is not yet fully  operational and will join the process. The committees  are therefore in the process of being set up. Child and forced labor Gamesa has no knowledge of any activities carried out  within its corporate boundaries that involve a potential  risk of exploiting child labor [HR6] or forced or com- pulsory labor [HR7]. Section 3.1 of the Gamesa Code of  Conduct, which is aimed at respect for human right and  public freedoms, sets forth the commitment to elimi- nating any kind of forced or compulsory labor by doing  away with child and compulsory labor to return debts  and ensuring no other kind of coerced labor exists.  This condition has been extended to include the supply  chain through the General Procurement Conditions,  which incorporate this issue. 4. Human rights Performance indicators 05   113 Security Practices Gamesa is equipped with an Integrated Security  Department whose main aim is to plan and set  policies and techniques to protect the integrity of the  companys tangible and intangible assets, people,  goods, information and knowledge. This department  has a permanent staff of ten employees geographically  distributed in China, the United States and Spain. The  rest of the staff is hired through security companies  which are duly certified before the corresponding go- vernmental authorities. Gamesas General Procurement  Conditions, particularly the clauses on the protection of  human rights and the prevention of fraud and corrup- tion, apply to all contracts. [HR8] The security workforces composition varies on the  basis of the businesss needs. There was an average of  217 security guards in 2011.  Certification by a government agency authorizing  them to provide security services and the existence  of a health and safety policy are among the essential  requirements demanded from suppliers. Other awareness raising initiatives on global security  issues in 2011 well worth mentioning include: 	selection and contracting of a global security partner  in the event of having to evacuate personnel from areas  at risk; 	design and start-up of a security observatory in  countries at risk; 	integration of the trip management platform and the  security observatory; 	corporate intranet – minisite to provide support to  travelers in areas at risk; 	e-learning platform (world-wide initiative); 	best practices on integrated security. 979 employees  called upon to attend – 979 hours of training. The service is equipped with permanent communica- tion channels and queries can be made by employees.  In Europe alone, 18,103 actions concerning integrated  security issues were dealt with (anti-social behavior,  occupational accidents, information, awareness raising,  functioning of security teams, etc.). The responsibility for contracting and managing  security services lies with Gamesas Integrated Security  Department, which provides security staff with the ins- tructions and training needed to perform their duties,  particularly with respect to human rights. Evidence of  this is the fact that 100% of subcontracted security  personnel have been informed about Gamesas Code of  Conduct, as set forth in internal operating procedure  ISI-1-0011, and that such personnel undergo continuous  auditing by the Integrated Security Department. Indigenous Rights No violations of the rights of indigenous people were  detected by the Regulatory Compliance Unit during  2011.

Human rights Performance indicators 05   114 Management Approach  Gamesa contributes to the improvement of the quality  of life and wealth creation by providing its own services  like promoting and launching new business activities,  as well as by driving forward socio-economic develop- ment through non-business channels. The principles maintained in Gamesas relationship with  the community are the following: 	awareness of social change in order to better unders- tand how the needs of society in general evolve and  thus anticipate future demands of the environment; 	systematic, fluid and truthful information about  its activities that generates a climate of trust and  credibility; 	respect for the environment, complying with prevai- ling regulations and collaborating in the conservation  and improvement of same; 	job creation by leading new competitive business  developments; 	providing support to the development of disadvanta- ged groups and sectors; 	making a contribution to raising the scientific and  technological level of our environment, as well as pro- moting the use of technologies and methods of action  which are respectful to the environment; 	collaborating with institutions as platforms of activity  for the communitys improvement and development. This awareness is translated into activities having to  with the development of the socio-economic environ- ments in which the company operates through commu- nity support projects and programs. (See section EC8  for further details). The companys management approach likewise inclu- des commitments geared at respecting prevailing legis- lation in the countries where it performs its activities  and avoiding any behavior which, without breaching the  laws of the countries where it operates, would contra- vene the ethical values principles and behavior set forth  in the Code of Conduct.  In this area, Gamesa has developed regulations against  fraud and has put into practice mechanisms such as  the regulation on the prevention of conflicts of interest  and/or cases of corruption and/or bribery.  The creation of sustainable employment, the contribu- tions made to the development of local supply chains  which enrich the local socio-economic fabric and com- pliance with environmental regulations are some of the  contributions the company makes to social development. The company is equipped with several mechanisms  aimed at raising the awareness of its professionals  about a variety of issues connected with the commu- nity in which they operate, including policies, codes,  regulations and other compliance oversight tools. Community [SO1] As indicated in the management approach on  labor practices, an essential pillar of the companys  human capital management is to be found in its  philosophy of social relationships with workers repre- sentatives, namely the social dialog model. Important  milestones during 2011 include signing the second  Gamesa Collective Agreement in the United States, as  well as the agreement reached with a majority of the  workers representatives to conduct a downsizing plan  aimed at suspending operations at four plants in Spain  and ending them at one plant. (See indicator LA11 for  further details) As a result of the companys rapid expansion, the need  to create a department to provide business support  when breaking into new international markets has  been identified. This internationalization department  works on establishing the legal and labor framework,  company policies, labor calendar, employee manual and  social benefits to be applied in any countries where  local recruitment is expected.   From the standpoint of compensation and benefits,  the value proposition for Gamesa employees in their  respective countries always takes into consideration  the social benefits most in demand in the territory in  question. In order to achieve this, market studies drawn  Gamesa has developed  regulations against  fraud and has put into  practice mechanisms  to prevent conflicts of  interest, cases of  corruption or bribery  The creation of  sustainable  employment,  the contributions made  to the development of  local supply chains and  compliance with  environmental  regulations are some of  the contributions the  company makes to  social development 5.

Corruption The year 2011 marked the companys consolidation in  terms of its positioning in the fight against fraud and  the corruption in all their forms. The work performed in preceding years and a series  of measures have strengthened the organizations  commitment. The following stand out among these  measures: 	Approval of the Crime Prevention and Anti-Fraud  Policy by the Board of Directors on March 23, 2011,  which is aimed at promoting the same message among  executives, employees and third parties, namely: that  companys activities comply with the law and promote  and defend the companys corporate values and prin- ciples on sustainability, among which the fight against  corruption and the fraud in all its forms is to be found; 	Approval of the Ethics and Compliance Program,  which guarantees before shareholders, public admi- nistrations and other stakeholders, as well as before  the courts, that the company exercises, taking into  consideration the groups governance model, due  control over what it may be legally required to comply  with regarding administrators, executives, employees  and other entities which depend on the company, par- ticularly the rejection of corruption and fraud in all its  forms, including extortion, coercion and bribery, within  a framework of robust principles of corporate governan- ce based on business transparency. 	The Ethics and Compliance Program establishes and  plans the set of activities or measures to be adopted by  Gamesa in order to prevent crimes and fraud, as well as  their detection and the reaction against them should  they come about within the framework set forth in  rules 3.2 and 3.7 of the Gamesa Code of Conduct. Gamesa has developed an action plan to strengthen the  companys ethical framework and to consolidate and  promote exemplary behavior, which includes the imple- mentation of a framework of ethics and integrity across  the company, a training system having a global scope, a  suitable framework of indicators, extending complian- ce to include contractors, collaborators, suppliers and  collaborating companies, as well as the application of a  due diligence methodology on ethics and integrity for  new projects and markets. 	The collegiate nature of the Regulatory Compliance  Unit, comprised of the Chief Counsel, the General Ma- nager of the Legal Department, the Manager of Internal  Auditing and the Compliance Officer, which is entrusted  05 5. Society Performance indicators   117 with the definition, design, monitoring, updating and  effective oversight of the Ethics and Compliance Pro- gram, reporting directly to the Management Commit- tee and the Audit and Compliance Committee. It has  likewise been entrusted to exercise effective oversight  and monitoring of the regulatory environment affecting  Gamesas activities and to supervise and safeguard  compliance with the Internal Rules of Conduct Regar- ding the Securities Markets and the Code of Conduct,  holding special responsibility for promoting a culture  of compliance and the prevention of corruption, bribery  and potential conflicts of interest within the group. 	The Compliance Officer who, through delegation by  the Regulatory Compliance Unit, has been entrusted  to conduct the ordinary management of the Ethics and  Compliance Program and to promote and implement  crime prevention and anti-fraud protocols and mecha- nisms.  Other implementation and/or control measures have  been added to these measures, which are aimed at  ensuring the existence of suitable internal controls,  procedures, processes, along with action and decision- making protocols contained in the crime prevention and  anti-fraud measures. The internal rules, procedures,  processes, and action and decision-making protocols  on the matters or areas set out below were reviewed  and updated in 2011: Corporate Governance and Busi- ness Risk Policies; direct and indirect procurement of  investments and services; certification of suppliers,  materials and components; certification and monito- ring of subcontractors; investments in tangible and  intangible fixed assets; accounting policies and stan- dards; contract approval; regulation of Gamesas legal  and corporate structure, bodies of administration and  powers of attorney; management of trips, advances,  petty cash and credit cards; protection of Gamesas te- chnological assets, know-how and intellectual property;  information security; personal data protection; the use  of communication resources; occupational health and  safety; environmental protection; and general terms  and conditions of agreements. These rules cover and affect all business areas and  corporate units in any of the companys geographic  areas. It can thus be affirmed that all of them together  constitute the activity of analyzing and controlling  corruption risks. [SO2] These control systems are complemented with a  reporting channel, which underwent a standardization  process in 2011 and was made available on the intranet,  the Internet and by post. The system of rights, obliga- tions, guarantees, terms and conditions of access and  use of this channel by users were also standardized. All these tools jointly cover the entire workforce and  activities of the company with regard to corruption risk  control. Furthermore, the training actions conducted in the di- fferent geographic areas cover all of the companys bu- siness units and their recipients (489) form part of the  management group. This ensures that the company is  based on solid principles of good governance, including  the fight against corruption, the dissemination of a  culture of compliance and respect for the law among  those who form part of the teams led by those people.  [SO3] (See indicator HR3 for further details) Actions taken in response to incidents of corruption   [SO4] Twenty-two (22) reports on alleged breaches of the pro- visions set forth in the Gamesa Code of Conduct were  received through the reporting channel in 2011. Of these, two made reference to Rule 3.7 (Fight against  Fraud. Rejection of corruption and the bribery) as the  rule allegedly breached. After having conducted the re- levant investigation, none of them turned out to reveal  the existence of any conduct in breach of the rule.

Society Performance indicators   118 Public policies Gamesa takes part in the development of public wind  energy policies through its membership in industry  associations in the countries where it has a presence  [SO5]. Through these associations it also defends the  interests of wind energy and works on consolidating it  as a response to the energy crisis and climate change,  as well as a key option to meet targets on the reduction  of polluting gases.  Gamesa contributes to the formulation of wind indus- try policy positions on key issues. It helps create a regu- latory framework in which it can successfully perform  its activities and policies to reinforce the development  of wind energy markets, infrastructures and technolo- gy, including: 	the implementation of regulations favoring wind  power by developing strategic initiatives to influence  public policy so that stable markets are created and  maintained and constraints against wind energy are  overcome; 	the defense of efficient renewable energy incentive  schemes, principally feed-in-tariffs, which have been  demonstrated to be the most effective to provide  security, continuity and trust to investors. The most  developed wind markets use feed-in-tariffs; 	setting ambitious targets for the presence of renewa- ble energies in the energy mix; 	the elimination of technical, bureaucratic and market  constraints that limit the growth of wind power; 	promoting R&D and innovation; 	making politicians, opinion makers, companies, the  media, public opinion, NGOs and other stakeholders  aware of the benefits provided by wind energy. At Gamesa, relationships with public authorities are  guided by institutional respect and strict compliance  with the law, as established in section 3.14 of the com- pany Code of Conduct. Thus, any link to, membership  in or collaboration with political parties, institutions,  foundations or associations whose purposes go beyond  those of the company, as well as any contributions the- reto, should be done in such a way so as to ensure their  personal nature is clear and without involving the com- pany or its political neutrality in any way whatsoever. In the United States lobbying is a permitted, recognized  and regulated practice. The financial contributions Ga- mesa allocates to this activity are disclosed and made  available on the Lobbying Disclosure Database38. [SO6] Anti-competitive behavior Gamesa states that it has not brought or been accused  by any legal actions for anti-trust and monopoly prac- tices.  [SO7] Regulatory compliance Gamesa states that it has not been penalized for failing  to comply with any laws or regulations. As far as it is  aware, Gamesa complies with all legal provisions and  regulations. [SO8] 38 http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields  05 5. Society Performance indicators   119 Management Approach  The main products that Gamesa places on the market  include a wide range of wind turbines developed to  offer the best performance depending on the different  kinds of sites. (See indicator 2.2) The company has its own wind turbine design and  technology development capacity, which is vertically  integrated and includes the manufacturing wind turbi- ne components, in addition to assembly. This ensures  Gamesa is able to plan and control product design and  development, along with operations and maintenance  services.  From the perspective of customer health and safety,  Gamesa determines the steps, reviews, assurances and  validations at each stage of the design and develop- ment process when it is planned. It also assigns respon- sibilities and authorities of this process. In order to do  so, it manages the interfaces among different groups  involved in design and development, ensuring efficient  communications and a clear assignment of responsibi- lities. The inputs connected with product requirements  include: functional and performance requirements, any  legal and regulatory requirements which apply, infor- mation from preceding similar designs, requirements  specified by the customer and recyclability, along with  other essential design and development requirements.  As part of the systematic reviews conducted at each  stage, all the necessary aspects to ensure the inclusion  of relevant issues having to do with occupational health  and safety, the environment and energy efficiency  are included in all processes, including product design  and development, along with the management of any  changes that may have an incidence throughout the  products useful life. One of the key factors for Gamesa is being customer- driven. The companys flexibility to offer its customers  technologies, products, services and innovative ideas  aimed at improving their competitiveness is a determi- ning factor. Gamesas relationship with its customers is  therefore based on fully responding to their require- ments and meeting their needs through ongoing com- munications in order to measure the quality of service  offered, which is a differentiating element in addition  to constituting a guarantee in the market.  For this reason, the company strictly complies with  standards to ensure Gamesa wind turbines are duly  certified by renowned independent entities in accor- dance with the most current design standards and type  certifications. It includes the following measurements  and assurances in these certifications: 	Product design in accordance with standard wind  parameters (classes); 	Loads in accordance with specifications; 	Power curve measurement; 	Noise level measurement; 	Energy quality measurement; 	Production center inspection. Customer health and safety The purpose of the process known as Life Cycle  Assessment (LCA) is to assess the environmental  loads associated to a product, process or activity, taking  into account its entire life cycle. It is based on making  a material and energy balance of the system under  study, so as to identify the systems inputs and outputs  to subsequently assess the different environmental  impacts it may cause. Gamesa has had an interest in the life cycle assessment  system for quite a number of years [PR1]. The very first  LCA was conducted on a G80-2.0 MW wind turbine in  2009. It demonstrated the value and great potential of  this innovative tool, which allows a company to have  a total overview of its product or process throughout  all the stages of its life cycle and to focus on improve- ment and efficiency opportunities and on increasing  competitiveness.   The Ecowind project came to an end in December  2011. This project involved a Life Cycle Assessment of  The life cycle  assessment  of a wind turbine  allows to have  a total overview  of the product and process,  and to focus  on improvement  and efficiency  opportunities and on increasing  competitiveness 6. Product responsibility 05 Performance indicators   120 a Gamesa G90-2.0 MW wind turbine, which inven- toried 99.8% of the entire wind turbine and covered  the following components: nacelle, rotor, tower and  foundations. Today LCA has become a tool ready to be  implemented on the G9X-2.0 MW platform to optimize  the life cycle of this successful well-known product  platform. Gamesa has also conducted a life cycle assessment  (LCA) of the Electric Vehicle Recharging Point project,  upon which the evolution of the different prototypes  will be based, in order to improve the products quality,  technology, materials, sustainability and efficiency  throughout its entire life cycle, as well as to obtain an  ecodesign certification. The next steps involve deploying the tool for the G10X- 4.5 MW and offshore platforms and moving forward in  the LCA tools integration into the technology area. LCA enables an overview of the entire life cycle to be  obtained and thus allows improvement actions to be  deployed at each of its stages, including: design, raw  materials and components procurement, manufactu- ring, delivery, assembly, operation, maintenance and  dismantling. 	Design: environmental aspects are taken into consi- deration from the projects initial design stages by in- cluding the requirements the product, the subsystems,  the parts and their associated processes will have to  meet (RD - Requirements Documents), the relevant en- vironmental design assessments (EDA), environmental  design observations (EDO), and lastly the manufactu- ring process environmental impact assessment report  (MPEIAR); support and supervision activity of the first  wind farm prototype designs; 	Raw materials and components procurement:  working with the supply chain, especially the suppliers  whose activities are more environmentally friendly in  order to gain traction from its suppliers and having a  more sustainable source of supply; 	Manufacturing: the focus has mainly been placed on  reducing waste, raw material consumption and VOC  emissions. Success has been achieved at eliminating  unnecessary processes, like applying protective tape  to the leading edges of blades or cleaning trowels with  solvents. Less polluting and more efficient processes  have also been introduced, such as: Teflon trowels,  low waste and emission painting systems, ultrasound  cleaning of tools, solvent recovery distillers and part  cleaning systems equipped with water recovery at gear- box plants. At the same time less, polluting products  have been certified, like high-solid paints and low VOC  content cleaners, and chromates and halogens have  been progressively replaced; 	Delivery: use of returnable packaging between Ga- mesa centers and from plants to wind farms, thereby  minimizing waste generation and consumption of  packaging; 	Assembly: drawing up most of the assembly manuals  issued with the relevant environmental warnings and  observations. Inclusion of environmental kits and stan- dard waste containers in lists of materials; 	Operations and maintenance: integrated spill contain- ment devices designed to avoid any possible accident or  leak during operation, as well as tools for support tasks.  Operations and maintenance manuals were entirely  reviewed in keeping with the technology creation flow  and include all relevant environmental warnings and  observations. Inclusion of environmental kits and stan- dard waste containers in lists of materials; 	Dismantling: the dismantling and inertization manual  for the G10X-4.5 MW wind turbine was initiated in 2011  and will be concluded in 2012. There are plans to update  the generic manual drafted in 2005 for the preceding  G5X-850 kW and G9X-2.0 MW platforms. LCA enables an  overview of the entire  life cycle to be obtained  and allows  improvement actions  to be deployed at each  of its stages, including:  design, raw materials  and components  procurement,  manufacturing, delivery,  assembly, operation,  maintenance and  dismantling 6. Product responsibility 05 Performance indicators   121 The company is equipped with management elements  to set the activities, responsibilities and work flows  to ensure that the occupational health and safety of  in-house and external workers who will have to interact  with the product throughout its life cycle is taken into  account in the products design. More specifically,  the PHS-TEC-001 framework rule sets an appropriate  application scope for Gamesas Customer Solutions  Conception System (SC2G). The purpose of health and safety assessment is to  detect intrinsic design features that could unnecessa- rily generate future hazards or dangers arising from a  poor conception of safety conditions, which could affect  the health and safety of workers who will work on the  element designed throughout its useful life. Gamesa has no record of any incidents in 2011 arising  from a failure to comply with legal regulations or  voluntary codes on the impact of products and services  throughout their useful lives on the health and safety  of workers. [PR2] Product and Service Labeling Gamesa places special importance on providing an  appropriate degree of information and labeling on the  sustainability of its products and services. Given the  nature of the equipment sold, warranties are set forth  in agreements between the customer and the supplier.  [PR3] One of Gamesas main tasks is to provide truthful sales  information about its products, technologies and servi- ces. Gamesa therefore maintains sales and marketing  practices that respect the legitimate interests and  rights of recipients and provide suitable information to  facilitate their choice.  Likewise, any sales messages drawn up by Gamesa  are conceived under the umbrella of a transparent and  truthful marketing policy and no subjective compa- risons are made in them. No information is supplied  that could lead to a conflict of third-party rights or  to a breach of good faith in business or contractual  relationships with third parties. These policies cover  all geographic areas where Gamesa has a commercial  presence and ensure compliance with legal regulations. Gamesa has no knowledge of any penalties in 2011  arising from the marketing tools used to communicate  about its products. [PR4] Customer satisfaction [PR5] Gamesa aspires to meet its customers expectations,  improve the channels of communication with them  and ensure maximum quality in its offering through its  sales activities. Priority actions in this are clear and include: gearing the  offering to customer needs and to the development  of new technologies, so as to allow for an improve- ment in the productivity, sustainability and excellence  parameters of products and services to the benefit of  its customers. Gamesa considers a close relationship and ongoing  dialog as essential to gain first-hand knowledge about  customer needs, expectations and requirements.  Gamesa establishes continuous feedback mechanisms  and processes. The company has made a significant  effort in recent years to remain close to customers  and strengthen personal attention by opening new  commercial offices to make more information available  on products and their features, as well as to channel  queries, complaints and claims.  Additionally, the companys participation in inter- national trade fairs and holding specific events with  customers open up new channels of communication  which make a contribution to strengthening business  relationships. Las actuaciones  prioritarias en los  productos son claras:  orientar la oferta a sus  necesidades y al  desarrollo de nuevas  tecnologas que  permitan mejorar los  parmetros de  productividad,  sostenibilidad y  excelencia de los  productos y servicios 6. Product responsibility 05 Performance indicators   122 Gamesa conducts a Customer Satisfaction Project (CSP)  every two years, a tailored survey on main customers,  allowing it to establish direct communications and  measure the quality of its service.  To do so, topics linked with the development, cons- truction and operating stages of projects are assessed,  along with overall perceptions on the company. Methodology Allows to Profile of interviewees Face-to-face interview with each of our  customers Questionnaire focusing on the  customers activities, setting an  improvement on their processes as a  priority Increase in the number and depth of  open (38) and closed (47) questions Importance field in each of the questions  broached (assessment and importance) Strengthen focus on customers Focus on key aspects of the business Define a framework to gather highly  valuable information for the company A format that facilitates more  dynamic interviews to be used Gather data with a view to improving  future questionnaires Nineteen companies from  six different countries  The sample was  guaranteed to include  companies with different  profiles and its size was  large enough to offer a  statistically reliable result. Nineteen clients from six different countries took part  in the last CSP conducted in 2010, which accounted  for 92% of the MW sold/contracted during the period  under study. The overall satisfaction rate with the  company reached 100%, as opposed to the rate of 85%  obtained in the preceding survey. The survey asked about the degree of importance (on  an ascending scale of importance from 0 to 3) and the  level of satisfaction interviewees attributed to a series  of aspects on the different stages of their activity (de- velopment stage, construction stage, operating stage  and a section on overall satisfaction with Gamesa as  a company). Suggestions and/or comments through a  series of open questions were likewise requested. 6.

During the year, Gamesa took part for the very first time  in important trade fairs in markets like Australia and  South Africa, as well as in specific offshore trade fairs  in Europe. In addition, awareness about Gamesa was  boosted in new markets (Finland, Chile, Philippines,  Colombia, Singapore and Jordan) by sponsoring industry  conferences and having a presence at networking  meetings. Participation in all these events was also tied  to a presence in their lecture programs through specific  presentations on the product, services and technology  solutions offering developed by the company. For the second consecutive year, Gamesa chose to do  product seminars with customers, which mainly took  place in So Paulo, Brazil and Paris, France. Gamesa has put into place an ambitious sponsorship  program since 2011, sponsoring the Gamesa Sailing Team  led by Mike Holding to take part in the Vende Globe  2012 regatta. The team tackled its first challenges during  the year to prepare for the event: the Transat Jacques  Vabre regatta (Le Havre, France) and the Transat B2B  regatta (Saint Barthlemy). Gamesa organized specific  actions with customers at both regattas, while participa- ting for the first time with a stand in the race village of a  sailing event (Transat Jacques Vabre). Customer privacy Gamesa has no record of any incidents in 2011 related  to the marketing and advertising of its products [PR7].  Gamesa states that it has not brought or been served  any claims by third parties regarding privacy issues and  the leaking of its customers personal data.
