For the first time, part of the  report is also published as a magazine, effectively portraying what  Corporate Responsibility looks like and how it is implemented in  the Otto Groups core business. Mainly intended for Group em- ployees, the magazine aims to raise awareness of corporate re- sponsibility issues. In the report, eleven companies present their  sustainability performance; these include the ten companies that  reported previously: 	 OTTO  	 Baur 	 bonprix 	 Frankonia 	 Heine 	 OTTO Office 	 Schwab 	 SportScheck  	 UNITO 	 Witt1 Newly included is: 	 Hermes1 The Corporate Responsibility Report integrates the second of  the Otto Groups three business segments by including Hermes.  All reporting companies have their headquarters in a German- speaking country and an annual turnover of more than 100 mn. The Corporate Responsibility Report 2011 follows the  Otto Groups Sustainability Report 2009 and covers the period  from 1 March 2009 to 28 February 2011 (financial years 2009/10  and 2010/11). The editorial deadline for this report was 10 June 2011. Following the introductory chapters Strategy and Manage- ment as well as Stakeholder Dialogue, the reports structure is  based on the Otto Groups five CR fields of action: Employees,   Climate and Environment, Suppliers, Assortment and Customers  and finally, Society. A concise overview of relevant economic, en- vironmental and societal key figures follows each report chapter,   except for Society and Stakeholder Dialogue. Unless explicitly   stated otherwise, these figures are based on consolidated data  from the eleven reporting companies. With the implementation  of the new CR database, modified survey methods, the inclusion  of Hermes and an expanded number of locations covered by the  report, the basis for consolidation of key figures has changed.   Deviations are indicated in the respective chapters. The Strategy and Management chapter initially reports on  the Otto Groups strategic direction and business development;  it then provides an overview of corporate governance principles  implemented in different business processes. It also explains how  CR is embedded in the Groups corporate culture and how man- agement structures will be further developed. The Stakeholder  Dialogue chapter that follows presents a new development. Its fo- cus is a continuous exchange that the Group fosters with its stake- holders on key environmental and social challenges. In this report,  the Otto Group responds to its stakeholders demand for proactive  transparency in describing the Groups value chain. In particular,  purchasing policies and implementation processes with respect to  social and environmental standards in the supply chain are pre- sented in detail. The next chapter is Employees. Specifically, the Otto Group  tackles key personnel issues such as workforce diversity, work-life  balance as well as education and training. The spotlight in the  following chapter on Climate and Environment is on the Groups  Resource Management and Climate Protection Strategies, includ- ing their implementation in goods transport, at the Groups vari- ous locations and in business travel. Ensuring socially acceptable  working conditions in the Group companies sourcing markets also  presents a challenge: how can economic, environmental and social  standards be implemented on-site, in line with the Otto Groups  own programmes or also through industry-wide initiatives? The  chapter on Suppliers is dedicated to this question. As the inter- mediary between manufacturers and customers, the Otto Group  can exert multifaceted influence. The chapter on Assortment and  Customers therefore not only describes how the Otto Group sets  out to fulfil its customers wishes but also describes the Groups  1   Subsequently, mention of the legal forms of Group enterprises is omitted and  instead, throughout  the entire CR Report they are referred to as OTTO, Baur,  bonprix, Franconia, Heine, OTTO Office, Schwab, SportScheck, UNITO, Witt and  Hermes. about this report about this report   C3  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto group  initiatives for and offers of attractive, sustainable products. The  reports closing chapter addresses Group companies progress on  their numerous social commitments in addition to running their  core businesses; it also addresses the initiatives of the company  owner and Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Dr Michael Otto. The Executive Board Members set an important example and  fulfil a leadership role in the implementation of the Otto Groups  CR Strategy. In 2010, each Otto Group Board Member sponsored  a core CR topic and drove the development of solutions through  their personal dedication. As a result, each Board Member intro- duces the respective chapter for the CR topic corresponding to  their personal sponsorship. The CR reporting of the eleven Otto Group companies includes  this printed report as well as supplementary report contents at  ottogroup.com/cr-report. These supplementary contents on the  Internet are referenced within the Corporate Responsibility Report  2011 at the bottom of each page with the symbol   . The Corporate Responsibility Report 2011 was prepared in ac- cordance with the Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative  (GRI) G3. Following a detailed audit by the GRI, the report was veri- fied and designated as application level A+, the highest applica- tion level for the applicable GRI Guidelines category. Furthermore,  the eleven companies sustainability reporting provides informa- tion on the implementation of the Ten Principles of the United  Nations Global Compact, thus fulfilling the function of a Commu- nication on Progress. A tabular summary of the report that deals  with the GRI indicators and the Global Compact principles can be  found on p. 136 and online at ottogroup.com/cr-report. This Corpo- rate Responsibility Report 2011 was fully audited and certified by  the auditing and consulting firm PwC, according to the Standard  AA1000AS. This standard verifies whether sustainability manage- ment corresponds to the reporting entity as well as its CR report- ing requirements and stakeholders interests. A certificate of the  independent audit by PwC can be found on Page U5 of the report. The Corporate Responsibility Report 2011 is available in both  German and English. It addresses the most important societal  stakeholders of the Groups companies, particularly the scientific  community. Alongside non-governmental organizations, business  partners, government, academia and media, the report also ad- dresses employees and junior staff, customers and the interest- ed public, and invites all to join in a constructive dialogue with  the reporting companies. The flip-page version of this report at   ottogroup.com/crreport provides readers with the possibility to  give feedback on the report and to enter into dialogue with the  Otto Group. The next Corporate Responsibility Report is currently sched- uled for publication in 2013. The Otto Group plans to extend its  scope beyond the Retail and Service business segments to include  Financial Services, the Groups third business segment.

In a globalised world this  makes it a success factor for the Otto Group, which is active  in 20 countries. We build trust at the interface between  manufacturers and consumers through acting responsibly for  people and nature. Hans-Otto Schrader,   Chairman of the Executive Board and Chief Executive Officer Otto Group (CEO) following the deep crisis the global econo- my has seen a clear rebound. Manufacturing  and trade have recovered quickly, above all in  emerging countries. In Germany too we have  seen a very positive economic development.  We are happy to say that the Otto Group has  been able to increase its turnover clearly in  the three segments of Multichannel Retail,  Services and Financial Services. This indicates  to us that we are on the right track with our  company strategy. As a globally active group of companies  we started at an early stage to act respon- sibly for people and nature. Already 25 years  ago OTTO declared environmental protection  as a corporate goal. As a development of this  understanding of ourselves we have ancho- red Corporate Responsibility (CR) Group-wide  in our core business. More and more Group  companies are making a specific contribution  in a range of CR disciplines, such as reducing  CO2 emissions or expanding their assort- ments of sustainable goods. We move to- gether in this way towards our goal of positi- oning the Otto Group in the area of corporate  responsibility as the best multi-discipline  player in our competitive environment. We can only realise our Vision as a res- ponsible company group with all our emplo- yees on board, however. My colleagues on  the Executive Board and I see it as our special  duty to bring CR to life throughout the enti- re Group. For this reason, each Board Mem- ber has sponsored a core CR topic which he  will personally drive forward. In this report  we each present a chapter representing a  CR field of action for the Otto Group. In ad- dition to this, dear Readers, with the aid of  twelve portraits, interviews and spotlight  reports we aim to show you how our emplo- yees bring sustainability to life in their daily  work. In this report we lay out, in accordance  with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) re- porting guidelines, how the Otto Group  and eleven Group companies are engaged  in designing their businesses in an environ- mentally and socially sustainable way. With  the integration of the logistics provider  Hermes we have expanded our reporting  to cover two segments, Multichannel Retail  and now also Services. In future we plan to  include further Group companies in our CR  reporting. Dear Readers, In producing this years report we have  borne the requirements of our stakeholder  groups very much in mind regarding their  demands for proactive transparency and  integration in discussions on key CR topics.  Prior to producing this report our key stake- holders had the opportunity to express their  points of view in a dedicated workshop and  – as explained in this years new chapter Sta- keholder Dialogue – to influence this report.  What is more, we not only detail our CR per- formance but also transparently describe the  conditions under which we conduct our busi- ness activities, including the varied ecological  and social challenges these imply. Resting on our laurels is not part of  Otto Group culture. We will continue to work  each and every day to improve our CR perfor- mance. We wish you an informative and entertaining  read! On behalf of the Executive Board, Yours Hans-Otto Schrader otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 3 FoRewoRD By the chAIRMAn oF the executIVe BoARD  the RePoRtInG coMPAnIes  At A GlAnce The Otto Group is a globally  leading retail and services group  comprising 123 main Group com- panies in Europe, Asia and North America. With almost 50,000 em- ployees, the Group increased its net turnover in financial year 2010/11  by 12.6% to 11,404 mn compared to the previous year. Global e- commerce made a significant contribution to this as the key growth  driver in the Otto Group. E-commerce business grew by 25% and has  become the Otto Groups most important sales channel, accounting  for almost 50% of all retail sales. Consequently, the Group was able  to affirm its position as the worlds second-largest and Germanys  largest online provider in the business-to-consumer (B2C) segment.  This positive business performance is being driven by all three of the  Groups business segments, detailed below. The Multichannel Retail segment generated turnover of  10,004 mn in financial year 2010/11 representing growth of 12.1%.  Ten of the eleven companies covered by this report belong to this  segment, which comprises e-commerce, catalogues and over- the-counter retail. The retail segment accounted for 87.7% of the  Otto Groups overall turnover in 2010/11. The Financial Services segment comprises the Otto Groups  global commercial financial service providers. This segment, which  is dominated by the financial services businesses of the interna- tional EOS Group, generated a turnover of 455 mn in financial  year 2010/11 and achieved the highest growth rate of all three of  the Otto Groups segments, with growth of 17.1%. The Otto Group consolidated its entire portfolio of retail services in  the Services segment and placed a strategic focus on the area of services  and logistics through the Hermes Group companies. Besides the report- ing company Hermes, Otto Freizeit and Touristik Group (OFT) is also part  of the Services segment: this group bundles all travel service activities  and achieved growth of 14.9% in financial year 2010/11, generating turn- over of 945 mn. Otto Group Financial services Multichannel Retail The segment covers the Otto Groups worldwide  range of multichannel offerings.

As  Department Head of Technical Services hes  responsible along with various teams for  the safety, management, maintenance, re- furbishment and planning of new construc- tions at the Baur Groups locations in Burg- kunstadt, Weismain, Altenkunstadt and at  various external warehouses. In his work, its  important to strike a balance between costs  and benefits as well as between technical  possibilities and environmental concerns.

Following the financial crisis, however,  changes were made that put a question  mark over the responsible management of  these forests. The Latvian government had  suspended FSC certification of its state for- ests and had subsequently sold them to  timber producers who originally had no in- terest in certification. That was simply unac- ceptable for the Director and her team, so  she joined forces with Heines Management  Board, the Director of the Purchasing Office  in Latvia, furniture suppliers and Latvian  government representatives to ensure that  FSC certification was resumed for 2011.

Fortunately, the supplier passed  the inspection with flying colours, having in- troduced a control system for improving en- vironmental protection on its own initiative  – an unusual level of commitment in India.  For Holschuh, it was positive proof that it is  right and sensible to insist on sustainability  in the supply chain.  otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 13  As Central Buyer for womens wear at Witt,  Karolin Stangl specialises in bringing her  customers in the 50+ age group fashion  that is attractive, comfortable and casual;  increasingly, its also produced sustain- ably.

Since he began working at SportScheck in  2008, Christian Tews has already accom- plished quite a bit: in his job as buyer for  outdoor textiles for over-the-counter retail,  hes committed to improving sustainability  – which reflects his personal convictions as  well. The basis for it is the bluesign standard,  which is widespread in outdoor sports. It cov- ers a wide spectrum of sustainability criteria,  from resource productivity, through prevent- ing the pollution of air and water, to labour  law and consumer protection. Christian Tews aims to offer his  SportScheck customers whole collections  that were manufactured under these con- ditions, and is working in close cooperation  with bluesign representatives and selected  brand manufacturers to do this. Here he  often carries out an intermediary function,  working to convince the manufacturers.  He puts bluesign representatives in touch  with the brand manufacturers, and so con- tributes to increasing the share of products  whose production and use do not harm peo- ple or the environment. One current example is his collaboration  with a well-known outdoor-goods supplier.  After three years of work SportScheck will  present the first items of functional clothing  in autumn 2011 that adhere to the bluesign  standard and that can also be recycled in  an environmentally friendly way.

This rule states that there has to be a link to  the data-protection notice in a prominent  place near the Like button, where custom- ers can find out more about what happens  with their data when they click the button.  This rule creates a high degree of transpar- ency with regard to data protection, and  will in future be used by all Group compa- nies in Germany.   How do you ensure that data protection is  integrated in the Groups daily work? Roland von Gehlen: Data protection and  security are issues that affect us all.

This focus is the Groups key  to long-term business success. Global challenges such as resource short- ages, climate change, the extinction of  species, poverty and human rights viola- tions increasingly influence markets and  therefore also the ethical and economic  conditions for global trade. However, in- telligent action based on a responsible CR  commitment creates great opportunities  for companies in this area of tension – for  example through steadily increasing sales  of sustainably produced products. This ap- plies even more so today, because along  with politics and non-governmental orga- nizations (NGOs), consumers and financial  markets also demand responsibility from  corporations. Regarding the mandatory objectives of  the Group's CR Strategy and Group-wide  programmes, the Otto Group has anchored  sustainability in its core processes. In this  way, the Group not only assumes respon- sibility for the welfare of its nearly 50,000  employees in 20 countries, but also for hu- mane production conditions in its complex  supply chain. Climate and environmental  protection throughout production, trans- port and distribution processes, and the  conservation of natural biodiversity play an  equally important role. In order to address changing market re- quirements and challenges, the Otto Group  has developed a new strategic orientation  in 2010. The Vision (see p. 31) has been re- vised and The Power of Responsibility mis- sion developed.

To strengthen their  market position, Otto Group companies  will continue to work on developing inno- vative concepts and on aligning their exist- ing activities, making them future-proof.

For this reason,  Group companies always pursue their tar- gets under consideration of market condi- tions and adjust them if necessary in order  to fulfil their functions within the portfo- lio.

During the course of this project, personnel re- organisations were also carried out (see p. 57). Responsible development  of growth markets The Otto Group strives for healthy growth  and is working to further open up major  growth markets in central and eastern  Europe, particularly the Russian market.  In addition, China and Brazil are gaining  increasing importance as markets of the  future for the Otto Group.

Given the increasing volatility  of global markets, this represents a major  competitive advantage. Such an approach shows that the  Otto Group recognises fluctuating market  conditions as a constant and has designed  its structures effectively to meet this chal- lenge. The Group was able to demonstrate  the success of this strategy in the reporting  period with revenue and profit growth in all  three core segments. In future, the Group  will also be able to take advantage of its op- portunities as a responsible market player. New business areas in eastern  Europe, shifts in online and  over-the-counter commerce  To attain its goals, the Otto Group continually  opens up new business areas and models and  thus extends its competitive environment.  Besides its own business concepts such as  OTTO, bonprix and Witt, that were multiplied  to eastern Europe, the Otto Group bought  shares of various home-shopping retail com- panies such as Quelle Rusia in the growth  regions of central ans eastern Europe during  the reporting period. Additionally, the Group  further expanded its business in the multi- channel retail segments of over-the-counter  retail, catalogue and e-commerce business;  the latter for example with its acquisition of  the Bestshop website.  The brands of Internet portals Discount24  and Yalook were absorbed by shopping24  GmbH, where they are now used as spe- cialised shopping platforms. In February 2010,  the online, Berlin-based online shoe retailer  Mirapodo was also launched.

In the report- ing companies, there were variations in over- the-counter business for the following com- panies: SportScheck: Opening one store in Berlin in  September 2010, no store closures bonprix: Opening a total of 16 stores in  Germany and another in Italy, four store clo- sures in 2010. Growth across all business segments As in the previous year, in financial year  2010/11 the Otto Group reported growth  across all business segments. In its core  business segment of multi-channel retail, it  achieved an increase in sales of 12.1%, which  corresponds to a turnover of 10,004.0 mn.  For the first time, worldwide online business  accounted for half of the Groups retail sales:  this share increased in financial year 2010/11  from 43% to around 50% over the previous  year. The Services segment, which includes  logistics and travel service providers as well  as purchasing companies in the Otto Group,  reported a sales increase of 14.9%. The Finan- cial Services segment continued to perform  positively and increased revenue by 17.1%. 4,000 commitments to   The Power of Responsibility The missions goal is  to demonstrate how  Otto Group employees  strive for Profitability,  Innovation, Diversity and  Sustainability at work as  well as in their pri- vate lives. For every  employee can  assume his or her  share of responsi- bility. Touched by the plight  of people in Japan, for  example, an OTTO em- ployee initiated a t-shirt  relief effort called Help  for Japan. Since then,  for each t-shirt sold  on otto.de, five euros  were donated to the aid  organisation Save the  Children.   To promote this com- mitment to respon- sibility, the Groups  approximately 50,000  employees worldwide  are called upon to as- sume responsibility for  the Groups four core  values and to help shape  the Groups future. As a  visible symbol, 4,000  commitments are  to be realised by  the end of the year  and published on a dedi- cated, company intranet  website for The Power  of Responsibility. The  slogan Participate and  Show Responsibility  encourages every   Otto Group employee  worldwide to take part. The Otto Groups Vision The Otto Group honed its profile with a  new Vision in 2010. Its self-understanding  is that of a globally active corporate group  of retailers and commercial service provid- ers with successful business concepts that  takes responsibility for people and nature. Group-wide mission:   The power of Responsibility The Otto Group consists of a variety of com- panies that operate in the worlds major eco- nomic regions. As a unifying element among  all its companies, the Group has initiated a  mission in 2011 that will be understood across  The Power of Responsibility was initiated by the Otto Group at its Ex- ecutive Board seminar in March 2010. There, the Board presented its  conviction that responsibility is a key element of corporate strategy.

The Power of Responsibility mission com- bines the four core-value constellations that  are seminal for the Otto Group: Profitability,  Innovation, Diversity and Sustainability. Central to the Otto Groups self-under- standing is the active responsibility of each  individual employee: they are each responsi- ble for what they do, for how they do it, and  for that which can be improved  whether  on a small or a large scale. In this way, the  involvement of nearly 50,000 people in  20 countries adds up to a powerful force:  this is the true Power of Responsibility. The Otto Group Executive Board has  presented its new mission at some 30  Group companies in an international road- show. During the first six months of 2011, it  visited facilities in Germany and Austria as  well as Group subsidiaries in Russia, France  and the United States, Great Britain, Japan  and Hong Kong. ENSURING lONG-TERM  pROFITABIlITy The Otto Groups primary objective is to  maintain its own long-term profitability and  thereby safeguard the companys existence  and ongoing success. Through their cost-con- scious, efficient and profit-orientated work,  Group employees create the conditions nec- essary for financing innovations, protecting  jobs and supporting the company. pROMOTING INNOVATIONS Digitalisation and global networking pro- vide the framework for a critical mass of  innovations to drive the success of a glob- ally orientated, multi-channel retail group  such as the Otto Group. These innovations  range from new websites, through internal  process improvements to entirely new busi- ness models. In this case, every Group em- ployee is responsible for questioning what  he or she does: can it be improved? Can it  be made more economical, more desirable,  simpler  or simply make more sense? In  order to strengthen innovation throughout  the Group, the company created the central  Innovation Management department at the  end of 2010. The Innovation Strategy pro- vides personalised consulting and support  for individual Group companies with the  objective of progressively expanding their  innovation competency. In their innovation  activities, each individual company estab- lishes its individual focal points for itself,  within defined and strategically relevant  fields. Ideas Management at  Group subsidiaries Many companies in the Otto Group already  operate their own Ideas Management. With  heinovation and Witti.dee, employees at  both Heine and Witt have their own ideas or  innovation platforms available. Baur also be- gan a process for Ideas Management in 2010,  while OTTO Office has established a so-called  Ideas Forum on its in-house intranet. New ideas at OTTO In order to develop ideas into innovations,  the single company OTTOs platform my- idea gives its employees assistance in  structuring, publishing and further devel- oping their own ideas. Approximately 1,100  employees took up the offer during the  reporting period. From a total of 350 ideas  submitted, 42 (12%) have been implement- ed to date. OTTO also operates an Innova- tions Lab for new media and distributes a  newsletter called 25 Impulses plus which  introduces the latest trends and ideas from  across the industry. With the programme  Ideas Corner, OTTO also offers its employ- ees an opportunity to showcase their ideas,  following the famous example of Speakers  Corner in Londons Hyde Park. stRAteGy AnD MAnAGeMent  otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 33  A company culture based on diversity is a source of creativity and innovation. lIVING DIVERSITy Succeeding in a global, fragmented mar- ketplace presents a major challenge for  the Otto Group. As a multinational, mul- ticultural retail and services company it  has deliberately established its mission to  support and maintain diversity within the  entire Group. Diversity creates freedom for  ideas and facilitates the development of  unconventional solutions. Specifically, the  Otto Group therefore supports the indi- vidual differences of its workforce. For in- stance, in early 2011 the company created  a new position for Group-wide Diversity  Management. In future, the potential of  the existing diversity of employees within  the entire Group will be utilised even bet- ter through applying a strategic approach  (see p. 62 ). ANCHORING SUSTAINABIlITy Acting responsibly for people and na- ture comes from the very roots of the  Otto Group. As a result, the Group ap- proaches natural resources, partners and  employees with an attitude of care and  fairness; this is the foundation of the  Groups sustainably profitable business  activity. Impacts on the environment and  society that can be attributed to Group op- erations are identified by the Group at an  early stage, transparently communicated  both internally and externally and miti- gated through Corporate Responsibility  (CR) management. To ensure this approach  is also followed in future, the Group regu- larly reviews the effectiveness of measures  derived from its CR Strategy  for instance  via the implementation of status reports to  the Executive Board – and adjusts its busi- ness processes appropriately.  Otto Group Annual Report 2010/11          www.ottogroup.com/en/die-otto-group/    geschaeftsbericht.php     The power of Responsibility   www.die-kraft-der-verantwortung.de/    english/home.html  CORpORATE GOVERNANCE The Otto Group is well aware that in a com- pany of nearly 50,000 employees and world- wide retail activities, compliance with in- ternational laws and regulations can cause  conflicts of interest and standards that may  involve risks. The Group regards a high level  of integrity as its best protection against  risks of reputation – in corporate decisions  as well as in the conduct of each individual  employee. Executives here have a special re- sponsibility to set a leading example. In order to ensure and assess compli- ance with respective national laws and in- ternational standards at all levels and to  prevent tendencies towards corruption, the  Otto Group established a Group-wide Com- pliance Committee in 2007. It meets at regu- lar intervals and consists of managers from  the areas of Group Security, Group Human  Resources, Group Data Protection, Group  Law, Group Corporate Responsibility and  Group Internal Audit. As a globally active  company, the Otto Group is also exposed to  stRAteGy AnD MAnAGeMent  34  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  business, industry-specific and general risks.  These are monitored and controlled by a  Group-wide Risk Management System. The foundation of every business  relationship: the Code of Conduct Of central significance to the Otto Groups  Compliance Management is the Group- wide Code of Conduct. It also applies to the  Groups business partners and calls for ad- herence to the respective national laws and  internationally recognised operating norms,  based on the minimum standards of the In- ternational Labour Organization (ILO) and  the UN (see p. 97). Mandatory reporting of  corruption cases:   Group Anti-Corruption Guideline To prevent corruption, the Otto Group ad- opted the Group Anti-Corruption Guideline  in November 2009; in December of that  same year the Group supplemented its  Code of Conduct with a corresponding sec- tion. All corruption cases must be reported.  Employees have the option of reporting ex- isting suspected cases – also anonymously  – to an internal point or to an external Om- budsman. Reported suspected cases are  thoroughly investigated worldwide, either  by the Otto Group department respon- sible, or by external audit companies com- missioned to conduct such investigations.  Where Code violations are established, the  Otto Group applies appropriate sanctions,  such as labour-law measures or the imme- diate termination of supplier relationships.  Right at the start of their employment, new  employees are reminded of their obligation  to comply with all applicable Group guide- lines. These are also available on the Group- wide intranet. Managers are required to  inform each employee personally about the  contents of the guidelines and any modifica- tions to these. Group Gifts Guideline  increases legal security Introduced in February 2011, the Group Gifts  Guideline governing business gifts and oth- er benefits is intended to increase legal se- curity for Otto Group employees within this  sensitive area. These regulations prevent  personal dependencies and obligations that  may occur, or that may create the impression  that the integrity of Otto Group employees  and executives or external individuals may  have been compromised in some way. policies for donation  practices and data protection,  Internal Control System  Other relevant policies concern donation  practices and the particularly sensitive topic  of data protection and data security in the  home-shopping business (see p. 120). For  Risk Management, the Internal Control Sys- tem has special significance: this ensures  that transparency and cost-effectiveness of  operational processes are improved contin- uously, that risks are reduced, losses avoided  and assets protected.  Integrated Compliance Management With its globally applicable Compliance  Management System, the Otto Group is cur- rently implementing an efficient monitoring  system for its compliance activities. In this  context, the system checks whether exist- ing policies include all relevant rules and  regulations regarding risk considerations and  whether the contents are well understood by  the employees. Preventive inspections moni- tor compliance with legal requirements. Sus- pected cases are investigated and solved;  upon confirmation of suspicions, they are  sanctioned accordingly.  In addition, the development of a struc- tured training system for employees is gov- erned by Compliance Management. New  employees are – depending on their area of  work – trained in various compliance-rele- vant topics, for instance through web-based  e-learning tools for the Anti-Corruption  Guideline. The Otto Group also organizes  intensive training sessions for specific target  groups such as Buyers, for example a further  training series on the topic of Antitrust Law.  The Otto Group Executive and Supervisory  Boards are informed periodically regarding  the status of current compliance activities.

RISK MANAGEMENT Within its corporate strategic planning, the  Otto Group comprehensively identifies and  evaluates its growth and development out- look as well as its economic improvement op- portunities. The Group analyses and monitors  its risks with the help of the Group-wide Risk  Management System. All Group companies  conduct an annual, systematic Risk Survey.  Since 2011, this survey is completed with the  aid of a newly developed Risk Management  platform. At least twice per year, Group com- panies also update their risk reports at Super- visory Board meetings. Significant risks are  reported ad-hoc to the Board. Risk Management as a Group- wide early warning system  The Risk Management System is part of the  Groups strategic three-year plan. In the  context of analysis, Group Controlling iden- tifies and evaluates investments as well as  significant risks and main opportunities  (see Annual Report 2010/11, p. 35) for each  company. It allows the Group to identify  risks at an early stage in order to monitor  and respond appropriately and immediate- ly, thus minimizing possible repercussions  from risks, should they materialise. Risk  Management increases the transparency of  risk exposure for the Group and serves as a  Group-wide early-warning system. Economic conditions as a financial risk Precarious economic conditions in the sales  and purchasing markets currently carry a cer- tain degree of financial risk for the Otto Group.  Whereas some countries have not yet fully  recovered from financial and economic crises  and are still burdened by the impact of natu- ral disasters  particularly southern Europe  but also Japan and the United States  it is  anticipated that increased economic perfor- mance in Germany will have a positive effect  on consumer demand for the Otto Group.  However, due to intense competition in the  retail sector and increased data protection  legislation here, the economic environment  has not become easier for the Group. stRAteGy AnD MAnAGeMent  36  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  In view of these challenges, the  Otto Group is working to distribute risk  more broadly: it is strengthening its inter- national focus, actively managing its port- folio of companies and through various  distribution channels, is serving a variety  of market segments. In addition to expan- sion abroad, it aims at continued growth  through  innovation,  business-concept  multiplications as well as strategic part- nerships and acquisitions. Analysis of core  risks (e.g. financial risks) is a main feature  of the Otto Groups Annual Report 2010/11. Risks posed by changing  markets and climates As additional risks, the Otto Group is facing  changes in its sourcing markets and from  climate change. Higher commodity prices  for cotton and synthetic fibres, rising en- ergy costs and dwindling output capacities  in supplier countries, particularly in China,  burden the Groups growth prospects. Also  difficult to predict are the risks associated  with climate change, such as crop failures.  Additionally, higher energy prices affect the  entire value chain, especially transport. These  increased costs narrow the Groups margins  and cannot easily be passed on to the con- sumer in the form of higher retail prices.

At the same time, weather trends can  lead to demand fluctuations in the distribu- tion markets. Countermeasures are prepared both at  the level of individual companies as well as  at Group level. Thus, among other things, an  increase of order quantities has been imple- mented in order to realize greater economies  of scale and thereby minimize the risks of ris- ing supply prices (see p. 95). stRAteGy AnD MAnAGeMent  otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 37  Statutory regulations and changes  in consumer behaviour A range of political processes is indirectly  relevant to the Otto Groups business, for  example the implementation of Phase III of  the EUs Climate Protection Package in 2013.  Changes in consumer behaviour also have an  impact on business development. Increased  demand for especially climate-friendly prod- ucts can be seen as one of the Otto Group's  risks, but can at the same time be seen as a  major opportunity. General sustainability  trends and risks Beyond climate issues, ever-dwindling natu- ral resources such as water, fossil fuels and  fertile soil pose additional potential risks to  the Groups development. Managing these re- source risks requires responsible supply-chain  organisation, allied with increased transpar- ency and measurability of the social, ecologi- cal and climatic impact of business activities.  The Otto Groups approach to these overarch- ing challenges is illustrated in this report in  the chapters Climate and Environment, Sup- pliers and Assortment and Customers.

The  Otto Group is among  the Coalitions founding  members of more than  30 influential actors.  The process is based on  the so-called Sustainabil- ity Index, developed by  the Coalition and which  has been in a test phase  since spring 2011. This  index collects extensive  data, ranging from the  harvest or extraction of  raw materials, through  processing, all the way to  the end-consumer stage.  In this way, the ecologi- cal and social aspects of  production as well as the  recycling and/or disposal  of textiles and footwear  become completely  transparent – and thus  controllable. In addition,  the Sustainability Index  indicates fields of action  in which the global textile  and footwear industries  must increasingly assume  responsibility and opens  new opportunities for the  implementation of tech- nological innovations.  The goal is to reduce the  consumption of water  and energy, chemical use  and waste generation  significantly as well as to  continue to improve so- cial standards in sourcing  countries. In March 2011, a group of well-known international clothing  companies, scientific experts, representatives of NGOs and   the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the   Sustainable Apparel Coalition to push the development of   a Product Sustainable Footprint.    CR STRATEGy In April 2010, the Otto Group presented its cur- rent Corporate Responsibility (CR) Strategy.  This strategy ties in with the Visions core com- ponent of taking responsibility for people and  nature; furthermore, it contributes to success- fully fulfilling The Power of Responsibility mis- sion. In the wake of this new strategic direc- tion, the Executive Board has so far negotiated  specific CR objectives with ten Group compa- nies and thus anchored sustainable business  principles even more deeply within the organi- sational structures of the Group. CR objectives of the Otto Group:  substantial progress in all areas With its CR Strategy, the Otto Group aims  to position itself as the best multi-discipline  player in its competitive environment. Rather  than crowd-pleasing, single achievements in  only a few areas, the Group intends to achieve  substantial and measurable advances in ev- ery CR discipline. Despite invigorated compe- tition, the Group is convinced that with this  strategy it will achieve CR leadership among  retail companies in German-speaking coun- tries. Its broad approach rests essentially on  the commitment of the reporting companies,  each with different goals for implementing  the CR Strategy within their respective busi- ness models. Thus, for example, the com- panies have defined specific objectives for  increasing the percentage of organic cotton  in their assortments, or for improving energy  efficiency. CR fields of action and  overall objectives In order to identify relevant disciplines for  the new CR Strategy, the Groups Corporate  Responsibility division initially analysed  stRAteGy AnD MAnAGeMent  otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 39  stakeholder requirements and conditions in  the global marketplace. From that data, the  areas of Employees, Climate and Environ- ment, Suppliers, Assortment and Custom- ers and finally, Society were identified as  strategic CR fields of action. This structure  also forms the framework for the present  report. Within the individual fields of action,  important Group issues have been defined:  within the CR field of action Assortment and  Customers, examples of these are organic  cotton, responsible trade, energy-efficient  electric and household appliances, wood  products from responsible forestry and con- sumer protection. The Otto Group strives for  the following overarching objectives in the  individual CR fields of action: Employees:  Successful Diversity Management  of Group employees; promoting work-life bal- ance as well as educational and further training. Climate and Environment: Focusing on cli- mate protection, especially in purchasing  and distribution logistics, and increasing  resource efficiency at facilities as well as in  transport and mobility. Suppliers: Expanding social management  and increasing transparency in the supply  chain. Assortment and Customers: Promoting con- scious consumption through the expansion  of sustainable assortments and communi- cating clear environmental and social prod- uct features. Society: Here, the Group does not establish  Group-wide formulated CR objectives and  leaves this field of action to the individual  companies. Group subsidiaries participating in the  CR Strategy were involved in the process of  setting objectives. Subsequently, each sub- sidiary then established its own action plan  for implementing the agreed company-spe- cific, partial objectives to be achieved by the  end of financial year 2012/13. Binding CR objectives  for all subsidiaries The Otto Group's CR Strategy will progres- sively integrate other subsidiaries. Central  topics include the development of sustain- able assortments and realization of the  ambitious Group-wide Climate Protection  Strategy. Since March 2010, the CR Strategy  Just like his Executive Board colleagues, Hans-Otto Schrader has assumed personal   sponsorship for a core CR topic. executIVe BoARD MeMBeR TOPIc SPOnSORShIP Hans-Otto Schrader Chairman of the Executive Board and Chief  Executive Officer Otto Group (CEO)       Communication/Stakeholder Management Dr Rainer Hillebrand Vice Chairman of the Executive Board, Brand,  Service & E-Commerce OTTO Community Building in Web x.0 Alexander Birken Member of the Executive Board, Human  Resources, Controlling & IT OTTO, Chief Human  Resources Officer Facility Energy Efficiency and  Water Management  Social Commitment Dr Michael Heller Member of the Executive Board,   Merchandising & Category Management OTTO Sustainability in Wood and Paper CmiA Textiles, Organic Cotton, Fairtrade Dr Timm Homann Member of the Executive Board,   Retail Otto Group Consumer Protection Hanjo Schneider Member of the Executive Board,   Services Otto Group  Social and Water Management  in the Supply Chain Energy Efficiency in Logistics/Supply Chain Jrgen Schulte-laggenbeck Member of the Executive Board, Finance & IT  Otto Group, Chief Financial Officer (CFO)                                     Corporate Governance Dr Winfried Zimmermann Member of the Executive Board, Human   Resources & Controlling Otto Group Sustainable Development of Employment stRAteGy AnD MAnAGeMent  40  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  has initially been implemented in ten of  the eleven reporting companies; UNITO was  added as the eleventh in the autumn of 2011.  Therefore, binding CR objectives have been  stipulated for all eleven Group companies in- cluded in the CR Report. For example, in the  context of the Climate Protection Strategy,  the Group sought a reduction of air freight  of 12% (bonprix) and 3% (OTTO). OTTO aims  to increase the percentage of cotton from  the Cotton made in Africa initiative to 10% in  its own brands, while Schwab is aiming for a  percentage of 10% in its overall assortment  (see p. 143). In a series of on-site visits from June 2010  to February 2011, Corporate Responsibility  staff provided Group subsidiaries with com- prehensive consultation on how to proceed,  based on company-specific requirements  for each competitive environment. The aim  was to inform them about the CR Strategys  operational framework and thus to develop  a shared understanding of increased respon- sibility. Among other things, individual focus  points of CR commitment, the specific form  of programme-implementation measures  and the opportunities for a deeper integra- tion of CR Strategy and reporting in business  processes were all addressed. Executive Board Sponsorships  for CR topics A central requirement for the success of  the best multi-discipline strategy for the  Otto Group is the personal commitment of  every individual employee and manager.  Board Members have a special responsibility  here. In 2010, each of the eight Otto Group  Executive Board Members has therefore as- sumed sponsorship of a key CR topic and will  expressly promote its development. Previ- ously, this was the responsibility of the CR  Steering Committee. In this way, the topic of  CR was also organisationally elevated from  the second management tier to Executive  Board status.  CR flagship projects The Otto Group supplements its substantial CR  performance in all disciplines with high-profile  flagship projects, which represent major stimu- li in the Groups key CR fields of action. With international cooperation, the Otto Group  has launched the pilot project Product Sus- tainable Footprint in 2011. The goal is to  make the social and ecological impacts of  individual products measurable throughout  each products entire lifecycle (see p. 39). Hermes followed suit with its WE DO! pro- gramme for its own ambitious climate protec- tion goals: annually reducing CO2 emissions  along the entire supply chain by 2% and by  3.5% at Hermes locations. Customers are able  to mark their shipments with the WE DO! la- bel. Environmental and conservation activities  are also included (see p. 77). OTTO fosters conscious shopping decisions  with its online store ECOREPUBLIC, which al- ready carried more than 3,600 products as of  February 2011. A special guidance system of  Eco Facts based on independent labels facili- tates finding sustainable products across all  distribution channels  and communicates  their added sustainability value in simple,  easily understood terms. Schwab, Baur and  UNITO have also embraced this concept (see  p. 115).  Sustainable Apparel Coalition             www.apparelcoalition.org      CR MANAGEMENT  The decentralized structure of the Otto Group  requires a clear division of working processes  for implementing its strategic CR objectives.  Therefore, in 2010 the Group also refined and  modernised its CR organisation. The role of  CR Coordinators within the individual subsi- diaries has been reinforced: they now work  with management to guide the integration  of CR into core business processes and in this  way, the Coordinators will play a key role in  bringing together the CR activities of their  respective companies. Group Corporate Re- sponsibility now concentrates primarily on  its Group-wide management and consulting  function as well as on its role as an initiator.  This devision is also responsible for the de- velopment, planning and communication of  Group-wide policies and projects; it reports  semi-annually to the Executive Board which  bears the primary responsibility for the de- sign and ongoing development of the CR  Strategy. The status report is based on the  implemented, Group-wide CR data manage- stRAteGy AnD MAnAGeMent  otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 41  ment that serves to identify and control key  figures from Group companies. Figures from  the Social Programme for suppliers are ma- naged in another database, called the Social  Database. In addition to detailing the current  level of implementation, the management  report covers objectives and proposed mea- sures, thus accelerating further planning. Standardised CR communications  structures The Otto Group has established standardised  communication and cooperation structures to  implement the CR Strategy within the eleven  reporting companies. CR Coordinators at the  Group companies steer all CR-related activi- ties and information as well as communicating  regularly with the Groups Corporate Respon- sibility division. Additionally, in the relevant  Otto Group areas such as Controlling, Human  Resources, Law, Risk Management and Cor- porate Strategy, central CR contact employ- ees have been designated who also maintain  close contact with the Corporate Responsibility  team. In order to embed CR more deeply as a  cross-company task in all organisational areas  of the Otto Group, Group-internal networking  was intensified in the reporting period. For this  purpose, CR Coordinators in the Group compa- nies continuously exchange information with  the responsible specialists in each of the op- erational areas. In addition to voice and video  conferences, cross-company workshops also  take place regularly. CR database as the basis for  key-figure management Introduced in the first half of 2010, the CR  database provides a necessary overview  of the comprehensive key performance- indicator system; this allows the Group to  determine how deeply CR issues have al- ready been integrated in the core processes  of the company. CR-related figures from the  Employees, Assortment and Customers as  well as Climate and Environment CR fields  of action are thus captured and prepared  uniformly throughout the Group for the  very first time. In this way, the CR database  is an effective means for evaluating the im- plementation status of CR objectives and  managing the measures taken. Internal  data comparisons allow for best-practice  identification and process improvements  (e.g. CO2 benchmarking; see p. 79). The  figures collected are based on the CR and  Climate Protection Strategies and will be  summarised in CR Reporting. Group-wide Sustainability  Guideline bundles requirements From Autumn 2011 onwards many of the  Otto Groups CR-related requirements will  be bundled into a Sustainability Guideline  that is valid for all main Group companies  in the commercial segment. This Guideline  governs the conditions under which mer- chandise may be procured and distributed.  For example, the sale of goods with real  fur components will be excluded; there  are provisions made for textiles tested for  harmful substances, and working condi- tions at suppliers facilities (see p. 104)  will be established. The Guidelines imple- mentation takes place at the Group com- pany level and in future will be reviewed by  Group Internal Audit. Group-wide expansion of CR  Management: CR Rollout 2011-2012 In January 2011, the Otto Group launched  the project Corporate Responsibility Roll- out 2011-2012 (CR Rollout). The goal is to  design and implement CR Management in- ternationally and to expand it to include all  major Group companies, which jointly gen- erate roughly 90% of Group revenue. By the  end of 2012, measures are to be initiated in  these companies in order to manage sus- tainability actively, based on Group-wide  regulations. The CR Rollout covers topics from  three areas, with varying implementation  complexity and risk relevance. Minimum  indicates those topics for which imple- mentation implies no complex manage- ment requirements. These include, for ex- ample, banning the use of tropical timber,  proof of origin when using organic cotton,  implementing the Code of Conduct and  stakeholder management. Standard and  Profiling include tasks with complex man- agement requirements that significantly  exceed the Minimum coverage level, such  as the Group-wide Climate Protection  Strategy, development of the Social Pro- gramme or CR Reporting. These tasks are  undertaken primarily in companies with  annual revenues of more than 50 mn –  currently 43 Otto Group companies. The CR Rollout sets high standards,  particularly for Group companies that are  not yet integrated into the Otto Groups CR  Management. They must develop a com- prehensive understanding of sustainability  as well as specific actions for conceiving  and implementing sustainability in their  own core business processes. 42  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP stRAteGy AnD MAnAGeMent   oPeRAtInG FIGuRes  2007/08  2008/09**  2009/10  2010/11 Net turnover for the whole Group in mn 10,058.3 9,992.5 10,132.0 11,403.9 Net turnover for the companies covered by this report in mn (combined values)* 4,312.0 4,214.5 5,060.4 5,733.2 Capital of the whole Group in mn  2,671.9 2,160.4 2,036.2 2,080.5 Capital of the companies covered by this report in mn* 1,477.6 1,458.8 761.7 776.2 Liabilities of the whole Group in mn  10,786.2 4,460.8 4,292.8 4,534.3 Liabilities of the companies covered by this report in mn* 3,303.4 3,617.6 1,347.5 1,762.6 * 2009/10 and 2010/11 reporting companies incl.

These  included a soft-shell girls jacket from OTTO and a glass table from  bonprix (see p. 117). In the reporting period, regulatory authorities and lawyers presented  a total of 55 complaints regarding violations of customer-data protec- tion laws. Many of the complaints concerned the sending of newslet- ters without the prior agreement of the addressee. The 20 violations of product-information labelling standards in the re- porting period concerned violations of laws regarding manufacturers  information, CE markings or missing instruction manuals. Examples  of marketing-standards violations included missing base-price infor- mation and confusing quality-seal claims. In the reporting period, one complaint was also received due to a vio- lation of gender-equality laws. Consumer protection violations and sanctions In financial year 2010/11, the Otto Groups employee headcount – con- verted to full-time equivalents – totalled 49,721 (47,952 in the previous  year). The fall in headcount in 2009/10 versus 2008/09 was mainly due  to the restructuring in the Groups Great Britain activities. The eleven reporting companies employed 20,248 people in financial  year 2010/11, representing around 40% of the Groups total workforce.  This increase versus the previous reporting period is mainly attribut- able to the inclusion of Hermes in the group of reporting companies.

Consequently, we are conducting a wide range of discussions with our stakeholders,   who include non-governmental organisations and our employees. These different  perspectives help the Group to identify potential risks early on and produce solutions   to ecological and social challenges more quickly. We are in continual dialogue with our vari- ous stakeholders, who include customers,  suppliers, employees, non-governmental  organisations (NGOs) and representatives  from politics, academia and the business  community. The diverse range of dialogues  enables our Group to gauge the expecta- tions and requirements of our stakeholders  and to draw impetus from them. A further  aim of our dialogues is to initiate and shape  positive developments in the market, such  as ensuring humane working conditions in  our sourcing countries and raising the at- tractiveness of sustainable products. In this  effort the Group has succeeded in bringing  together people of different and even con- troversial perspectives, and initiating lively  discussions through events on ethical con- sumption, among other activities. Our Stakeholder Management System,  which we further developed in this reporting  period, allows the Otto Group to identify  trends and possible critical issues early on  in dialogue processes and to respond to  these. Stakeholder dialogue is therefore a  catalyst for innovation processes and thus  contributes to safeguarding the Groups  reputation. We are in continual dialogue with our stakeholders   and in particular of course with our customers:   each year, the companies covered by this report  interact with 37 million of them. This very close  dialogue allows us to better understand the current  and future needs of our customers. In this regard,  conscious consumption is emerging as a social trend,  whereby growing consumer power plays a key role. We  will also continue to play an active and pioneering role  as a communicator, agent and enabler between our  suppliers and customers.

This  will ensure that Group companies respond  with a uniform approach to all external   enquiries. Furthermore, our procedural instruc- tions will indicate possible approaches on  how best to respond to specific stakeholder  expectations and how to implement these  responses within the company. Depending  on the significance and urgency, this may ei- ther be through decisions at Executive Board  level or by adapting our policies and hand- books. In addition, the procedural instruc- tions provide guidelines on handling critical  enquiries; for instance, if queries originate  from NGOs, these will immediately be for- warded to our Corporate Responsibility Area,  which will then decide on the next steps.  Critical enquiries from the media will be for- warded to the Group Communications Area  which will coordinate its efforts with our  Corporate Responsibility Area regarding the  underlying issue. STAKEHOlDER  MANAGEMENT SySTEM The Otto Group is continually working towards  improving the quality of our dialogue further,  as well as the way in which we work with our  stakeholders. We made an important step  towards this in 2011 with the further develop- ment of our Stakeholder Management System.  Documenting interactions in the  stakeholder management database The basis of our Stakeholder Management  System is the Stakeholder Management Data- base in which we extensively document all  relevant interactions with our different stake- holder groups. Within this tool we list and  assign all internal and external stakeholders  to a topic area or a stakeholder group for the  Climate and Environment, Suppliers as well  as Assortment and Customers fields of action. Verified Stakeholder  Management System To continually improve our CR performance,  we have our sustainability-related processes   including our Stakeholder Management  System  verified by the accounting and  consulting firm PwC. Auditing is carried  out under the AccountAbility1000 (AA1000)  standard, and its core assessment criterion  is the incorporation of stakeholders into the  companys sustainability process. Dialogue with critical stakeholders  based on the example of  live feather plucking In the Otto Group, we have established a  transparent and partnership-based way of  working with our stakeholders, even when  it comes to critical issues. In November 2010,  following a report by the ARD television pro- gramme Report Mainz and the animal wel- fare organisation Four Paws on feather-down  obtained from live plucking in the assortments  of OTTO, Baur and Schwab, numerous letters  of protest were received by CEO Hans-Otto  Schrader and the companies concerned  (see p. 104). We took immediate action,   removing all that particular suppliers pro- ducts from our assortments. Furthermore,  we entered into very close dialogue with  Four Paws and supported the animal welfa- re organisation in an initiative which aims  to move the EU to tighten up live-plucking  regulations. Roll-out of stakeholder management  procedural instructions  With our new procedural instructions which  we will roll out in autumn 2011 in the com- panies covered by this report, we will further  professionalise our Stakeholder Management  System.

Here, primarily the  possible tensions between external require- ments and the companies actual opportu- nities to influence matters were examined  in detail. Focus topics included climate and  environmental protection, switching to sus- tainable assortments and working condi- tions in the sourcing markets. For instance,  Otto Group representatives discussed op- portunities to ensure humane working con- ditions (see p. 102) with trade-union and  government representatives as well as with  other local stakeholders in Bangladesh, Tur- key and China. Here, the Otto Group initiated  a host of strategic and future-orientated dia- logue events on Corporate Responsibility. New CR Strategy event   In April 2010, a critical public attended our pre- sentation of the Otto Groups new CR Strat- egy. Amongst over 200 internal and external  attendees were managers from the Group as  well as representatives from universities, the  Utopia Internet platform and the WWF. In  line with the Groups Vision as well as with its  mission The Power of Responsibility, our new  CR Strategy anchors the topic of sustainabil- ity as a core element in the Groups culture.  At the same time we are pursuing the aim of  performing well in all CR sub-disciplines and  placing ourselves ahead of the competition in  terms of overall results (see p. 39). Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue to  further develop CR reporting  and management We are further developing our CR reporting  as a central communication tool for stake- holder dialogue in active exchange with our  stakeholders. In a workshop held in 2010, 27  internal and external stakeholders – includ- ing representatives from NABU (German  Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union),  Transparency International and the German  trade union ver.di – detailed their core ex- pectations of our CR reporting 2011. Prior to  that, key CR topics were evaluated based on  a questionnaire and the results were sum- marised in a Materiality Matrix. The results  showed that our Climate Protection Strategy  and Social Management System are impor- tant reporting topics, both for our employees  as well as for our external stakeholders. The  Otto Group has been working on these two  topics very intensively for a while now (see  p. 76, p. 98) and they form core elements of  our new CR Strategy.  Building on the results of the Materiality  Matrix, participants produced five require- ments on the future focus of our CR reporting. At the centre was the requirement for  proactive transparency when outlining the  Groups business processes as well as their  impact on humanity and nature. In particu- lar, it was felt that our Purchasing Policy and  the implementation process for social and  environmental standards in the supply chain  ought to be described in more detail. There  were also demands for greater cross-industry  comparability in reporting facts, figures and  specific targets and aims. Furthermore, it was  stated that the interconnections between  our Business and CR Strategies needed to be  better established and that the whole Group  and its value chain ought to be incorporated  in our coverage These lively discussions provided impor- tant stimuli for the Otto Groups CR reporting,  In its Stakeholder Workshops the Otto Group brings representatives from critical public associations, business, politics and science  together around the table. stAkeholDeR DIAloGue otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 49  materials and paper products. Here, were  playing a leading role in Europe in imple- menting FSC projects (see p. 84). Hermes intensifies  stakeholder dialogue  In the transport sector, Hermes is faced  with particular expectations and chal- lenges. For this reason it intensified the  exchange with its stakeholders during the  reporting period. In November 2010, the  company organised the first Hermes Fu- ture Forum in Hamburg. 75 guests from  the political and business spheres, includ- ing numerous respected international  figures such as Nobel Peace Prize winner  Muhammad Yunus, former UN Secretary  General Kofi Annan, Puma CEO Jochen Zeitz  as well as Dr Michael Otto and Otto Group  CEO Hans-Otto Schrader, discussed what  responsibility companies bear for social  and ecological business practices. The aim  was to provide impetus for sustainable  entrepreneurship and to provide practical  perspectives. At the forum, the significance  of conducting business in a way that uses  as few resources as possible for growth and  future competitiveness was discussed in  detail. Employee loyalty – from informal  discussions to expert groups Our employees are among our most impor- tant stakeholders. We offer them the oppor- tunity to contribute their ideas at numer- ous formal and informal events, whether  through getting involved in working groups  or in informal networking events such as  Conference and discussions  on protecting biodiversity  The Otto Group has traditionally held the  view that biodiversity should be treated   responsibly. As a member of the Business  and Biodiversity Initiative and host of two  of the initiatives dialogue events, we made  a decisive contribution to the prepara- tions for the Conference of the Parties to  the Convention of Biological Diversity, held  in the Japanese city of Nagoya in October  2010. As part of this, we organised an event  where environmental associations and  member companies of the initiative were  able to exchange experiences. During this  event, the The Economics of Ecosystems  and Biodiversity study was presented and  its consequences on the way companies  operate were discussed. Furthermore, the  Otto Group organised an initiative work- shop in Hamburg directly in the run-up to  the Nagoya conference, in which the final  preparations were made and future per- spectives were discussed (see p. 81). Cross-industry information  event on FSC criteria As part of our membership of the Forest  Stewardship Council (FSC), we organised  specialist dialogue events in 2010 in which  we informed representatives from over 80  printing companies, paper suppliers and  other FSC-certified companies about how  to use the logo in compliance with FSC  guidelines, and in which we discussed the  latest status of those requirements. Be- sides furniture production, FSC certifica- tion is particularly relevant to our printed  which we have already implemented to some  extent in this current report. We have paid  greater consideration to the requirement  for proactive transparency: in the chapters   Climate and Environment, Suppliers as well  as Assortment and Customers, the business  environment along the value chain, result- ing challenges and selected solutions are  described in detail. For instance, the limited  opportunities to exert influence on produc- tion processes when sourcing products in  risk markets is one of the issues that we have  highlighted; among other activities, we are  countering this by stepping up our drive to  form alliances (see p. 102). Consumer power dialogue  event in Berlin In June 2011, we held our fourth expert  workshop on Ethical Consumption, this  time entitled Consumer power and con- sumer confidence – consequences for Ethi- cal Consumption. Chaired by Otto Group  Executive Board Member Dr Timm Homann,  representatives from the spheres of politics,  the media and NGOs discussed the neces- sary prerequisites for customers to be able  to take conscious and confident decisions  as consumers. Together, a thesis was devel- oped which is intended to provide guidance  to companies as well as those involved in  politics and civil society. After a high-level  podium discussion, the participants formed  two working groups in which, based on spe- cific expert theses, they discussed the role  of politics, civil society and the media in the  process of building confidence and compa- nies opportunities to influence this.  We Want to participate in dialogue With  consumers, increasing their poWer. it is important not to overWhelm customers  nor to patronise them.

Lunch & Learn (see p. 57). When it comes to  important company and cross-area topics,  we bring together the employees concerned  in internal working groups. One example  is our Climate Protection Strategy Working  Group that convenes on a regular basis; em- ployees from 18 Group companies as well  as various Otto Group areas are involved in  this. Under the supervision of our CR Area,  in the reporting period this Working Group  developed a plan to implement our Climate  Protection Strategy agreed in 2007 at our   locations (see p. 79). CR COMMUNICATIONS  Besides stakeholder dialogues, our overall CR  communications are aimed at informing our  internal and external stakeholders. Through  our Group-wide CR communications we in- tend to intensify and systemise dialogue with  our stakeholders. At Group level we also pub- lish an exhaustive CR Report every two years,  which is supplemented with company-specific  CR publications by our Group subsidiaries. CR communications positions the  Otto Group as thought leader  Through our CR communications we intend  to position the Otto Group more strongly than  previously as a sustainable company group  in the eyes of the public. To achieve this, we  clearly emphasise the Groups qualities as a  thought leader, initiator and pioneer of new  ideas, projects and initiatives in the area of CR.  Overarching strategic topics and projects in- clude our Climate Protection Strategy, our sus- tainable online shop ECOREPUBLIC and the de- velopment of a Product Sustainable Footprint.  In terms of content, our CR communications   focus on our five CR fields of action: Employees,  Society, Suppliers, Climate and Environment as  well as on Assortment and Customers. Besides CR communication at Group level,  the single Group companies address their  particular stakeholders in a targeted way and  on their own initiative, as these companies  are closer to their respective customers and  products. Communication at Group level is  therefore supplemented with local measures  by the Group subsidiaries. For instance, OTTO  is increasingly reporting on its CR activities  in the companys o.ton employee magazine.  With its new environmental label WE DO!,  Hermes is highlighting its focus on carbon- efficient logistics services to its customers  and clients, with all shipments across Europe  bearing this environmental label. stAkeholDeR DIAloGue otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 51  Internal CR communications We also further intensified our internal CR  communications in the reporting period  through countless networking, training and  information offers. Through our networking  offers, we mainly target those responsible  for CR, such as CR Coordinators in the Group  companies, or Social Officers who are active  locally in the sourcing markets. Furthermore,  the Otto Group offers employee training  courses and workshops as well as a grow- ing number of presentations on CR topics. In  2010 we launched an internal CR newsletter  targeted at managers and employees across  the Group interested in the topic of CR.  Otto Group Trend Study 2009 – an  example of external CR communications  At the same time as our CR reporting we pub- lish a Trend Study every two years on ethical  consumption. In 2009 it focused on the topic  of The future of ethical consumption. When  this was published, the results were met with  great media interest; we also communicated  them at events and in the form of a brochure.  In 2011 the topic will be Consumer confidence  and its consequences for ethical consumption:  our aim here is to make ethical consumption a  key topic in future public discussions. Supplementary CR reports by  the single Group companies Besides CR reporting at Group level, our  single Group subsidiaries publish their own  independent CR reports, which they use for  targeted communication to their specific  stakeholders. For instance, in January 2011  Baur published its first concise CR report  detailing its CR objectives, programmes and  measures. Focusing on Climate and Environ- ment, Assortment and Customers, Suppliers,  Employees and Society, this report linked  up with the five CR fields of action at Group  level. It is aimed at employees and business  partners, but is also available to custom- ers on the companys homepage. OTTO,  SportScheck, bonprix and UNITO have also  supplemented our CR reporting with their  own publications. By contrast, Hermes pub- lishes its own environmental report once a  year; this exhaustively documents the com- panys performance in this area. Numerous awards for CR performance In the reporting period, several reporting  companies in the Otto Group were once  again recognised with prizes and awards  for their special efforts, particularly in the  areas of Services, Climate and Environment  as well as Employer Quality.  In 2009 OTTO received the fashion in- dustrys Top Employer award following  a study conducted by the specialist trade  magazine TextilWirtschaft. The results are  based on a survey of fashion industry grad- uates, job starters and job seekers carried  out in 2009. In 2010 Baur was awarded the  Excellent customer service certificate with  five crowns by the agency ServiceRating; in  the same year, SportScheck was awarded  the title of Best Sports Business by DISQ,  the German Institute for Service Quality. In  2011 both OTTO and UNITO were elected in  two different rankings as being the most  customer-focused service providers in the  retail category, with both receiving a Ser- vice Oscar. In September 2010 we strengthened  our position as a leader and pioneer in the  field of climate and environmental protec- tion, scooping the first ever FSC Global  Partner Award in the mail-order category.  We earned particular praise from the FSCs  renowned jury for the way in which we com- prehensively promoted the significance of  the FSC logo for consumers (see p. 84). Fur- thermore, Hermes was awarded the Hanse  Globe for sustainable logistics projects for  its efforts in climate and environmental pro- tection. The  personal  commitment  of  Dr Michael Otto was also recognised once  again with multiple awards. Among them,  the Chairman of the Supervisory Board was  awarded the UNESCO Support sculpture  in 2010 for his successful engagement in  the area of climate protection (see p. 132).

As one of the first compa- nies to do so, in November 2009 OTTO signed  the Utopia Changemaker Manifesto, thereby  underscoring its stated aim to be a pioneer in  the area of Corporate Responsibility. The com- pany is committed to upholding the Manifestos  Ten Commitments: these include integrating  sustainability at Executive Board level and into  management processes along the entire value  chain, reducing the use of natural resources and  promoting environmentally friendly practices  among the companys customers. In October  2010, OTTO also supported the Utopia annual  conference as a main sponsor of the event. In October 2010, Hermes signed a five- year cooperation agreement with NABU  Landesverband Hamburg e. V. (the German  Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union)  to support the unions nature-conservation  work on the River Elbe floodplain in Lower  Saxony. Baur is a signatory of the Environ- mental Pact of Bavaria and is also in direct  dialogue with local authorities to reduce  site-reconstruction noise levels, among other   initiatives.

Our employees  take responsibility for everything that can be improved, however  big or small, and instil sustainability in the core business. They  develop new ideas and also get involved on their own initiative:  in 2010, over 100 of our employees volunteered in our Young  classX music project. This is the attitude that will enable us to  remain successful in the market long-term while also fulfilling our  responsibility to society. Alexander Birken, Member of the Executive Board,   Human Resources, Controlling & IT OTTO,   Chief Human Resources Officer leARnInG FRoM one AnotheR   AnD GRowInG toGetheR To the Otto Group, responsibility for our almost 50,000 employees means more than just safeguarding jobs.  We aim to create an environment for our employees in which they can work creatively and develop innovative  ideas. This is why we offer them a wide range of development and dialogue opportunities. The Otto Groups human-resources man- agement faces a variety of challenges.  Among them, demographic change in par- ticular demands human-resources policy  solutions to attract talented employees to  our Group and to secure their long-term  loyalty. This is why we invest extensively in  attracting talent, vocational training and  employee loyalty. Our Group operates in a dynamic busi- ness environment. Within this, our transi- tion to becoming a multichannel retailer  as well as our international expansion re- quire a high degree of willingness on the  part of our employees to learn and adapt to  change. The Group aims to help them – ir- respective of gender, age and ethnicity – to  realise their full potential. To achieve this,  we offer flexible working arrangements  and systematic health management, along  with extensive professional development  opportunities. Our Group places empha- sis on supporting its employees according   to the different stages of their lives and  their related needs to maintain their em- ployability and motivation throughout  their careers. eMPloyees otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 55  New mission The Power of Responsibility: common commitment of the Otto Group Executive Board  to a Group-wide, value-orientated company culture. innovate. Through its Heine Online Trans- formation programme, this Group company  closely involves its employees in its transi- tion to an Internet-based sales model. Im- plementation is made transparent using live  tickers, a newsletter, blogs, the Intranet and  information events. A further core value of our corporate mis- sion is promoting Diversity within our Group  companies, and this is reflected in our stra- tegic priorities for human resources. Within  the context of expansion, bonprix is foster- ing exchange with its international group  companies, for example by organising inter- national human-resources meetings; UNITO  launched programmes and initiatives to pro- mote work-life balance in 2011, and Hermes  is pursuing the aim of strengthening its in- tercultural competencies, making cultural  diversity visible and successfully managing  demographic change. To unite the Group mission value of Prof- itability with flexibility, OTTO is focusing on  bringing flexibility to working hours and lo- cations, as well as on making internal pro- cesses digital through its Workspace 2010  programme. INDIVIDUAl HUMAN RESOURCES  STRATEGIES CONTRIBUTE TO THE  IMplEMENTATION OF OUR MISSION While Otto Group companies set different  strategic priorities when formulating their  human-resources strategies, every compa- ny follows the values set out in our Group  mission, The Power of Responsibility (see  p. 32). They take appropriate measures to  contribute towards ensuring the long-term  profitability of the Group, promoting in- novation and diversity, and positioning the  Otto Group as an attractive employer. In  line with the Groups commitment to treat- ing employees and partners with respect,  we give our individual Group companies  a high degree of autonomy and freedom  when formulating their individual human- resources strategies. This is essential in  ensuring that each Group company meets  the varying economic, social and cultural  challenges in its particular business area  and region. local implementation of  our shared values Otto Group companies human-resources  strategies are derived from our Groups mis- sion values. These strategies are evaluated  annually and analysed by our Group HR Di- vision, which advises the Group companies  on implementing human-resources policy  aims. It also provides operational support,  for instance by holding workshops and  providing best-practice examples. Besides  OTTO, Schwab, SportScheck and UNITO, in  2011 Heine also aligned its human-resourc- es strategy with the topic of e-commerce,  thus strengthening our Groups ability to  21.3% 22.0% 56.7 % 2010/11   Employee headcount: 26,671 (reporting companies) aged  under 30 aged  over 50 aged from 30 to 50 Employee numbers eMPloyees 56  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  Strengthening employee identification – OTTO em- ployees as models on Fashion Days. positive ratings  Several companies covered by this report  regularly conduct employee surveys to  gauge employee satisfaction and enable  them to identify the need to make changes  early on. In total, 16 surveys were conducted  by the reporting companies in the reporting  period. With over 60% of employees providing  feedback, Witt achieved an exceptionally  high return rate in 2010. The survey revealed  that employees rated the business climate  and the health management system as  particularly positive, with information and  co-determination receiving a significantly  better rating than in the previous survey in  2004.  Ich bin OTTO (I am OTTO)  employee programme The majority of our Group companies ac- tively encourage employee identification  with the particular companys aims and  values. Following this approach, OTTO  launched its Ich bin OTTO (I am OTTO) pro- gramme in 2009, against the backdrop of  far-reaching changes in the transition to  an e-commerce business model, and the  market opportunities that were opening  up as a result of the global economic cri- sis. OTTO communicated its corporate aims  and values to over 5,000 employees over  seven one-to-two-week campaign periods,  at Fashion Days held in February 2009 or  presentations to OTTO Purchasing staff, for  example. In 2010 the company highlighted  its strategic aims with the Lange Nacht  der Gipfelstrmer (Night of the Mountain- eers), in which various campaign stands  helped employees find out about strate- gies and initiatives designed to increase  company profitability. A RESpONSIBlE EMplOyER The Otto Group makes a point of actively  involving employees in the companys de- velopment. We seek dialogue with them and  their representatives, and promote open ex- change across the entire Group. Besides this  we develop consensus solutions in difficult  situations, such as company restructurings.  We also allow our employees to share in our  economic success by offering them competi- tive, performance-related remuneration as  well as attractive benefits.   Open dialogue across all  hierarchical levels Intensive exchange across business-areas  and hierarchical levels promotes company-in- ternal learning processes, strengthens team  spirit and improves mutual understanding. In  particular, informal discussion formats invite  employees to have fun exploring new topics  and to talk about them with colleagues and  managers. In 2010 OTTO invited its employees  to three Espresso Talks which were each at- tended by an Executive Board member, plus  Lunch & Learn business snacks with presen- tations of specialist topics. Baur, UNITO and  Witt also hold regular mealtime events with  Executive Board members. Besides personal  exchange, our Group companies use their  intranet sites to encourage dialogue and the  transfer of knowledge between managers  and employees. At Witt, for example, man- agers and the Works Council are available for  Q&A sessions on the Gute Frage (Good Ques- tion) platform. At Heine, managers blog about  their everyday work and answer employees  questions. In 2010 SportScheck launched  SportScheck-trainiert-Web-2.0 (SportScheck  Trains Web 2.0) – an online platform that al- lows all employees to share their knowledge. Dialogue events on critical  situations with stakeholders In critical situations too, such as prior to re- structurings, the Otto Group fosters dialogue  with its employees and their representatives  to find socially acceptable solutions together.  We enter into these discussions with the de- sire to find constructive solutions. At almost  all our locations, the interests of employees  are represented by Works Councils. In May  2010, the youngest Works Council of the  Otto Group was founded in the administra- tion office at OTTO Hamburg. Agreed approach to modernising  warehousing logistics At the start of 2009 out Group decided to  modernise its warehousing logistics ser- vices. Before we took action we entered into  intensive negotiations on the implemen- tation arrangements with employee rep- resentatives. Faced with new competitors  in Germany and neighbouring European  countries, our aim was to maintain our lo- gistics networks competitiveness, thereby  eMPloyees otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 57  year, which is linked both to achievement   of the companys as well as individual tar- gets. Furthermore, the Group offers em- ployees both within and outside collective  salary scales additional financial bonuses,  such as Christmas and holiday pay. In addi- tion, OTTO, Heine, Hermes, Witt, UNITO and  bonprix subsidise employees travel tickets  for local public transport. Over half of the reporting companies of- fer their employees the opportunity to join  an occupational pension scheme. Employees  are entitled to a collectively agreed pension  and a favourable rate if they are directly in- sured or participate in the salary-conversion  scheme. The Employers Contribution made  by the Group is 10% of the pension contribu- tion converted, provided that social security  payments are saved through this. Scope for individual responsibility  in structuring working hours Depending on their areas of responsibility,  all Group companies offer their employees  flexible working hours. At OTTO for in- stance, over 700 employees regularly work  from home, with laptops and iPads provided  for this purpose. At Baur, Heine, Hermes,  Frankonia, Witt and OTTO, employees can  use job-sharing arrangements – an offer  taken up by some 200 Hermes employees.  In 2010/11, 51.2% of the reporting compa- nies employees worked part-time, which  equates to 13,659 employees. further 107 jobs were lost as a result of the  integration of Discount24 and Yalook into  the existing online-shopping portal Smatch/ Shopping24. The workforce adjustments de- scribed above were made to enable these  companies to operate in a cost-conscious  and efficient way, thus helping to ensure the  Otto Groups long-term economic success. Sharing in our Groups success  through fair remuneration A key element of the way the Otto Group  manages its employees and ensures their  loyalty is through market-competitive and  performance-related  remuneration.  Per- formance and success-related components  at management level also form part of the  various additional bonuses the Group offers.  Through stock-ownership plans in the form  of profit-sharing rights, employees of com- panies in which the Group holds a majority  stake can also benefit directly from their  companys success. Executive Board and  employee remuneration Concerning remuneration practices, the  individual Group companies also act with  great independence, within the framework  of collective wage agreements. However,  the underlying remuneration structure for  senior management levels is defined by  the Groups HR Division. Here, achieving  sustainability objectives is an integral part  of the bonus system for Executive Board  members, with variable components based  on the achievement of key operating fig- ures (please see the Otto Groups Annual  Report 2010/11 for total remuneration fig- ures, p. 152). Non salary-scale employees also gener- ally receive a variable bonus for the financial  safeguarding jobs in the long term. Since  mid-2009 we have been implementing the  package of measures agreed with employee  representatives under the name Neue  marktorientierte  Lagerlogistik  (market- orientated realignment of the Otto Groups  warehousing logistics) or NmL for short.   Furthermore, our Group has kept its promise  to keep all our warehousing logistics loca- tions open in Germany. Almost all the Groups logistics locations  were affected by the changes – particularly  our logistics service provider Hermes, which  reduced its headcount by 500 without the  need for redundancies. Unavoidable work- force reductions were organised in a so- cially acceptable way and employees were  supported on their path to finding new  employment. To this end, Frankonia and  Hermes developed their own programmes,  with  information  and  career-guidance  events. UNITO established an own founda- tion which offered its employees extensive  qualification programmes following socially  acceptable company restructuring. Hermes  also supported those finding a new direc- tion for their careers by setting up an inter- nal job-vacancies site. Further personnel changes in the   single Group companies New business and sales models demand  further adjustments in the single Group  companies, such as at bonprix. In 2010, this  company successfully restructured its Pur- chasing and International Management ar- eas without reducing headcount; however,  SportScheck and Schwab had to make 96 re- dundancies in administrative and customer- support departments, in particular because  an increase in online orders reduced the need  for telephone-based customer assistance. A    Awards in the reporting period   www.ottogroup.com/cr-report eMPloyees 58  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  EDUCATIONAl AND FURTHER   TRAINING We get in touch early on with potential em- ployees to attract new talent to our Group,  thereby countering any threat of a shortage  of skilled employees. We also offer all our  employees – from apprentices to manag- ers – continuing professional development  courses which focus just as much on ex- panding their professional skills as on their  own personality. It is in our mutual interest  to ensure our employees receive extensive  training at all stages of their careers, right  through to retirement. We specifically pre- pare them to meet evolving challenges such  as the digitalisation of commerce, as well as  the increasing internationalisation of our  Group companies. The OTTO Academy offers an extensive  range of Group-wide professional develop- ment courses. 2,303 participants attended  202 training courses in 2010/11, ranging  from IT courses to top-management semi- nars. Other Group companies also offer their  employees a comprehensive range of fur- ther development opportunities, with 3,677  Targeted development of employees within the Otto Group Academy – ranging from young future managers to managing directors.  seminars being held across the Group in the  reporting period. Group-wide manager  development from the outset Once a year, our Group HR Division conducts  Group-wide performance and potential as- sessments of our managers, as part of our  management-succession planning process.  Besides Division Managers and Directors,  since autumn 2010 we have also assessed  Department Heads. When we identify high- potential employees we support them as  part of an Otto Group Academy programme  that focuses on individual development  stages. Right from the Groups new Talent  Development Programme, the basis is laid  for Group-wide networking and transparent  documentation of career-development paths.  The subsequent stages focus on Department  Heads and very high-potential employees  at Division Manager level. In the case of the  latter, since November 2010 Division Manag- ers have benefited from such initiatives as a  Cross-Mentoring Programme: this supports  Group-wide career paths with the aid of  mentors who are external to the managers  own Division. Stage four is the Top Execu- tive Development Programme for potential  Executive Directors, in which around twelve  managers each year participate. New digital   talent-management system The Otto Group offers its employees indivi- dual development opportunities which are  also aimed at strengthening our Group-wide  management pool to meet future challenges.  This is why Group-wide talent management  is closely integrated in our management- succession planning process. In 2011 we laun- ched our digital version, which provides even  greater transparency on high-potential em- ployees and their development steps, there- by supporting Group-wide career paths. From  autumn 2011, we also intend to replicate the  management assessment processes as part  of our new SAP-based talent management  system: this will allow further personal infor- mation to be linked. Here, internal high-po- tential employees as well as external talent   such as former employees or competitors  who cannot be appointed at the moment   will be entered into the system. eMPloyees otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 59  Common standards of knowledge  for purchasing and Sales In the reporting period we also conducted ex- tensive training in our central Purchasing and  Sales areas, for instance through our Group- wide development programme for Purchasers,  which we launched in October 2010. The pro- gramme aims to ensure a common standard  of knowledge, to allow qualified purchasing  decisions to be made in line with our corpo- rate values. Furthermore, in partnership with  the Bavarian Akademie Handel (Commerce  Academy), SportScheck is offering a Sales  Manager qualification course which provides  content from the areas of Marketing and  Sales, Human Resources management as well  as operational Controlling and Management. E-commerce is a key topic As part of our further training activities,  we are placing a strategic focus on expand- ing our employees e-commerce knowledge   using a Group-wide intranet platform. Here,  e-commerce topics and terms are clearly ex- plained in short articles covering subjects  such as viruses and different smartphone  applications. E-commerce is also being   examined in detail as part of Heines On- line Transformation programme (see p. 56).  Heine has already achieved great success in  this respect: in an exhaustive survey, 95% of  employees said they understood and agreed  with the process. Baur and bonprix also of- fer their own range of e-commerce training  courses, while OTTO has incorporated the  topic of digital turnaround into its Leader- ship Programme for 2011. Gathering experiences in interrelated  matters in other business areas Many Group companies deliberately give  their employees space to gather experience  outside their own working environments  too. To offer an insight into company pro- cesses and promote cross-area communi- cation, since 2009 bonprix has called on its  Department Heads and supervisors each  year to spend some time in other areas of  the business. Twice a year, Witt makes it pos- sible for all employees to spend one day in  another area that interests them. The non-profit organisation Seiten- Wechsel (Changing Sides) offers personal  development courses for managers, who  can gain an insight into different ways of   living by helping out for a week at a social   institution. Witt and bonprix also partici- pate in this project. Systematically documenting  further training In return for the Groups extensive invest- ment in further training, our companies  expect strong willingness from their em- ployees to continue to learn. In this regard,  the further training costs and rates are sub- ject to systematic checking at SportScheck  and Baur, for instance. In 2008 SportScheck  introduced its own electronic reporting  system for its stores: this logs the number  and type of events as well as the number of  participants. The end result for 2010 showed  992 campaign events were held and 6,026  people participated. In calendar year 2010,  Baur achieved an increase of 15% versus the  previous year in terms of its further train- ing rate, with the number of participants  increasing from 1,371 to 1,599. Securing qualified new talent To counter the threat of a shortage of skilled  employees and to secure a broad base of  qualified new talent for the Group, our indi- vidual companies carry out numerous activi- ties at a variety of levels. Using innovative re- cruitment methods, they specifically appeal  to young target groups and support them  right from the vocational orientation phase. Recruiting talent via social networks When approaching job starters, we increas- ingly use social media such as Twitter, Face- book and Xing. By doing this we intend not  only to reach a wider target group, but also  to appeal specifically to new talents who  are skilled in using new media and who can  apply this knowledge in our company to at- tract a new generation of customers. We  have almost 2,000 followers on Twitter who  receive the regular job information updates  we post, while our Otto Group Karriere  (Otto Group Career) fan-page on Facebook  has over 3,000 fans. News about job offers  is also spread via our employees personal  Facebook pages, and the Group has its own  YouTube account where we post videos on  career topics. In June 2010 OTTO employees from the  companys New Media Division launched a  blog on e-commerce topics called eStarter.

These  place just as much emphasis on promoting  specialist know-how as on extensively pre- paring young people for the modern world  of work. In the eleven reporting companies,  in 2009/10 a total of 743 young people par- ticipated in vocational training in just over  30 vocational training positions – with this  number rising to 778 in 2010/11. OTTO and Baurs trainee companies of- fer apprentices specific opportunities to  implement real-life, profit-orientated proj- ects themselves. This helps them acquire  key skills and qualifications such as an  awareness of responsibility and cost, man- agement competencies and team-working  skills; moreover, they are also trained on  how to put entrepreneurial thinking and  acting into practice. Cooperation5, OTTOs  trainee enterprise, devises and organises  events, promotional campaigns and sup- porting programmes for conferences and  office parties for the company. At b-sales,  the trainee enterprise founded by Baur in  2009, apprentices auction sample articles,  watches and jewellery to employees via an  intranet platform – and it already has al- most 1,000 users. Selected university collaborations Ideally, students are prepared during their  studies for the specific challenges facing them  if they intend to enter the world of multichan- nel retail. This is why the Otto Group has tra- ditionally played an extensive and long-term  role in engaging with the university sector to  motivate students to start their careers in our  Group. A current example of this is our en- dowed Chair for Home Shopping and Service  Marketing at Zeppelin University in Friedrichs- hafen, which started its first cycle of lectures  in the 2010 winter semester. In addition, since  2011 the first consecutive Masters degree  course dedicated to e-commerce has been  running in Germany at the Wedel University  of Applied Sciences – a Chair endowed by the  Otto Group with the participation of Baur,  bonprix, OTTO, Schwab, SportScheck and Witt.  Furthermore, since 2008, Hamburg University  of Applied Sciences has been offering the only  Multichannel Trade Management in Textile  Business course in Germany – all made pos- sible through our foundation professorship. A further example is SportScheck, which  is driving forward modern management voca- tional training in over-the-counter retail, with  its professional development course for Execu- tive Board employees. This was developed in  collaboration with the University of St. Gallen. In addition to those mentioned, we also  collaborate with the following universities: 	European School of Business in Reutlingen  	Leuphana University, Lneburg 	Humboldt University, Berlin 	University of Mnster   Westphalia – Marketing Center Mnster 	University of Applied Sciences, Wedel 	University of Applied Sciences, Amberg- Weiden (Witt) The Otto Group plans to progressive- ly expand its university partnerships. To  achieve this, we are seeking university part- ners for each of our segments: Multichannel  Retail, Financial Services and Services.

For example, OTTO  offers a multimedia training programme  covering topics such as such as personal   development, developing values, sustainabil- ity and innovation. Our Group companies have a range of  offerings when it comes to specifically ap- pealing to young people in the vocational  orientation phase: 	Schwab, bonprix, Baur, OTTO und Witt  job-application training   	Witt  podium discussions on applying for jobs  (for school pupils, teachers and parents) 	OTTO  sending information to schools for parents  evenings on apprenticeships; interactive  apprentice blog 	Baur  Woche der Ausbildung (Training Week),  in which school pupils work with Baur  employees on real-life projects 	Frankonia short gunsmith internship 	Witt, Schwab, Baur und Heine   Fit fr die Bewerbung (Fit for Application)  initiative of the Goinger Kreis (a German  employment think-tank)  	UNITO  trial internship for school pupils eMPloyees otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 61  DIVERSITy AND EQUAl  OppORTUNITIES The Otto Group is unequivocal in its com- mitment to offering all its employees equal  opportunities, irrespective of gender, age,  cultural background, ethnicity and physical  characteristics. The prerequisite is a culture  of openness and appreciation, in which  each individual can realise his potential.  This is why we have set to promote Diver- sity as part of our new company mission,  The Power of Responsibility. Agreement to promote Diversity   Our Group Works Agreement on the Pro- motion of Diversity and Protection from  Discrimination of December 2006 applies  to all our Group companies in Germany;  it forms the foundation for partnership- based,  non-discriminatory  cooperation  among employees. This Agreement calls  on all our employees to actively play their  part in applying these principles in their  working environment, and the same mes- sage is spread nationwide across Germany  through our E-Learning Programme. Appreciating the different  stages of life   Otto Group companies contribute towards  the Groups Human Resources policy, which  is geared towards employees different  stages of life with a range of offers. This  is all the more important, as the shortage  of skilled employees demands innovative  measures to ensure employee loyalty and  maintain employability. As such we place  particular emphasis on ensuring we have  a balanced age-structure and that our em- ployees have a healthy work-life balance  (see p. 63). Schwab actively promotes diversity among its workforce.  This is something thats also reflected in Schwabs structure:  60% of its workforce is female, women account for an above- average 50% of managers, and people from 33 different  nations work for the company.  Schwab is engaged in  improving its emplo- yees work-life balance.  One example is its mem- bership of Bndnis fr  Familie (Family Alliance)  in Hanau, which it joi- ned in 1999. The Alliance  works at a local level to  relieve the burden on  families, for instance by  getting stores and local  authorities to change  their opening times to  more family-friendly  hours, making changes  to public transport time- tables and by setting up  a support service to pro- vide childcare at short  notice. Schwab is repre- sented on the Advisory  Board as well as on the  Steering Committee  and in various working  groups of the Family  Alliance in Hanau. Fur- thermore, the company  is collaborating with the  local specialist integra- tion service (IFD) which  advises employees and  managers in regular con- sultations on topics such  as conflict management,  and on how to organise  workplaces to enable  full access for disabled  employees. eMPloyees 62  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  increased once again for this purpose in the  reporting period. Since 2010, OTTO and Witt  employees have also been able to bring  their children into work with them and use  dedicated parent-child rooms, should they  run into difficulties finding child-minders.  This offer was used 52 times at OTTO dur- ing 2010. Our Group companies also support  parents in searching for suitable day-care  places. For instance, the OTTO package of  measures Eltern in Bestleistung (Parents  at Peak Performance) launched by the  Works Council and Human Resources de- partment includes, among other things,  a collaboration with ElternService AWO,  a parents service of the Workers Welfare  Association, which finds childcare places  across Germany. Since launching this coop- eration in June 2010, the service has been  used 62 times. Achieving a greater percentage  of women in top management When it comes to equal opportunities in  the world of work, the Otto Groups objec- tive is to balance the ratio of women to men  at all levels as far as possible; however, we  feel that limiting this target to introducing  a female ratio when filling managerial posi- tions is too short-sighted. Criteria such as  qualifications and ability to fit in, as well as  Work-life balance Flexible working models that balance work  and private life are offered as a matter of  course across the Otto Group. To support  employees with dependants in need of  care, OTTO launched its Hilfe, meine Eltern  werden alt! (Help, my parents are getting  old!) seminar programme at the start of  2011. This covers topics such as dementia/ Alzheimers and new types of accommoda- tion for the elderly. Employees with chil- dren are also supported, whereby Baur,  UNITO, Frankonia and OTTO extend statu- tory parental leave. At SportScheck, 18% of  employees on parental leave are part-tim- ers – and the share of part-time jobs was  A multi-purpose working space: OTTO and Witt offer parents a special child-friendly office. eMPloyees otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 63  the individuals motivation and impact are  instrumental in filling managerial posts. The  share of women in managerial positions in  financial year 2010/11 was 16.8% for the elev- en reporting companies. The Otto Group  aims to achieve a ratio whereby women  occupy at least 20% of all managerial posi- tions as well as all other hierarchical levels  by financial year 2015/16, across all Group  companies (see p. 142). One of the measures we have imple- mented to expand the share of women  in managerial roles is our participation in  the Generation CEO initiative. Here, 40  female managers from various companies  – including the Otto Group – receive career  coaching, get to know the Chief Executive  Officers of the sponsoring companies and  are given wide-ranging networking sup- port. In September 2010, our Executive  Board members Hans-Otto Schrader and  Dr Timm Homann met the participants in a  discussion group. Mixed-age structure    a Human Resources policy aim Demographic  change  is  altering  the  age structures of society, as well as the  Otto Groups own workforce. For this rea- son, we consider all age groups when at- tracting talent, focusing on their poten- tial, and drive forward the promotion and  appreciation of employees  regardless  of age. One example of how the practical  knowledge of older employees is appreci- ated is Baurs 50+ programme, with which  the company specifically supports the hir- ing of applicants over the age of fifty. OTTO  and Witt offer special courses for older  employees, in which they get to grips with  growing older and the opportunities to ac- tively shape their career perspectives. HEAlTH MANAGEMENT The Otto Groups long-term Human Resourc- es Strategy also includes extensive health  and occupational safety management. This  is increasing in importance, particularly in  view of demographic change which is rais- ing the need for flexibility and performance  at the same time. In accordance with the  WHO (World Health Organization) definition,  we consider health as being a state of com- plete physical, mental, and social well-being.  As such, a focus area of the Groups health  management system is on prevention and  therefore ensuring our employees are able to  continue performing at their best. Our multi  award-winning health programmes help us  play a leading role in the retail industry in  this regard. Integrated health  promotion: aktiv.net The Otto Groups Centre of Excellence for  Group-wide health management system is  aktiv.net, the network founded in 2000 by  OTTO, with a health offering developed by an  interdisciplinary team of experts. Across Ger- many, aktiv.net supports 16,000 employees  from 16 Group companies at 249 locations  and also organises the 33 areas of our Groups  sports offering. All eleven reporting companies also run  their own health management systems, of- fering their employees extensive preventa- tive measures such as influenza vaccinations,  back-care training and dedicated sports  groups. OTTO Health Index 2010 In collaboration with the Mannheim Insti- tute of Public Health, in 2010 for the first  time OTTO surveyed the state of health and  Including disabled people A key guiding principle of our Human Re- sources Strategy is to encourage people  according to their individual abilities and  experiences. For instance, OTTO supports its  disabled employees by organising its work- places to offer them full access. At Hermes  offices in Hamburg, special receivers with  vibrating alarms have been installed to alert  deaf employees about the need to talk or  specific situations.  In 2011, UNITO hired 37 employees with  physical or social disabilities as part of a vo- cational training project in collaboration with  FAB. This is an Austrian organisation that  specialises in occupational integration, with  the aim of finding them a regular job after  a maximum of two years. Schwab, Witt and  Baur work with the Integration Service (IFD);  it advises the companies on all questions re- lating to the hiring and employment of parti- ally and severely disabled people. In financial  year 2010/11, among the reporting companies  the share of severely disabled people in the  workforce was 4.1%. Diversity Manager systemises  existing approaches   Although Equal Opportunities has tra- ditionally played a major role in the  Otto Groups culture, in the reporting peri- od we decided to emphasize our systemat- ic approach to Diversity Management even  more in the future. Since February 2011, a  female Diversity Manager has been look- ing into all aspects of this topic in close  cooperation with the Groups companies.  This includes developing an integrated,  Group-wide Diversity Strategy and defin- ing specific aims. Furthermore, we plan to  set measurable indicators to review prog- ress. eMPloyees 64  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  performance of individual employee groups  to adjust its offerings to meet actual de- mand even better. A parallel objective was  also to increase awareness among manag- ers for this topic. The annual OTTO Health  Index result shows at a glance whether and  where a course correction needs to be made  or how effectively this was implemented. Of  the almost 5,500 employees invited to par- ticipate, 57% took part in the survey. The results were positive: in 2010 and  2011 employees felt well supported by their  team and managers, and they also felt their  work was appreciated – including in terms  of being fairly remunerated. Employees also  assessed their own performance to be high,  thereby standing out positively versus com- parable companies. The Index also revealed  the need for action in terms of subjectively  experienced health, employees ability to  revitalise themselves as well as their work- life balance. We communicated the results  Group-wide and derived corresponding  measures such as workshops, target-group  specific programmes and campaigns. Cooperation with health insurer  Techniker Krankenkasse In 2010 OTTO also expanded its coopera- tion with German health insurer Tech- niker Krankenkasse (TK). At the TK Fitness  Lounge, the companys own sports centre,  over 700 OTTO employees train to build up  their strength and stamina, and make use  of TK's preventative courses  irrespective  of whether they are insured by TK or not.  Since 2011 the offering has been further ex- panded to include courses on healthy eat- ing and stress prevention.  Through its extensive UNITO – we link family programme, this  company specifically supports parents with young children. The  core elements are flexible working-hour models which are agreed  with employees for the long-term, so that personal needs can  be incorporated into their working hours. Here, employees can  choose between morning and afternoon models and a relatively  adaptable, flexitime-based working structure. From autumn 2011,  ideas on how to improve  work-life balance will  be gathered in an ideas  exchange specifically  set up for this purpose –  with the best ideas go- ing on to be published in  the employee newsletter.  In addition, once a year  UNITO organises a Fami- ly Day where employees  children and family  members get to see their  workplaces and find out  more about their wor- king environments. The company also  maintains contact with  employees on parental  leave by sending them  the employee newslet- ter. It also plans to invite  parents to a quarterly  shared breakfast which  managers also attend.  When they return from  parental leave, they  have the opportunity  to gradually ease them- selves into the working  environment again and  integrate themselves  into everyday working  life. If needed, they are  offered personal or spe- cialist professional deve- lopment further training  courses. In 2010, UNITO was re- cognised by the Verband  sterreichischer Mittel-  und Grobetriebe des  Handels (Austrian Asso- ciation of Medium and  Large Retailers) as being  a particularly family- friendly company. eMPloyees otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 65  A focus on prevention Growing demands on employees work and  private lives are leading to an increase in sub- jectively experienced stress. To prevent burn- out and exhaustion among our employees  and to help them find a healthy work-life bal- ance, Otto Group companies place particular  focus on preventative offerings as part of the  Groups integrated health management sys- tem. For instance, in 2010 Baur offered the  Stress Pilot programme which allowed  chronic stress to be diagnosed at an early  stage based on a heart scan, and correspond- ing preventative measures to be taken. In ad- dition to this offer, Baur Witt and SportScheck  offer courses on combating stress; Witt also  offers yoga courses and presentations on re- laxation and work-life balance. Furthermore,  since summer 2011 UNITO has been expand- ing its programme to promote mental health. OTTO, Baur, bonprix, Hermes, Witt,  UNITO, SportScheck and Schwab also of- fer their employees individual ergonomic  consultations so they can avoid incorrect  body posture and suffering health problems  in the workplace. Utilising Witts moving  programme specifically designed to prevent  back problems, employees can relax at their  computer workstations by taking short ex- ercise breaks during the working day. And  to ensure they dont forget, a pop-up win- dow notifies participants – in 2010 that was  around a quarter of PC users – that they  need to exercise, and guides them through  the process. In 2010 Hermes launched a  massage programme for relaxation during  the course of the working day. Running groups are part of the prevention programme in many Group companies. In June 2010, 200 OTTO employees ran   for the childrens charity Kinder helfen Kindern. Help for those affected We also help our employees in the event  of serious illness. Special counsellors form  a key point of contact, and can be con- tacted via aktiv.net for instance. They pro- vide specific and personal advice on psy- chological or social problems. In 2010/11,  the reporting companies provided 1,344  consultations on health-related topics.

The biggest change in figures in the current reporting period com- pared to financial years 2007/08 and 2008/09 is due to the inclu- sion of Hermes in our Corporate Responsibility Report 2011. The lo- gistics service provider, whose business model focuses on logistics  services, warehouse handling, order picking and returns proces- sing, requires more flexible employment solutions owing to strong  seasonal fluctuations such as Christmas business. Furthermore, as  a high proportion of work at Hermes is physically demanding, the  share of women in the workforce is lower than at the retail com- panies. For the same reason, the accident rate at Hermes is higher  owing to the nature of physically demanding work involved than  at the retail companies where office-based commercial activities  are the norm. In the reporting period, there was only a slight initial increase in head- count, in line with the turnover development of the ten retail com- panies; however, in financial year 2010/11 headcount grew by 7.1%.  The cumulated headcount figures of the reporting companies in the  reporting period rose by around one half, as a result of the inclusion  of Hermes.

As a trans- port and logistics company, Hermes traditionally has a high share  of male employees. Extensive new hirings in male-dominated IT  and physically demanding jobs are the reason for the further re- duction in the share of female employees at Hermes. At the newly  constructed Hermes hubs, women therefore only account for 13%  of employees due to the type of work involved. eMPloyees By eMPloyMent stAtus (contRAct tyPe) 10 retail companies Hermes Total  Share of employees with a fixed-term contract, in %       Share of employees with a permanent contract, in %        Share of employees with a temporary contract, in % 2010/11 2009/10 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2009/10 eMPloyees By GenDeR 10 retail companies Hermes Total  Share of female employees, in %        Share of male employees, in % 2010/11 2009/10 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2010/11 2009/10 32.0 32.1 33.4 50.1 54.3 38.2 40.7 68.0 67.9 66.6 49.9 45.7 61.8 59.3 2007/08 32.0 68.0 The number of fixed-term and temporary contracts increased sig- nificantly in the reporting period. In terms of types of employment  status, this increase is in line with the general economic trend. The  Otto Groups field of business has become more dynamic, with the  demand and competition situation changing faster today than even  just a few years ago. This results in an increase in the share of fixed- term contracts. Adding to this are experiences gained from the eco- nomic crisis of 2009, which required that the companies act flexibly.  The high number of temporary contracts at Hermes is specific to the  transport and logistics industry. Increase in fixed-term and temporary contracts Increase in the share of male employees Given the increase in market dynamism, the Otto Group is increasing  its utilisation of temporary agency employees to respond flexibly to  sales-turnover fluctuations.

However,  due to the inclusion of Hermes, which as a logistics service provid- er traditionally has a significantly lower share of female employees  across all hierarchical levels, the overall share of female employees  also fell.

While the number of  reportable accidents per 1,000 employees among the retail compa- nies within the last four financial years ranged between 16 and 21, at  Hermes this figure was 35 and 61 for the last two financial years re- spectively. The reason for this higher accident number is the higher  risk of injury that physically demanding warehousing work entails  – a bigger factor at Hermes – compared to commercial activities.  The increase in accident numbers at Hermes in financial year 2010/11  was on the one hand due to the opening of the hubs in Friedewald  and Langenhagen and the associated increase in physical activity;  on the other hand it was due to the reduction in activities with a  low accident risk, such as order picking, as part of the restructurings   at Hermes within the new market-orientated realignment of the  Otto Groups warehousing logistics (NmL) (see p. 57).

Especially with regard to transporting goods and at its facilities, the company has implemented  numerous climate and environmental protection measures. The CR database introduced in 2010 ensures   a measurable and targeted approach.  With its Climate Protection Strategy the  Otto Group not only responds to climate  risks but also increases its own indepen dence from rising energy costs, thereby en suring its competitiveness in the long term.  The various business models implemented  by Group companies, and the correspon dingly heterogeneous Group structure, make  this a challenging task.  As a globally active multichannel retailer  with worldwide purchasing markets and  a range of more than 100,000 articles, the  Group causes most of its CO2 emissions in the  transport of goods (where CO2 emissions are  It is the Otto Groups stated goal to   reduce its 2020 CO2 emissions by 50%  compared to 2006/07, and by 70% for  2040.

Economically as well  as ecologically, it is therefore vital to control  inventory as closely as possible. Shortterm  orders of articles with an unexpectedly high  demand can often only be fulfilled by using  air freight, which leads to particularly high  additional CO2 emissions.  Another important source of CO2 emissions  for the Group is energy consumption at its lo cations – around a third of total emissions are  caused by running offices, warehouses and  logistics buildings, as well as physical stores.  Emissions from the use of company cars and  corporate travel are comparatively low. To achieve its demanding climate protec tion targets, the Otto Group is focused on in creasing efficiency in the areas of transport,  facilities and mobility. Climate and environment otto grouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 75  companies. The aim is to expand the Strategy  as part of the Group-wide CR Rollout by 2012  (see p. 42) gradually to all Group companies  with an annual turnover of more than 50 mn,  which currently includes more than 40 com- panies. Their share of the Otto Groups total  turnover is more than 90%. Implementation status: 4% CO2 In the benchmark year 2006/07, CO2 emis- sions from the 18 companies included here  came to a total of around 306,000 t (see  also chart on the left). The adjusted CO2  emissions of around 293,000 t during fi- nancial year 2010/11 represent a percentage  improvement of 4% for the companies com- pared to the benchmark year.  A clear improvement in CO2 and energy  efficiency was achieved at company locations  (7%), in distribution logistics (10%) and in  mobility (10%). In purchasing logistics, how- ever, CO2 emissions rose due to the continued  high share of air freight (see p. 78) of 5% com- pared to the benchmark year. ClIMATE pROTECTION Advancing climate change requires deci- sive action from everybody, including com- panies. Scientists estimate that warming  the Earths atmosphere by an average two  degrees Celsius is a critical risk limit be- yond which the consequences cannot be  calculated. To avoid crossing this limit, CO2  emissions must be lowered, especially in in- dustrialised countries. The Otto Group has  adopted a demanding Climate Protection  Strategy to make its contribution.  Goal: 50% reduction of adjusted  CO2 emissions by 2020 The Climate Protection Strategy adopted  by the Otto Group Executive Board is aimed  at lowering adjusted CO2 emissions due  to transport, facilities and mobility. By the  year 2020, we plan to reduce CO2 emissions  by 50% compared to the 2006/07 financial  year, and by 70% in 2040.  For the implementation of its Climate Pro- tection Strategy the Otto Group has formu- lated two premises. Firstly, the reduction  of CO2 emissions should be as efficient and  cost-effective as possible, and be achieved  primarily through increasing energy effi- ciency. Secondly, the operative realisation  of the required measures should be decen- tralised as a rule and carried out by individu- al Group companies.  Systematic realisation of  climate protection measures    From 2012 we will control climate protection  measures consistently across the Group: these  will in future be identified systematically, clas- sified and prioritised Group-wide according to  their effectiveness and cost. One important  step in this direction was the introduction of  CO2 benchmarking, for which the key energy  figures for the German and Austrian Group  buildings have been recorded since 2010.

In  freight transport we distinguish between  purchasing and distribution logistics. Some  Group companies have already managed to  realise efficiency increases in the transport  of the articles they market by reducing the  proportion of air freight in the goods they  purchase. In distribution, Hermes lowered  its greenhouse gas emissions through the  use of new, more economical vehicles and  alternative fuels, as well as better utilisa- tion of transport capacity and more efficient  route planning. At our locations and fa- cilities, CO2 emissions are caused mainly by  energy consumption from the use of elec- tricity, gas, heating oil and district heating.  Conveyor-belt systems in logistics buildings  as well as lighting, information technol- ogy, heating and air-conditioning are being  switched over to energy-saving technolo- gies. In addition we are extending the use of  solar power, geothermal heat and biomass.  The area of Mobility includes all business  travel, operation of the company-car fleet.  As part of our new Company Car Guideline,  the Otto Group has committed to the pro- gressive reduction of CO2 values per kilome- tre driven in company cars. Central importance of logistics for  achieving climate protection targets Purchasing and distribution logistics is a par- ticularly CO2-intensive area, and is handled  mainly by our subsidiary Hermes. Hermes  range of services follows the logistics value  chain. Goods are transported by purchas- ing logistics from the sourcing markets via  sea and air freight, and by truck or rail to the  Groups warehouses and distribution centres.  Once orders are received, they are dispatched  via Hermes from there as parcels to the end  customers. On the German parcel market,  Hermes moved more than 304 mn deliveries  during the 2010/11 financial year.  There is a long tradition of climate  protection at Hermes. As early as 1994 the  company implemented CO2 controlling to  manage greenhouse gas emissions. Since  its introduction, CO2 emissions per actual  delivery have been lowered from 0.43 kg to  0.25 kg, a reduction of around 42%.  Hermes WE DO! Since 2010 Hermes has bundled its climate,  environmental and nature protection mea- sures under the WE DO! label.  The core of WE DO! is its CO2 Master- plan, which stipulates an annual reduction  in CO2 of 3.5% at facilities, as well as 2% in  the transport area. With regard to the lat- ter, the company maintains a modern truck  fleet and participates in research projects  on extending the use of alternative mobility  power plants, for example fuel cells.  Hermes also includes its business part- ners in the WE DO! strategy. One important  component is comprehensive CO2 control- ling, which breaks down transport-related  emissions precisely and therefore increases  transparency. CO2 values are calculated on  the basis of real-time data and communi- cated to business clients automatically on  every invoice.  pURCHASING lOGISTICS   Around 32% of the Otto Groups CO2 emis- sions are caused in purchasing logistics. In the  benchmark year, these were portioned into  24% from air freight, 5% from sea freight, and  just under 3% from road transport. Although  sea freight covers around 80% of our goods  transport requirements, it results in only about  17% of CO2 emissions through purchasing. Air  freight only accounts for about 15% of trans- port volume, but is the cause of nearly 80% of  CO2 emissions in purchasing logistics. The reduction of air freight – which in  turn depends strongly on purchasing behav- iour in the Group companies – is therefore a  key lever for lowering the Otto Groups CO2  volumes. Whereas initial orders from suppli- ers in distant purchasing markets are gener- ally transported by ship, repeat orders are of- ten delivered by plane. The Otto Group needs  to find a balance between keeping its prom- ise to customers of constant availability of  goods on the one hand, and the challenge of  accurately forecasting actual sales volumes  and therefore transporting goods in the most  climate-friendly way on the other hand.  protecting the environment protects  the future. preserving nature,  protecting habitats and maintaining  the diversity of natural forms of  life protects the basis of our oWn  existence. DR MICHAEL OTTO,  CHAIRMAN OF THE OTTO GROUP SUPERvISORy BOARD  clIMAte AnD enVIRonMent otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 77  Group companies reduce  the use of air freight bonprix plays a pioneering role across the  Group in our drive to reduce CO2 emissions  due to air freight. An increasing emphasis  on the sea route is intended to lower the  proportion of air freight to 12% of self- sourced goods volumes by the 2012/13 busi- ness year; this is equivalent to halving the  proportion of air freight since the 2006/07  financial year.  OTTO has set itself a target of reducing  the proportion of air freight by 30% by the  2012/13 financial year. During the same pe- riod, Witt intends to lower its adjusted CO2  emissions in purchasing logistics by 20% and,  together with its transport partners, has in- troduced the CO2-PERATION Project. Its goal  is to determine and realise CO2 saving po- tentials. For example, goods from Turkey are  increasingly being transported by train and  ferry. Witt also uses more combined sea and  air transport as a CO2-saving transport alter- native. Since 2010, the company has required  its logistics partners to employ low CO2 en- gines. The Group companies measures to  reduce air freight in favour of other transport  types contribute measurably to achieving cli- mate protection targets.  DISTRIBUTION lOGISTICS  From receipt of the products in the distri- bution centres to their delivery to the end  customer, responsibility for distribution  logistics lies primarily with Hermes. There  is potential for saving CO2 mainly in the  use of modern CO2-efficient vehicles and  through continuous improvements in lo- gistics processes. Consumption analyses at Baur showed that more than a  third of CO2 emissions at its locations were due to the use of  electrical energy. Through various measures to lower electricity  use, Baur managed to achieve annual CO2 savings of just under  700 t CO2 in the reporting period. A substantial proportion  came from the purchase  of more efficient convey- or and sorter systems at  the Altenkunstadt site.  The compressed-air unit  was also renewed and  improved in terms of its  energy use. To achieve  energy-saving lighting  that adjusts to demand,  Baur installed motion  detectors and dimmers  in its administrative  offices. Both measures  led to annual sav- ings of approximately  530 t CO2. As part of the  Energy Management  for Companies Project  in cooperation with the  Oberfranken Energy  Agency, conventional  fluorescent tubes and  incandescent lights at  the Altenkunstadt and  Burgkunstadt sites   were replaced with   energy-saving fluores- cent lighting.  clIMAte AnD enVIRonMent 78  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  GPS management, which has been used at  Hermes as standard since 2008. Further- more, around 420 transporters in the fleet  will be equipped with automatic start/stop  engines by 2012. At the start of 2011, 220 ve- hicles already had this efficiency system. FACIlITIES  The CO2 emissions caused by running  facilities constitute about 34% of the  Otto Groups total emissions, of which the  use of electricity accounts for around 24%,  and the use of heating about 10%. The en- ergy mix used in each country is the most  relevant factor in calculating CO2 emis- sions due to electricity consumption in the  Otto Group, consisting for example of coal,  gas, nuclear power and renewable energy.   CO2 benchmarking  to reduce emissions To determine and control location and fa- cility-related CO2 reduction potential, the  Otto Group introduced a classification of its  buildings according to efficiency grading in  2010. CO2 benchmarking is based on the newly  introduced CR database and was developed  and implemented by a Group-wide working  group. It has determined 50 energy-related  key figures for different types of buildings. With the aid of these data, the build- ings with the highest potential for efficiency  increases are identified, and the effects and  costs of any measures are then determined  through detailed analysis. Priority is given to  implementing measures with the best cost- benefit ratio. In the reporting period, the key  figures for around 400 buildings owned by  the Otto Group in Germany and Austria were  recorded.  Detailed analyses have been carried out  since 2011, and the initial investment deci- sions on this basis are planned for 2012.  Increasing energy  efficiency in facilities During the reporting period, individual  Group companies have realised numerous  decentralised measures to increase energy  efficiency as part of facility management. Use of CO2-efficient vehicles  in distribution   Hermes own fleet is among one of the most  modern in the sector: its approximately  1,300 vehicles are on average a maximum of  one-and-a-half years old and meet the strict  Euro 4  and increasingly Euro 5  emissions  standards. A special leasing model also gives  contract partners the option of using new,  low-emission vehicles. In addition, Hermes  has been committed to the development of  alternative fuels since the 1990s: as a test  partner in the Clean Energy Partnership, the  company participates in one of the largest  fuel-cell demonstration projects in the world.  Since 2008, it has also used 20 transporters  with dual-fuel petrol and natural gas engines  in distribution delivery.  Since 2010, Hermes has been a coopera- tion partner of Mercedes-Benz in the use of  the first electric Vito E-CELL vans. The joint pi- lot project in urban Berlin is designed to run  for a period of four years.  A similarly high potential for reducing  CO2 lies in improving route planning with  Quiet and environmentally friendly: an electrically powered Mercedes-Benz E-CELL transporter in the Hermes fleet. clIMAte AnD enVIRonMent otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 79  Energy efficiency at facilities Hermes  Installation of lighting and heating  controls in communal areas  Replacement of light source   Certification of newly constructed com- pany locations by the German Society for  Sustainable Construction (DGNB e.V.)

Hermes improved its energy efficiency on  the one hand through installing photovoltaic  systems at its northern hub in Langenhagen  as well as at its Ohrdruf facility (generating  1,251 MWh annually). On the other hand,  Hermes uses a solar thermal system to heat  the required hot water. SportScheck also uses renewable ener- gies and has ensured the hot water supply at  its Unterhaching location by harnessing geo- thermal energy. Witt applies a further form of harnessing  alternative energy. In the reporting period this  Group company exchanged three of its con- ventional heating systems for a local-network  heating system fired with wood chips, thus  cutting around 476 t CO2 emissions per year. In the spring of 2011 UNITO connected its  central warehouse in Bergheim to the local  biomass heating plant and through this was  able to reduce its CO2 emissions significantly. MOBIlITy  Mobility – that is, the operation of the compa- ny-car fleet and business trips for Otto Group  employees – is of lower importance for total  emissions, with a share of 3%. All the same,  the Company Car Guideline contributes ma- terially to raising awareness, since it assigns  responsibility to top-level management and  is often debated due to its symbolic value.  Company Car Guideline  in force since 2010  In January 2010, the Otto Groups new Com- pany Car Guideline came into force, which  applies to company cars in the German  Group companies. The permitted level of  emissions is defined as 200 g CO2 per kilome- tre driven. It is reviewed every two years, and  will be lowered gradually. Group companies reduce  mobility-related CO2 emissions Some individual companies introduced fur- ther measures in the reporting period for  reducing mobility-related CO2 emissions. For  example, UNITO uses more video conferenc- ing to replace business trips, and also en- courages its employees to form drive-shares  for the many journeys between its sites in  Graz and Salzburg. In the reporting period,  Frankonia swapped ten diesel cars in its own  fleet for natural-gas fuelled vehicles. Climate protection solutions  for delivery and distribution  of catalogues Several Group companies have made their  catalogue  distribution  climate-friendly  with the help of CO2 compensation: OTTO  used the Deutsche Post DHLs GoGreen Ser- vice to send out all of its addressed cata- logues in a climate-neutral way. Likewise,  bonprix uses GoGreen for its climate-neu- tral mailing. Overall, these investments  compensated for 1,300 t CO2 through cli- mate protection projects.  Additional CO2 emissions were saved  through shortening the channels between pro- duction and distribution of catalogues: in 2009,  bonprix moved the manufacture of gravure- print paper from a Finnish to a German facility. clIMAte AnD enVIRonMent 80  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  BIODIVERSITy In its commitment to biodiversity, the  Otto Group fulfils its corporate Vision regard- ing acting responsibly for people and nature.  As an internationally active trading company,  we ensure our offer of sustainably produced  articles is constantly extended; furthermore,  we work across companies to promote net- working between politics and industry with  the goal of maintaining biodiversity (see   p. 104). Corporate initiative Biodiversity  in Good Company In February 2008, together with the Ger- man Federal Environment Ministry (BMU)  and other companies the Otto Group  launched the cross-sector initiative Bio- diversity in Good Company. More than  40 international member companies are  committed to integrating the preservation  of biodiversity in their corporate manage- ment systems and to positioning the topic  on the socio-political level.  Michael Otto Foundation for  Environmental protection The Michael Otto Foundation for Environ- mental Protection is among other things  dedicated to protecting the natural di- versity of species. The focus of its work is  the protection and preservation of natural  bodies of water and adjacent habitats (see   p. 132).

Moreover, Hermes is committed amongst  other things to preserving biodiversity. In cooperation with   the local chapters of NABU, the German Nature and Biodiversity  Conservation Union, the company has set itself the goal of  designing and running its logistics and warehousing facilities   in as nature-friendly a way as possible.  As part of this coop- eration, for example,  Hermes created nesting  for swallows, defined  green areas and in- stalled insect hotels at  its Hanover-Langenha- gen site. The company  additionally created  habitats for bats, two  each for summer and  winter. These animals  are strongly endangered  in their natural habitat:  as they cannot build  their own nests, they  depend on sheltering  in small spaces in roofs,  hollows behind clad- dings or in attics. For its  commitment, Hermes  was awarded the  Bat-Friendly Building  plaque by NABU in 2010.  clIMAte AnD enVIRonMent otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 81  ENVIRONMENTAl MANAGEMENT Awareness of the need for corporate envi- ronmental protection has been anchored in  the Otto Groups company culture for many  years: as early as 1986 the single company  OTTO declared environmental protection as a  corporate goal. All environment-relevant pro- cesses at its locations are controlled by the  Group-wide Environmental Management  System.  Controlling based on CR database   The Otto Groups environmental manage- ment is supported by an extensive system  of key figures. The Group improved its envi- ronmental management controlling signifi- cantly by introducing a central CR database  in 2010 (see p. 42): the central availability of  all environmental data now enables syste- matic controlling for the whole Group. Every  reporting company is required to submit all  environmental data on a continuous basis;  for example, this includes the number of  appliances disposed of, and the paper con- sumption in its offices.  This system not only ensures a high de- gree of transparency and comparability, but  also allows deviations and irregularities to be  discovered quickly and corrective measures  to be derived and implemented. Disposal of used electrical appliances   In accordance with the German Recycling and  Waste Management Act, the Otto Groups  waste management ensures the efficient  and economical disposal of electrical appli- ances such as washing machines and refrige- rators. When a new appliance is delivered by  Hermes, customers have the option of return- ing their old one at a low fee. Acting for other  Group companies as well, OTTO and Hermes  coordinate the collection of old appliances,  the elimination of harmful substances and re- cycling of usable materials. Thanks to special  offers, increased turnover and growing cus- tomer acceptance, the number of returned  appliances rose markedly in the reporting pe- riod: with a total of 140,987 in 2010, it was 45%  higher than the 2009 total.  Reduce, reuse, recycle In its use of valuable materials such as paper  and cardboard, the Otto Group subscribes to  the reduce, reuse, recycle principle. Prima- rily, resources should be used as sparingly  as possible. If that is not possible, the used  materials are recycled. Implementing this  principle requires the qualification and per- sonal commitment of employees as a criti- cal factor. Therefore, in this reporting period  the Otto Group strengthened its training and  awareness campaigns for the careful use of  resources in the office. In the reporting peri- od, the focus was on training new employees,  trainees and subcontractors. The Group companies use sustainably  produced office supplies. At all OTTO sites, all  technical appliances such as printers, photo- copiers and computers have been awarded  the Blue Angel environmental seal. The com- pany uses 100% FSC and recycled paper ex- clusively. OTTO has received several awards  for environmental protection at its sites. In  2009 OTTO was awarded second place in the  Businesses with more than 500 Employees  category in the German Environmental Man- agement Associations (B.A.U.M.) Office &   Environment competition.  For the use of resources, most Group  companies can show a recycling rate of over  95% at their locations; at Hamburg-Bramfeld,  the site with the most staff, the rate is over  99%. Overall, total waste for the Group in  2010 was 33,503 t, of which 985 t were re- sponsibly disposed, and 32,518 t were able  to be recycled. Across the Group, the rate is  therefore 97%.

All spills  were professionally remediated.  Fulfilling the DIN EN ISO 14001  Environmental Management  Standard By adhering to the DIN EN ISO 14001 Environ- mental Management Standard, companies  commit to voluntary self-control of their  Environmental Management Systems. The  management system is audited and certified  annually by external assessors. Four of the  eleven reporting companies received their  audit certificate under this internationally  recognised standard. The Otto Group there- fore has a pioneering role in its competitive  environment, as trading companies are not  usually ISO 14001-certified. OTTO was suc- cessfully audited as the first trading compa- ny in the world to this standard in 1997.  At Baur, the successful recertification of  the Environmental Management System for  its Altenkunstadt, Burgkunstadt and Weis- main locations took place in July 2010. In  May 2010, the German facilities in Hamburg- Bramfeld (OTTO), as well as Hamburg, Hal- densleben, Lhne and Ohrdruf (Hermes) and  the UNITO Central Warehouse in Bergheim  were recertified. Hermes is one of the few lo- gistics companies worldwide to hold the TIP  (Trust Improvement Program) ISO 14001 cer- tificate for its Environmental Management  System. The requirements of this process  exceed those determined in the ISO 14001 En- vironmental Management Standard, and can  therefore only be applied to highly evolved  environmental  management  systems.  Hermes achieved certification to this standard  for the first time in 2003.  and warehouses. If dangerous waste is pro- duced, this is generally old fluorescent tubes,  petrol separator contents and discarded elec- tric appliances.  Further reduction of damage cases Overall, the risk of environmental damage  resulting from the Groups activities is rela- tively low, as the reporting companies are  involved in trading goods, or in the case of  Hermes, work as logistics service providers  and do not manufacture goods themselves.  The main risk of damage lies with Hermes,  for example through transport accidents and  the related risk of an oil spill.  At Hermes main hubs, partner compa- nies use specialised vehicles with hydraulic  lifting mechanisms for loading and unload- ing swap-body trucks. These vehicles gen- erally use mineral-oil based hydraulic fluid,  which can cause ground contamination in  case the systems leak. For this reason, since  2006 Hermes has required its partners to  progressively equip their vehicles systems  with biodegradable hydraulic fluids.

Ensuring  the responsible handling of key resources  such as timber and cotton is therefore one of  our essential goals (see p. 104).  Furthermore, the business model of  trading companies within the Otto Group  requires the consumption of large amounts  of paper to produce catalogues and advertis- ing materials. Despite our steadily increasing  online share of turnover, around half of all  orders are still triggered through catalogues.  Many online shop customers continue to  rely on our catalogues for inspiration, so it  remains an important marketing instrument. The distribution of goods also generates  waste packaging materials, such as card- board, filler material and plastic foils. To limit  the resulting negative effects on the environ- ment, we are continually extending the re- source-efficient use of paper and packaging  Group-wide. For example, catalogue formats  and page grammage have been reduced over  the years. The proportion of recycled paper  remains at a maximum of 25% of paper used,  so that the perception of a high-quality cata- logue is maintained. For all paper manufactured from fresh  fibre pulp, the Otto Group guarantees  through contracts with its paper suppliers  that this does not originate from illegal felling. print products from  responsible forestry In the production of printed items, the Group  works closely with the Forest Stewardship  Council (FSC) (see p. 105, p. 113). The FSC label  is applied to products whose timber content  is produced through responsible forestry. Since 2007, OTTO has been FSC-certified  for the production of and trading in printed  products. In subsequent years, Schwab,  Baur, bonprix and SportScheck have joined  as part of an FSC Multi-Site Certification.  Currently, the proportion of FSC-certified  catalogue paper within the reporting com- panies is around 7%.  The OTTO main catalogue is the Groups  largest print product by far, and is printed ex- clusively on chlorine-free (TCF) paper. OTTO  also uses FSC-certified paper in seven other  European countries. Baur and Schwab also  use FSC-certified paper in the production  of catalogues, flyers and mailings. Since the  start of the cooperation with the FSC, the  label has been applied to around 500 mn  printed materials, catalogues, advertising  materials and shipping boxes – making the  Group a European leader in applying the FSC  label. FSC Global partner Award for  comprehensive customer information To raise awareness among its customers of  the importance of responsible forestry, the  Otto Group informs them extensively about  the FSC label and the resulting environmen- tal benefits. In September 2010, it was the  first company to receive the FSC Global Part- ner Award in the mail-order category. Within  four years, the Group has realised more than  500 projects with 60 FSC-certified partner  companies, most of them printers and paper  suppliers. The Group fully intends to expand  these activities. Environmentally friendly packaging: customers receive around 130,000 parcels from OTTO, Schwab, Baur, bonprix   and SportScheck each day bearing the FSC label. clIMAte AnD enVIRonMent 84  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  cotton used for textiles from the Cotton made  in Africa initiative may not be artificially   irrigated (see p. 105, p. 112). For many other  products, however, water consumption in the  supply chain is not known. The Otto Group is  therefore participating in the development  of a Product Sustainable Footprint (see p. 39):  amongst other goals, this will make the wa- ter consumption for selected products over  the whole product lifecycle transparent.  In those regions where the reporting  companies facilities are located, significantly  more ground water is produced than extract- ed. The reporting companies, which do not  have their own production and whose wa- ter requirements arise almost entirely from  administrative activities, concentrate on the  use of water-saving technology and the pre- vention of accidents. They cover their water  demand mainly from external supplies. One  exception is the Hamburg-Bramfeld site,  where only 20% of water comes from the  public water supply, 13% from rain water and  about 67% from its own well.  Reducing noise pollution  No production takes place at the reporting  companies sites, so there is no significant  noise pollution. Only HGV noise at the Bram- feld site and at the Hckelhoven hub caused  several complaints from residents in the re- porting period, due to HGV traffic for OTTO  and Hermes. The cardboard presses used by  waste contractors also caused high sound  levels. To remedy this, a noise pollution wall  was erected in Hckelhoven in 2009.  Individual Group companies achieved  progress in protection from noise emissions  during the reporting period: employee sur- veys at Witt showed that in some areas of  logistics handling there was noise pollution  and this was confirmed by measuring sound  levels. The installation of sound absorbers  lowered the noise levels. With the goal of reducing noise emis- sions at the Altenkunstadt site, in 2010 Baur  began the construction of an enclosure for  the freight centre; this was completed in  May 2011.  With its extensive measures, the  Otto Group takes responsibility for people  and nature and minimises the negative im- pacts of its trading activities.     Forest Stewardship Council   www.fsc.org    German Environmental Management   Association B.A.U.M. e.V.    www.baumev.de Resource-saving packaging Another field for the application of resource- efficient measures is packaging, which is  used both for internal distribution of goods  as well as mail order. Cardboard products,  which make up a large proportion of the  packaging used, consist almost 100% of re- cycled materials. Group companies such as  OTTO, Baur, Frankonia, Heine and Schwab are  also changing over their shipping materials  gradually to FSC-certified recycled materi- als. Every day, OTTO, Schwab, Baur, bonprix  and SportScheck distribute around 130,000  parcels with FSC labels. OTTO Office has like- wise set itself a target of changing over all of  its shipping cartons to FSC-certified materi- als. Reusable packaging is increasingly being  used for internal goods traffic.  Reusable trays and thinner  foils reduce use of plastics OTTO also continued developing the mail  packaging for its catalogues. The foil thick- ness has been reduced gradually: overall,  the foil used since 2010 is 32% thinner than  before, yet still durable. UNITO has been us- ing second-hand corrugated board from old  cardboard packaging as parcel filler material  since 1995. From autumn 2011, OTTO Office  plans to begin using Flo-Pak GREEN made  from 100% recycled polystyrene as in-trans- port protection and filler material.  Reducing waste water volume  and own water supply Globally, water is increasingly becoming a  scarce resource. Looking at the whole value  chain, Otto Group companies use a large  amount of water; this is mainly in article pro- duction stages, such as textile production.  Individual companies already carry articles  produced using less water: for example, the  clIMAte AnD enVIRonMent otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 85  The information presented in the chapter on climate protection re- fers to the eleven reporting companies and is financial-year data,  unless otherwise stated. The applicable CO2 key figures have been  gathered and analysed for 18 German companies as part of the  Climate Protection Strategy since the 2006/07 financial year (see  chapter Climate and Environment). Because UNITO was not in- cluded in the Climate Protection Strategy at that point, its CO2 key  figures are only available from 2009/10 and relate only to mobility  and facilities. CO2 emissions are adjusted on principle, that is, shown relative to  the performance units explained below. Against the background of  a dynamic business development, evident for example in the strong  rise in distribution logistics freight volumes, an absolute view deliv- ers a distorted image. Nevertheless, the table Total CO2 Emissions  shows both adjusted and absolute CO2 emissions. For the calculation of location-specific CO2 emissions, a new adjust- ment method is used retroactively from the financial year 2009/10.  This is why, aside from the 2006/07 benchmark year, only the finan- cial years within the reporting period, i.e. 2009/10 and 2010/11, can  be shown in the comparison.  CO2 emissions were adjusted using the following performance units,  which makes them comparable with the 2006/07 benchmark year:  distribution logistics: shipment volume (for example, deliveries to  customers and returns)  locations and facilities (new adjustment method from 2009/10):  - distribution logistics: shipment volume  - mobility: journeys and/or passenger kilometres (pkm) - offices: number of staff and size - logistics buildings: parcel turnaround per year - warehouses: gross capacity of buildings - shops: opening hours and sales area - other uses: surface area Some of the values given for the 2006/07 benchmark year vary from  those given in the Sustainability Report 2009. This is due on the one  hand to the inclusion of Hermes in the reporting scope, and on the  other hand to the change of method in the CO2 adjustment for loca- tions. Since the Otto Group only maintains physical stores, administration  and logistics buildings, environmentally relevant gases such as SO2 or  NOX which would typically arise from production are not emitted in  meaningful quantities and are therefore not shown. The reporting companies energy demand rose mark- edly during the reporting period. This was largely due  to increased demand for heating at locations and fa- cilities during the harsh winter of 2010/11. However,  progress was made in energy and CO2 efficiency by  performance unit, which becomes apparent in the  adjusted representation of CO2 emissions at loca- tions and facilities (see p. 76).  From financial year 2012/13, the Otto Group plans –  within the context of long-term supply contracts – to  switch part of its electrical power supply to green  electricity.

Since the importance for the Otto Group of the sourcing markets in  the Far East has constantly increased, transportation performance  in purchasing logistics has also increased steadily since 2006/07.    The volume of corporate mobility transportation has increased sig- nificantly within the last few years. This reflects the increasingly in- ternational orientation within the Otto Group as well as the positive  business development, which are leading to increased volumes of  travel.

Since the Group orders large volumes for longer  periods, the annual statistics show fluctuations or waves. This can  be seen in the order amounts for the single company OTTO, which  buys the largest amount of paper within the Group. For example, in  the financial year 2009/10 OTTO ordered 306 t of office paper, but  only 134 t in 2010/11. Hermes used almost exclusively environmen- tally friendly recycled paper and has the largest share of overall  paper consumption in the total amount. In the previous two financial years, the reporting companies ordered  a large quantity of recycled and FSC paper compared to conventional  paper. However, this development should be differentiated: whereas  consumption figures for recycled paper stabilised at a high level, the  share of FSC paper declined after a peak in the 2008/09 reporting  year. The cause of the fluctuation is the development at the single  company OTTO: the total amount of office paper ordered by OTTO  declined significantly in the 2010/11 reporting year compared to the  previous year.

Increasing paper consumption for  catalogues and advertising Higher consumption of packaging  due to increasing unit sales In 2009 there were six, and in 2010 four complaints due to noise,  which affected OTTO, Baur and Hermes.

The Group  therefore continues to extend the auditing and qualification of its suppliers and takes  part in alliances to improve local working conditions. As an international trading group, the  Otto Group is active on the global market,  an intensely competitive environment with  many players and correspondingly high  pressure on costs. Due to strong global  demand for raw materials such as cotton  and the scarcity of supply due to natural  catastrophes and speculation on the com- modity exchanges, raw material prices rose  considerably in this reporting period. At the  same time, domestic demand increased in  many emerging countries. And because our  range includes well over 100,000 articles,  the Otto Group orders lower amounts from  each supplier than a competitor with a more  focused range would. As a result, it has be- come harder for the Otto Group to purchase  at stable prices while at the same time en- suring socially and environmentally sustain- able production.  To ensure our suppliers compliance  with specific social and environmental  standards in the production of goods de- spite the above, the Otto Group partici- pates in international coalitions. Together  with our competitors, we can insist stan- dards are fulfilled without causing a dis- advantage for individual companies. For  suppliers from risk countries with limited  government supervision such as Bangla- desh and India, we created our Social Pro- gramme in 1999 which consists of inspec- tions and qualification for suppliers. The  Otto Group aims to alleviate social griev- ances for the long term. Beyond this, we  are actively committed to improving socio- political circumstances in our sourcing  countries, in dialogue with government  representatives and non-governmental or- ganisations (NGOs). The Otto Group buys goods from more  than 70 sourcing countries and works  with more than 5,000 suppliers. We  therefore bear a particular responsibility,  both for humane working conditions at our  suppliers globally, and the sustainable use  of raw materials in production. It is our aim  to integrate all suppliers from risk countries  in our Social Programme.

Mandatory guidelines for suppliers The Otto Groups Social Programme is based  on our Code of Conduct, which applies to all  employees and suppliers of the Group. All  business partners are required to accept it  when agreeing contracts. At the same time,  they commit to passing on the requirements  of the Code of Conduct to their own sub- contractors. Initially only applicable to the  suppliers of merchandising goods, in March  2009 we also made our Code of Conduct  obligatory for suppliers of non-merchandis- ing goods such as office equipment.  Requirements aligned with  international standards Maximum working hours of 60 hours per  week, paid overtime and minimum remune- ra tion of at least the legal minimum wage  are central requirements of the Code of  Conduct. It also includes a ban on child and  forced labour and upholds freedom of asso- ciation, workers right to unionise. In addi- tion, trading partners must specify measures  against discrimination, bribery and corrup- tion; they must detail their programmes for  occupational health and safety and the envi- ronment, and prove these during audits. The  required standards are based on the guide- lines from the International Labour Organi- zation (ILO) as well as on the UN Convention  on the Rights of the Child and the Convention  on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimi- nation against Women. BSCI guidelines and  the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter- prises were also included in the formulation  of our Code of Conduct.  SOCIAl RESpONSIBIlITy IN  pURCHASING MARKETS The Otto Group introduced its Social Pro- gramme as early as 1999. It is based on the  suppliers Code of Conduct launched in 1996,  and we regularly check compliance with this.  Otto Group purchasing  in risk countries The Otto Group purchases goods in more than  70 production countries worldwide. In most  of these countries, compliance with social  and environmental standards is regulated by  national law and checked by the state  and  this is where we source the majority of our  goods. However, in some purchasing markets  compliance with these standards is not com- pletely guaranteed, so that the violation of hu- man rights and socially unacceptable working  conditions cannot be excluded. Among these  countries are China, India, Turkey, Bangladesh,  Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Vietnam, the  United Arab Emirates and Mauritius. The Busi- ness Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) – a  union of more than 650 global trading compa- nies, manufacturers and importers, which in- cludes the Otto Group (see p. 102) – considers  these regions to be countries at risk for trade.  The Otto Group therefore integrates its suppli- ers in these markets into its Social Programme.  Since 2010, this has also applied to Egypt, Bra- zil, Bulgaria, Morocco and Romania – in part,  because these countries have gained in impor- tance as buying markets for the Otto Group,  and in part because they were first defined as  risk countries by the BSCI in 2010. purchasing structures in  reporting companies  The reporting companies Baur, bonprix,  Frankonia (from summer 2010), Heine, OTTO,  OTTO Office, Schwab, Witt and SportScheck  are responsible for their own purchasing on  the global markets, and some also transfer  goods to other Group companies. In most  markets these companies are supported   by the market organisation Hermes-OTTO   International (HOI), a fully owned subsidiary  of the Otto Group. In countries such as Pakis tan  or Morocco where HOI is not represented,  the Group relies on external market orga- nisations, which we call agencies, instead.  However, UNITO sources the majority of its  suPPlIeRs 96  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  Employee awareness of  the Code of Conduct A four-part series of reports in the Otto Groups  internal media starting in October 2009  showed the importance of the Code of  Conduct from different perspectives. The  practical implementation of the Code was  demonstrated through a portrait of the  Social Officers (see p. 98) and their respon- sibilities. Another contribution explained  the Code of Conduct in its relationship to  the internal Anti-Corruption Guideline. The  aim of this series was to raise awareness of  the Code in employees who might other- wise not come into contact with it in their  daily work.  Hermes own Code of Conduct In addition to the Otto Groups Code of  Conduct, in spring 2011 Hermes introduced  its own Code of Conduct which takes the  specific requirements of a logistics com- pany into account. Hermes Code defines  social standards and working conditions  and applies to all Hermes employees as  well as its self-employed contract partners  working in parcel distribution. The Code of  Conduct guarantees payment in line with  legal or industry standards. For example,  the Code of Conduct excludes all direct or  indirect disciplinary measures in form of  payment deductions. Furthermore, this  Group company supports its contract part- ners in corrective measures to solve any  problems that arise, within the spirit of the  Code of Conduct. Serious violations of the  Code, for example illegal employment, lead  to an immediate end of the contractual  relationship. In suspicious cases, employ- ees and contract partners can contact an  ombudsman in full confidence.  New cuts, seasonal colours, changing fabrics: the textile industry  is highly dynamic. Therefore the processes in the period between  the initial design for an item of clothing to its serial production  need to be as efficient as possible. To shorten product  development cycles  substantially and boost  employees responsibility  in production countries,  bonprix re-allocated   process responsibilities  in 2010: in three Asian   pilot regions – Hong Kong,  Qingdao and Shanghai  – responsibilities were  shifted to the local   market offices, which are  now in charge of quality  control and approval for  almost all ranges. They  can decide whether to  fall back on the exper- tise of their colleagues  in Germany or to grant  approval themselves. The  new distribution of tasks  has several advantages:  it avoids duplication  of effort, which speeds  up the process. It also  makes better use of the  technical competencies  of employees in the pro- duction countries. This in  turn leads to improved  quality and higher  motivation in the local  teams, but also to relief  for quality development  staff at bonprix; these  specialists can now   concentrate on their core  tasks, despite an increas- ing number of products  in the assortment.  suPPlIeRs otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 97  improvements for training programmes and  accompanying suppliers during the imple- mentation of these. Furthermore, the Social  Officers maintain regular contact with the  factories as part of follow-up audits. 23 Social  Officers currently work for the Otto Group  and are trained annually, most recently in  March 2009 in Bangkok and in June 2010 in  Hong Kong.  Audit to BSCI Standard If the pre-scan does not find any funda- mental breaches of the Code of Conduct,  the business relationship can commence.  By signing the contract, the supplier com- mits to adhering to the Otto Groups Code  of Conduct. From the third season onwards,  that is, after twelve months of active coop- eration, the supplier is obliged to let their  production sites be inspected by an auditor  to check adherence to the Code of Conduct.  Auditors are selected by the BSCI and must  be able to show accreditation by the non- profit organisation Social Accountability  Accreditation Services (SAAS). If the supplier  passes the audit, the business relationship  – conditional on regular follow-up inspec- tions by the Social Officers – is extended for  since 2010. If the supplier only manufactures  at one or two facilities, these are checked  in any case. This extension is in response to  several factories increasingly producing for  one supplier, and therefore indirectly for the  Otto Group.  Social Officers: key role in  implementing the Social programme  Since 2007, Social Officers have supported  the adherence to our Code of Conduct in  risk countries. These employees belong to  Hermes-OTTO Internationals market organ- isations or agencies and function as a link  between the Otto Group and its suppliers;  they have prior knowledge of quality assur- ance or have worked as auditors. They carry  out pre-scans for the selection of suppliers,  during which they inform potential busi- ness partners about the social requirements  and carry out a pre-inspection of their pro- duction facilities. Their goal is to determine  whether cooperation is feasible with the  new supplier, i.e. whether they already ful- fil, or could fulfil, the requirements of the  Code of Conduct. Social Officers also take  part in training and qualification measures,  for example by selecting factories needing  THE OTTO GROUpS  SOCIAl pROGRAMME The Social Programme of the Otto Group   ensures that suppliers follow the Code of  Conduct. It rests on three pillars: supplier   audits, supplier qualification, and intensive   dialogue with the stakeholders involved locally.  All Otto Group companies in Germany,  Austria and the United Kingdom that source  centrally through market organisations are  required to implement our Social Programme.  The Groups Corporate Responsibility area de- velops, steers and controls the Programme,  leads the dialogue and defines responsibili- ties. Alongside this, it documents and com- municates the processes.  Extending the Social programme In recent years, the Otto Group has extend- ed its Social Programme significantly. Since  the start of 2009, suppliers of durable goods  such as decorative articles and electrical ap- pliances have been inspected as part of the  Social Management System – and thus all  product groups traded by the Otto Group  that it has sourced from risk countries.  In addition, we have inspected at least  three production facilities for every supplier  Before establishing a business relationship, Social Officers inspect working conditions at production sites. suPPlIeRs 98  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  another three years. Suppliers who make  a particularly good impression in the BSCI  audit are recommended by the Otto Group  to gain certification under the internation- ally recognised SA8000 standard from SAI  (see p. 102), which places high demands on  the working conditions in production. This  includes the manufacturers guarantee of  liveable wages as well as their responsibility  for humane working conditions along their  entire production chain.  Where suppliers are assessed with im- provements needed or non-compliant, they  are supported by the Otto Group through   an extensive qualification programme. Sup- pliers are graded as non-compliant if they  fail to fulfil more than 50% of the require- ments or one of the crucial criteria, such  as paying minimum wages and permitting  one day off following six working days.   After half a year, there is a re-audit to check  progress. By the second re-audit (within  twelve months) at the latest there must be a  clear improvement in order for the business  relationship to continue. All audit results  are recorded centrally in the Groups Social   Database (see p. 100). Focus on qualification  and development  In cases where suppliers refuse an audit of  their sites, we terminate the business re- lationship. The same applies if a supplier  assessed as non-compliant does not im- plement measures for improving working  conditions, despite being offered help and  given a warning. However, since the focus  of the Social Programme is on the develop- ment and qualification of partners, this is  only a last resort. To achieve permanent im- provements locally, the Otto Group instead  prefers stable and long-term relationships  with its suppliers. In total, we worked with 450 audited  companies in risk countries during 2010.  Of these, 90.4% received an audit result of  improvement needed or better. A total of  408 breaches of the requirements in the  Otto Group Code of Conduct were recorded  in this set of audits (see p. 97). For 125 sup- pliers, individual training and qualification  measures were carried out to ensure adher- ence to the Otto Groups Code of Conduct.  suPPlIeRs otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 99 CORE pROCESSES IN THE OTTO GROUp SOCIAl pROGRAMME sanction (if an audit is refused) qualification (if BSCI audit result is improvements  needed or non-compliant) audit repeated after   6 months Supplier Follow-up Follow-up sanction (if 2nd BSCI audit result  is non-compliant ) before first order:  pre-Scan from 3rd Season 3 years without  external audits repeat BSCI audit good BSCI Audit  Step-by-step inclusion of importers As of the 2012/13 financial year, further fac- tories and market agents such as import- ers, which do not belong to the Otto Group  and are active in critical sourcing countries,  will gradually be included in the Social Pro- gramme. Implementation had been planned  for the 2011/12 financial year, but the various  decentralised purchasing processes in the  Group companies required further harmoni- sation. In March 2011, the Executive Boards  of the main German trading companies in  the Otto Group were presented with a pro- posal for integrating the importers. A work- ing group consisting of representatives from  OTTO, Heine, Baur and SportScheck as well  as Hermes-OTTO International was created  to clarify detailed questions about imple- mentation. The goal is to develop a practical  proposal for including importers to which all  participants can agree by autumn 2011. Demanding targets for  implementation of the Social  programme To increase the transparency of social manage- ment processes, the Otto Group created an ex- tensive Social Database during the reporting  period and set clear targets for the Purchasing  areas in their selection of suppliers: Group  companies Purchasing areas and the market  organisations have to generate 75% of their  turnover with suppliers in new risk countries  who have achieved a pass. For the other risk  countries, a target turnover ratio of 98% has  been established. Since the extension of the  Social Programme, a pass is only awarded to  suppliers whose main production sites – and  where applicable, up to two further factories   are assessed at least as good or improve- ments needed during auditing.  The Social Database contains data on  suppliers, factories and audit results, can be  viewed by all participants in the buying pro- cess and hence serves as a Group-wide control  and steering instrument. Since its completion,  quarterly reports based on key figures from  the Social Database have been sent to the  Groups Executive Board, in-market organisa- tions and Group companies to inform them of  the current progress towards targets as well  as areas of improvement potential.  The data recorded in 2011 fall short of the  targets the Group set itself. This was due to  the extension of the scope of application of  the Social Programme to the entire article  assortment as well as the increase of the  number of production sites to be inspected  in 2010, many of which do not fully com- ply with the requirements of the Code of   Conduct or have not yet carried out an au- dit. The relevant suppliers are being trained  by the Otto Group as part of the Social Pro- gramme to eliminate any shortcomings.  Supplier development We want to improve production conditions  through constructive cooperation and stable  supplier relationships. As the second pil- lar of its Social Programme, the Otto Group  therefore carries out extensive qualification  programmes for its suppliers. The training  courses take place within the Groups own  Market Development Programme (MDP) and  through external BSCI programmes. The lat- ter carries out approximately 100 courses  annually for staff in leadership and middle  management positions as well as for employ- ees at an operational level.

The goal is  to advise and direct them in adherence to the  Code of Conduct.  The advice is based on a factory inspec- tion by Systain Consulting, a consultancy  belonging to the Otto Group, to check the  working conditions and management sys- tems in the factories. Significant problems  often exist in the systematic documenta- tion of working hours, and in the areas  of occupational health and safety and in  dealing with overtime. To solve these, the  Otto Group carries out intensive training  courses, supports the creation of solid man- agement structures and bears the cost of  the qualification processes.  In the reporting period, 125 qualifica- tions were carried out for suppliers. Because  of the importance of the Chinese market,  the focus of qualifications in 2009 and 2010  was on China.  Social programme works  for long-term successes To achieve permanent changes in our pur- chasing markets, the Otto Groups Social  Programme is set up for the long term  and focuses on a process of continuous  improvement. The current three-year plan  ends during the 2012/13 business year. One  year before its end in 2011, the Otto Group  will commission Systain to carry out a sta- tus report, bearing the requirements of  both internal and external stakeholders in  mind. We will also consider the possibility  of extending the Social Programme in par- allel with the CR Strategy to further Group  companies and deeper into the supply  chain (see p. 42).  The qualification of suppliers plays a key role in the Otto Groups  Social Programme for improving working conditions at production  sites in the long term. At production sites where a need for  improvements has been identified, Systain Consulting takes on the  task of advising and supporting.  Systain consulting   supports the Otto Group With its own local  employees, Systain  visits the factories and  develops the required  corrective measures in  close coordination with  factory management  and workers. The task  primarily requires good  knowledge of local  circumstances and tact  in discussing sensitive  topics. Systain staff also  use their experience in  training the local Social  Officers.  Apart from its active  participation in the   Social Programme,  Systain supports the  Otto Group in the deve- lopment of a sustaina- bility footprint for selec- ted products, as part of  the commitments of the  Sustainable Apparel   Coalition (see p. 39). In  addition, Systain advi- ses the Group on strate- gic decisions about the  development of the So- cial Programme and the  concept development  for climate-protection  measures in the supply  chain. suPPlIeRs otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 101  AllIANCES AND COOpERATIONS   To have an impact on complex global markets  and apply pressure to political demands, in  addition to its own activities the Otto Group  forms alliances with other important market  players to improve working conditions. The  Otto Groups CR Representative for Purchas- ing Markets also represents the Groups in- terests in these markets and coordinates the  dialogue locally. In addition, the Group lends  practical help, for example by supporting  a project for the terre des hommes charity  working against child poverty (see p. 128).  BSCI improves social standards  in the supply chain One of these alliances is the Business Social  Compliance Initiative (BSCI), founded in 2004  with the Otto Groups participation. Its goal  is to improve working conditions in inter- national supply chains. Dr Johannes Merck,  Director of the Corporate Responsibility area  in the Otto Group, has represented the in- terests of German member companies on the  BSCIs Steering Committee since the start of  2009. All members are committed to gener- ating two-thirds of turnover through audited  suppliers after three years. After five years, all  suppliers are required to be assessed as im- provement needed or good. BSCI has strict  criteria for the audits: only auditors accredit- ed by the Social Accountability Accreditation  Services (SAAS), a non-profit organisation,  and trained by Social Accountability Interna- tional (SAI) are admitted. The BSCI ensures  that members uphold their voluntary com- mitment and carries out an annual review on  this. It also collects the results of all audits,  which are available to all members for their  respective suppliers. BSCI also organises sem- inars on specific topics such as occupational  health and safety, which are also open to the  suppliers of all members.  Cross-sector commitment  to high social standards   In addition to its commitment to the BSCI,  the Otto Group is a sustaining member of  Social Accountability International (SAI), one  of the worlds most influential independent  multi-stakeholder initiatives for improving  working conditions and workers rights. SAI  assists companies in the systematic develop- ment of their procurement management. It  also awards the internationally recognised  social standard SA8000 certificate for manu- facturing sites.   Alliance for minimum wages in Asia The Otto Group welcomes and supports the  Asia Floor Wage Campaign (AFWC). The or- ganisers goal is the introduction of a stan- dardised minimum wage for Asias textile  sector, measured against the respective  countrys specific purchasing power. The  campaign has become necessary because  in some Asian countries, wages are not suf- ficient to cover the livelihoods of workers  and their families. Previous initiatives by  the Otto Group and individual stakehold- ers have so far not managed to achieve  widespread living wages. The solution can  therefore only lie in regulating labour costs  in Asian buying markets with the inclusion  of all market participants, thus making it  competitively neutral. The Otto Group has  recognised the urgency of the situation and  together with other strong partners is using  its influence, for example at Round Tables  with government representatives, trade  unionists and NGO representatives in Ban- gladesh and China, to influence decision- makers in the Asian textile sector.   Round Table on Codes of Conduct Dialogues in the Purchasing markets, but  also at Group locations, contribute to the   debate on current issues and the develop- ment of solution approaches. The Round  Table on Codes of Conduct is a multi-stake- holder forum of German companies, trade  associations, unions, NGOs and Federal Min- istries. All participants agreed in March 2011  on a position paper with which they demand  the payment of living wages in developing  countries. The participants also developed  practical recommendations and action plans  for implementing the living wage in the   Asia region. As a next step, in autumn 2011  there will be a meeting to discuss companies  experiences in ensuring living wages in risk  countries.   Developing a sustainable  product footprint In March 2011, together with international  clothing companies and stakeholders in  the shoe and textile sectors as well as with  scientific experts, the Otto Group founded  the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. The aim  of the Coalition is the development of a  Product Sustainable Footprint, which will  be an international measure for assess- ing the sustainable quality of products and  improving transparency in the value chain.  Apart from the Otto Group, Gap, H&M,  Levi Strauss, Nike, Timberland, Wal-Mart,   Patagonia, Marks & Spencer and Li & Fung  are among the more than 30 founding mem- bers (see p. 39). limits of transparency  in the value chain In August 2010 consumer protection ex- perts from Stiftung Warentest (a leading  independent German product and service  suPPlIeRs 102  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  Cooperation with critical media  Corporate action in finding a balance bet- ween attractive purchasing conditions and  social as well as environmental demands  in developing countries was the topic of a  report by the ZDF TV channel entitled Sew  until you drop. The report was filmed at   Otto Group suppliers facilities for textiles,  furniture and shoes in Bangladesh and South  China, and broadcast in December 2010. The  film team accompanied the Otto Groups CR  Representative Purchasing Markets while in- specting working conditions and safety stan- dards. The pieces on Bangladesh and South  China focused on critical points such as over- time in production sites, but also mentioned  positive changes in the manufacturing con- ditions through controls implemented by the  trade. The report shows the daily struggle for  progress in upholding social standards, and  makes clear that only continued cooperation  will lead to improvement in local production  conditions.  Otto Grameen Textile Company  created as Social Business Type II  Together with the Grameen Trust, a chari- table NGO founded in 1989, the Otto Group  plans to operate the Otto Grameen Textile  Company in Bangladesh. The aim of the Joint  Venture is to produce export goods under  competitive conditions. An existing factory  will be rebuilt and extended according to en- vironmental and social criteria. The factory will function as a Social  Business Type II: while it repays the loan  granted by the Otto Group, part of which is  interest-free, 20% of profits and later 80%  of profits will be managed by a founda- tion and used for projects to improve living  conditions for the employees, their families  and their home communities. 20% of prof- its will be reinvested into the factory.

They also checked the working conditions  under which the products had been manu- factured. Stiftung Warentest was only able  to certify that the Group company demon- strated the rudiments of social and environ- mental commitment. Criticism was levelled  in part at the behaviour of a subsupplier, an  Indian spinning and dyeing company which  had refused the auditors nominated by the  Foundation access to its production sites.  Another criticism was that the Otto Groups  Social Programme had not integrated this  pre-processing stage of production.  As there was no direct contractual rela- tionship between the Otto Group and the  relevant spinning works, it was not possible  to exert sufficient influence on the company.  Neither did Stiftung Warentest recognise in- ternal documents as proof of organic cotton  and queried gaps in the external inspection.  Whereas in the past certified organic cot- ton was used and its actual processing in  products was ensured through an internal  safety system, independent certificates will  be used in future (see page 134).

Although the Otto Group  does not produce any goods itself, it is never- theless responsible as a trading company for  the sustainable production of the articles it  sells. It has committed itself to strict procu- rement policies, such as the Timber Sourcing  Policy and the Sustainability guideline, which  prohibit the use of particular raw materials. Strict Directives for the textile trade From autumn 2011, all of the main Group  companies in the Otto Groups trading seg- ment will be subject to their own Sustaina- bility Directive, which brings together previ- ously separately regulated CR requirements  for products with working conditions for sup- pliers (see p. 42). Among others it contains ru- les on animal protection, bans real fur from  the entire assortment and prohibits the use  of live plucking of down and feathers. In No- vember 2010, the Report Mainz programme  by the ARD TV channel and the Four Paws  animal protection organisation reported on  live plucking at suppliers for OTTO, Baur, Witt  and Schwab. The Otto Group rapidly re moved  all products from this supplier from the  assortment and terminated the supply rela- tionship (see p. 48).  Challenges in cotton cultivation and  opportunities for organic cotton The Otto Group not only observes animal  protection regulations in the production  of textiles; by using organic cotton, it also  contributes to promoting biodiversity. The  utilisation of non-degradable chemical and  synthetic pesticides, insecticides and ferti- lizers is prohibited in the cultivation of orga- nic cotton. Likewise prohibited is the use of  genetically modified organisms. Organic cul- tivation respects annual crop rotation in the  fields, pests may only be removed by natural  methods and only organic fertilizer may be  used. These measures avoid monocultures  and protect biodiversity in cultivation areas.  OTTOs and Witts organic cotton ranges  are among  the pioneers in the textile mar- ket. Both offer their organic cotton textiles  through the PURE WEAR brand (see p. 113).  Textiles bearing this label must contain fi- bre mixes with a minimum of 50% organic  cotton, and while other natural and syn- thetic fibres are allowed, no conventionally  produced cotton may be used. PURE WEAR  as a brand will in future only be available at  Witt; a new brand will be developed for OTTO  and potentially for other companies in the  Otto Group. The new safeguard, agreed by  the Otto Group Executive Board, prescribes  certification of the range through one of the  two internationally recognised standards:  the Otto Group accepts Organic Exchange as  the basic standard, and Global Organic Tex- tile Standard (GOTS) as the premium standard. Apart from these requirements, suppliers  must be able to show a BSCI audit result of at  least good or SA8000 certification (see p. 99).  The cultivation of organic cotton protects the soil and contributes to maintaining biodiversity. suPPlIeRs 104  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  harvest. Therefore the Otto Group adopted a  policy in mid-2011 that discourages all its sup- pliers and their subsuppliers from processing  cotton cultivated in Uzbekistan. In addition,  the Group has banned the purchasing of all  Uzbek textile products. The Otto Group is  aware that a complete enforcement of the  ban is a very difficult task, due to the com- plexity of the supply chain, and has formally  required its manufacturers to instruct their  subsuppliers accordingly.  Wood products from  responsible forestry  In Otto Group companies assortments, tim- ber is of great importance. The Otto Group  is therefore committed to responsible for- estry in order to prevent overexploitation  of forests. Since 2007, the Timber Sourcing  Policy has regulated the sourcing of furni- ture and accessories from solid wood. The  Otto Group demands that the legally sound  origin of timber is proven by providing   documentation of the timbers botanical  name and its region of origin. Five compa- nies in the Otto Group are pioneering the  Timber Sourcing Policy, and have taken on  responsibility for the origin of solid wood  ranges in the absence of legal regulations.  European timber regulators – based on  the EUs FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement,  Governance and Trade) action plan – will  introduce mandatory laws in this area from  2013. The Otto Group, along with WWF,  campaigned for legal regulation. The work  completed as part of the Timber Sourcing  Policy provides a good basis for fulfilling  the requirements of European timber regu- lation from 2013 onwards. Until these regu- lations come into force, the Otto Group will  continue to critically accompany the FLEGT  process through regular dialogue with poli- ticians and NGOs.  Heine achieves FSC certification  of wood products Since October 2010, seven new Heine sup- pliers in Latvia, Romania and Indonesia  have been certified to FSC standard for  solid wood fibreboard and recycled teak.  Latvia, one of the most important timber  suppliers to the Otto Group, decided in 2010  to suspend certification for the Spring/  Summer season 2011 due to the economic  crisis. However, Heine successfully argued  for retention of the certification process  in Latvian national forests. Thanks to the  strong pressure of the market agency in  Riga, the decision was reversed for the fol- lowing season: from Autumn/Winter 2011,  certification will once again be verified.   During 2011, Heine and the market agency  in Riga held several workshops with Latvi- an suppliers to drive forward the issue of  sustainable industrial timber furniture pro- duction.  Development opportunities  for African cotton The developmental aid initiative Cotton  made in Africa (CmiA) was founded in 2005  by the Aid by Trade Foundation (see p. 133).  CmiA is not organic cotton, but it is harves- ted by hand and in its cultivation great care is  taken with the effective and responsible use  of pesticides and fertilizers. The trade partners in this initiative form  a Demand Alliance and are thus able to of- fer the cotton producers reliable sales chan- nels and prices above the market average  for their products. In addition, they support  the smallholder farmers in the transition of  their production to environmentally friendly  processes. Transparent value chain in the  cultivation of CmiA cotton By the end of 2010, 237,000 smallholder   farmers were taking part in the project and   farming a total of 330,000 ha. CmiA offers its  trade partners the benefit of a transparent  value chain and with its Global Sourcing Unit  has created a unique service for this. Control  systems ensure that the initiatives quality  and manufacturing standards are adhered  to and developmental aid goals are fulfilled.  For example, Impact Monitoring observes  changes in the farmers income as well as the   social and environmental development of  their community. In May 2010, this data was  used to complete the first full and indepen- dent verification of all CmiA cultivation areas.  In addition, the quality of CmiA cotton is in- spected every two years (see p. 134). policy rules out use of Uzbek cotton In Uzbekistan, pupils still in childhood and  students are forcibly recruited for the cotton  suPPlIeRs otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 105   2007  2008  2009   2010 Egypt n.d. n.d. n.d. 0.8  Bangladesh 3.7 2.9 5.0 4.6 Brazil n.d. n.d. n.d. 0.2 Bulgaria n.d. n.d. n.d. 1.5 China (incl.

Apart from textiles, shoes  and toys, durable goods such as decorative items and furniture have  been included since 2009. In the reporting period, the Social Pro- gramme was applied in China, India, Turkey, Bangladesh, Thailand,  Indonesia, Pakistan, Vietnam, United Arab Emirates, Mauritius and,  as of 2010, in Egypt, Brazil, Bulgaria, Morocco and Romania. The key  figures in this chapter relate to calendar years from 2007 to 2010 in- clusive. In a consolidated format, they provide information on mea- sures and results in the companies included in the Otto Group Social  Programme, which are Alba Moda, Apart*, Baur, bonprix, Frankonia,  OTTO UK, Heine, OTTO, OTTO Office, Schwab, SportScheck, UNITO  and Witt (including Sieh an!, see p. 8). In parallel to the extension of the group of risk countries, supplier  evaluations were developed methodically in 2010 to respond to  changing conditions. As part of continuing globalisation and order  diversity, the number of production sites used by each supplier has  increased. This requires an extension of the inspection practice to  further production sites.  In summary, the following factors influenced the number of factories  to be audited, and therefore the audit status of suppliers:  extension of the Social Programme to durable goods  integration of further risk countries  inclusion of additional Group companies in the Social Programme  audit of up to three factories per supplier. oRDeR VoluMe* By RIsk countRy in %  In 2010, the Otto Group expanded its evaluation method for supplier  performance. Whereas until 2009, the audit result from one factory  per supplier was sufficient, from 2010 the audit results of up to three  factories per supplier are taken into account. The evaluation categories  were also adjusted: since 2010 the Otto Group distinguishes between a  pass (all factories satisfactorily audited), incomplete (not all relevant  factories audited or not all satisfactory) and not audited (the relevant  factories have not yet been audited). The extension of the inspection spectrum up to three factories per sup- plier has meant that the proportion of order volume from suppliers with  * Audit-relevant order volumes = from 3rd season in %    certificate (SA8000/ICTI)     good           improvements needed     critical        *  Audit-relevant suppliers = from 3rd season.    not audited  ** Audit-relevant order volumes = from 3rd season in %  pass   incomplete         not audited  64.2 9.9 12.1 7.1 6.7 suPPlIeRs* By suPPlIeR PeRFoRMAnce 2008 2009 2010 2007 51.6 12.4 11.3 7.9 16.8 55.0 9.1 8.9 12.0 15.0 FActs AnD FIGuRes  Developing supplier evaluations  77.2 8.2 4.1 8.5 73.7 8.0 7.9 7.6 74.8 7.2 2.7 10.9 oRDeR VoluMe By suPPlIeR PeRFoRMAnce ** 2008 2009 2010 2007 2.0 2.8 4.4 19.9 45.3 34.8 43.0 12.9 44.1 * As of May 2010, Apart no longer belongs to the Otto Group. 106  Corporate responsibility report  2011 otto GRouP suPPlIeRs – FActs AnD FIGuRes  Number Order-      volume Number Order-      volume Number Order-      volume Number Order-      volume a pass mark was very low during 2010, at 44.1%.

The factories audit results are given in line with  the evaluation categories of critical, improvements needed, good  and certificate. Overall, this evaluation is based on 450 valid BSCI au- dits and certificates in the risk countries.  Audit results along the supply chain   The development of supplier evaluations in 2010 required audit re- sults to be presented in a different way. As of 2010, the new evaluation  categories of pass and incomplete are in use. Also, the unaudited  factories and suppliers per country are given for 2010, whereas for  the period from 2007 to 2009 only the distribution of audit results  is shown. Due to the inclusion of new risk countries and the increase in the  number of suppliers in individual risk countries, the number of audit- relevant suppliers increased significantly from 2009 to 2010. This de- velopment can be seen in the example of the figures for Indonesia  and Thailand: whereas in 2009 17 suppliers were audit-relevant, this  number increased in 2010 to 42. China, the Otto Groups largest sourc- ing market, also saw a clear increase in suppliers from 2009 to 2010.  Nevertheless, the proportion of not audited order volumes for China  in 2010 was only 6.2%.  The introduction of the Otto Groups Social Programme to the new  risk countries during 2010 achieved differing rates of progress: Brazil  and Romania were unable to report audit results in this period, while  in Morocco, Bulgaria and Egypt the first audit results were able to be  delivered.

As in previous  years, in this reporting period the majority of violations were in the  areas of documentation, health and safety regulations (with the ma- jority classified as improvements needed) as well as in maximum  working hours and wages (with the majority classified as critical). In the area of child labour/young workers, there were no critical  violations in the reporting period. In the area of forced labour, there  was one critical violation in 2009. The Otto Group no longer works  with this supplier.

To achieve this, the Group produces attractive, easily accessible   product offers, communicates the added value of sustainability clearly and expands its relevant  assortments continually. Our central position at the interface be- tween manufacturers and customers al- lows us to bring our influence to bear on  both sides. As part of this, we see an op- portunity and duty to promote ethical con- sumption further. When shopping, an increasing number  of customers now pay attention to where  the goods on offer are made and the condi- tions under which they are produced. De- mand for responsibly produced products  continued to grow even during the global  economic crisis of 2009. Despite this posi- tive market development the Otto Group is  faced with a huge challenge, as the major- ity of its customers still predominantly buy  conventional products. This is why we have  set ourselves the aim of raising awareness  among as many consumers as possible  and inspiring them with the advantages  of sustainable products. Natural resources  involved in the production of sustainable  goods are treated with care – for instance,  the land used to cultivate organic cotton is  not contaminated with artificial fertilisers  and pesticides. However, that brings with it  an increase in effort which, in conjunction  with rising prices on raw material markets,  leads to higher purchasing costs. For this reason, the Group considers it  as one of its main duties to make it easi- er for our customers to choose a product  which may sometimes be slightly more  expensive. We display and describe the  relevant sustainability aspects directly on  or next to the product. In our online shops  and catalogues, these Eco Facts bundle to- gether the relevant information and also  make products easier to identify. Further- more, OTTOs entire assortment of sustain- able goods is clearly presented in its online  shop ECOREPUBLIC. With an assortment of  over  3,600 products  in our EcOREPUBLIc  online shop, we are  enabling our customers to  make a conscious decision  in favour of sustainable  products. We aim to make  this assortment attractive  and available to as many  people as possible – which  is why we are continually  expanding our  sustainable assortments.

In contrast, Heine  is basing its 10% target in terms of its own  and third-party brands on using CmiA and  organic cotton (see p. 143). Expanding our organic  cotton assortment So far organic cotton still plays a secondary  role in global cotton cultivation, accounting  for just 1.1% of the total cotton harvest. Some  leading textile retail companies are already  achieving much higher organic cotton shares  in their textile assortments. Concerning the  Otto Group companies covered by this report,  the share of organic cotton quality is current- ly just 1.5%, and in terms of their own-brand  assortments 2.1%. At the single company  OTTO, the share of its own-brand assortment  is 4.4%; the share of organic cotton in terms  of third-party brands is still very low. Based on our new counting process, sev- en Group companies sold a total quantity of  364 t of organic cotton in their assortments  in the financial year 2010/11. The Otto Group  is aiming to increase the amount of organ- ic cotton processed to 450 t by the end of  2011 (see p. 122, p. 143). OTTO, SportScheck,   SUSTAINABlE pRODUCT WORlDS To promote ethical consumption, Group com- panies are continually expanding their sus- tainable assortments and raising awareness  among their customers about these products. Expanding our sustainable  assortments While we produce the majority of our assort- ments using conventional means, we subject  them to rigorous minimum requirements  (see p. 105) such as testing textiles for harmful  substances. That said, compared to our con- ventional assortments, the share of certified  sustainable products is still mostly relatively  small. To increase this share, within the frame- work of our CR Strategy eight Group compa- nies have set themselves individual aims, tai- lored to and targeting the relevant assortment  spectrum, to further expand their sustainable  assortments. We intend to increase the share  of sustainable products both in terms of our  own brands (such as Hanseatic) where the  Otto Group has brand rights and associated  responsibilities, as well as third-party brands  (including Puma, for example). Cotton made in Africa textiles In the financial year 2010/11 the Otto Group  companies covered by this report offered a  total of 813 different Cotton Made in Africa  (CmiA) articles. These articles are produced  to a social and ecological standard, and we  predominantly offer these articles in our  own-brand assortments (see p. 104) where  they account for a 0.7% share of our overall  textile assortment. Based on a new count- ing procedure, 2010/11 saw an increase  from 102 to 260 t over the previous year in  the quantity of CmiA cotton processed (see   p. 123). In 2009 we set ourselves the aim of  achieving 750 t by the end of 2011, although  this was based on a data-collection process  that has since been revised (see p. 143). CmiA  products can be found in the assortments of  eight of the reporting companies. As part of  our CR Strategy (see p. 39), four of the re- porting companies have set themselves in- dividual aims to further expand their share  of CmiA assortments by 2012/13: OTTO in- 77.5% 2010/11   Share of energy-efficient large  household electrical appliances in the whole assortment 1.5% 2010/11 Share of organic cotton   articles offered  in the whole assortment AssoRtMent AnD custoMeRs 112  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  bonprix and Witt have set themselves indi- vidual aims within the framework of our CR  Strategy: by the end of financial year 2012/13  OTTO is planning to increase the amount  to 5% in terms of its own brands; bonprix is  aiming for a 2% share in its own and third- party brands, SportScheck for a 3% increase  in these brand groups, while Witt intends to  increase the share of organic cotton to 6% in  relation to the overall textile assortment of  its core brand WITT WEIDEN. Extensive range of energy-efficient,  large household electrical appliances Otto Group companies already carry a very  good range of energy-efficient products in  the large electrical household appliances  segment. OTTO, Schwab and Baur have now  systematically removed fridges, freezers,  washing machines and dishwashers from  their assortments that do not have an ener- gy-efficiency rating of at least an A. Further- more, since 2006 many appliances offered  by OTTO and UNITO, such as freezers, have  borne the EcoTopTen seal awarded by the  ko-Institut Freiburg (Eco Institute). This  seal is only awarded to high-quality prod- ucts that offer a significant environmental  benefit and which at the same time repre- sent good value for money. Wood from sustainable forestry After cotton, wood is the Otto Groups sec- ond most frequently used raw material. It  is used in the production of catalogue and  advertising materials as well as products  in our furniture assortments. The Group  companies are continually increasing the  share of certified wood products that meet  the internationally recognised criteria of  the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) (see  p. 105). Every Otto Group reporting company that carries organic cotton  displays this range separately in their catalogues and online  shops. In relative terms Witt dedicates a lot of advertising space  to organic cotton and has been playing a pioneering role within  the Otto Group for many years. The company uses the  PURE WEAR brand name  to market organic cot- ton articles. Once again,  Witts Spring/Summer  2011 catalogue features  an extensive range of  PURE WEAR fashions.

Energy-efficient living The Otto Groups sustainable assortments  do not consist only of consumer goods;  they also include property. Since early 2011  UNITO has offered 50 different passive- house models in its assortment. These  houses primarily cover their heating re- quirements from sunlight as well as from  waste heat generated by people and equip- ment in the home. The houses dont need  traditional heating even in the winter,  thanks to their excellent insulation, an air/ water heat pump which extracts heat from  the ambient air and a ventilation system  which also recovers heat. positioning sustainability  as a selling point The Group companies intend to raise cus- tomer awareness about the advantages of  sustainable products, as the purchasing  vegetable-tanned leather as well as certified  natural rubber, organic cotton and recycled  materials.  Close collaboration with brand  suppliers at SportScheck In spring/summer 2011, SportScheck ex- panded its assortment of third-party  branded outdoor articles by 240 sustain- able products – equating to a share of  36% of all newly incorporated products.  The purchasing criteria include organic  cotton quality and a recycled-materials  ratio of at least 50%. This total included  166 bluesign-standard certified products,  which SportScheck markets in its online  shop and in prominent places within its  stores. The requirements of this standard  guarantee compliance with strict criteria  in terms of resource productivity, labour  law as well as imissions, watercourse and  consumer protection. To enable SportScheck  to further expand its assortment of blue- sign-certified outdoor articles it is work- ing closely with manufacturers and sup- pliers.

Only limited space is available to the  Group companies to put forward selling  points both in the online shops and in their  catalogues. Besides including product quali- ties that are decisive for customers, such as  price, size and brand, little space therefore  remains next to products for communicat- ing sustainability aspects. Nevertheless, our  Group companies are also seeking ways to  present sustainable product qualities in a  clear way to offer customers easy guidance. For this purpose, since as far back as  2009 OTTO has been bundling its sustain- able product ranges in a dedicated online  shop: ECOREPUBLIC. This shop is aimed  at a broad base of consumers who are in- creasingly interested in ethical consump- tion and sustainable products. To address  this target group, OTTO has developed ac- companying marketing and communica- tion campaigns in its CR Strategy. Conse- quently, the homepage of the online shop   otto.de has been permanently linked to the  ECOREPUBLIC shop since March 2011 and it  has been displaying its ranges increasingly  on site banners. UNITO also continually  places ECOREPUBLIC shop articles on the  homepage of its online shop. OTTO also  promotes the topic in its catalogues, where  it presents sustainable fashion collec- tions  made from organic and CmiA cot- ton, among other products  on multiple  double-page spreads. In addition OTTO has  developed the Eco Facts customer-guide  system: this is a collection of modern, eye- catching symbols that highlight the sus- tainability value of products. In July 2009 OTTO launched the online shop ECOREPUBLIC. This  shop bundles together and presents the single companys entire  assortment of sustainable products – in February 2011 this totalled  more than 3,600 products from the areas of fashion, living and  technology.

At utopia.de, the  web portal for sustainable  consumption, OTTO pre- sents the ECOREPUBLIC  shop and other CR activi- ties for discussion to a cri- tical group of consumers. The ECOREPUBLIC range  continues to grow, with  the aim of offering OTTO  customers sustainable  product alternatives co- vering as many areas of  their lives as possible.

We have high standards when it comes  to evaluating product quality: we do not  measure this only in terms of qualities such  as durability, finish and aesthetics, but also in  terms of the production process.  Systematic spot checks in  all textile assortments By conducting systematic spot checks, we  monitor compliance with statutory require- ments to certify the safety of our textile cloth- ing assortments. In addition, since 2008 (or as  far back as 2004 in the case of Witt) the com- panies covered by this report have placed spe- cific requirements on the testing of the textile  assortments for harmful substances based on  the ko-Tex Standard 100. Several accessories  and decorative items which do not directly  touch the skin when worn, as well as certain  rug products, are among the things excluded  from testing. The eco material requirements  include testing for formaldehyde, heavy met- als as well as carcinogenic and allergenic dyes.  The threshold values are determined using  the latest scientific knowledge and technol- ogy available. Even stricter testing parameters  apply to childrens clothing. If the textiles are  within statutory thresholds – and if our Group  subsidiary wishes – the textiles are awarded  our own company seal hautfreundlich, weil  schadstoffgeprft (skin-friendly, tested for  harmful substances). Almost 100% of the tex- tiles offered in the assortments of OTTO and  Schwab bear this seal. Overall, textiles tested  for harmful substances accounted for 70% of  the textile assortment offered by the report- ing companies in the financial year 2010/11. us, as these build trust among consumers in  the quality of the products and their sustain- able added value. In turn this has a positive ef- fect on how we are perceived as a responsible  Group of companies. The aim of Eco Facts is not to replace ex- isting labels, but rather to allow consumers to  make better use of them. Eco Facts improve  guidance when dealing with labels, make it  easier to identify sustainable products and, as  a result, make it simpler for the consumer to  make sustainable purchasing decisions.  prominent partners as ambassadors  of sustainable fashion When marketing sustainable products, OTTO  also counts on the credibility of recognised  partners. In collaboration with the designer  Michael Michalsky and the World Wide Fund  for Nature (WWF), OTTO has been showcas- ing its Protect! fashion line since August 2010  in the ECOREPUBLIC shop at otto.de. The col- lection is devoted to protecting endangered  species and these are represented as printed  designs on organic cotton t-shirts. For every  t-shirt sold, 5  goes to the WWF. Since Octo- ber 2010, the collection of musician Thomas  D, member of the German band Die Fantas- tischen Vier (The Fantastic Four), has also been  available in the ECOREPUBLIC shop: he has put  together a unique, recyclable collection made  from organic cotton for the eco label PYUA.

To- day, many consumers feel overwhelmed by  the flood of eco labels, whereas in other ar- eas they are missing essential information.  OTTO, Schwab, UNITO and Baur therefore  place Eco Facts directly next to the product  in their online shops and catalogues to give  customers a quick overview of the particu- lar key sustainability aspects in each case.  Eco Facts are divided into five categories: Eco Bio denotes the use of natural raw ma- terials with noticeable ecological advantag- es such as organic cotton or FSC-certified  timber.  Eco Recycling denotes the use of recycled  materials, for instance when textiles are  made from recycled materials by the brand  PYUA. Eco Engagement denotes products which,  when purchased, support social or non- profit initiatives; products include textiles  from the CmiA initiative. Eco Energie is used to denote particularly  energy-efficient devices and appliances;  the evaluation is based mainly on energy- efficiency ratings of the European Energy  Label. Eco Vital denotes products that promote or  protect health. Among others this includes  low-radiation phones, or products specially  developed for those suffering from allergies  and which have been awarded the Seal of  Approval, for instance. We only assign a product to one of our  Eco Fact categories if it has been awarded a  trustworthy label attesting to a quality check  by the Otto Group, or an external certification.

For  this reason, we have defined a standard pro- cedure for all Group companies when it comes  to dealing with product recalls. If production  responsibility lies with the Group company it- self, such as when clothing is sourced directly  from the Far East, the particular company  conducts the product recall itself in consulta- tion with the authorities involved. However,  if responsibility – as is often the case – lies  with the brand supplier, then the supplier is  responsible for conducting the recall. We sup- port suppliers in fulfilling this responsibility  by allowing them to access customer informa- tion necessary for the recall, after signing a  corresponding confidentiality agreement. In the reporting period, there were four  incidents in which Group companies recalled  own-brand articles: a soft-shell girls jacket  from OTTO where a cord did not meet the re- quired breaking-point standard; a glass table  from bonprix which broke for no obvious rea- son; Hanseatic-brand bicycles at Baur where  there was a potential risk of the frame break- ing; and at OTTO, a service provider exchanged  a furniture-light LED set which had a poorly  isolated power supply unit. Test enquiry relating to REACH  chemicals poorly answered A test enquiry by BUND (nature and envi- ronmental protection federation Germany)  concerning the chemical composition of wel- lington boots which fall under the REACH  (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and  Restriction of Chemicals) regulation was in- correctly forwarded by Schwab and as a result  was not answered appropriately. Under the  REACH regulation, companies are required  to respond to customer enquiries concerning  the chemical composition of products within  45 days. Following this incident, Schwab re- viewed its entire customer service process  chain and, in cooperation with Hansecontrol,  retrained managers and customer centre em- ployees.

To achieve  this, among other things they train those em- ployees who are in direct customer contact. Our  objective is to achieve a high level of customer  satisfaction and in doing so positively influence  the willingness of customers to recommend us,  and also to influence their purchasing decisions. Customer satisfaction study  and training measures  In September 2009 we conducted an in- ternal study of ten of the eleven reporting  companies to measure the quality of cus- tomer service and support, both in terms  of telephone and e-mail contact. As part  of our study, customers who contacted the  customer centre were asked to assess the  discussion they had had. The services of- fered by our Group across all categories of  questions, such as friendliness, contactabil- ity and expertise, were assessed as positive  by the study participants and we achieved  a well above-average score at Group level.  Here Witt did extremely well, placing itself  above the overall good level of the Group  in many categories including friendliness,  contactability and overall satisfaction with  telephone-based customer contact. Further- more, OTTO Office and Frankonia regularly  review their competitors' telephone-based  customer service to compare this against  their own quality. To improve customer satisfaction fur- ther still, OTTO focuses on direct contact:  every new employee spends the first two  weeks in the companys customer centre.  There, they conduct one-to-one discussions  as well as answer e-mails and enquiries to  raise their understanding of what custom- OTTO Office specialises in selling office equipment, communications  technology and office furniture to small and medium-sized business  customers. In this segment, purchases are primarily made under  economic considerations, the main purchasing criteria being quality  and price. It is a bold move to offer sustainable products here –  something which OTTO Office decided to do, based on conviction.  The company has  achieved particular suc- cess in the price-sensitive  product area of toners,  where it has successfully  launched own-brand ar- ticles bearing the Blauer  Engel (Blue Angel) envi- ronmental seal. The Blue  Angel is regarded as the  highest and most strin- gent requirement in this  product segment. As part of our CR Strategy,  OTTO Office has also set  itself individual aims to  expand its sustainable as- sortment. By the end of   financial year 2012, 5% of  all wooden articles, includ- ing wooden materials, are  to be FSC certified and  10% of its product offer  is to be climate-efficient.

Since August 2010, the estimated delivery  time of articles that are currently unavailable  is also displayed in Frankonias online shop.  In the same year, OTTO already increased the  reliability of its delivery information by 95%.  Since the middle of the year, alternative ar- ticles are also proposed to customers if the  displayed delivery times are too long.

M-commerce as a new sales channel Along with Amazon, the Otto Group is one  of the worlds largest online retailers, already  generating some 50% of its overall turnover  via the Internet. Even in this rapidly changing  sales channel, the individual companies are  continually adapting their offerings to match  new technological developments.

Regular customer surveys  for quality assurance Eight of the eleven reporting companies reg- ularly measure their customers satisfaction  and willingness to recommend. In addition to  the monthly satisfaction surveys it conducts,  in 2010 Baur gathered customer feedback re- lating to quality and assortment-based top- ics on two occasions, as part of its Consumer  Appraisal event.

Schwab also conducts regular  customer surveys to measure satisfaction  with the companys services and e-mail ser- vice via its internal Telephone Marketing De- partment. Answering customer  enquiries promptly Besides the customer approach, other factors  including call-waiting times play a key role in  terms of customer satisfaction. This is why  UNITO and bonprix defined standards in 2010  to keep this waiting time as short as possible.  At UNITO, 80% of incoming calls must be an- swered within 20 seconds; inbound e-mails  are responded to within 24 hours at the lat- est.

Quite rightly, these people  expect us to take all the necessary measures  to protect their personal information from  misuse. We manage data protection through  Group-wide policies and monitor compliance  with them by conducting external and inter- nal security checks. Central coordination of  data protection Our Group IT Security Guideline, most re- cently updated in 2009, guarantees that data  is protected in all eleven of the companies  covered by this report. Furthermore, it is sup- plemented by our Data Protection Guideline  which places additional requirements on the  Groups eleven reporting companies. Both  Guidelines are consistent with the require- ments of the German Federal Data Protection  Act. In compliance with this Act, in 2009 un- der an Executive Board resolution data pro- tection and IT security were separated from  the operational areas and consolidated in our  new organisational unit Data Protection and  IT Security, under the responsibility of our  Chief Data Protection Advisor. At Group level, the Chief Data Protection  Advisor coordinates the single companies  officers and instructs them on how to deal  with specific data-protection issues. Both  parties are in regular contact with each  other, such as at our annual two-day Data  Protection Conference. In addition, in 2009  we set up a central data-protection wiki on  our intranet, where data protection and IT  security policies, checklists and procedures  can be viewed.

As  far back as 2008, after rigorously auditing its suppliers in the key  purchasing market of Latvia, Heine launched a cooperative project  together with its suppliers aimed at producing environmentally  friendly furniture. Since that time Heine  has only been working  with those suppliers that  accept the companys  internal, ecological  product-design require- ments which stipulate,  among other things, that  FSC-certified timber is   to be used. As part of the  project, further criteria  were developed to   ensure production is   sustainable – includ- ing the use of environ- mentally friendly dyes,  adhesives and varnishes.  Additionally, a docu- menting and monitoring  system was established  which is intended to help  further improve the use  of resources. Currently,  several factories are al- ready using it to also log  their energy and materi- als consumption. In the next stage of the  project, Heine plans to  launch a special environ- mental auditing system  at the Latvian production  sites. During the course  of the overall project,  Heine has done a lot of  work to convince its sup- pliers and has supported  them extensively. If the  system proves a success,  Heine plans to roll it out  in other countries and to  cover other suppliers.  Internal and external data- protection and IT-security controls The Otto Groups IT Security Guideline sets out  how we protect personal information against  unauthorised access and theft, as well as  the security requirements on our IT systems.  Since 2001, our Group Audit area has regularly  checked whether the reporting companies are  complying with these provisions and whether  key data-processing systems are protected  against unauthorised access. Furthermore,  it checks whether the accountable specialist  areas are implementing the measures stipu- lated by the Chief Data Protection Advisor. We supplement our Group-internal da- ta-security checks with external checks. For  instance, seven of the eleven reporting com- panies have the security of their online shops  certified by external companies: Baur, OTTO  and OTTO Office were awarded the TV (Ger- man Technical Inspection Association) seal,  Witt and Schwab received the quality seal  from the Bundesverband des Deutschen Ver- sandhandels (German E-Commerce and Dis- tance Selling Trade Association), UNITO was  awarded by the sterreichischen Handels- verband (Austrian Trade Association), and at  bonprix, the Trusted Shop seal confirms that  personal information is protected. Our IT Core Security Suite is a further tool  to ensure IT security. Before IT projects with  a value of over 50,000  can be launched,  all questions listed must be answered and  IT security requirements met. At the same  time, this is used to document the security  measures of the individual IT systems. Our  IT Core Security Suite currently applies to the  majority of reporting companies, but we in- tend to roll this out Group-wide from 2012. In  February 2011 an extended version of our IT  Core Security Suite came into force at OTTO.  It places greater focus on e-commerce topics,  such as additional security requirements for  integrating social media into the online shop. 338 articles made   of FSc-certified   timber  were offered by the reporting companies  in the 2010/11 financial year – more than  seven times as much as in the 2006/07  financial year. Apart from furniture, this  also included home accessories. Answering data-protection  enquiries at OTTO The single company OTTO received some 600  data-protection enquiries from customers in  2009. To enable the company to respond as  quickly and definitively as possible to such  enquiries, OTTO established a central point  of contact together with the Customer Dia- logue Department to answer sales-related,  data-protection questions.

The data relates to the ten  reporting companies from the Multichannel Retail segment. The scope of the key figures changed between financial years  2008/09 and 2009/10 as it took into account the assortments of all  sales channels, whereas the focus had previously been on the (main)  catalogue offer. Besides all catalogues, since the 2009/10 financial  year the current scope of the key figures includes the Internet and  over-the-counter retail. Furthermore, cross-selling assortments  have also been incorporated: these cover all articles that the com- panies offer their customers by cross-selling them from other Group  companies, instead of sourcing them themselves. For this reason, in  the Cotton made in Africa (CmiA) cotton, organic cotton and Forest  Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified timber key-figure explanations  a distinction is made between those articles that the company has  sourced itself and offers the customer, and the total number of arti- cles offered in each case (including cross-selling assortments). More- over, besides own-brand products (Otto Group owns brand rights)  the new key-figure scope also includes external brands (brand rights  owned by third parties). Products carried over from the previous seasons assortments were  also included in the data-gathering process. For example, if an article  is offered in both the Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter seasons, it  is only counted once. Another new development is the introduction of  a minimum sales criterion of 20 pieces in order to forego the need to  include articles such as those sold online in smaller quantities. These  adjustments have improved the key figures validity. At the same time,  however, in two instances (amount of organic and CmiA cotton pro- cessed) the previous years comparative figures had to be modified to  ensure the necessary level of transparency and to allow a comparison  to be made. To improve the transparency and raise the comparability of different  sustainable assortment groups, from financial year 2009/10 details  are also given on the number of articles for organic cotton and CmiA  key figures, besides details on the amount processed. share of 50%). This is necessary, as some organic cotton textiles con- tain additional non-cotton fibres. Even though in practice the organic  cotton share is typically well over 50%, the Otto Group cannot assess  this for each individual product; we therefore use this conservative  method to determine the key figure. To bring transparency to this de- velopment over the past four years and allow the values to be com- pared, the figures from financial years 2007/08 and 2008/09 have  been adjusted to follow this method. As such, the figures are not con- sistent with those stated in the last report. On the basis of the new method, it is clear that there has been a con- siderable increase in the amount of organic cotton used, with figures  almost doubling in the reporting period. Behind this, OTTOs figures  are particularly impressive as, under the new method of data gather- ing, it almost quadrupled the amount of organic cotton used from   64 t in financial year 2009/10 to 254 t in 2010. To gather data on the amounts of organic cotton processed, a new,  fundamentally modified method was used in the reporting period,  whereby only half of the determined weight of the textiles was as- sessed in each case. This method conservatively assumes that textiles  only meet our minimum standards for organic cotton (minimum  Organic cotton on a growth trend FActs AnD FIGuRes AMount oF oRGAnIc cotton PRocesseD 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 107 t  188 t  364 t 146 t  122  Corporate responsibility report  2011 otto GRouP AssoRtMent AnD custoMeRs – FActs AnD FIGuRes  To gather data on the amounts of CmiA cotton fibre processed, the  Otto Group opted for the same conservative calculation method as  for organic cotton. This method assumes that all products only meet  the Groups minimum standards for CmiA cotton (minimum share of  Doubling of the amounts of Cotton made in Africa (CmiA) 50% in terms of fibres processed). Accordingly, products are calculated  to only be produced half with CmiA cotton and half with non-cotton  fibres. In practice the percentage of cotton may, in many cases, also  be significantly higher in the case of CmiA products. To bring trans- parency to this development over the past four years and allow the  values to be compared, the figures from financial years 2007/08 and  2008/09 have been correspondingly adjusted.

The Otto Group takes a position on socio-political  issues and actively pushes developments. consequently,  we engage with these issues within initiatives and  associations, for example with the Goinger Kreis.  Together with our partners we want to create and raise  awareness of social issues such as young peoples right  to an education, and create tangible solutions. In the  year 2010 alone, 165 youths participated in job training  courses at Otto Group companies. Dr Winfried Zimmermann, Member of the Executive Board,   Human Resources & Controlling Otto Group Engagement for the good of society is a  longstanding tradition for the Otto Group  and its affiliated companies. Its numerous  activities are shaped to a major extent by  the exemplary commitment of leaders such  as the companys founder, Prof. Werner Otto  and the current Chairman of the Otto Group  Supervisory Board, Dr Michael Otto. Many of  the Groups executives and employees are  also personally committed to social causes. The Hamburg Secondary School Model  (Hamburger Hauptschulmodell)  is anoth- er example of the successful engagement of  the Otto Group to improve education oppor- tunities for young people. This transregion- ally established project supports secondary  school graduates with a successful transition  from school to professional life.  The Otto Group is involved not only in  the local areas of its various locations, but  also for young people in critical purchasing  markets. For instance, we are working with  the child aid organization terre des hommes  against child labour in India. The commitment of the Otto Group is  complemented by the activities of the indi- vidual Group companies, which are respon- sible for their own projects, align those proj- ects with local needs and customise them  individually. socIety otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 127  Student enthusiasm for classical  music: The young ClassX The Otto Group takes another approach  to promoting education in Hamburg with  its unique youth music project, The Young  ClassX, that intends to inspire children and  young people to enjoy classical music. In col- laboration with the ensemble Salut Salon,  The Young ClassX launched after a successful  pilot phase in January 2010 with Dr Michael  Otto as its patron. The project encourages  children and adolescents to approach classi- cal music in a playful way and aims to mo- tivate them to become musically active. In  cooperation with the Salut Salon Ensemble,  Group Executive Board Member Alexander  Birken has developed this projects ambitious  educational approach. The young participants have the oppor- tunity to participate in a neighbourhood  choir, to learn an instrument, to play in an  orchestra, or to attend concerts. A specially- provided Music Mobile brings them to these  musical learning opportunities and audi- tions with the numerous cooperation part- ners. The youngsters self-confidence, team  spirit and perseverance are strengthened  through group musical rehearsals. The assis- tance of prominent musicians adds further  value to the project: one of the highlights  during the reporting period was a workshop  with the internationally renowned percus- sionist Martin Grubinger from Austria. No  less successful was the annual concert in  June 2010, in the organization of which 50  Otto Group employees participated volun- tarily. Since its inception, The Young ClassX  project has developed very well, with 25  Hamburg schools and more than 1,600 stu- dents already involved and with the com- mitment of new project partners such as  the Hamburg State Opera and the company  SOCIETAl ENGAGEMENT OF  THE OTTO GROUp AND ITS  REpORTING COMpANIES Within the activities of the Otto Group and  the variety of its individual companies there  is a broad spectrum of social, cultural and  athletic project sponsorship. A focus is on  improving educational opportunities for chil- dren and adolescents - both near the compa- nies own locations in Germany and also in  sourcing countries. Future opportunities for child workers In India, a significant sourcing market for our  Groups companies, we promote the project A  Future through Education in cooperation with  the child aid organization terre des hommes.  While the financial sponsor is the Otto Group,  terre des hommes manages the project. Since  March 2008, the project partners have been  working against child labour in the northern  Indian state of Bihar and in the slums of New  Delhi at a structural level: child workers are   integrated into the state schools and their  families are assisted in setting up their own  small businesses.  The children are approached by proj- ect staff members and motivated to attend  a study centre; here, they are prepared for  school attendance through instruction in  reading and writing. Connected to the educa- tional programme are also youth clubs and li- braries. The project provides adolescents with  a course of vocational training as an alterna- tive to unskilled manual labour. Success and expansion of the project  A Future through Education Since its launch in 2008, A Future through  Education had made considerable progress  by 2010: in New Delhi, around 675 children are  integrated into the range of educational and  recreational activities on offer, with 76% of  them attending educational institutions on a  regular basis by 2010. In the province of Bihar  in the same period of time, 1,150 children aged  five to 14 years were already enrolled. Also, the  affiliated vocational training system is well  a dopted there, with 132 adolescents currently  in training. In 2010, 44 adolescents successfully  completed training in the tailoring trade, which  also conveyed personalized expertise in how  to set goals and how to structure their days on  their own. Thirteen boys began with studies at  a technical school. Likewise, the training cen- tres and youth clubs are very popular in both  districts. Additionally, during the period 2008  to 2010 microloans supported 27 womens self- help groups in Bihar that now operate a small  business independently and no longer depend  on the labour of their children. In November 2010 representatives of the  Otto Group invited journalists to travel with  them to New Delhi. They wanted to get an  on-site impression of how it is possible to suc- cessfully release people from the cycle of pov- erty and to help them secure an independent  life. On this trip the media representatives  were able to engage the children and their  families in personal discussions. Financial assistance for  Indian school for the deaf The individual company bonprix has also  been involved in India for years through  improving educational opportunities. bon- prix employees conduct regular fundraising  events on their own initiative for the benefit  of a school for deaf children in the southern  Indian town of Tirupur and sponsor indi- vidual children there. In 2009 and 2010, in  addition to material donations, more than  25,000  were donated for the development  and maintenance of this school. socIety 128  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP  Steinway & Sons.

Facilitating career entry:  Goinger Kreis The Goinger Kreis (Going Group) sees itself  as a forum and think-tank for innovative per- sonnel and sociopolitical issues. One of this  initiatives functions is to develop and bring  into public debate new approaches to per- sonnel management. Dr Winfried Zimmer- mann, Member of the Executive Board, Hu- man Resources and Controlling Otto Group,  is personally and actively involved in driving  this initiative. In addition to the Environ- ment working group he directs the project  Quo Vadis? which promotes the develop- ment of new ideas for the employer-employ- ee partnership. The Goinger Kreis Fit for Application  campaign helps youths with vocational  guidance and is comprehensively support- ed by Otto Group companies. For example,  SportScheck invited around 70 secondary  and junior high students to its Munich head  office for job-application training during the  German nationwide campaign days in 2009  and 2010, where they received targeted advice  from company representatives. The young  participants had the opportunity to receive  a simulated job interview, receive a subse- quent evaluation and to create a customized  strengths and weaknesses profile. Baur, Witt,  Schwab and Heine also participate in these  annual Advice Days and in 2010 assisted a  combined total of 125 students from the re- gion with job-application training.  Lack of physical activity and related motor impairment in children  is widespread. With its sports programme SportScheck therefore  takes up the challenge to help primary school children rediscover  their in-born joy of movement.  The initiative was laun- ched in 2008 in coopera- tion with the Technical  University of Munich;   it supports children and  youth day-care centres  throughout Germany  in building a self-deve- loped, age-appropriate  exercise programme   for one year. This is   now already running   in 20 facilities.  In April of 2010, the first  After-School Club Sports  Festival was held in Mu- nich, in which children  were encouraged to exer- cise alongside students  and employees of the  Technical University of  Munich. In the Festivals  second year, the primary  goal was to integrate  the concept in the state  childrens education sys- tem: physical education  students were supported  in developing and im- plementing a repertoire  of movement games for  children in After-School  Club Sports. Since 2009,  SportScheck has also  used its well-established  city races for the bene- fit of After-School Club  Sports: per kilometre that  each participant runs, the  company donates five  euro-cents to the initiati- ve. In its first year, twelve  city races raised dona- tions totalling 31,495   with 32,864  donated  the following year.

Meanwhile, all 91  schools in Hamburg take part in the Model,  from which secondary-school pupils gradu- ate. The Model has already been adopted in 19  cities and communities throughout Germany,  and once in Switzerland too. Four additional  regions are in the establishment stage. Even in  London, there is already interest in the Ham- burg Secondary School Model concept. In 2010 a total of some 1,600 secondary- school leavers in the project were also ac- cepted in unsubsidized training, who would  otherwise have ended up in so-called on- hold programmes. The single company OTTO  continually develops the Model, ensures its  dissemination, assists other regions in its  implementation and organizes a nationwide  exchange of experience. School uniforms with  added social value When it comes to school uniforms, opin- ions are divided fairly evenly in Germany.  Whereas proponents emphasize the posi- tive impact in a sense of community, op- ponents fear egalitarianism. With its con- temporarily  designed  and  sustainably  produced concept collection of various  school uniform items for the Hamburg  School Hegholt in 2009, OTTO succeeded in  convincing even sceptics of the advantages  of school uniforms. The new school clothes are based on  designs by OTTO designers, made with Cot- ton made in Africa and sewn by employees  of Hamburger Arbeit (Hamburg Labour  Union) (see p. 112) – an employment ser- vice for long-term unemployed people and  people with disabilities. Thanks to this ini- received special transitional help, such as  preparatory courses at companies, the rate  in Hamburg even reached 28% in 2011.

Joint sporting events for health  and community spirit Exercise is healthy, and shared sporting ac- tivities strengthen a sense of community –  two good reasons for Otto Group companies  to also get involved in sports and physical  activity. Baur organized the tenth Kaufwelt- Baur Triathlon, with about 250 athletes com- peting each year. On its anniversary in 2010,  people with physical disabilities also partici- pated for the first time, so that the sporting  event was co-designated as the official Ba- varian Championship of Handicapped Tri- athletes. In the preliminary programme the  company also organised children's 400 and  800 metre races to benefit a needy family in  the district of Lichtenfels. Societal engagement: Children's  Hospice and Children's Safe Haven In the years 2009 and 2010, bonprix in- troduced numerous charity events for its  long-standing commitment to the Stern- enbrcke Children's Hospice in Hamburg.  In both years the staff collected nearly  18,000  for terminally ill children and ado- lescents, above all through proceeds from  flea markets and sales promotions. Thanks  to this support, in 2010 this care facility  was expanded and is now open to young  adults as well. In Hanau, Schwab engages  in a prevention project, run by the city and  the local police, for children who require  assistance in their daily lives. As a result,  Schwab has designated its corporate build- ing as a Safe Haven for children. Youngsters  who feel uncomfortable, are at risk or are  injured can take refuge there. Transport and logistics  for social projects Hermes provides logistics services for social  projects: for example, for the association  Schler Helfen Leben e. V. (Schoolchildren for  Social Solidarity), the company supplies free  information and registration materials for a  nationwide campaign day at schools – some  4,000 letters and packages every year. Stu- dents can work on that day instead of going  to school and can donate their wages to char- ity projects in south-eastern Europe. Since  March 2010, Hermes has also been involved  in a project to re-use bicycles in South African  SOS Children's Villages. For this project, the  company transports donated bicycles from  throughout Germany to the project partners  logistics centre (fahrrad.de). Rapid assistance for victims  of natural disasters Otto Group companies and their employees  respond quickly and with minimal red tape  in providing assistance to victims of natural  disasters such as the earthquake in Haiti and  the floods in Pakistan, both in 2010. For exam- ple, following an intranet call for donations,  employees gave about 27,000  for the earth- quake victims in Haiti, an amount the com- pany doubled to 54,000 . Heine presented  the European Well Company with employee  contributions of 2,000  towards the con- struction of a water-supply system in Haiti.  The Otto Group maintains close ties with  Pakistan as a key sourcing market for raw  materials; when that country was affected  by disastrous flooding in August 2010, em- ployees donated 10,000  for the victims to  the Malteser Hilfsdienst aid organisation,  for which the company also doubled the  sum. The money will be used to give the  population access to clean water. Aid for earthquake victims in Japan After the massive earthquake in Japan and  the tsunami it triggered in March 2011, the  Otto Group asked all employees to donate  to the children's rights organization Save  the Children, which cares for children in di- saster areas. The Group has pledged to sub- sequently double the total sum donated.  In addition, the individual company OTTO  launched a t-shirt sales promotion at its on- line shop in late March 2011 that was adopt- ed by other Group subsidiaries: 50% of the  sale price of each t-shirt bearing the Help  for Japan logo also went to the children's  rights organisation.     terre des hommes         www.terredeshommes.org     The young ClassX           www.theyoungclassx.de socIety otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 131  FOUNDATIONS AND  ENTREpRENEURIAl ENGAGEMENT The two major Otto Group-related founda- tions  the Michael Otto Foundation for En- vironmental Protection and the Aid by Trade  Foundation  are pathfinders for social  change.

This programme, developed with partners in  the educational, economic and nature con- servation fields, aims to motivate children  to question their use of water resources and  to advocate their protection and responsible  coexistence. The most important medium  is the AQUA AGENTS briefcase, containing  projects on topics such as water supply and  sanitation, water as a habitat, Harbour City  Hamburg, or even hidden water consump- tion in the production of goods.

Interdisciplinary dialogue on  conservation policy issues Once a year, the Michael Otto Foundation in- vites influential representatives from govern- ment, industry, conservation organisations  and science for an interdisciplinary dialogue  on the latest conservation policy issues. The  Hamburg Forum on Nature Conservation  series of discussions aims to develop results- orientated approaches to solutions. In 2009, the participants debated the  risky handling of natural resources under  the title Nature – a free-for-all?.

This initia- tive works with scientists, politicians and civil  societies on long-term solutions to climate  protection. The Aid by Trade Foundation The Otto Group partners the Aid by Trade  Foundation, which initiates pioneering proj- ects in developing countries to improve local  peoples living conditions as well as to pro- tect the environment. This Foundation was  founded by Dr Michael Otto. According to the developmental ap- proach of helping people help themselves,  the Foundation promotes regional sustain- able cultivation of agricultural and forestry  products, so as to enable small farmers to  improve their living conditions through  their own efforts. These principles were  implemented in an exemplary way in its  first initiative Cotton made in Africa (CmiA)  (see p. 112), which is now also supported by  several Group subsidiaries as well as by nu- merous other trading and manufacturing  companies. Demand Alliance guarantees the  success of Cotton made in Africa The key to this initiatives success lies in building  an extensive Demand Alliance. This consists of  more than 20 international trading and manu- facturing companies, including major brand re- tailers such as Tchibo, REWE Group and Puma,  which buy textiles made specifically from CmiA  cotton and market them to their customers. In  2010, the partners jointly sold more than 10 mn  items of clothing of CmiA quality. Through li- censing fees, the companies taking up CmiA  cotton also make a contribution to improving  living conditions in the CmiA-producing re- gions. Thus training courses are financed local- ly, for example, in which smallholder farmers  in the five project regions Benin, Burkina Faso,  Ivory Coast, Malawi and Zambia learn efficient  and environmentally friendly farming methods  for growing cotton that will help them to boost  quality and bottom-line earnings. These train- ing courses in conjunction with higher incomes  allow the farmers to develop independent new  perspectives. The initiatives efforts to improve  the educational situation of local people as a  whole also play an important role. Minister Dr Ladislav Miko and the recipient of  the Alternative Nobel Prize, Prof. Michael Suc- cow, presented ways to make the supposedly  free resources of nature calculable. In the fol- lowing year, experts debated the opportuni- ties and risks for ecosystems associated with  increased urbanization; the approaches de- veloped can be viewed on the Michael Otto  Foundations website. Initiative 2 – German CEOs  for Climate protection The majority of international climate scientists  agree that climate change with unforeseeable  consequences is unavoidable if man-made  greenhouse gas emissions are not drastically  reduced within the next few decades. In the  initiative2–GermanCEOsforClimatePro- tection, launched by Dr Michael Otto in 2007,  leading business executives have joined forces  in order to decisively address climate change.  This initiative actively supports the German  Federal Government in implementing a glo- bally orientated and market-based climate  policy. It also promotes the development of  technologies, processes and services that can  Dr Michael Otto supports school children in their educational training to become AQUA AGENTS. socIety otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 133  Social projects within the   Cotton made in Africa initiative The CmiA initiative is also intended as fa- cilitator for social public-private partnership  (PPP) projects to strengthen the social infra- structure. With this in mind, in the autumn  of 2009 jointly with partners from industry  and public agencies the initiative launched  a literacy project for adults in the project re- gion of Burkina Faso. An evening school co- financed by the Otto Group provides 5,000  adults with the opportunity to learn to read  and write. During a trip to the project region  of Benin in December 2010, Dr Michael Otto  laid the foundation stone for a new school  building. He travelled with representatives  of the Foundation and partner companies in   order to gain first-hand knowledge of pro- gress made by the CmiA initiative. Close cooperation with smallholder  farmers in the verification process The CmiA label guarantees that the cotton- production process respects social, envi- ronmental and economic aspects in equal  measure. In order to manage this process  efficiently and cheaply with more than  200,000 smallholder farmers in five differ- ent countries, the Aid by Trade Foundation  – in cooperation with the Dutch University  of Wageningen, the auditing and consult- ing firm PwC, various developmental and  environmental policy actors as well as Afri- can cotton companies included in the initia- tive – developed a verification system and  presented it to the public in May 2010. Its  effectiveness depends on close cooperation  between smallholder farmers and the cot- ton companies: as superordinated units the  latter collect comprehensive data, such as  payment to the smallholder farmers, and for- ward this to the auditors; this simplifies veri- fication and lowers costs. The first complete  and independent verification of all CmiA re- gions was concluded in May 2010. Promoting education in India: the Otto Group supports school projects run by terres des hommes.

And on the other  hand it is important that as many consumers  as possible develop a clear awareness of the  effect of their own buying decisions, and pur- chase sustainable products – even if these  are sometimes a little more expensive. With your climate protection initiatives  and most recently also with Sustaineo,  the Founders Alliance for Developmental  Cooperation, you are working specifically  to bring politics and business together  around the table. What is the thinking be- hind this? Dr Michael Otto: I am in no doubt what- soever that the public and private sectors  need to network far more closely to make  changehappen.Ourinitiative2–German CEOs for Climate Protection illustrates one  approach to this issue. As entrepreneurs in  this initiative we work to support po- litical decision-makers, on both a na- tional and an international level, in  their efforts to protect the climate.  With Sustaineo we have transferred  this principle to the field of develop- mental cooperation and are working  to form close national and interna- tional cooperations here too. your strong personal engagement is  well known, and you have received  many awards for this. What drives  you – and how do you find the time  for all your initiatives? Dr Michael Otto: Reading the  Club of Romes report The Limits of  Growth at the beginning of the 70s  was a powerful inspiration. This was  the trigger for me to commit to en- vironmental and climate protection.  Naturally this implies dedicating a sig- nificant amount of time, but given my  personal convictions I am more than happy to  do this! Today I have a little more time avail- able for my foundations engagement than I  had in my time as Chairman of the Otto Group  Executive Board. For instance, I was recently  able to travel to the Aid by Trade Foundations  project regions in Zambia and Benin, and to  talk to the cotton farmers there in person. I  was deeply impressed by their progress and  to see how the Foundations work is making a  secure existence possible for them. The Otto Group has promoted environmen- tal protection for 25 years. Do you see todays  globally networked economy as an opportu- nity, or as more of an obstacle in this effort? Dr Michael Otto: As both. Global trade  implies an enormous burden on the global  climate and environment, of course,  merely due to the long freight routes  and the associated CO2 emissions.  On the other hand I am convinced  that the business community has  many opportunities in this area to  improve the situation  through the  intensified global transfer of know- how, for example. Companies can  and must make a major contribu- tion here. For instance, with its Cli- mate Strategy the Otto Group set it- self the objective in 2007 to halve its  Group-wide CO2 emissions by 2020.  And in recent years many companies  have set out to combine ambitious  ecological and societal goals with  their business requirements. I sin- cerely hope that many more will do  the same. The media have highlighted a new  conscious-consumer movement over  the last couple of years, with the so-called  lOHAS – followers of a lifestyle of Health  and Sustainability – at the forefront. How do  you see this trend developing? Dr Michael Otto: We see this trend  spreading further through society and estab- lishing itself. Many customers are changing  their buying behaviour and critically ques- tioning product quality and production con- ditions. What is key here is that this change  in attitude is taking place on both sides: on  Dr Michael Otto, Chairman of the Otto Group Supervisory Board thouGht-leADeR In    sustAInABle DeVeloPMent interview with Dr Michael Otto socIety otto GRouP Corporate responsibility report 2011 135  136  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto GRouP GRI-G3 content InDex GRI-G3 content InDex The Corporate Responsibility Report 2011 of the  Otto Group and its eleven reporting companies  is based on the requirements of the Global Re- porting Initiative (GRI) and completely fulfils the  requirements of the G3 Guidelines.

No  further details are given in order to respect privacy protection regulations. 1, 6 LA14 Gender pay disparity Given the current status of Otto Group data, it is not possible to make a meaningful statement on gender-based varia- tions in compensation. Compensation is particularly dependent on the specific professional function of male and female  employees, but based on experience, also depends on length of employment and age. To determine a possible gender- related dependency, differentiated, multivariate analyses would be required. Furthermore, within the Otto Group the  percentage of women at Division Manager and Board level is comparatively small, meaning that individual cases have  a disproportional influence on the overall picture and render a meaningful statement impossible. In pursuing the goal  of a consistent, Group-wide compensation policy, the Otto Group applies so-called analytical position gradings in many  Group companies. Compensation for a particular position is thus orientated by the value of the function carried out and  the corresponding salary benchmark determined by an independent external provider.

BSCI The Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)  was founded in 2004 under the umbrella of the Euro- pean Foreign Trade Association (FTA). It is an association  of companies whose objective it is to ensure their sup- pliers comply with a consistent social standard.  Code of Conduct The Otto Groups Code of Conduct  sets out principles and aspects of Corporate Responsi- bility that are in harmony with international conven- tions. As the umbrella of the Otto Groups social pro- gramme it is an integral component of every supplier  contract and commits them to upholding clear social  and environmental standards. Compliance Management Compliance Management  ensures that laws and Otto Group guidelines as well as  voluntary commitments, for instance the Groups Code  of Conduct, are upheld. CR Rollout Through the Rollout Corporate Respon- sibility 2011–2012, the Otto Group is establishing and  implementing consistent sustainability standards in its  companies. Diversity Management Diversity Management refers  to the strategic integration and leveraging of the indi- vidual differences of employees, within the context of  their activity for the Group company. It aims to create  a productive overall working climate through the posi- tive valuation of individual differences, to prevent social  discrimination of minorities and to improve the equality  of opportunities. Ethical consumption Ethical consumption describes  consumer behaviour in which the buying decision is  no longer exclusively influenced by perceived value for  money. Rather, the customer takes other aspects into  consideration, including the fair treatment of employ- ees and suppliers as well as the responsible use of natu- ral resources in the production and use of articles.  FSC Multi-Site Certification The non-governmental  organisation FSC was set up in 1993 with the objective  of ensuring environmentally, socially and economically  sustainable forestry. The FSC Multi-Site Audit enables  the certification of several locations within a company  group under a single certification number. Greenhouse-gas emissions Greenhouse-gas emis- sions describe the release of various gases (such as  carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides) into the atmo- sphere and which partly reflect the heat radiated by the  Earth. An increase in the concentration of greenhouse  gases causes a rise in the Earths surface temperature  and is a contributing factor in climate change. International labour Organization (IlO) The Interna- tional Labour Organization (ILO) is a special organisation  established by the United Nations to promote and moni- tor social equality as well as human and employee rights. Materiality matrix A materiality matrix provides two- dimensional representation of sustainability-related  topics along two axes, according to their relevance to  companies as well as their stakeholders. The basis for  the matrix is a precise analysis of stakeholder expecta- tions, to support the development of strategies at an  early stage to manage possible opportunities and risks  to the company. Mobility In this report, mobility refers to the opera- tion of Otto Group company vehicle fleets, the use of  company vehicle pools, as well as employees business  trips by plane, train and rented car.

Ombudsman In cases of conflict, for instance when  suspicion of corruption is reported, an ombudsman fulfils  the role of an independent and confidential arbitrator. He  is obliged to maintain absolute confidentiality concern- ing the identity of the individuals who contact him, and  supports the search for a solution to the reported issue.  public private partnership A public-private partner- ship describes a partnership between private business  and the state, in which both partners invest know-how  and capital in order to carry out an enterprise or initia- tive on the states behalf. REACH REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisa- tion and Restriction of Chemicals) is the European  Community Regulation on chemicals and their safe  use. It came into effect on 1 June 2007 and regulates  the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restric- tion of chemical substances. SA8000 SA8000 is an internationally recognised,  certifiable standard for social management systems  developed by Social Accountability International (SAI).  Founded in 1997, SAI is a non-governmental organisa- tion dedicated to ensuring that ethical and humane  labour conditions are upheld throughout the entire  supply chain. SAI has developed effective systems to  audit social standards. The SA8000 standard is used  by the BSCI as the best-practice standard. Social Business Type II The objective of a Social Busi- ness is not to maximise profits. Its priorities are the  pursuit of sustainable social and often ecological ob- jectives. In contrast to a Social Business Type I, a Type  II takes a profit-orientated approach. However, profits  are not paid out as returns on capital but are returned  to its employees in the form of a social profit. The   objective is to improve the living standards of the local  population for the long term.  Social Media Social media describes digital platforms  that enable users to network as well as to exchange in- formation and opinions.  Sustainable Apparel Coalition The Sustainable Apparel  Coalition was established in March 2011 by interna- tional manufacturing and retailing companies, stake- holders and and scientific experts to drive forward the  development of a Product Sustainable Footprint. The  Coalitions objective is to establish an international  benchmark for the qualitative evaluation of prod- ucts under sustainability criteria. The Otto Group is a  founder member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. Sustainability Guideline The Otto Group has estab- lished binding guidelines for Group-internal processes  and procedures.

GlossARy  assurance statement We have been engaged to perform a moderate assurance  engagementii on the adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility  Principles with respect to the eleven Group companies  covered by this report (hereinafter the reporting companies)  and on specified quantitative sustainability-performance  information selected by the Otto Group from its Sustainability  Report 2011 (hereinafter the sustainability report) iii MAnAGeMentS ReSponSIbIlIty Otto Groups management is responsible for    the adherence to the Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and  Responsiveness set forth in AA1000 AccountAbility Principles  Standard (2008) (the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles) in the  Corporate Responsibility management and   the preparation of sustainability-performance information in the  sustainability report in accordance with the criteria stated in the  Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3 (pp. 7-17) of the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI). This responsibility includes the design, implementation and   maintenance of systems and processes to ensure adherence to the  AA1000 AccountAbility Principles and to prepare the sustainability  report using assumptions and estimates which are reasonable in   the circumstances. ASSuRAnCe pRovIDeRS ReSponSIbIlIty Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work   performed as to whether any matters have come to our attention  that cause us to believe that, in all material respects,    the systems and processes implemented by the Otto Group for   the eleven reporting companies are not sufficient to fulfil the  requirements the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of Inclusivity,  Materiality and Responsiveness, or   the selected specified quantitative sustainability-performance  information in this sustainability report has not been prepared in  accordance with the abovementioned criteria of the Sustainability  Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3 of the GRI. Within the scope of our engagement we considered the following  quantitative sustainability-performance information from the sec- tions Facts and Figures of the sustainability report selected by the  Otto Group: Share of FSC articles within the chapter Assortment and  Customers, CO2-Emissions from Otto Locations within the chapter  Climate and Environment and within the chapter suppliers supplier  performance on the basis of order volume, supplier performance on  the basis of supplier count, supplier performance on the basis of risk  countries, supplier count per risk country and distribution of factory  audit results. We also have been engaged to report on recommendations for the  further development of Corporate Responsibility management and  reporting.  We conducted our work in accordance with AA1000 Assurance   Standard (AA1000AS) 2008 and additionally observed the Interna- tional Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000. Those standards require that we comply with professional require- ments and plan and conduct the engagement, under consideration  of materiality, to express our conclusions with moderate assurancei,  the level of assurance requested by the Otto Group. We are indepen- dent in the meaning of section 3.2 of AA1000AS (2008). Based on our  skills and experiences within non-financial assurance, sustainability  management, social and environmental issues, as well as expertise  in the retail and consumer goods industry we possess the required  competencies to perform this assurance engagement.  In a moderate-assurancei engagement the evidence-gathering  procedures are less extensive than in a high-assurance engagementiv  and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a high assurance  engagement.  The procedures selected depend on the assurance providers profes- sional judgment.  With respect to the adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility   Principles regarding the reporting companies we performed the   following procedures on the level of corporate headquarters of   the Otto Group, amongst others:    Inquiries of management.   Inspection of relevant documentation.   Evidence-gathering procedures on the implementation and   suitability of relevant systems and processes on a sample basis. With respect to the selected specified sustainability-performance  information of the sustainability report we performed the following  procedures, amongst others:   Inquiries of employees at group level responsible for CR Communi- cation and Controlling, Social Responsibility, Sustainable Products,  and Climate Protection.   Inspection of procedures for collection, calculation and reporting of  sustainability-performance information.   Testing of controls implemented to ensure the data quality of  sustainability information.   Analytical procedures on selected sustainability information.

Independent Assurance Statementi  To Otto Group, Hamburg assurance statement C5  Corporate responsibility report 2011 otto group  Key FInDInGS AnD ConCluSIon  Findings in relation to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle of   Inclusivity:    Specific commitments to the stakeholders of the reporting   companies are implemented and communicated at all levels of   the organization.   Whereas some elements of the group wide Stakeholder Manage- ment practices have been formalized in the reporting period, the  documentation of group wide standards is still to be improved. Findings in relation to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle of  Materiality:    Systematic procedures are implemented at corporate level to   determine the relevance and significance of sustainability topics  for the reporting companies. Exchange on material issues takes  place through group wide communication channels.   The results of the materiality assessments and the status of  engagement of priority topics are included in the sustainability  report. Findings in relation to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle of   Responsiveness:    Processes and procedures are established and reproducible to deal  with and respond to material topics and stakeholder concerns.   The reporting companies follow up on relevant topics and   thus complement the group wide coordinated stakeholder   communication of corporate functions.   By applying the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of GRI suitable  principles for stakeholder reporting are applied. Based on our moderate assurance engagement, nothing has come to  our attention that causes us to believe that, in all material respects,  the systems and processes implemented by the eleven report- ing companies of the Otto Group are not suitable to adhere to the  AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and  Responsiveness.  Furthermore, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to   believe that, in all material respects, the selected specified quantita- tive sustainability-performance information of the sustainability  report has not been prepared in accordance with the criteria of the  Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3 (pp. 7–17) of GRI.  ReCoMMenDAtIonS  Without qualifying our conclusions above, we recommend for the  further development of Corporate Responsibility management and  reporting the following:    We recommend to systematize the group wide stakeholder   management activities as part of the planned CR-Rollout in the  German and international Group entities.
