The fact that we experienced three seasons within one day speaks volumes for unpredictable  climate change in the not-too-distant future. This year, Bangchak Petroleum Plc organized a  seminar on Thailands Natural Disasters, Worlds Natural Disasters: Our State of Unreadiness,  featuring experts and people experienced on the matter. In addition, it has developed a handbook  on how to deal with natural disasters for the public to recognize potential problems and properly  prepare themselves. The Great Floods of late 2011 has reiterated Thailands lack of readiness for  natural disasters, which could bring sorrow to those having to endure prolonged floods and  tremendous economic havoc. To help the public, Bangchak extended help early on and provided a  mobile service station selling cheap fuels to flooded areas; supplied boats for soldiers and civil  servants to provide relief, clean water and survival bags to those without access to food; and  restored flooded homes to normal conditions by taking volunteers and employee volunteers to  homes that could not manage restoration work by themselves, including homes for women and  the elderly, temples and schools.    If we do not want such radical changes, we must reduce our greenhouse gas emission. We can  take a simple, yet significant, step by cutting down on our energy consumption and using  resources to the full while consuming conscientiously in all quarters of society. As a member of  the private sector and a leading Thai company that has abided by the Greenergy principles  (sustainable business development together with environment and society), Bangchak Petroleum  therefore defined in 2010 its goal of being a carbon-neutral company to ensure environmentally  friendly business growth by the year 2014. This past year has seen completion of our solar farm  with a 118-megawatt capacity. It is our aim to halve our carbon dioxide emission while achieving  business security.   Furthermore, we have humbly applied His Majesty the Kings  Sufficiency Economy philosophy to our business management in  parallel with corporate governance so that our execution may  become transparent and be open to scrutiny while being committed  to our Be virtuous, knowledgeable and contributive to society  Bangchak culture. These have enabled us to constantly strike a  balance between business value and virtue, as we strive to become a  sustainable business entity.    On September 1 this year, Bangchak joined the network associates of the United Nations Global  Compact, consisting of 10 rules for dealing with human rights, labor, the environment and  anti-corruption. This will become our cornerstone business principle that will be part of our  strategies, culture and day-to-day precept.   8    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Adherence to the  United Nations Global Compact 10 principles Human rights     1.

It will continue to do so with an aim to strike a  balance between business values and those of the environment and society through the  consistent application of a self-sufficient economy, good governance and social responsibility  to its operations and goal achievement.    Besides managing its business to generate steady and continuous value through good  governance principles and strict risk management for its business, the Company has applied  the concept of sustainable management as an essential element of its strategic planning. To  illustrate, it has included a social and environmental indicator among its performance indicators  in addition to other indicators, namely financial, customer, process and personnel. This would  enable the company to properly cascade social and environmental goals down to the  operation levels (departments and sections). This way, action plans are interconnected or at  least do not contradict the social and environmental indicator. At the operating level, besides  the above-mentioned cascading of goals, all employees who observed the employee culture of  Be virtuous, be knowledgeable and contributive to society also contribute to the driving of  various action plans, which will be directly and indirectly beneficial and lead to true success.     15    Sustainability Report 2011 Efficiency  Shutdown Low-efficiency Unit   Energy Conservation  DecarbonizedFuel  Natural Gas to replace Fuel Oil    RenewableEnergy  Biofuel Plants (Biodiesel, Ethanol algae)   Solar Power Plant   Others  CSR  Forestation   Used cooking oil to Biodiesel  Baseline The Company has defined business growth goals to grow sustainable value for its business  by restructuring its revenue from 70% (refining business), 30% (marketing business) today,  which is highly volatile by nature of the refining business-whether world market prices or  refining margins that are subject to global and regional economic conditions-which could in  turn result in the Companys performance being also volatile. The Company has now  restructured its revenue to 50% (refining business), 20% (marketing business), and 30%  (clean-energy business) in 2015. This new element, featuring a constant stream of revenue  with low volatility caused by external factors, includes solar-energy power generation, biodiesel  production from palm oil (including palm planting) and wind-energy power generation. This  move grows business value while diversifying risks associated with its future revenue.  Grow the business and diversify risks  to businesses with secure income   Carbon Neutral Company  Core strategies for sustainable business operation  Aware that the refining business consumes a large amount of energy and emits considerable  carbon dioxide, the Company has set a target to become a carbon neutral company.  16    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Such balanced business management goals backed by determined and  ethical staff-committed to the employee culture and values-will enable the  Company to add value to business as well as society and the environment  and become an organization of sustainable growth. 4  Open, Transparent and Verifiable   3  Socially and Environmentally Friendly Business Models  (In-process)  Aware that business operations that lack social and environmental activities are unsustainable,  the Company is determined to do business in such a way that not only can it sustain  continuous growth, but also simultaneously generate positive impacts on society and the  environment. Such a model that the Company has been operating successfully is the  cooperation of retail stations and agricultural cooperatives. The Company buys agricultural  products from cooperatives in different communities and uses them for retail stations sales  promotion to create jobs and revenue in support of the economic and social development of  the communities. In the future, the Company, in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture  and Cooperatives, the Ministry of Energy and the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural  Cooperatives, will initiate a conversion of abandoned orange farms to palm plantations for  orange farmers in Rangsit. The palm produce will be their new source of income and promote  the use of alternative energy, which has been the Company initiative for more than a decade  as in gasohol and biodiesel promotion. In all, this business model benefits the environment  and provides higher income to support social development in agricultural communities.    The Company adheres to an open, transparent and verifiable policy in its operations.  Operational data are transparently disclosed under good corporate governance and SET rules.  Applying proactive environmental management, it discloses the actual data on quality of air  and effluents around the refinery by posting such information at the entrance to the refinery  and in surrounding communities.    17    Sustainability Report 2011 Grow the business and diversify risks to businesses with secure income (economic aspect)    Become a carbon-neutral company (environmental aspect)  Strategy 1  Strategy 2  1.1 Develop the solar-energy  power-generating business by  118 MW 1.2 Develop the ethanol business  with a capacity of 500,000 liters/ day 1.3 Develop the biodiesel  business with a capacity of  600,000 liters/day 2.1 Use clean natural gas  instead of fuel oil 2.2 Generate power and steam  from an efficient co-generator 2.3 Improve the refinerys  energy efficiency 2.4 Develop clean-energy  businesses (as in (1)) Plan and goal  Plan and goal  1.1 Generated and sold 8  MW since August 2011, but  currently under suspension due  to floods 1.2 Invested with Ubon Bio- Ethanol Co., Ltd.

The Enterprisewide  Risk Management Committee (ERMC), consisting of Board directors and senior management,  defines the management approach, develops an efficient ERMS, drives cooperation from all  across the Company, and ensures manageable overall risk management covering strategic,  operating, financial management, compliance, and other key risks dealing with the Companys  business.    Risk Management Structure  Risk Management Structure consists of all directors, executives and employees. The  Enterprisewide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), appointed by the Board of Directors, is  responsible for supervision in place to ensure the efficiency ERMS of the Company and  realization of impact from risks has been ignited by all executives and employees. The Price  Risk Management Committee especially defines and monitors the Companys risk management  policy for price and exchange rate volatility. Moreover, The Risk Management and  Organization Development Division is a center unit which coordinates and supports all  executives, employees and other departments to efficiently continue ERMS management and  the risk manager and risk coordinator are responsible for managing, coordinating, monitoring  and reporting the progress of risk management plan from each department, as following  figure.

Each year, it  analyzes and processes the outcomes of corporate business strategies (short-term and  five-year); global and domestic economic outlooks for the upcoming year; external and internal  risk factors; opinions of Board, Enterprisewide Risk Management Committee and Audit  Committee meetings; recommendations of external auditors, including the State Enterprise Policy  Office; and outcomes of risk management or residual risk factors from the previous year. Then  approaches are defined, as are measures for risk management control and risk monitoring,  to enable the Company to handle risks at manageable levels and bolster confidence  in achieving its goals.

This years 26 key  risks - included volatility in the oil price and exchange rates, operating risks for the refining unit, risk of marketing  business and risks of investment in new business ventures, were implemented by the cost-benefit analysis of  each measure as a decision-making tool for systematic choice of risk reduction measures.  The Company also updated its Risk Management Handbook for use as a guideline for creating a common  understanding among all related parties; improved all stages of risk assessment in processes for internal controls;  and constantly campaigned for risk management to accompany its business operation and become a company  culture. This latter action was made possible through public relations and activities designed to promote mastery  of and an atmosphere conducive to risk management among Company management and employees through  training, internal broadcasting, the intranet and knowledge management. Thanks to its consistent risk management practices, this past year saw the Companys practices achieve a  moderate degree of risk management control. In view of emerging risks addressed by the upcoming years  risk management plan, the Company has upgraded its Risk Factors topic for investors. Key risk factors are  grouped below. Economic risks    1. Risks from volatility in the oil price and value of the baht in the world market    The Companys costs of crude oil and refined-product prices are subject to rises and falls in the     world market, along with fluctuation of the baht and currency exchange rates (which are highly    volatile beyond control). As a result, gross refining margins (GRMs), which form the Companys    25    Sustainability Report 2011   staple revenue, are unpredictable. To manage price risks, the Price Risk Management Committee     therefore trades both short-term and long-term derivatives and is engaged in forward currency     contracts and derivative instruments to convert foreign-denomination loans and set proper risk     management goals in line with the Companys business plans. To manage the costs and sales     prices of such transactions, each price risk management action must accompany physical volumes     of raw-material and product trading. Besides, PTT Group features cooperation among its affiliates     in oil price information exchange to widen perspectives and promote transport cooperation to cut     transport costs from the Middle East, in addition to purchase of group insurance policies. Also,     the Company focuses on sourcing additional volumes of indigenous crude oil to keep oil and     transport costs low. 2. Risks from investment in emerging businesses     Thanks to its vision to forge environment-friendly energy businesses for sustainable development,     the Company values investment in downstream ventures for the sake of its own sustainability-    including biodiesel, solar power plants, ethanol plant shareholding and oil-palm planting project in     deserted orange groves in Rangsit. In all feasibility studies of new ventures, the Company    inves tigates the risk factors affecting each projects strategic objective achievement, assesses the     severity of each such factor, defines a risk management plan to eliminate or ease the impacts,     and monitors progress on the implementation of that plan. All these steps are under the    consid eration of ERMC to ensure that investment in new ventures achieves its goals. Social risks  1. Risks concerning corporate image and participation with communities and society    Taking business conduct with systematic social responsibility seriously from day one, the Company     has constantly won awards and prestigious corporate ranking among those with best practices in     corporate social responsibility (CSR). As part of its stewardship for energy security and participation     in social improvement, it has put in place risk factor management concerning its social image    (at national and community levels) under a clear, consistent direction for environmental, public service,     community and social development to keep them sustainably strong, and reports its actions to     the Enterprisewide Risk Management Committee. During the recent Great Floods of Central Thailand,     the Company extended continual help to the public, neighboring Bang Pa-in communities, the     Central Region and Bangkok-as well as the private sector and the public sector-to ease societys     hardship as a social and community citizen. 2. Safety risks for communities and society    Taking the safety of employees and society very seriously because its business could harm     surrounding communities, the Company values risk management by defining preventive measures     for machinery, plant compounds, workplaces, procedures under its health, safety, environment     and energy policies, as well as preparedness to act under emergency and crisis plans, which are     continually and earnestly implemented. In addition, the Company joined PTT Group in internationalizing     its vessel standards. In 2011, the Company upgraded some of its oil transport vessels to    double-hull ones to minimize en-route oil spills.  26    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 3. Risks from public policy changes     In the past few years, Thailands political uncertainty has wielded impacts on the Company and     subjected it to risks from public policy changes in assorted energy-related measures, including     the policy on the blending ratio of biodiesel (B100) in diesel; diesel price fixing; and the reduction     in contribution to the Oil Fund of 91-octane and 95-octane gasoline and of diesel. As a result, the     price gaps between these fuels and gasohol fuels-Bangchaks core products-have shrunk, directly     hurting its sales volumes and revenue. Environmental Risks  1. Risks from the refinerys location, and environment    Since ours is the only refinery operating right in the heart of a Bangkok Metropolis community,     it could create environmental and safety hazards unless properly controlled. The Company therefore     continually values sound environmental and safety management while stressing strict compliance     with relevant laws and regulations, as well as TIS 18001, OHSAS 18001, and ISO 14001. Since     the Company also recognizes the need for vigilant measures for assorted safety and environmental     impacts on communities and the residents of new condominiums around the refinery, it has set     up a refinery environmental quality information center at the Piyarom Sports Club Department     Store, containing environmental quality parameter as shown on several monitors installed around     the refinerys surrounding community. 2. Risks and opportunities arising from environmental problems and global warming    In the light of continual problems stemming from global warming, the Company envisions the     value of alternative-energy forms that benefit national energy security, cut trade imbalance due to     fuel imports and cut greenhouse gas emissions-which aligns with its vision and desire to become     a carbon-neutral company. To this end, the Company has focused on the development and sale     of biodiesel and gasohol fuels, while initiating the development of and investment in alternative-    energy projects, biodiesel plants, ethanol plant shareholding, an oil palm planting promotion project     in deserted orange groves in Rangsit, oil production project from algae, and promotion of other     alternative energy forms that are friendly to the environment, including a project on power     generation from solar cells. Crisis business management      Continually, the Company has monitored, revised and conducted crisis management plan and     emergency plan drills so as to remain prepared in personnel and resources. In 2011, it applied the     Business Continuity Management process under the BS 25999 standard by appointing an     Organizational Development Committee charged with system preparation to systematically handle    risks and potential crises; defined strategies to keep the Company running even during emergencies;     formed a task force to formulate business continuity management procedures to update plans     to cover all situations, ring-fence crises and situations, and recall key business processes within     set periods so as not to disrupt or wreck businesses, customers and stakeholders.  27    Sustainability Report 2011 Lessons learned in 2011    Ignition of plant equipment  A piece of equipment caught fire at the fuel-oil-to-diesel quality improvement unit at the refinery  on January 14, which came under control within about 30 minutes-which illustrated the Companys  capability to manage and control such as incident swiftly and without casualties or impacts on air and  environmental quality. A fact-finding committee was appointed to develop stringent measures, invest  in essential equipment changes to avoid recurrence and bolster the confidence of all stakeholders.  The committee periodically reported its findings to the Enterprisewide Risk Management Committee  and the Board of Directors.   Great Floods of 2011  The Great Floods of 2011 wreaked unprecedented havoc in the North, Northeast and Central Region,  ravaging 65 provinces, including Ayutthaya and parts of Bangkok. Thanks to its preparedness for handling various situations swiftly and systematically under crisis and  information uncertainty, the Company has activated its crisis management plan constantly as analyzed,  anticipated, devised and rehearsed since 2006 so as to minimize impacts from this disaster. As a  result, proactive steps were taken at the refinery itself on Sukhumvit 64 and at Bang Pa-in. The  Company set up a flood prevention operation center to define preventive measures, coordinate, publicize  and rehabilitate areas around the refinery and Bang Pa-in areas with the support of Royal Thai Army  troops and employees cooperation in reinforcing flood barriers in all areas. The Company had taken  out insurance policies for all properties owned by it and its subsidiaries; this eased impacts on its  revenue and enabled the Bangchak refinery on Sukhumvit 64 to run uninterrupted without any impact  from the floods. As for the Bang Pa-in Oil Distribution Center and the biodiesel (B100) plant, these  were spared from the floods, but temporarily suspended operations from October 16 and October 11  (resumed in mid-November) because transport routes were submerged in deep water, causing trucks  carrying biodiesel raw materials and oil tank trucks to stay away from the compounds. To compensate  for this under the crisis management plans, oil products were distributed by other depots at Bangchak  Refinery and Samut Sakhon. The project area for solar-energy power generation (phase 1), however,  was inundated, for which the Company and its contractor had taken out property insurance policies.  The project is expected to come on stream and distribute electricity in 2012.  28    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Floods rise and fall..., but kindness is enternal   29    Sustainability Report 2011   About this report    This Sustainability Report illustrates Bangchak Petroleum Plcs (BCP) performance related to social,  economic and environmental development.  We first prepared this annual report for distribution in 2005,  so this is our seventh issue, containing performance from January 1 to December 31, 2011, under an  approach suggested by Global Reporting Initiatives (GSI G3) indices with applied United Nations Global  Compact principles.  In essence, it illustrates the Companys continuous development in executing its  business with social and environmental responsibility on a path toward being Thailands CSR role model.  The report consists of an identification of key issues, namely vision, strategies, good corporate  governance, key company risks, together with economic, environmental and social performance.  In 2011, the task force entrusted with preparation of this report defined additional contents and  classification, and presented comprehensive details covering procurement processes and treatment of  stakeholders.  To this end, the Company ensured quality certification and assessment of the reports  comprehensiveness by Global Reporting Initiatives.    Scope of report  This report presents data related to the Companys performance in 2011 with comparisons of  certain indices going back to 2009 for analytical and development purposes.  The data  encompass the activities of all its businesses, excluding those of its subsidiaries and  associated companies.  Comparisons of basic data dates back to 2009, because the Company  has initiated significant process changes which is resumption the normal operations of the  Hydrocracking Unit and completion of construction for the EURO IV quality improvement  project for gasoline and gasohol. As for environmental cost accounting, only the findings  related to the production group (in charge of refinery processes), which by and large  concerns the environment and the Bangchak distribution center during 2010 - 2011, are included.

In the latter half of the year, the price of crude still fluctuated because of negative  factors resulting from the downgrading of the US by Standard & Poors (a reputed rating agency)  from AAA to AA.    As for the refinery business, the year saw BCP utilize 85.7 thousand barrels per day of its capacity,  which proved lower than the year before (86 thousand barrels per day).  Meanwhile, fuel sales  prices rose by an average of 16.21%, combined with a 0.35% rise in sales volume, and US$9.24  per barrel in refining margin (a substantial rise from US$6.09 per barrel).  BCP therefore grossed  Baht 156,928 million in sales and service revenue, a rise of Baht 22,290 million from that of last  year, while its net profit this year surged by 100.64% from that of last year.  In addition, the  Company profited from oil stocks, income from fines paid by a PQI Project contractor and insurance  fines associated with the ignition of plant equipment at the fuel-oil-to-diesel quality improvement unit  in January this year, altogether Baht 5,610 million, or Baht 4.24 in earnings per share.    Expenses   Most of BCPs expenditure this year was for transportation and personnel expenses, at 29% higher  than that of last year, but lower than the increment rate in net profit.  Expenses for taking care of  society at large, schools and refinery communities rose by Baht 20.17 million.  For the year, however,  the Company managed a saving of Baht 378 million in taxes paid to the government and local  agencies, thanks to the exercising of benefits of environmental investment projects.  It managed a  Baht 94-million reduction in its cost of funds from the conversion of debentures into common shares  early in the year, thus enabling it to avoid paying interests to debenture holders.  Incidentally, BCP  paid dividends comparably with those of last year.

(Signed) Anusorn Sangnimnuan (Dr. Anusorn Sangnimnuan) President  32    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited  33    Sustainability Report 2011 2009 2010 2011 Indigenous crude   Imported crude Crude oil   sources   (%)  Environmental  Environmental management   Bangchak was the first company in Southeast Asia to adopt ISO 14001 as a primary tool for its  environmental management since 1997. The system has been constantly developed to include  refining units, the Bangchak Oil Distribution Center and Bang Pa-In Oil Distribution Center. Currently,  the Senior Executive Vice President, Refinery Business, chairs the Safety, Health, Environmental and  Energy (SHEE) Management Committee, the highest authority in its environmental management  hierarchy. The Company has maintained the ISO 14001 standard for the last 14 years, thanks to  cooperation from employees and contractors working on its behalf to conform to the policy on SHEE  management as well as the ISO 14001 requirements. This year, the Company has upgraded its  document management system into an electronic one to increase efficiency, reduce paper use and  is developing online-ISO Management System to further heighten its operating standards.  Furthermore, the Company won the Green Industry, Level 3 - Green certification from the Ministry  of Industry for its systematic environmental management, monitoring, assessment and review for  continual development. and won the Green Building from Thailand Environment Institute Foundation  as well. Finally, the Company has upgraded its personnel in environmental awareness through training for its  lead auditors and pollution prevention system operators, air emissions, volatile organic compounds  and air quality monitoring station to strive for Greenergy Excellence with its human resources as  the main mechanism.           Raw materials      The Company refines imported and indigenous crude oil with modern and environmentally      friendly technology. This year, indigenous crude amounted to nearly 2.7 million litres, or      54% of the total crude run, and 2.4 million litres of oil was importes. This lessened the      currency outflow and the emissions of greenhouse gases due to crude oil transport.     To minimize losses, slop oils and oils separated and physically recovered from the      wastewater treatment system, which account for 2% of the total crude run, are stored      in slop tanks for recycling, representing a way to prevent oil losses. Green Production and Carbon Footprint 63 37 62 54 38 46 Crude Oil  34    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Products  The Companys products include fuel gas, LPG, 91-octane gasoline, gasohol 91 and 95, jet  fuel, B2, B3 and B5 PowerD and fuel oil. For the entire year, the Company operated its  refining unit under the gasoline quality improvement project which processed fuel oil into  diesel and gasoline and resulted in increased ratios of the two products. In the last quarter,  it started up its EURO IV unit, which reduces benzene and sulfur in the refining processes  and yields EURO IV standard gasoline before enforcement date of the law (January 1, 2012).

Overall energy consumption this year dropped from last year due to the maintenance  turnaround early in the year. Consumption of LPG and fuel gas was therefore 146 million  litres, while that of fuel oil dropped by 6% due to the 2% increase in natural gas  consumption.    For higher efficiency and energy conservation, the Company consumed electricity energy  supplied by the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and that from combined-cycle power  plants as secondary energy. Electricity consumption this year was equivalent to 42 million  litres of fuel oil equivalent barrels, and steam consumption was equivalent to 29 million litres  of fuel oil equivalent barrels.    The company has formed an energy management task force to constantly improve its  resource consumption to suit its business. This year it reduced energy consumption under six  refinery efficiency improvement projects by 104,050 million BTU, equivalent to 6,621 Tons CO2.    The Company also reduced its energy consumption through:  1.  Installed scale removers at the heat exchangers of the Crude Distillation Unit   2.  Upgraded hydrogen pipeline system of the Hydrogen Plant Unit to reduce flared gas and  use it instead as fuel   3.  Enhanced energy efficiency by repairing and replacing insulators of heat exchangers and  steam pipes  4.  Improved piping system at the top of Distillation Unit 2 to reduce unnecessary pumping.   36    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 14  19  20  29  12  6  53  55  13  4  8  6  10  2009 2010 2011 51  Water  The Company uses water supplied by MEA for the refinery which will not be affected to  anyone, and sources fire water from the Chao Phraya River. Water consumption in 2011  amounted to 2,156,619 cubic metres, a slight drop that of the previous year due to lower  refining activities, lower use for maintenance purposes as well as implementation of the  following water-saving measures in offices and refining processes:      1.  Installed sensors on toilet sinks to lower water losses.   2. Use of treated water for plant watering on the compound, thereby saving 4,800 cubic     metres or 0.23% of total water consumption.   3. Use of stripped water from the Sour-Water Stripping Unit as Boiler Feed Water (BFW) of     Distillation Unit 4, reducing consumption by 40,800 cubic metres of BFW per year.   4. Use of stripped water from the Sour-Water Stripping Unit of Units 2 and 3 (rather than     piped water) to dissolve salts in crude oil, thus lowering water consumption by 57,120     cubic metres per year.   5. Use of a reverse-osmosis system to pre-treat water for the Demineralization System,     preserving 38,000 cubic metres of treated water per year.     Ground water is consumed at the Bang Pa-in Oil Distribution Center in Ayutthaya province,  while water from the Bang Khian Canal, a tributary of the Chao Phraya River, serves as fire  water.

Because of its close proximity to communities and recognizing the importance of environmental  quality, the Company uses clean fuels in its refining process and closely monitor emissions.  Continuous Emission Monitoring (CEM) equipment was installed at the refinerys emission  stacks to monitor environment quality and pollutants in the exhausts at all times.  Furthermore,  the Company has set up two air quality monitoring stations near its neighborhood. The first  checkpoint was at Somthawil School, and later this year, the second checkpoint was set up at  the Secretariat Department military housing units. All readings go to the monitors in the  Process Control Room and air-quality analytical results are displayed together with those from  the CEMs on automatic environment quality signboards installed at the entrance to the refinery  and communities in its vicinity as well as in public areas, such as Piyarom Sports Club, for the  public to monitor them at all times as well as for the comfort of the surrounding communities.    Serious about ozone-depleting Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), the company has  established VOC accounting.  Its measurement of VOC emissions started in 2010, and this  year, the Company has bought four units of modern equipment for VOC measurement to  prevent emissions and will further define measures for their reduction.    Carbon footprint  This year the Company released 529,215 tons CO2e of greenhouse gases from its own  processes and 96,795 tons CO2e from its purchase of power and steam for a total of  626,010 tons CO2e.  This total was slightly lower than that of the previous year, since this  year the Company suspended its hydrocracking unit from January to February, accounting for  about 20.06 tons CO2e per kilobarrel, mildly lower than the 22.91 tons CO2e recorded in 2010.  Incidentally, a new unit has started up to produce EURO IV fuels since October 2011.   38    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Analytical  Results of  Nitrogen  Oxides  (NOx)  Analytical  Results of  Sulfur Dioxide  (SO2)  Analytical  Results of  Hydrogen  Sulfide  Opacity  (%)    3  3  106.7 45.5 72.6 35.0  9.7   14.0 28.0  3  3   1/2, 3      1/2, 3  EIA standard (160 ppm)   EIA standard (400 0ppm)   EIA standard (48 ppm)   EIA standard (80 ppm)   EIA standard (10%)  106.7  2.4  106  < 2.0  < 1.0  0  < 2.0  < 2.0  < 2.0  < 2.0  < 2.0  45.5  72.6  35.0  9.7  14.0  Sulfur Recover  Unit 1/2, 3   SRU 1/2, 3 28.0  Boiler Boiler TPU 3  SRU 1/2, 3 CRU 3 CRU 3 VDU VDU HCU HCU HPU HPU Common Stacks Common Stacks Boiler  39    Sustainability Report 2011 Water Pollution  The Company houses high-efficiency wastewater treatment systems using closely-monitored  online measurement devices.

Process water is treated physically, chemically and biologically until  the quality exceeds the required standards before discharge through the Bang Aw Canal  to the Chao Phraya River. In 2011, the Company discharged a total of 613,198 cubic metres  of effluent. The Company is committed to the reduction of water consumption and effluent   to save water and make the most efficient use of water. It plans to install a sophisticated  effluent quality improvement unit to obtain quality water on a par with piped water for reuse  in its processes.

All situations that occurred in  areas of refinery had been immediately under managed, controlled and recovered in line with  SHEE laws and environmental regulations which have never been affected to water resources  and environment at all.  NOTE: Definition of waste by regulation of Ministry of Industry  Waste and scrap / disposal  Process waste from the refinery and the distribution center that cannot be treated internally  are reused, recycled and disposed of by domestic transporters and disposers approved by the  Department of Industrial Works. Some spent catalysts were exported for extraction of  recovered metal for reuse. Waste disposal and management strictly conforms to the laws and  Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their  Disposal.    This year the Company exported from its plants a total of 2,938 tons of waste, consisting of  1,487 tons of hazardous waste (51%) and 1,451 tons of non-hazardous waste (49%).    All this waste is treated and disposed of by technically proper methods. About 28% of the  Companys waste is segregated for sale to treaters authorized by the Department of  Industrial Works for full subsequent use. Late this year, the Company improved its processes  to lower wastewater volumes derived from the biodiesel plant. It is therefore expected that  in 2012 it will be able to reduce the volume of waste needing treatment by about 40%.

To avoid traffic jams, transport of products is mainly through  underground pipes to Bang Pa-in Oil Distribution Center for further distribution to the North  and Northeast, while trucks are used for Bangkok Metropolis. The Companys trucks run on  the less-polluting biodiesel B5 instead of normal diesel, and 16,000-litre trucks were replaced  with 20,000-litre and 32,000-40,000-litre ones to lower the numbers of trips and lower fuel  consumption and carbon dioxide emission. Furthermore, all Bangchak oil trucks are  GPS-monitored to control their speeds and reduce risks of accidents harming the environment.  Every driver must undergo defensive driving training, and all trucks must be in working order.  Emergency teams are required to be on alert, ready to move in to terminate or control the  incidents potentially involving oil spill.   Compliance  Compliance represents good governance and a health, safety, environment and energy (SHEE)  policy element to which all employees and contractors working on behalf of the Company  must pay attention and strictly adhere in their operations. Besides having a unit responsible  for the follow-up, summary and compliance of new and draft laws on SHEE, there are at  least two SHEE compliance audits every year conducted by internal and external auditors.  The Company also has a legal office responsible for educating and generating awareness of  rules and regulations to ensure compliance. The Company has never been fined or punished  as a result of non-conformance to environmental laws or acts in violation of laws or  regulations during transport.

It introduced an electronic accounting system in 2008 and expanded the scope to  the Bangchak and Bang Pa-in Oil Distribution Centers in 2009. In place are daily monitoring and reporting to  executives for further reporting to investors and shareholders every quarter in the MD&A section and the IR  Newsletter. Besides these, BCP educated students and other interested parties on environmental cost  accounting, which is considered a branch of environmental management accounting applied by BCP to resource  consumption in its environmental management in tandem with financial management for higher efficiency, which  paves the way to BCPs sustainability.    Since 2010, BCP has operated all its various units under the PQI Project at full steam and with significant  process changes. The Company therefore presents below data for 2010 and 2011, which can be compared on  the same basis as follows:    Environmental expenses this year exceeded those in 2010 by about Baht 26,688 million or 32%. About 99%  of the increase is material costs of product outputs, since crude oil prices had risen by an average of Baht  4.98/litre or 31.8% over those of 2010 (when they averaged Baht 15.68/litre), whereas production rose by  only 1% from the same period.    For the year, material costs of non-product outputs-in other words, process waste-were about the same as  those of 2010 despite the companys close monitoring of processes that reduced about 21% in slop oil volume.  Unfortunately, the Company incurred 30% higher rerun costs. On the other hand, the Company managed to  lower excess volumes of chemicals as a result of equilibrium adjustment and that of oil tank sludge.                              Waste and emission control costs, comprising those of maintaining environmental management equipment and  those of managing process waste.  This year these expenses fell, whereas the costs of waste management  rose with the maintenance turnaround and the replacement of machinery. As a result, the equipment lasted  longer and the volume of waste needing disposal higher. Incidentally, there was no difference between the  prevention and other environmental management costs over the past year.                               Other than environmental costs, this year the Company generated  revenue from scrap sold to other industries, notably liquid  sulfur, a byproduct of sulfur extraction during the quality  improvement stage. This year, this revenue rose by  Baht 12.81 million in line with the sulfur content  of the crude feed, which was about twice  higher; incidentally, such crude feed was  about eight times that of 2010. The  Company has also produced diesel and  gasoline of EURO IV standards, which  called for more sulfur extraction to obtain  more environmentally friendly products  ahead of enforcement.       43    Sustainability Report 2011 Unit: Million Baht  Item                   2010  2011  Material Costs of Product Outputs  Crude Oil               77,393.94  27,248.50  Ethanol                1,728.85  514.67  Biodiesel (B100)           1,728.55  617.91  Used Vegetable Oil          33.03  9.98  Chemicals              84.01  21.76  Process Water            29.03  7.88  Energy                 3,093.93  814.71  Material Costs of Non-Product Outputs      Slop Oil                120.27  29.90  Bottom-Tank Sludge / Fuel Oil   0.45  -  Effluent                10.92  2.53  Excess Chemicals in Water from stabilizer Pool  0.83  0.06  Poor-Quality Sulfur          -  0.05  Waste and Emission Control Costs      Environmental Equipment Maintenance  10.65  8.49  Depreciation of Pollution Control Equipment  200.09  31.40  Effluent Treatment          6.68  1.68  Waste Disposal            5.23  1.79  Environmental Fees and Taxes    N.A  N.A  Fines                 N.A  N.A  Environmental Management Costs      Monitoring              7.01  1.49  Depreciation of Waste Storage Area  0.06  0.07  Management Operation Cost    0.91  -  Environmental Equipment Maintenance Cost   0.01  -  Benefit from by-product and waste recycling  Liquid Sulfur             3.55  3.91  Glycerin                0.30  0.12  Steel-Aluminum Scrap        8.52  4.29  Paper                 0.03  0.00   44    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Biodiversity  Bangchak refinery and Bangchak Oil Distribution Center, located in Bangchak Sub-District,  Phra Khanong District, Bangkok, are now surrounded by urban communities and industrial  plants including Thai Plywoods Co., Ltd., and battery manufacturing plants. To the west is the  lower Chao Phraya River. These areas are not regarded as protected areas or those with  biodiversity. Nevertheless, recognizing the value of environmental quality, which directly  impacts biodiversity, the Company continues its monitoring and surveillance of environmental  quality in and around the refinery and neighboring communities. The Company faces no risk  of extinction of local plants and animals. In fact, thanks to Bangchaks stewardship of the  surroundings and nature, 72 species of local and migratory birds have made the refinery their  habitat.  Eco-Efficiency In sustainable development, a business cannot consider merely business returns, but must  also consider environmental impacts.  This is why the Company has introduced an eco- efficiency indicator, which blends economic with environmental performance. To obtain this,  we use the adjusted EBITDA, which illustrates economic performance, together with the  carbon dioxide equivalent in emission, which illustrates environmental performance. All things  being equal, better economic performance or better environmental performance raises eco- efficiency. This year, the refinery emitted 626,010 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (the so- called carbon footprint), which was less than that of last year, thanks to the switch from fuel  oil to cleaner-burning natural gas and the co-generator method of heat and power generation  (which is highly energy-efficient). Also, the adjusted EBITDA this year accounted for the  higher eco-efficiency.       Eco-efficiency   =   Adjusted EBITDA (Baht million)                     Carbon dioxide equivalent (tons)  2008  2009  2010  2011  0.017  0.012  0.007  0.011  Eco-efficiency table (Baht million/tons CO2 equivalent)   45    Sustainability Report 2011 Strong stewardship of the environment enables us   to cherish bird families living together with us in this home  According to the surveys and notes of the Companys bird-watching group,  Bangchak Refinery is home to many local birds. Each year, knowledgeable  employees serve as volunteer guides for bird-watching around this natural  learning center for local youths and families to get acquainted with the  ecology and birds. Seventy-two species of birds are sighted on the refinerys  compound. Some species are least expected or should have been extinct, yet  they are sighted here every year. Im speaking about Nok Kaeo Mong  (Alexandrine parakeet) or Nok Kaeo Hua Phrae (blossom-headed parakeet).  Then there are migratory birds from Siberia, near the North Pole, like Nok  Kraten Noi Thammada (common kingfisher), otherwise known as the king of  migratory birds. Commonly seen at the refinery is Nok Ti Thong (coppersmith  barbet), also known as the city queen (found living together in families).    Kanchit Chinarin  Public Relations Officer, Public Relations Section  Chairman, Bangchak Bird-watching Club   46    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Green procurement  Besides exercising environmental care inside the Company, the Company also supports its business partners to do so.  The Company values the use of environmentally friendly products through its procurement of products, goods and  services, known collectively as Green Procurement. This means that, besides the desired suitability of quality, prices,  delivery and services, the Company examine the degree of environmentally friendly production (manufacturing). To  elaborate, the life cycles of desired products and services must be compatible with the diagram below as well as socially  responsible; business partners must run their businesses by the law, rules, government regulations and abide by labor  and safety laws; in treating their employees, business partners must abide by a code of practice and respect for human  rights, while avoiding child labor and alien labor. Even in times of floods, which require plenty of laborers, the Companys  business partners are to hire only Thai labor.  This year the Company procured the following green products:  Use environmentally  friendly materials  Employ efficient  production technology  Use light  and small materials  Efficient managment  system for post-service life  Minimize environmental  impacts duing product  application  Use efficient transport  and distribution systems  Life-cycle  cost-effeciveness  Properties of lifelong  environmentally friendly  products and services  The Company bought digital multifunction ones whose technologies  leads to improved office workplaces, where the EU-RoHS standard  controls the release of toxic materials, including ozone, which poses  hazards in workplaces. Lead and halogens, posing threats to the nervous  system and the digestive tract, were banned. Chromium, toxic to nasal  tissues and carcinogenic, was abolished. Dry toners replaced magnetic  powder, thus making it safe for work in the office and odorless.

Measures must be established  for the return of salvaged products and reused  properly under technical principles.  Fluorescent bulbs/tubes  Canon products lowers energy consumption                while taking care of our surroundings  When I think of Bangchak Petroleum, I think of a force that conserves the world. To me, Bangchak  represents clean energy, environmental stewardship and green thinking. This is pretty much the way  Bangchak chose environmentally friendly products from Canon in support of its business and efficiency  improvement in document management. Document management becomes simple, time-saving and  cost-saving in line with Bangchaks vision and strengths.    Canon is proud to be a part of Bangchaks support, thanks to our commitment to environmental  innovation, which so dearly values users wellbeing. By stemming 30% of carbon dioxide sources,  cutting the use of toxic chemicals, preventing pollution with bioplastic technology, and recycling  plastics-we ensure that all models of Canon products bear the Energy Star international standard. This  confirms that Canon products lowers energy consumption and promotes a good environment.

Pollutants may not  exceed given limits. Halogenic solvents were  banned in production processes. Finally, metallic  containers must not contain lead.  Building paint  Wood furniture  As for future Green Procurement, the Company will extend this list to promote Green Procurement markets for  products and services to encourage producers and manufacturers to pay greater attention to green products.   48    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited The Company is a leader in the production and distribution of alternative fuels, with constant  introduction of green products (both fuel products and lubricants) and services in keeping with  its Greenergy Excellence vision. Leading supplier of gasohols with top market shares for E20 and E85 The Company pioneered alternative fuels in Thailand by blending ethanol in gasoline into 91-octane  and 95-octane gasohols for gasoline engines. It subsequently expanded this leadership to the  E20 variety, on sale since  2008, and developed E85 for current models. The Company currently  tops the market shares of E20 with 450 stations and E85 with 20 stations. Sales promotion is  conducted through the Gasohol Club Project, which saves crude oil imports while adding income  for farmers. Leading supplier of EURO IV diesel ahead of enforcement The Company pioneered the production and sale of Super Power D EURO IV four years ahead  of the enforcement date of 2012, lowering by seven-fold sulfur emissions and lowering pollutants  (carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons) while also combating global warming. In early 2012, the  Company is poised to start selling EURO IV gasoline in response to the public policy requiring  gasoline to be friendlier to human health and the environment. Constant improver of service station image, surroundings and quality  Valuing constant improvement of service stations through the likes of good surroundings  (mini-garden, cleanliness and toilets), the Company has completed the refurbishing of 304 stations  (114 Bangchak service stations  and 190 community ones). This improvement, particularly of those  on main  roads and highways, prepared them for more road users. Reimaging of supplementary  businesses consisted of Bai Chak convenience stores, featuring development of prototype stores  where retailers with serious work  on quality improvement can showcase their products and further  develop  them. The Green Series car care business and Inthanin coffee shops add to  consumers  satisfaction.  The Company installed toilets for wheelchair users in support of human rights, with ramps  promoting their access. For the third straight year, the Company won the Quality and Safe Service  Stations Award,  sponsored by the Department of Energy Business, Ministry of Energy, with a total of 128 awards  (53 gold, 42 silver and 33 bronze), the first runner-up among domestic oil companies. It also  earned the first runner- up award recognizing Clean Toilets at service stations that met the  HAS standard, sponsored by the Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health.    Mobile service stations selling low-priced fuels in aid of flood victims  During the Great Floods of 2011, the Company launched its Sharing Project to extend help to  flood victims by selling 91-octane gasoline and diesel at mobile service stations at one baht/litre  below regular prices in the following districts of Bangkok Metropolis: Don Mueang, Bang Bua  Thong, Thawi Wathana, Bang Khae and Bang Khen.

Growth and quality improvement of lubricants to environmental standards To bolster consumers confidence in its lubricants, the Company ensures that  its lubricant business  is in line with the ISO 9001:2008 quality management standard encompassing the management  system, product development,  sales, depot management and after-sales services, apart from  the ISO/TS  16949:2009 management standard for the automotive industry. The Company is  proud to have become the first in Thailand to be so certified. The Company has also introduced  new lubricants that conform to API CJ-4, the highest current standard. API CJ-4 diesel-engine  lubricants lower engine  wear, are more heavy-duty and lessen lubricant replacement frequencies  while doing an excellent job in keeping engines clean. They work with new models of cars that  run on EURO V, thus hiking Bangchak lubricant sales every year, an illustration of the growth  of the lubricant market along with greener development of products with greater environmental  care. In addition, the Company has promoted the maximization of resource usage by inserting an  environmental message and reusing lubricant can cartons as office document boxes. Lubricant   sales   volumes  (KL)   50    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Bangchak Gasohol Club card The Bangchak Gasohol Club card gives holders 0.20 baht/litre discounts on gasohols along with  those on lubricants, allied stores, privileged access to roadside emergency assistance and extra  discounts under the Same Price Project (which entitles holders to get the same prices on the  day of fuel price adjustment) in an effort to please cardholders. Today the Company has more  than 430,000 cardholders. This year, to further promote the use of alternative energy, the Company launched a Triple Point  campaign for E20 and E85 gasohol buyers to get three times the regular discount of 0.20 baht/ litre to 0.60 baht/litre from April 10 to June 30 and still enjoy the Double Point privilege of  twice the regular discount of 0.40 baht/litre. Besides, it has issued the Bangchak Lady Card for  additional privileges for lady drivers, including discounts provided by allied stores for cosmetic  products, spa services, ladies journals and golf lessons-in an effort to attract more lady drivers  by offering them over and beyond the current privileges. This year, the Companys regular activities for cardholders consisted of a visit to the Royal  Chitralada Projects, a tour of hydroponic vegetable planting, a seat at the Golden Culture of  Ratanakosin show, a lesson in bouquet arranging, coffee making, photography, make-ups and  movie seats. Moreover, when Bangkok and its perimeter as well as the Central Region faced  massive flooding, cardholders had donated their cumulative points to help victims through the  Thai Red Cross Society, the donation total Baht 35,532.20. Our family members are staunch Bangchak patrons because were convinced of the  fuel quality, which brings no engine problems. Whats more, Bangchak was among the  first companies to advocate the use of environmentally friendly gasohol or biodiesel,  and has run promotional campaigns for these fuels. Take the Gasohol Club Card: I like  point accumulation, which can be turned into discounts. Biscuits, sweets, and other  items are Bangchaks nice giveaways, inspiring customers interest in Bangchak  services.

Besides boosting sales, thus  strengthening these service stations, this move nurtures the community economy. Today, under  an expanding headcount, more than 130,000 have joined the membership. Green Series service center and public services The Green Series car-care business this year staged an activity in which flood victims could have  free checks for their flood-affected cars. Up to 50% discounts were offered for participating  lubricant products, together with free lubricant changes. Bangchak stands for impression, bond and more  Mobile phone application (iPhones) The Company has developed an application for iPhone  users, who can download it for access to all current  product prices and identification of nearby service  stations. This application links databases on Bangchak  service stations with GPS, an approach illustrating the  Companys innovative ways to cater to customers  demand Driving to work every day, I pass by Bangchak service stations. The mere sight of its logo refreshes me, thanks to its light  green color, which pleases the eye. That inspired me in the first place to use Bangchaks fuel. The first time, I got dried,  honey-glazed bananas as an impressive giveaway-most others give drinking water, whereas Bangchak gives an OTOP  product! This means its addressing issues like environmental conservation and showcasing the countrys natural products. It  illustrates the Think Green approach of Bangchak executives. Convinced of Bangchaks attention to details like this, Ive never  doubted its fuels benign quality on my cars engines. From that day, Ive pledged to become  a Bangchak disciple. Then one day I saw an advertisement of Bangchak Gasohol Club (the so-called GSH  Club Card), which prompted me to ask a service station attendant about how long it would take to  become a member. The application process was a snap! My application was mostly to declare myself as  a Bangchak disciple, so I didnt bother to read what benefits the card would provide. On reading it, I  became aware of the 100 baht, 200 baht, and so on, discounts and what I like is the accumulation of  points, like 500 or 1,000 points-in short, I got hooked! Since the first day when I became  a Bangchak patron, Ive always thought highly of Bangchak, which stands for impression, bond,  and so much more. Thanks for all the good things!      Mr. Sajee Thawee  Executive Secretary  Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction PCL     52    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Bangchak supports communities that are ready to manage  service stations. It also expands and finds new marketing  channels for community products, and displays them at  Bangchaks minimarts (Bai Chak), successfully coordinating  help between towns and rural areas.    Today, more than 500 agricultural cooperatives are running  Bangchak service stations-thats about half of Bangchaks total  station-count! Benefiting from this scheme are more than one  million households nationwide. Agricultural communities are  therefore sustainable, serve as prototypes for observation  tours by other cooperatives and generate income for  communities together with Baht 3.5 billion a year in working  capital. Communities and society, as a result, are becoming  stronger.    Mr. Chuchat Insawang   Manager, Si Prachan Agricultural Cooperatives, Ltd.  Trust underscores Bangchak business execution,                   which embraces society  Communication  Customers can inquire about and search for product information by reading product and  service labels, and accessing marketing information at the Bangchak customer service center,  manned by officers that have passed standard training on communication with customers  while taking into account human rights. Customers get fair treatment in their search, apart  from accurate, useful and not misleading information; the Company officers also listen to  recommendations while remaining prepared to cater to customers needs and keeping their  data confidential. Finally, communication is done through the Company website and online  social networks, including Facebook. Other operations in marketing and advertising did not  violate the laws, also no complaints on privacy right of customers.  Safety, health and environment  Recognizing the criticality of safety, health and environmental standards, the Company has  installed vapor recovery systems at the Bangchak oil depot on Sukhumvit 64 Road and the  Bang Pa-in oil depot in addition to all service stations in Bangkok and its perimeter in an effort  to bolster confidence among depot and service station users.

Community needs could also emerged from  the annual community engagement and the communitys own forum. There are also visits to communities,  carried out seven rounds a year-a program that draws direct participation between the community  and the Company. The Company has divided target communities located in a short distance from  the Company into four groups:  2010 2011 Satisfaction  of Community  Relation  Activity  (percentage)  96.93% 96.37% Bangchaks community participation and social development programs have been running ever  since the Companys establishment, or as long as 27 years ago. The Companys Greenergy  Excellence culture has been inherited and turned into practice from generation to generation,  resulting in all levels of operations having responsibilities and respect for communities, social  groups, stakeholders and the country at large.  Community Participation and Social Development Bangchak is Thai from roots to leaves    Despite its continuous attempt to equip the public with knowledge about the environment through  various projects to alert them to live their lives in an environmentally friendly way, people around  the world encountered various natural disasters through 2011, be it earthquakes, volcano eruptions,  tsunamis or the Great Floods of Thailand. The Company deems it an obligation to work harder  proactively and reactively to raise concerns among the public over the environment, that is, to  create awareness by publicizing knowledge about natural disasters and running disaster relief  programs in line with the Companys vision, corporate culture, mission and strategies. It is also  the Companys normal practice to create value for the community and society.    Communities around the refinery : The Company has a Community Relations Committee (CRC),  comprising a senior executive vice president and executives from various departments. The committee,  having environment and community relations section serving as the secretary, is scheduled to meet every  two months to devise strategies, grant approvals and follow up on community relations programs.   74    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Explanation of target groups:  1.  The community - Back in the old days, the Company was located far from communities, surrounded by paddy  fields, with only a few landholders living next to each other next to Chao Phraya River. The main means of  travel was an old rail line. After the city expanded, leading to migration of labor, the surrounding fields were  built on and became residential buildings rented out on a yearly basis. Currently the residents around the  refinery are registered with Amphoe Phra Khanong and are made up of six communities (1,028 households,  4,710 people) living in slum-like conditions with many migrant workers living there too. This year, the  Companys community relations program has been expanded to Tambon Bang Nam Phueng, Amphoe Phra Pra  Daeng, Samut Prakan, located on the opposite side of the Chao Phraya River and facing the back of the  refinery (11 villages : 1,116 households).  2.  Families – This group covers people who live in detached houses and townhouses in Phra Khanong and Bang  Na areas.  3.  Schools - There are 11 schools from the primary level to secondary level under the Bangkok Metropolitan  Administration and the Department of General Education in the area.  4.

Participating in this years project were students from five  schools: Wat Tham Mongkhon School, Wat Saphan School, Roong Ruang U-patam School,  Wat Bangna Nai School and Wat Bangna Nok School.              The Company also organized training for condominium dwellers-its latest target group that  has just emerged after the BTS skytrain route extension. This activity strengthens the  relationship between the Company and condominium neighbors. This year, residents as well  as representatives from condominium committees and juristic persons from three  condominiums, participated in the activity (namely Ua Amorn Suk, The Room 64, and Ideo  Mix on Sukhumvit Road).    3. Sports    3.1 The Eighth Bangchak Youth Futsal Tournament Project       The Company organized the annual Bangchak Youth Futsal Tournament, in its Eighth year, to  give youths a platform for developing sporting skills; promote physical strength, discipline and  sportsmanship; deter youths from using drugs and allow a sharing of experiences when they  compete with other schools. It also organized a team cheering competition to allow youths  to creatively express themselves. This event was participated in by 29 schools from various  districts of Bangkok Metropolis.    79    Sustainability Report 2011 Waen Kaeo Project  Health Check up for Community  One Family Project, Year 18    3.2 Bangchak Youth Sports Camp       The Company, together with the Royal Thai Navy Department of Welfare, organized the  Bangchak Youth Sports Camp to teach seven sports to encourage youths around the  refinery to spend their school breaks wisely; promote physical, mental, and emotional health  and deter them from drugs and broaden their non-classroom experience.

This is part of  its effort to improve life for those with poor vision, thus increasing their learning ability.      4.2 Health Check-up for Community        Bangchak realizes the need to take good care of peoples health; it organized a mobile unit  to provide health and dental check-ups for these residents. The mobile units service also  covers blood checks, bone density checks, chest x-rays and consultation with doctors. Over  420 people received the service, cooperatively provided by a medical team from Krung Siam  St. Carlos Hospital.      4.3 One Family Project, Year 18       The Company promotes family activities with a focus on provision of knowledge and  understanding of physical and emotional wellbeing. It emphasizes hands-on learning, in which  experts and the Company staff provide knowledge in such activities as Bangchak Yoga,  Power of Massage, Health Food, Keep Dharma in Your Heart, Dharma in the Garden and  Do It Yourself activity-made up of many smaller programs like plastic bottle recycling, re-do  and re-use (painting on used t-shirts) and handmade books.      80    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Sustainable Waste Classification,  Bang Nam Phueng, Samut Prakan  Sapling Planting  Phu ling Reforestation Project  5.  The Environment    5.1 Sustainable Waste Classification (Sorting), Aiming for Waste-Free Tambon at  Bang Nam Phueng, Samut Prakan        In collaboration with Bang Nam Phueng Tambon Administrative Organization, the Company  carried out a waste management project for the tambon to become waste-free. The project  provides equipment and training conducted by community experts on sorting waste, making  fertilizer and effective-microorganism liquids to reduce the need to buy fertilizer while  lowering risks from chemical substances. During the flood crisis this year, villagers learned to  collect EM liquids from households to make EM balls and distributed them to flood victims  for use in cleaning flood waters. EM balls were also put on sale at Bang Nam Phueng  market to earn income for the community. So far, 3,200 people in 800 households have  learned to understand the need to take care of the environment and are committed to  keeping their communities clean. Such action is regarded as a tribute to HM the King on his  84th birthday anniversary.               In addition, a workshop was provided for the Bee Power Save the World youth group at  Ruam Tawan Center, Amphoe Mueang, Kanchana Buri, to extend their knowledge about the  environment, which is useful for waste management, both in the community and at the  communitys floating market. The acquired knowledge also enabled youths to manage the  ecology of the communitys forest as well as the life-cycles of goods and services. It is  hoped that these children will become a driving force in strengthening the communitys  environmental conservation efforts.       5.2 Sapling Planting, Phu Long Reforestation and Thot Pha Pa, Raksa Ton Nam  (Monk Robe Offering, Keeping Water Source) Projects       Convinced of the inter-relationship among all lives and the environment, the Company  recognizes the need to take care of the environment (forests in particular), which makes  living things existence sustainable. It values activities and work procedures that conserve  nature and the environment by cooperating with the Phu Long Reforestation Project of   81    Sustainability Report 2011 Public Park in Honor of HM King  on his 84th Birthday Anniversary  Mobile Communities Project  Bangchak Summer  Camp Project  Sukhato Temple and Mahawan Temple, Chaiyaphum, in conserving the Lam Pathao  watershed (Phu Long), storing and reforesting the area. In this sixth year, six schools from  the refinerys surrounding communities and two local schools joined the program and  produced 20,000 saplings each year (covering roughly 50 rai) to teach children the  importance of conserving forests and engage them in the forest conservation effort. In  addition, students joined the Company staff in taking the saplings to Phu Long Forest and  offering robes to monks to raise funds to monitor the Phu Long Forest area and Mahawan  Forest Temple in Chaiyaphum, where two revered monks (Kham Khian Suwanno and Paisarn  Wisalo) are the abbots.       5.3 Mobile Families: Sapling Planting, Phu Long Reforestation, Chaiyaphum, Year 2       The Company and its neighbors participated in a Mobile Families activity entitled Sapling  Planting, Phu Long Reforestation, Chaiyaphum as an extension of the Sapling Planting  project to restore the forest area (the origin of Lam Pathao River) for wildlife and the  nearby community. This time, more than 13 rai was reforested.      5.4 Public Park in Honor of HM the King on his 84th Birthday Anniversary        In collaboration with the Ministry of Defence, the Company organized a planting activity in  the Public Park in Honor of HM the King on his 84th Birthday Anniversary in the housing  compound of the Secretariat Department, Ministry of Defence. The Company staff and  military officers residing there jointly created more green areas on World Environment Day  by planting over 500 trees.

This year, members of the One Family  project and those of the Company expanded their network to others to help society and provide  support to organizations that take care of the less-privileged. Volunteers took blind children to  Wat Plai Na in Pathum Thani, where both the volunteers and the children learned dharma and  jointly cleaned the temple area. They also knitted crochet caps and donated them to Priest  Hospital for further distribution to temples in the North and Northeast to help monks fight the  cold. Their knitting work was carried on and more crochet caps were donated to more people-an  activity that brought joy to each giver and receiver.           7. Economy       The Company continued to provide income to the communities around its refinery by ordering  food, sweets and drinks for its assorted activities and hired local people to deliver Khrop Khrua  Bai Mai bulletins to the refinerys neighboring residents.

Education    1.1 2011 Thailand Go Green Competition under the Topic of Solar Energy for Future       This continued program identifies a youth hero in renewable energy, who will win a trophy  from HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn and a scholarship worth over Baht 2 million  together with an educational trip to China. The project encourages students to find out  information about solar energy and its applications as an alternative energy in our daily life,  both at present and in the future. The project communicator using the Nong Sunny  Bangchak pseudonym passed on his knowledge to schools and communities through  activities like a drawing to encourage the use of solar power and an exhibition to publicize  solar power innovation at schools. Cumulative information through the past four years will  drive Thailand Go Green. Over 2.5 million students have learned about alternative energy,  and the figure is believed to go up to 3.4 million from more than 2,500 schools in 2011.        1.2 BCP Talent Internship Program       The Company organizes a summer training program every year to provide an opportunity for  students to gain real-life experience. The project prepares students to take social  responsibility while building a network among students from various schools.

Volunteer BCP staff take turns canvassing fresh markets to give out   85    Sustainability Report 2011 55 52 53 2009 2010 2011 information and buy used cooking oil on Saturdays and Sundays. The campaign, now in its fifth  year, raises awareness among vendors and the general public of the need to conserve the  environment and take care of ones health by selling used cooking oil to the Company to turn it  into biodiesel instead of throwing them in to the river, in order to reduce reusing used cooking oil.    2. Economy    2.1 Cooperative Service Stations       Conceived from the oil for rice idea of sharing basic necessities, the Cooperative Service  Station Project started at Si Prachan Cooperatives, Amphoe Si Prachan, Suphan Buri. Today,  the Company donates rice in its Lunch Project at schools surrounding the refinery, while  cooperatives sell low-priced oil to its members (a discount of Baht 0.5/litre). Built on the  mutual trust between the Company and the community, the collaboration has now  blossomed into a modern business with the opening of a standard cooperative service  station and, later, a community service station. This business model is based on a mutual  support culture that will strengthen community ties while forming a network of Thai-owned  businesses. Besides economic gains, the project builds a strong community, in which  peoples potential is developed to help them stand on their own feet. There are so far more  than 500 cooperative service stations, creating an overall income and a cash flow of more  than Baht 3,500 million/year for participating communities. These stations registered a  collective sales volume of over 53 million litres/month, equivalent to 25% of the total  volume sold through Bangchak stations across the country.  Collective  sales volume  sold through  Cooperative  Service Stations  (million litres/  month)   86    The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited Disaster Preparedness  Guidebook for Thais  Survival Bags and Drinking Water  Distrbution  Nong Bangchak  Sharing Project       2.2  Promotion of Community Products       Bangchak runs sales promotional campaigns at its retail stations differently from other oil  brands by continuously promoting community products from the provinces to promote local  jobs, while communities may become more self-reliant with the sufficiency economy.  This  year, 500,000 packets of rice cracker topped with black sesame from the Kham Sakae  Saeng agricultural housewife group and the Seng Si Thong Community Enterprise in Nakhon  Ratchasima, together with 600,000 packets of Doi Kham dried mango from Chiang Mai,  Chiang Rai and Sakon Nakhon-worth altogether almost 6 million baht-generated considerable  income for the communities.    3. The Environment    Since the beginning of the year, Thailand has encountered a series of natural disasters-especially  floods in northern provinces, the central plains, and southern provinces-which lasted long enough  to harm lives and properties, with consequent economic, social and environmental impacts.  The  Company has been dealing with ranging from fostering pre-disaster awareness, providing relief  during the disaster to arranging rehabilitation after the disaster, as detailed below:       1. Preparedness:  Bangchak values the provision of knowledge and useful information for the  general public to prepare themselves for disasters.  The public will have a proper  understanding of climate change, as well as global warming and their consequences,  especially floods, which are now very relevant to Thailand.  This year, the Company  organized a seminar on Thailands Natural Disasters, Worlds Natural Disasters:  Our State of  Unreadiness, where it became clear that most Thais are not alert for disasters and possess  little information.  As a result, the Company produced 400,000 free copies of handbooks for  Thai people to deal with disasters, written in both Thai and English, for distribution to  interested people.  Information appearing in the handbook is also uploaded onto Facebook  and the Company website.          87    Sustainability Report 2011    	     Bangchaks environmental forte together with community knowledge  and strengths:  perfect combination driving community capability to  no-waste community prototype   Bang Nam Phueng, a tiny community, possesses tremendous social capital.   As for the environment, the tambon administrative organization (TAO) and  local residents joined Bangchak Petroleum under the Sustainable Garbage  Classification for a No-waste Community Project by supplying tools and  creatively building on knowledge for human and environmental development for  the community.  This is achieved by integrating Bangchaks environmental forte  with local wisdom in undertaking common activities.  Our aim is to develop  immunity while solving the communitys fundamental problems of garbage  management, thus leading to an approach where the community may achieve  sustainable development. This sparks collaboration from all quarters in forging  volunteer minds among the community to work together for the stewardship of  the environment and society to make ours a nicer place to live.   Despite rather drastic changes to social and environmental conditions, Bang  Nam Phueng residents have managed to live their lives admirably.

During the Disaster:  Thanks to excellent cooperation from staff, Bangchak managed to get through the flood  crisis, which lasted from August to November.  To help victims, the Company distributed 20,000 survival kits,  sent mobile service stations to disaster-hit areas and sold petrol at one baht/litre cheaper and, in cooperation  with the Metropolitan Water Works Authority, transported water into disaster-hit areas to provide clean water  for peoples consumption.          3. Rehabilitation:  Bangchak initiated the Nong Bangchak Pan Namjai project (Youths Sharing Project), in  which it welcomed employees, volunteers and people who were between jobs as a result of flood-induced  unemployment to restore flooded houses and public places, such as schools, in 10 Bangkok districts.
