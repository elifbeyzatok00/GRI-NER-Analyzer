responsibility  that places an emphasis on innovation as the means to add  value, not just to the bottom line, but to the environment  and humanity at large.  –William A. Linton, CEO Promega Corporation For nearly 35 years, Promega has embraced the values of corporate responsibility  and sustainable business practices. Our ability to develop and deliver high quality  products to the Life Sciences industry is reliant on a sustainable connection  between our people, the natural environment and the communities in which we  work.  Promega is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen. We are proud to  create products and solutions that assist scientists in addressing some of the most  significant challenges in global health and wellness. We also are active in and  support our communities in the areas of education, community wellness and the  arts. At Promega we acknowledge that while sustained business growth will  support communities economically, to be a responsible corporate citizen   we must bridge science, ethics, community and the natural environment in   which we live. Commitment to Quality Promega Madison first certified to international standards for  quality management systems in 1988. Currently, 15 Promega  locations worldwide have certified to various ISO standards.  4 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 As the world becomes progressively interde- pendent and fragile, we stand at a vital  moment in Earths history, a time when the  human culture must consciously choose its  future.  In this ever changing world natural  resources are vulnerable and finite. We need  to look to the lessons provided by nature to  secure a sustainable future. Organisms never  stop innovating and evolving to adapt to  changing habitats, all the while still managing  to preserve the environment that maintains  them. As human populations grow, so do the resource demands  imposed on ecosystems. Humanity is yet another complex species in  this world and we must endeavor to create a harmonic balance between  nature and civilization.  Nature provides a host of insight and understanding in how best to  create a balance. Our challenge is tapping into this incredible opportu- nity. For instance, learning from the adaptations of organisms that are  capable of surviving extreme, severe conditions may help us design  vaccines and drugs that can sustain potency longer to reach remote  locations. Potential like this suggests we need to look to nature for  solutions as well as preserve natures knowledge for future generations  to build upon our work. At Promega, we have a vision of corporate responsibility that places an  emphasis on innovation as the means to add value, not just to the  bottom line, but to the environment and humanity at large. Through  increased awareness, we are becoming more sensitive to the principles  of sustainability found in biological and ecological systems and gradu- ally evolving to include them in everyday business practices. We con- tinue to utilize lessons of the natural world to solve scientific challenges  in life sciences.  As Albert Einstein said, We cant solve problems by using the same kind  of thinking we used when we created them. We must preserve and  utilize natures genius so that humanity can apply ideas of the mind to  create a more sustainable global society. William A. Linton, Chairman and CEO Not only must we look to nature   to solve todays complex challenges,  we must also preserve this   knowledge for future generations  to build upon our work.  5 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Overview Promega Corporation is the largest privately held life sciences company in the  world, with corporate headquarters located in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. Promega  has a large global presence including branch offices in 15 different countries as  well as manufacturing facilities in San Luis Obispo and Sunnyvale, California, USA;  Shanghai, China; and Seoul, South Korea.

With global implementation,  Promega will have a fully integrated efficient system to allow continued growth.   All these investments poise Promega for sustainable success far into the future. CGMP Manufacturing Building Last year, ground was broken at the Madison   campus on a state of the art CGMP   manufacturing facility. Corporate mind  6 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Headquarters Manufacturing Facilies Branch Oce Distributors Promega Worldwide Locations: With branch offices in 15 countries and more than  50 global distributors Promega works to support scientists worldwide. Promega Governance  Promega is governed by a Board of Directors, the Corporate Leadership Team and  a number of global Branch Managers. As the guiding force of the company, these  groups are responsible for setting company strategy and providing organizational  oversight. This group in total comprises 31 individuals; 23% of them are women.  Corporate Values Promega Corporate Mission Statement: To provide the most innovative biological  reagents and integrated systems used in research and applied technology world- wide. In carrying out our mission, we strive to preserve and pursue these core values:   Honesty, integrity and respect for all employees, customers and suppliers   Open access to information for all employees   Balance of work and life activities   Recognition and reward of achievement through creativity, risk taking, process  improvements and innovation   Adaptability and flexibility in the workplace   Contribution to the advancement of science and to the improvement of life in  the world community  Promega is an equal opportunity employer and is richly benefited by the diversity  of its workforce. We follow a global code of conduct, and employees are remind- ed annually of this commitment. This code of conduct is also always available and  accessible on the corporate intranet site and can be read in detail there.  Corporate Vision Promega Corporation is built on a vision where:   Innovative research tools accelerate scientific discovery   Life science research can lead to the cure and prevention of many diseases   The work environment nurtures creativity   The corporation appreciates and values the contributions of each employee  7 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Creative Approach Although meticulous and rational, scientists must also maintain imagination in  their work if they are to discover the mysteries of the unknown. In response to  the needs of such individualists, we have a long and creative tradition of doing  what is best versus what is expected. That independent spirit and determination  has led to a number of firsts that continue for Promega in each of its multiple  roles as a business, a member of the community and an employer.  Today, Promega is the largest privately held life science company in the world, an  accomplishment of which we are very proud. In an environment where acquisi- tion is the norm, we have maintained independence and instead forged selective,  global partnerships.  An example of this is the collaboration between Promega  and the experts in mass spectrometry at MS Bioworks.  This partnership provides  researchers access to a complete workflow solution, by providing unique pro- teomic reagents coupled with mass spectrometry services.   Supply Chain Management Promega values suppliers of goods and services that adhere to the highest social,  ethical and environmental standards. In 2011, Promega took the first step in expanding the reach of Corporate Respon- sibility by surveying our key suppliers to understand their social and environmen- tal commitments. A survey was sent to quantify the number of vendors with  formal programs, their key areas of focus, and to identify contacts within each  organization. Of the vendors that responded to our survey, over 50% have  Sustainability or Corporate Responsibility programs established or in develop- ment.  Promega recognizes the impact and importance that our suppliers have in the  scope of our Corporate Responsibility and strives to work with companies that  have similar commitments. Sourcing from local suppliers is also a focus to support  local communities and reduce impacts from shipping. Promega acknowledges the opportunity to reduce impacts through our global  supply chain. In the coming year we will start collaborating with key suppliers to  identify ways to improve our impacts and add mutual business value.       Leadership Innovation Integration Continuous Improvement Compliance Meeting requirements  What you measure will improve  Throughout business processes  Paradigm Shift  Promega embraces the values of corporate responsibility through all aspects of  operations and supply chain and strives toward leadership.  8 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Molecular biology opens doors not only to new understand- ing of life, but to practical applications that enhance the  health of our citizens. -CEO Bill Linton Overview Behind every new research advance and medical innovation there is an array of  products and services that support the work of the researchers and clinicians  involved. The role of Promega products in life science, clinical and forensics  science research is evidenced by the thousands of peer-reviewed publications  citing use of these products. The areas in which Promega products contribute to  the advancement of science include basic research, drug discovery, forensic and  paternity testing and molecular diagnostics.

These scientists seek to apply this knowledge in preventing disease,  finding new cures and understanding the natural world.  The HaloTag Mammalian Protein Purification System overcomes prob- lems scientists experience while purifying genetically engineered fusion proteins.  Researchers improve the recovery of difficult-to-express proteins, resulting in a  tag-free protein ready for mass spectrometry analysis.  Drug Discovery Biotechnology and pharmaceutical labs need tools to screen tens of thousands of  compounds only to identify a handful of potential new drug candidates. These  industrial researchers look for tools to shorten their product development cycles  and reduce costs by weeding out undesirable drug characteristics (e.g., toxicity)  sooner.  The new Mitochondrial ToxGlo Assay measures multiple biomarkers to  differentiate mitochondrial toxicity from other types of toxicity. Promegas  portfolio of mechanistic toxicity assays, which now includes the Mitochondrial  ToxGlo Assay, helps researchers assess a drug candidates toxicity profile, making  it a valuable, predictive and cost-effective set of tools for drug discovery. Forensics and Paternity Testing DNA analysts create genetic profiles (DNA typing) to identify both victims and  suspects during a criminal investigation. These same tools are applied in deter- mining paternity and other familial relationships needed to identify victims of  natural disasters.   The PowerPlex family of STR (Short Tandem Repeat) products use rapid  PCR technology to save time with every run. Amplification can be completed in  about 90 minutes, making forensic and paternity laboratories more efficient and  productive. Molecular Diagnostics Medical technicians and clinical pathologists prepare DNA samples before  performing diagnostic tests for organ transplants, infectious diseases and genetic  screening.   The Maxwell CSC is the next-generation, bench-top automation system  for rapid nucleic acid isolation.  It will be Promegas first instrument manufactured  under CGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practices), offering clinical customers  and partners a high-quality, regulatory-compliant alternative to their current  extraction methods.  10 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Promega in the Real World   Joplin Tornado Tragedy A devastating tornado hit Joplin, Missouri, USA, killing 134 people and leaving  many missing. With the use of DNA IQ, PowerPlex 16 and PowerPlex Y,  analysts were able to identify victims. Lab workers commented we appreciated  your products; they really came through during this very trying time. This lab  generated over 200 DNA profiles that helped bring closure to families who had  lost loved ones. Genetics of Taste Lab Central at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science is researching a gene  called Taster 38, which determines whether an individual can taste a particular  bitter substance. The lab is asking if the differences in the way individuals taste  affect food choices, with possible implications on health and lifestyle.  Volunteer Citizen Scientists work in the lab on the Genetics of Taste project.  Visitors to the museum can enroll into the project by completing a few steps  including providing a DNA sample. The Citizen Scientists use the Maxwell 16 to  purify DNA rapidly. The Maxwell 16 provides ease of use and streamlined results  for the lab. Lab Centrals goal is to bring awareness to the public to help people make  healthier life style choices. This lab generated over 200 DNA  profiles that helped bring closure to  families who had lost loved ones.  11 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Investments for the Future With significant dedication to research and development, Promega scientists  create ground breaking technologies to support increasingly complex scientific  experiments and methods. In 2011, over $30 million (US) was invested in research  and development, and 69 new patent applications were filed. Because of contin- ued global investment in research and development Promega has extensive  intellectual property.  In addition to developing our own intellectual property, Promega works with  academic institutions and other entities to license and develop promising tech- nologies. As a member of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation Research  Tool Subscription Program, Promega has the opportunity to take a first look at  new technologies from the university.  New Facility Under Construction to Support Regulated Product   Manufacturing Promega broke ground on August 25th, 2011 for a Current Good Manufacturing  Practice (CGMP) facility dedicated to accommodate business growth and its  customers who need FDA-regulated molecular biology products. These include  components such as sample preparation systems and reagents that are part of  diagnostic and medical tests sold by human diagnostic test providers. Plans incorporate a number of environmentally sensitive construction practices.  Some of those practices include geothermal heating and cooling, dark sky  compliant lighting, prairie restoration, bio retention ponds for storm water run off,  electric vehicle charging stations, and a living wall. The living wall uses vegetation  as living art inside the building to improve indoor air quality, keep the building  cool, and dampen noise pollution. Design of the building used firms with exper- tise in sustainable building practices and construction practices that recycle 99%  of construction waste. The 260,000 square feet facility will employ  100 people in the next five years. Most of  the building will be dedicated to manufactur- ing with committed (fixed) production lines  and flexible manufacturing areas. The  building will also have a customer experience  center for employees and guests that will  include spaces for training, laboratory  demonstrations, conferences, an exercise  and fitness center, and dining. Quality Process & Product Promega is continuously striving to hold operations to higher standards by  seeking external verification and certification of internal systems. Promega  Madison was first certified to international standards for quality management  systems in 1998 and is currently certified to the ISO13485 standard, required for  the development, manufacture, testing and delivery of medical devices around  the world. Just recently, Promegas European distribution headquarters, Euro Hub,  earned ISO13485 certification, increasing the total to 15 Promega locations  certified worldwide to various ISO standards. The ISO series of quality manage- ment system standards are developed and maintained by the International  Organization for Standardization. In addition, European branches are registered to  sell certain IVD devices in their territories.  Promega takes great pride in the products it produces and in ensuring customers  receive safety data, as well as comprehensive technical data sheets on the use of  Promega products.

As Promega continues on this journey, we are increasingly aware of the principles  found in biological and ecological systems that can gradually be mirrored in our  business. Promega acknowledges the importance of using resources more  efficiently and mitigating waste.   All Promega locations worldwide are committed to operating sustainably by  investing time and resources in improving energy efficiency, working to reduce  waste, and enhance the consciousness of impacts. Additionally, all Promega  locations recognize the opportunities to leave a positive legacy. Whether it is  funding reforestation efforts, supporting renewable energy generation, purchas- ing carbon offsets, or supporting environmental organizations, Promega looks  beyond our buildings to enact the principles of environmental sustainability. The chief lesson of natural history is that life has learned  the art of sustainability and that this art has stood the test  of time. It is an art, moreover, that can be learned, adapted  and put into conscious practice by us.—Bill Linton  13 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 In 2011 Promega made strides to reduce environ- mental impacts through focus on company-wide  operational efficiencies and environmental aware- ness campaigns.  All employees at Promega are  essential to our sustainability progress, and we  promote environmentally conscious decision  making on a daily basis through ongoing awareness  and education. Promega is proud to announce that  we are on target to achieve our 2014 reduction  goals in all six key indicators for environmental  sustainability. This progress is thanks to focus and consciousness of many indi- viduals worldwide committed to continuous improvement. Growth brings new  opportunities and challenges to operating in an environmentally sensitive manner  but Promega is committed to looking for opportunities to design, build, and  operate in a sustainable manner. Responding to Climate Change Appreciating the threats of climate change, Promega is striving to achieve a better  understanding of and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions at all levels of the  business operation. Promega actively tracks and strives to reduce direct emissions  from fuel combustion and  indirect emissions from  purchased electricity,  business travel and outgoing  distribution. Because of  improved awareness and  focused action since 2008,  Promega greenhouse gas  emissions have decreased  17% as indexed to revenue.  In the face of a head count  increase of 7% and addition  of multiple new buildings,  gross carbon footprint was  held to a 3.6% increase over  2010.   Energy Consumption With investments in time and resources to  improving efficiency, overall energy use was  held constant despite significant growth in  head count and the addition of new  facilities in 2011. Energy is a primary focus  for all Promega employees from facilities  managers to scientists as we recognize the  opportunity to do more with less.  Energy  use remains the largest contributor to  Promega greenhouse gas emissions. Electricity Electricity is the largest single contributor to the Promega carbon footprint and  accounts for 53% of our overall emissions. The Promega approach to minimize  impacts from energy is two-pronged.  First we focus on reducing actual energy  usage through improved efficiencies and facility optimization whenever possible.  Secondly, we also work to generate electricity or purchase it from renewable  sources. With significant focus on both these areas, emissions from electricity  decreased by 35 tons last year or an 8% reduction indexed to revenue.   We have placed a significant  focus on improving efficiency  and increasing employee  awareness at all global loca- tions with a primary focus at  corporate headquarters in  Madison, Wisconsin, where  over 90% of total global  electricity is consumed. In  2011, significant attention was  placed on enhancing the  efficiency of heating, ventila- tion, and air conditioning  systems because these operations are primary consumers of energy.    Replacing variable frequency drives on boilers at the Agora building allowed us  to reduce the previous requirement of three boilers to one.   Enhancements to chiller filters and motor replacements at the Agora building  will enable running one chiller instead of 2 chillers during peak periods and  could allow for just fan usage during winter months.  10623MA 78 100 89 87 Global Carbon Footprint Tons of C02 GOAL 2014 2011 2008 9 87 83 Indexed  to Revenue 4.7% Reduction 0 5,000 20,000 25,000 15,000 10,000 10573MA 395 506 468 430 Global Energy Usage Million BTUs of Gross 2011 2008 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000  ELECTRICITY            NATURAL GAS  Indexed  to Revenue 7.9% Reduction 2011 Global Carbon Footprint Electrical Usage Natural Gas Air Travel Automobile Travel Paper Distribution  14 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011   Installation of a more efficient motor on a cooling tower at our primary manu- facturing facility will further improve the efficiency of our air conditioning  systems.   New filters on an intake plenum at our primary R&D facility will improve air flow  and reduce energy requirements   Addition of infrared heating to roof top units will eliminate snow build up also  improving air flow for improved efficiencies. In 2012 Promega will continue to invest in new technology to reduce our energy  usage through:   Addition of a building automation system will allow for intelligent controlling of  mechanical equipment and lighting to eliminate wasted energy    PC Power management software to automatically power down workstations  during off-peak hours   Further enhancement to air handling systems In addition to projects to improve energy efficiency, efforts have been made at all  locations to increase the awareness on ways employees can reduce usage.  A new  campaign was launched globally in 2011 to remind employees to take simple  steps each to reduce their energy usage and environmental impacts. Promega branches continue to reduce energy usage as well:   Promega Euro Hub in Germany is transitioning to newer neon lighting in the  warehouse and replacing freezers with more efficient models.   Promega Singapore in 2011 implemented a new policy to shut off lights and  electronics during off-peak hours and lunches.   Promega Shanghai is another location recently adopting policies to reduce  energy usage from heating and cooling.   Promega France recently installed a new air conditioning system equipped with  a heat pump to replace the gas-based heating during mildly cold periods. In 2011, adoption of renewable energy use continued to increase. Promega  recognizes that using renewable energy eliminates greenhouse gas emissions that  otherwise would have been emitted during energy production.   The 250 photovoltaic panels on the Aviation Operations building in Madison,  Wisconsin, have generated over 110,000 kWh to date avoiding over 60 tons of  CO2 generation. To see the current production of this system, please visit this  live dashboard.   –  Any additional energy needs at this facility come from 100% renewable  energy sources.     Branch locations throughout the world continue to switch to 100% renewable  energy sources: –  Promega Euro Hub in Mannheim, Germany, September 2011 –  Promega Brazil in Sao Paulo, since opening in 2011 –  Promega Italia in Milan, November 2010 –  Promega Biotech Ibrica in Alcobendas, Spain since 2008 –  Promega Biotech AB in Stockholm, Sweden since opening in 2007 Promega is committed to investing in training specifically related to energy  efficiency and renewable energy. A number of facilities specialists in the head- quarters have been trained in energy efficiency through Wisconsins Focus on  Energy and help lead efforts to identify opportunities for improvements. The solar array on the Promega Aviations Hangar is one of the largest statewide.  15 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Natural Gas Natural gas is the largest source of direct air emissions and second in overall  emissions for Promega. Natural gas is used primarily at our manufacturing sites  for heating and production related processes but some branch offices use natural  gas. Through equipment improvements and better management of our heating  requirements, dependency on this resource decreased substantially during times  of growth. Since 2008, natural gas usage has decreased 25% indexed to revenue.  To reduce further impacts from natural gas use, Promega is investing in upgrades  to our equipment and looking to use renewable energy for air and water heating.   Geothermal heating and cooling continues to minimize the natural gas depen- dency of the Aviation Operations building in Madison, Wisconsin.  Direct air emissions outlined below are from fuel purchased for heating and emer- gency generators in North America. All of these emissions are below threshold  levels set by local and federal organizations. We continue to evaluate options to  further reduce direct emissions globally.  Distribution Much effort is invested to ensure  that our products get to customers  quickly and safely. We have also  focused on reducing air emissions  by using more efficient modes of  transport when possible and  reducing the weight of packaging  materials. Because of product  requirements for temperature  regulation and customer expecta- tions, roughly 90% of our ship- ments are sent via air. Our logistics  teams continue to be committed to  finding ways to reduce emissions  from distribution while assuring  the same high level of service to  our customers. To understand the indirect emissions  from outgoing shipments, data was  collected from Promega owned  global distribution hubs on weight,  distance, and mode of transporta- tion in 2011. In previous years where  data was unavailable emissions  related to outgoing logistics have  been estimated according to  revenue growth.       10625MA 2008 Emissions from Natural Gas 2011 2014 16 15 13 12 13 Tons of CO2 GOAL Indexed  to Revenue 7% Reduction 0 2,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 6,000 4,000 10576MA Distribution Emissions by Region Americas Europe Pac Asia Table 1.

Helix Smart capabilities  provide real-time product monitoring and manages Helix inventory based on  product usage to provide consolidated bulk replenishment shipments. This  enables more products to be sent with less shipping and materials. The automat- ed Helix inventory management system not only ensures uninterrupted supplies,  but consolidates shipments to ensure uninterrupted workflow for our customers  while having less impact on our planet.  Contributing to protect our environment and have  a positive impact on society, Promega continues a  campaign started in 2010 by purchasing carbon  credits to offset the greenhouse gas emissions from  energy use of all Helix units. In addition, emissions  from initial unit shipment and product distribution through this channel are also  offset. In 2011, Helix offset over 470 tons of emissions worldwide by supporting  the following projects:    Dalaman Hydro Power, Turkey    Zanghbei Wind, Hebei Province, China   Reforestation in North America    Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana   Lower Mississippi Valley Reforestation To see more information and learn how to participate,   visit: www.promega.com/helix  Business Travel As a global company, travel is  essential to building strong  customer relations and general  business operations. Reducing  travel to customer sites is difficult,  but with the availability of video  conferencing Promega is working to  reduce our travel emissions.  Business travel via air, automobile,  and rail make up about 12% of the  Promega current carbon footprint.  Air Travel Since 2008 global air travel emis- sions have been one of the most  significant challenges for Promega.  During this period emissions have  increased by 40% per revenue due  to emphasis on growth globally and  the addition of the Promega  Aviation Operations program in  2010.  The Promega Aviation Opera- tions Program provides unique  opportunities for development of  stronger connections with customers and collaborators as well as supporting  global operations internally.  Promega branches are dedicated to using efficient  high-speed rail in lieu of air travel to reduce carbon emissions whenever possible.   Because of its efficiency, rail travel contributes only a small portion to our carbon  footprint from travel. When travel is necessary, efforts are made to use the most  fuel efficient mode. 10630MA 10.5  8.0  7.2  9.5  Business Travel Carbon Footprint 2011 2008 Tons of Carbon Dioxide Emissions AIR AUTO RAIL 0 500 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 1,000 Table 2.

Promega Benelux, Promega AG in Switzerland, and Promega KK in Japan are just a  few of the locations to move to more efficient and ecologically sound fleets.    In the United States, enrollment in Emkays GoGreen fleets program enables  increased use of hybrids and other high-efficiency vehicles. As part of this  program, we plant trees each year to offset any unavoidable greenhouse gas  emissions generated from Promega fleet travel in the United States. Since our  enrollment in 2009, Promega has offset over  700 tons of CO2 as members of the  Go Green program.   To reduce the environmental impact of employee commuting, alternate transpor- tation programs have been implemented in a number of locations worldwide. The  goal is to encourage use of public transportation, ride sharing or biking to work.  To reduce further the impact of employee commuting, staff started an Alterna- tive Transportation Program at Global Headquarters to educate and encourage  employees on more environmentally friendly options for getting to work.   Promega is in the process of installing electric vehicle charging stations to encour- age the use of electric vehicles.  All buildings at corporate headquarters in  Madison have bikes for employees to use  and resources to support cyclists such as  pumps and bike repair kits. Many locations  worldwide have similar programs in place  to encourage employees to bike to work,  use public transport, or ride share.  Promega Biosciences in California and  Promega UK were specific locations that  expanded their programs to encourage  cycling or alternative transportation use by  employees.  Preserving Natural Capital Paper Usage In evaluating paper usage,  Promega strives to embody the  mantra of Reduce, Reuse,  Recycle. Adoption of emerging  media channels has enabled  enhanced communication with our  customers while at the same time  reducing the impact on the  environment. By using iPhone/ iPad and Android applications,  blogs, electronic catalogs or online  support, communications can also be more efficient. In 2008, aggressive commitments were made to move away from printing. With  significant efforts and investment Promega transitioned from most paper cata- logs, instruction manuals, print marketing, and a majority of other corporate  communications to electronic formats. Since 2008 paper usage has decreased  86%.  Additional efforts to reduce paper and impacts from paper include:   Using Recycled Paper and Duplex Printing: Many global locations have transi- tioned to recycled paper and duplex printing. These efforts provide value to the  environment by reducing air emissions, combating deforestation, and limiting  waste.  –  Promega Italia enrolled in a campaign in 2010 with the Portucel Soporcel  group where purchasing recycled paper also enables the planting of trees to  improve biodiversity in the region.  To date over 275 trees have been planted  in Portugal on behalf of Promega Italia.  Electronic documents: –  Field Application Specialists in North America along with branches such as  Promega UK have adopted iPads in order to serve customers while   eliminating the use of printed resources. –  In August 2010, Promega started sending electronic copies of various docu- ments to customers resulting in a savings of over 5,000 pieces of paper a  month since.  –  European branches offer electronic invoices as another way to reduce  unnecessary printing and paper usage.

For the first time since tracking global waste and recycling,  Promega is recycling more than we are sending to the landfill.  Since 2008,  recycling efforts globally have increased by 31% as a result of improved awareness  and convenience for recycling at all Promega locations.  Since founding our  Corporate Responsibility program waste is down 3% as indexed to revenue.  Key areas of focus that have contributed to waste reduction include:   Communication campaigns to increase awareness and understanding of what  can be recycled.   Looking at our waste stream to identify materials that can be segregated and  handled more responsibly. –  In 2011, over 4,400 ft3 of pipette tip boxes were recycled that would have  previously been sent to the landfill. These plastic boxes could fill an entire   semi trailer.   Use of permanent ware, compostable and recyclable materials in cafeterias and  kitchenettes: –  Reusable tumblers were provided to all Promega employees worldwide. –  Polystyrene materials have been removed and replaced with recyclable or  compostable alternatives at corporate headquarters.   In 2011 Promega Biosystems in California was certified as a Green Business by  Santa Clara County for their ongoing efforts around sustainability. Significant  focus was placed on waste and recycling last year with a formal audit identifying  additional waste streams to be minimized.  In 2012, Promega Biosciences   will be initiating a composting program that will further reduce waste being sent  to the landfill. Being in the biotech industry, manufacturing processes often require work with  potentially hazardous substances. Promega takes the responsibility that comes  with the use of these products seriously as well as the obligation to reduce waste  while ensuring that, at the end of their life, these products are disposed of  responsibly. As a result of focus on efficiency, Promega has seen a 10% reduction  in waste as indexed to revenue. Promega recognizes the value of absolute  reduction in waste stream and will continue to regularly analyze hazardous waste  reduction opportunities.  10628MA 437 Cubic Feet  Waste / Recycling Per Revenue 2011 2008 Global Non-Hazardous Waste 2014 GOAL 406 534 496 451 More Recycling Than to Landfill 0 20,000 120,000 140,000 80,000 100,000 60,000 40,000 10579MA 660 622 685 Global Hazardous Waste 2011 2008 590 Pounds of Waste Per Million in Revenue   BIOLOGICAL CHEMICAL Reduction 13% 44 43 37 35 In 2011, more waste was recycled  than sent to landfills.  19 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Water Usage Promega recognizes the value water provides to all life on this planet and the fact  that billions of people each year go without clean water. Many Promega locations  worldwide incorporate design features to minimize water use and insure proper  disposal of water. The corporate park of offices in Sydney, Australia, uses rain  water collected for cleaning, toilets, and irrigation of plants. Similarly, our Madi- son-based global headquarters building uses rainwater collection, allowing runoff  to drain to prairie and rain gardens for natural filtration. Promega is committed to responsible water use from all sources whether used in  manufacturing processes, landscaping, or daily office activity. With the increase in  water-intensive manufacturing processes since 2010, reduction in water usage  poses an ongoing challenge. In 2011, Promega realized a 4% reduction in water  usage when indexed to revenue as a result of ongoing diligence and new efforts.  Promega Biosciences Green Team in San Luis Obispo, CA made significant steps  to reduce water usage in 2011 primarily through an optimized irrigation schedule  and implementation of a water recirculating system for distilled water units. In the  new system condensing water is re-used rather than sent down the sewer. Over  the last year water usage  is down 30% saving over  250,000 gallons of water. Promega Biosystems in  Sunnyvale, CA, also  continues to look to  reduce water use through  low-flow aerators on every  sink and a new dishwasher  that is more water and  energy efficient. 10629MA 55.7 63.3 63.8 61.1 2008 Global Water Usage 57.5 GOAL 2011 2014 63.8 61 6 0 5,000,000 15,000,000 200,000,000 10,000,000 Indexed  to Revenue 4% Reduction Gallons of Water  20 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Packaging Packaging serves many functions for our products, but it also is a primary con- sumer of raw materials.  Promega recognizes the impact of our packaging and is  committed to searching for innovative ways to reduce packaging, use environmen- tally friendly materials, and design for recycling or reuse.   One recent step to improve our impacts was moving to unbleached shipping  boxes.  This step has been completed at all global logistics hubs to avoid the  harmful environmental impacts of bleaching corrugate. Unbleached corrugate  uses less virgin wood, less energy, and produces fewer waste and air emissions  than bleached corrugate. For shipments out of North America we were also able  to use Sustainable Forestry Initiative materials to minimize impacts further.  To take this initiative even further a team of individuals at our Corporate Head- quarters set out to look for an alternative to the wax coating on some of our  boxes.  While initial testing was unsuccessful we are currently working with other  resources outside of Promega to identify a solution. This change will allow  shipping boxes, which were not previously recyclable due to wax coating, to be  recycled.  These recent strides follow a long history of efforts to reduce the  impacts of packaging such as:   Funding a program for over 20 years enabling customers to return Styrofoam  containers for reuse to minimize waste in landfills. In 2011, over 14,000   polystyrene containers were recycled and re-used.   In 2012, Promega partnered with the Packaging Engineering Department at the  California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo to identify ways to imple- ment more sustainable packaging and maintaining quality during transport. Capturing environmental impacts of product and shipment packaging continues to  be challenging. Maintaining the critical need to adequately protect products while  minimizing the use of packaging is a delicate task. An initial cost analysis indicated  that plastic encompasses about half of the packaging purchases yet corrugate for  shipping, as well as paperboard used in product packaging, represent our best  opportunity for reducing environmental impact. Following transition to a new ERP  we will have richer data allowing for quantification of the amount of materials  used, providing the ability to develop a comprehensive packaging impact baseline. 2011 Packaging Breakdown by Spend 10645MA Plastics Aluminum Paper Polystyrene Corrugated Paperboard Glass Labels  21 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 People care Overview At Promega, we know that hard work, creativity, and passion drive success and  employee satisfaction.

To encourage irregular  riders, a bike event was held providing healthy  snacks promoting the Wisconsin Bike Challenge.   Over 40 Promega employees participated in the  2011 Wisconsin Bike Challenge. Cycling is  encouraged globally as a way to promote health  and wellbeing while also being environmentally  conscious. To support cyclists, bike racks and  repair kits are available at every building in  Madison and at several locations globally.    –  In May 2011, Promega Biosciences employees  in San Luis Obispo, CA, participated in the  regional Bike Month Challenge riding over  1,000 miles during the month of May.  Promega Biosciences is a Bike Friendly  Business that supports the local Bicycle  Coalition, providing workplace bikes for  employees to use, and by offering bike safety  seminars for employees.  –  Promega UK is another location with a Cycle  to Work program to encourage active and  healthy employees. Wellness Campaigns Our Promega Wellness  Team plans a variety of  wellness campaigns for  our company each year.   The campaigns promote  healthy eating, increased  physical activity, support  weight management and  educate employees about  personal health risks.   Some of these programs  are highlighted below.      Know Your Numbers. This two part program was designed to help provide  employees with important insights based on their overall level of healthiness.  The program consists of a health assessment used to gauge the general wellbe- ing of the individual followed by an online health survey concerning the  individuals personal habits such as eating and exercise.    More is Better. This wellness challenge was launched to increase fruit and  vegetable intake. The initiative attracted approximately 20% of our employees.   Ninety-five percent of those who participated indicated that the program  influenced them to make better eating choices.  The Promega Headquarters  offers a cafeteria and vending machines that contain healthy choices to foster  better nutrition at work.   Annual Promega Fun 5K Walk/Run. Each fall Promega sponsors a fun walk/run  for our employees and their families.   –  This year 120 participated, including a group of employees at a conference in  San Antonio, Texas, and our branch in Sunnyvale California.     Holidaze Fitness Craze. 173 employees participated in this 7-week physical  activity program geared to keep people moving throughout the Thanksgiving  through New Years holiday season.  Sixty percent of those who participated  indicated that the program helped them to exercise more. Half of participants  indicated that they had experienced either weight loss, improved BMI or blood  pressure or reduced stress.     Whittle Away the Winter. Our first weight loss challenge drew 53 participants  who lost a combined 80 pounds over the 4 week challenge. The challenge  winner posted a 7-pound weight loss.  24 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Promega values health education and regularly offers programs throughout the  year. In addition to a quarterly wellness newsletter, guest speakers have talked to  employees over the past year on wellness topics such as advanced directives,  nutrition for children, snacking smart, healthy recipes, smoking cessation,  financial planning, stress relief, back care, knowing your pet, and trigger point  therapy. Each year we sponsor a Wellness & Safety Fair in Madison. This year  approximately 30 vendors and 200 employees attended the event.   Employee Advancement Education, Training and Development To match a world that is constantly changing, evolving and advancing, our training  and development programs are designed to keep employees abreast of the latest  technologies, scientific trends and customer needs in order to stay competitive in  the marketplace. Our people determine the quality of our products and services.   Investing in employees is an investment in the future.   To support and empower our management the following training programs were  initiated in 2011:   Coaching for Leaders: This program will continue in  2012 for key leaders and mangers to teach skills to  empower employees, guide powerful coaching  conversations, and provide personalized recogni- tion.     Management Essentials Mini Series: This training  series is designed to help new managers or supervi- sors or those looking to refresh their skill and learn  up-to date approaches.  In 2011, 77 managers  attended at least one session. Globally, we invested over $1,100,000 in continuing education, development, and  training in 2011, a 35% increase over 2010. A significant amount of training is  focused on maintaining our high standards in Quality System Regulated (QSR)  areas. In early 2010, we implemented a robust system to track and manage QSR  training compliance. This has provided automated and just-in-time visibility into  the training status by individual employee as well as by training requirements.

Overview The people of Promega are especially aware of the interconnectedness of life  because they work at a life science company. Its the connection of DNA to a  protein to a cell to a function, to exchange, to growth, to life. So we work to  reinforce and strengthen Promega connections with the community.  Integration is a way of life at Promega. That is why so much of the Promega  campus makes room for the public to participate through community gatherings  and educational events. Its why childcare that started for Promega employees is  also offered to the community. Its why quarterly art exhibits on the campus are  open to and visited by hundreds of community members. And its why some of  the Promega business operates mixed use spaces that include areas for local  businesses to take residence.  In working to make a meaningful contribution to the community each year,  Promega has both established community organizations as well as contributed to  additional groups and initiatives.  Promega chooses to support areas which can,  like life science, foster discovery and enrich our lives. Promega centers most of its  giving around  Community Wellness   Creativity   Education/Knowledge  27 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Education/Knowledge  Promega embraces the perspective that shared knowledge across global networks  ensure that scientists and science can fulfill their potential. Education brings  growth, discovery, and rich context for the future. Each year Promega supports  established educational efforts as well as the individual efforts of Promega  scientists who volunteer to teach throughout the community (over 1,500 hours in  2011) and classes for Promega staff and customers in working with the tools of  molecular biology.   In 2011, nearly 40% of overall philanthropic contributions were geared toward  educational efforts. Initiatives supported by Promega include: AMAZ/Botanical Dimensions Digital Herbarium Project Promega started supporting this key initiative in 2010 to preserve and share the  knowledge of one of the largest extant flora collections in Northern Peru. The  AMAZ/Botanical Dimensions Digital Herbarium Project is a three year effort to  create a digital database of over 100,000 species that had been collected in the  Peruvian Amazon since 1972. Appreciating that 25 percent of medicines today  come from rainforest botanicals, there is a real need to preserve and share the  rich knowledge of the Amazon with scientists working around the globe.  The  information is being databased at the Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia  Peruana (UNAP). Promega locations worldwide strive to support education and create interest in  science. A few examples of efforts in 2011 include:  Promega GMBH in Germany signed on to sponsor the international learning  platform Honey Bee Online Studies (HOBOS) for the next five years.   The project of the University Wuerzburg is centered around a honey bee stock  and designed to stimulate the students urge to research worldwide.    Promega Australia supported The Smith Family Learning for Life Program in  2011 that supports disadvantaged children to develop vital life skills and stay  engaged in education.   Promega Biosciences chemists frequently make presentations at schools and  provide on site tours of the organic chemistry labs and manufacturing facilities  in California.  Promega Training Support Program Appreciating that teachers are always looking for news ideas and the latest  information for their curricula, Promega offers educational resources such as  complementary lectures and lab teaching guides on topics ranging form DNA  purification to emerging infectious diseases.

The BTC Institute has provided educational forums for the public and scientific  thought leaders. These forums are designed to explore the ethical questions around  new discoveries as well as around ancient unanswered questions.   28 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Woods Hollow Childrens Center Promega is a significant supporter  of the Woods Hollow Childrens  Center, which was developed to  provide affordable and vital early  childhood education and care for  the community surrounding our  headquarters in Madison, Wiscon- sin. With gold-standard accredita- tion, Woods Hollow offers a rich experience with diverse curriculum and a setting  that allows children to explore and create. Community Wellness & Giving Promega defines community wellness in a broad sense from strengthening the  physical and mental needs of the individual to addressing a multitude of social  needs in the community.  In support of the diverse interests of Promega employees and the diverse needs  of the community, each year Promega matches employee giving in the annual  United Way and Community Shares campaigns that are offered on the Madison  campus. Similar programs are also offered at Promega branches to encourage  contributions and volunteering:   In California at Promega Biosciences an  employee led Community Action Team  works to support local organizations by  involving employees in fundraising activi- ties, matching donations and encourag- ing volunteering. –  In 2011 funds donated by employees  were matched by Promega Biosciences  to support the Leukemia and Lympho- ma Society and The United Way.     Thanks to the initiative of employees of  the Promega Euro Hub and German  branch in Mannheim a donation fund  was setup in 2011 to help the people of  Somalia with food and medicine.  Employee donations were matched by  Promega Germany.   In 2011, Promega Australia raised funds  to support disadvantaged children  through World Vision Australia, sup- ported Cancer research, and made  contributions to The Red Cross.   Terso team members were also very  active in the Wisconsin community with  volunteering efforts benefiting Habitat  for Humanity in 2011.    Employees at Promega AG in Switzerland   donated to support the Swiss Cancer  Fund in 2011    Promega corporate headquarters also  launched an in-house aluminum can  recycling program to benefit young  adults with special needs in Wisconsin.  AdamCan Recycling is a start-up business  that will enable these young adults to be self-employed and active members of  society.  Since initiation in July 2011, Promega has collected and donated over  318 lb. of aluminum cans. The support received from Promega through contributions, the use of  Promega facilities, and employee involvement are all essential to the  success of the BTC Institute. This relationship between Promega and the  BTC Institute has created an innovative network of collaborations,  resulting in educational value and opportunities for a diverse commu- nity.  For example, last year over 3,000 local middle and high school  students participated in Biotechnology Field Trips.  In addition to biotech- nology workshops for teachers, we provided eight scientific courses that  offer UW-Madison credit and over 600 people attended either our 6th  Annual Wisconsin Stem Cell Symposium or our 10th Annual International  Bioethics Forum.   Karin Borgh, Executive Director BTCI  29 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 Creativity By its very nature, science is an experiment. The need to think of things that dont  exist is simply a part of the job. The ability to think creatively and be comfortable  forming ideas that have no specific roadmap is an important characteristic to  reinforce. As a result, Promega has a long history of supporting creativity within  the company and surrounding community. Quarterly Art Exhibits Quarterly public art exhibits on the Promega campus serve a dual purpose of  sharing the creativity of featured artists while introducing the community to  international perspectives. Throughout the years, exhibits have featured work of  artists from around the world. In 2011, the spring art show featured Bringing the  World Back Home: 50 Years with the Peace Corps. The exhibit honored Peace  Corp volunteers whose service over the past 50 years has affected thousands of  lives in various parts of the world. The art pieces were windows into their  memories and experiences with the overseas communities that welcomed them. Established Creative Venues Promega supports numerous cultural venues in the community such as the  Madison Contemporary Art Museum and the American Players Theatre (APT).  Specifically with the nationally recognized APT, Promega supports the education  program of this Shakespearean theater that travels to schools around the state  bringing new experiences from theater to thousands of students.  Promega has a long history of   supporting creativity within   the company and surrounding   community.  30 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 REPORT PARAMETERS Reporting on Promega Corporate Responsibility progress is completed on a  calendar year basis with information in this report covering January 1, 2011 to  December 31, 2011.  This is the fourth Promega report in this area following the  initial report released in July of 2009.  This process of reporting will continue on  an annual basis.  Corporate Responsibility reporting attempts to focus on the  environmental and social impacts of Promega operations worldwide using the  framework established by the Global Reporting Initiatives G3 Guidelines and the  principles of the United Nations Global Compact.    By establishing a more timely process for gathering information worldwide,  Promega has seen improved accuracy and transparency in its key indicators for  environmental and social impacts. Increases in the scope, materiality, and  comprehensiveness have been experienced,  but Promega recognizes that there is  still significant room for growth. Information has been gathered from all Promega  branches and subsidiaries worldwide, including Promega Brazil added in 2011. In  some instances, additional or more accurate information has been gathered  resulting in variations from reported indicators in previous reports. Estimations  for previous years indicators have been made where information was unavailable  using revenue as a factor. Areas that have not been measured in this report due to lack of current informa- tion are:   Packaging: By implementing a new system for gathering and tracking data,  Promega will have a better understanding of gross packaging material usage   by type and the impacts from these activities.   Staff Commute   Effluents to Water   Supply Chain Analysis Carbon footprint calculations have been made using the emission factors   provided by the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol on energy  and business travel. The reported emissions from distribution were calculated  with the conversion factors provided by Defras 2011 Greenhouse Gas Conversion  Factors. Lastly, the Environmental Defense Fund Paper Calculator  has been used  for calculating the life cycle impacts due to paper usage. Current and previous  years carbon footprints have been calculated using the most updated information  and current emission factors listed above.  31 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 KEY INDICATORS Economic 2008 2009 2010 2011 Revenue (US Dollars)  $220,700,634   $233,172,176   $259,141,868  $284,453,280 Number of Employees  973   1,009   1,117  1,197 Environmental  Energy Consumption: Electricity (kWh)  15,746,424   15,319,804   16,363,009  16,196,690 Natural Gas (Therms)  594,453   581,554   566,038  572,776 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Tons of CO2)  21,119   19,674   20,856  23,509 Emissions Per Million in Revenue (Tons of CO2)  95.7   84.4   80.5  82.6 Water Consumption (Gallons)  14,105,846   13,529,448   16,908,510  17,396,818 Printed Paper (Reams)  117,874   14,179   19,302  9,432 Plain Paper (Reams)  9,758   8,720   8,497  8,626 Solid Non-Hazardous Waste (Cubic Feet)  208,080   210,495   222,894  259,579 Incinerated (Cubic Feet)  6,586   3,981   3,984  6,580 Land filled (Cubic Feet)  109,384   110,689   108,542  117,702 Recycled (Cubic Feet)  92,109   95,825   110,368  135,298 Chemical Waste (Pounds)  145,395   144,449   177,238  167,771 Infectious Waste (Pounds)  9,316   9,431   9,261  9,923 Styrofoam Boxes Returned  16,718   18,172   16,743  14,590  32 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 GRI INDEX The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is the worlds most widely recognized sustainability framework for organizations to use when measuring and reporting on economic,  environmental, and social performance.
