By supporting the Global Compact program we  see the opportunity to make proactive efforts in  the ten principles, and our aim is to make the  Global Compact and its principles part of the  strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of  our company.  Our mission, our strong tradition and position in   wind energy markets, coupled with a highly en- gaged workforce and a deep desire to do the  right thing for our world, puts us in an excellent  position to take on responsibility.     Responsibility for our employees. Responsibility  for the value chain that we are part of. And in the  end responsibility for a better global work envi- ronment.    Tommy G. Jespersen  CEO  kk-electronic is committed to take on the responsibility of being a worldwide   company and live up to the social obligations of that role.                       4    Company profile   kk kk kk kk----electronic a/s electronic a/s electronic a/s electronic a/s is a leading inter- national provider of control system solutions for  wind turbines. The company was founded in  1981 and has since the origin worked with and  developed the capabilities of control systems.  Our merits include the delivery of the first control  system enabling the wind turbine to be grid- connected, the first electronic control system and  the first control and monitoring systems for wind  farms.    Over the years, kk-electronic has been selected  for the most tough and difficult development jobs,  and today offshore wind turbines is one of the  areas where kk-electronics control system com- petences is recognised; more than 40% of the  global offshore wind turbine population relies on  kk-electronics control system to generate wind  energy.     The headquarter in Ikast, Denmark has extensi- ve research and development competences and  prototype and test facilities, supplemented by  sales & marketing, quality and procurement  disciplines, and employs more than 200 specia- lists.      The production takes place in Szczecin, Poland  and in our joint-venture company in Chongqing,  China, kk-Qianwei, with more than 400 em- ployees.  kk-electronic is part of the kk-group, which also  comprises ELOGIC a/s, a manufacturer of distri- bution and control switchboards for industry and  domestic housing.            Innovation Innovation Innovation Innovation  For more than 3 decades, kk-electronic has been  in the forefront of wind energy developments.  The company was the first to develop a control  system which allowed a modern wind turbine to  be connected to the electrical grid. Through con- tinuous developments the companys control  system has been able to ensure superior perfor- mance and reliability of the steady larger and  larger wind turbines; from the 22 kW wind turbi- nes to the 5000 MW wind power plants in 2010.  kk-electronic a/s is an international provider of wind turbine control system solutions.                 5  This has enabled us to stay in the front (still to- day) with respect to control systems for offshore  wind and to make control solutions for the largest  wind turbines being developed.    kk-electronics more than 600 dedicated and in- genuous employees are adapting consumer and  customer demands into practical solutions and   innovations, often in co-operations with partne- ring companies.     We recognize that control systems are one es- sential answer to energy efficiency and to reduce  climate changes, and we are obliged to make a  serious commitment to develop, promote and  market more energy-efficient solutions for people  in all markets.        ...has been in       the forefront of       wind energy       developments         for more than       three decades                    ...developed      the capabilities       of control systems                 ...has been       selected for the       most tough and     difficult development         jobs                       6     The Ten          Principles                      Human Rights Human Rights Human Rights Human Rights        Principle 1    Businesses should support and respect     the protection of internationally    proclaimed human rights; and      Principle 2    make sure that they are not complicit     in human rights abuses.

Inputs  from sensors and transducers throughout the wind turbine  are collected and analysed in the control system to moni- tor, if the best possible performance is met. As such  control systems are key components in industrial societies  to ensure that resources are used efficiently.    Additionally, kk-electronic is marketing its products outside  the wind energy sector, and our control systems are sold  to wave energy installations and  municipal wastewater  treatment plants.  Score Principle 9    Score Principle 10  Up until recently, the Company only had internal values  against the use of corruptions, extortion and bribery. With  the entry into the Global Compact program it became clear  that policies regarding anti-corruption should be developed  and implemented. This work is ongoing.    Meanwhile, we have joined with  Royal Danish Embassy  Anti Corruption Partnership. It is both a strategic and a   practical  oriented  partnership  created  to  advance  com- mitment  and implementation of anti corruption practices.     The aim  is  to  secure an ongoing update on trends and  best practices and committing members to continuously   evaluate  and  improve  their  anti  corruption  tools  and   activities  in  order  to contribute actively to prevent corrup- tion.    1    2     3      4      5  1    2     3      4      5  1    2     3      4      5     11  Efforts in  Ikast, DK  kk kk kk kk----electronics electronics electronics electronics headquarter in Ikast  will make a Code of Conduct applicable for all  three locations.

In Chongqing in China kk-electronic has a joint-venture with Qianwei, a part of the  CSIC group.     14   World    focus  IN IN IN IN our business we have the world in focus and  we are driven by the core issues of the rene- wable industry. At the same time our holistic fo- cus stretches to other areas that make the world  spin around. This is also the reason why we are  supporting Global Compacts ten principles, and  already before our commitment in the program  we engaged in other issues.    We are member of an anti-corruption organisati- on, created by The Danish Embassy. The aim of  The Royal Danish Embassy Anti Corruption Part- nership is to counter corruption and demonstrate  commitment.  Companies with a global reach get to achieve  knowledge sharing across branches of how to  avoid or handle corruptive activities, in order to  continuously evaluate and improve their anti- corruption tools and activities.    Furthermore we support projects of SOS-    Childrens Villages. For more than 15 years we  have supported SOS-Childrens Villages with  economical support. Instead of sending Christ- mas presents to our collaborating partners we  give our adopted children in foreign countries the  funds, and the same goes for the funds collected  at corporate activities, such as Christmas gathe- rings.    kk-electronic also donates funds for Denmarks  Collection, who in 2011 raised funds for Africas  youth and thereby met some of United Nations  goals for 2015; The African youth must have  education, get out of poverty and into the labour  market, have access to health care and know  their rights as well as participate in the democra- tic proces.    Furthermore kk-electronic donates funds to  areas experiencing nature catastrophes, such as   the earthquakes in Haiti, Pakistan and Japan.                       15  AS AS AS AS a participant in the green renewable in- dustry, we do not only deliver green technology  solutions, we live the values around the green  mind set to create a society where the environ- ment must be protected. Therefore, we are ISO  14001 certified and our efforts stretch to personal  safety; Avoiding any danger to persons or equip- ment, and to unnecessary burden on the envi- ronment; Reducing waste and energy consump- tion and prevent contamination. Additionally, we  are continually launching preventive activities to  avoid any potential deficiencies in our processes  and products.    Climate change is now generally accepted to be  the greatest environmental threat facing the  world, and keeping our planets temperature at  sustainable levels has become one of the major  concerns of policy makers. The UNs Intergo- vernmental Panel on Climate Change projects  that average temperatures around the world will  increase by up to 5.8C over the coming century.    In order to avoid the worst ravages of climate  change, global greenhouse gas emissions must  peak and begin to decline before 2020. Since the  power sector is a major source of emissions, it is   essential that major emissions reductions in the  power sector are introduced.    Wind power consumes no fuel and no water for  continuing operation, and has no emissions di- rectly related to electricity production. Wind turbi- nes produce no carbon dioxide, nor other air pol- lutant (as do fossil fuel power sources) which are  polluting the major cities of the world and costing  billions in additional health costs and infrastructu- re damage. Within three to six months of operati- on, a wind turbine has offset all emissions caused  by its construction, to run virtually carbon free for  the remainder of its 20 year life. Further, in an  increasingly carbon-constrained world, wind po- wer is risk-free insurance against the long term  downside of carbon intense investments.     Given the crucial timeframe up to 2020 during  which global emission must start to decline, the  speed of deployment of wind farms is of key im- portance. Building a conventional power plant can  take 10 or 12 years or more, and until it is comp- leted, no power is being generated. Wind power  deployment is measured in months, and will start  generating power and income as soon as the first  turbines are connected to the grid.   Our   green efforts  Being a world leading supplier in the greentech industry kk-electronic live the values  around the green mind set.     16                                                                      kk-electronic a/s  Boegildvej 3  DK-7430 Ikast, Denmark  +45 9722 1033      kk-electronic Polska Sp.Z.O.O  UI.
