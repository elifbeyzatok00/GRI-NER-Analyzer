The principles set forth in this statement reflect the Company's philosophy about the way we  will conduct our business on a global basis. They are applicable to all Gosselin employees  and are approved and monitored regularly by the Company's senior management.     Diversity and Nondiscrimination: Gosselin  respects, values and welcomes diversity in its  workforce, its customers, its suppliers, and the global marketplace. The Company will comply  with all applicable laws of the countries in which we do business, and provide equal  employment opportunity for all applicants and employees without regard to race, color,  religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, disability, veteran status, marital status, sexual  orientation, gender identity, genetic information, or any other legally protected characteristic.     Harassment Prohibition: Gosselin is committed to providing a workplace free of sexual  harassment or harassment based on factors such as race, color, religion, national origin,  ancestry, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, veteran status,  genetic information or any other legally protected characteristic. The Company will not  tolerate harassment of employees by managers or co-workers, on or off-site. The Company  will also endeavor to protect employees from harassment by non-employees in the  workplace.  Gosselin employees are expected to treat their coworkers, and employees of the  Company's customers and suppliers with dignity and respect.     Child or Forced Labor: Gosselin will not employ anyone under the age of 16 in any position,  and workers under the age of 18 should not perform hazardous work. The Company also  expects its suppliers to comply with these standards when placing contingent workers on  assignment with Gosselin Georgia. The Company will not allow forced, bonded, or indentured  labor practices in our operations, and forbids harsh or inhumane treatment, including corporal  punishment or the threat of corporal punishment.          12        Security: Gosselin will seek to provide a safe and secure business environment for the  protection of our employees, products, materials, equipment, systems and information.

We encourage our employees to share their ideas, concerns or suggestions through a  culture of cooperation and teamwork                13      Georgia has carried out many efforts to improve the country's business environment,  including cutting the number and rates of taxes, improving tax and fiscal administration,  streamlining licensing requirements, deregulating, and simplifying customs and border  formalities. In addition, several surveys reveal that the demand for bribes has declined when  companies interact with licensing, registry and tax authorities.     Georgia has been widely praised for being able to cut back on red tape in relation to setting  up and running a company. Starting a company in Georgia is now relatively simple.     An Anti-Corruption Inter-Agency Council was set up in January 2009 to support and update  the National Anti-Corruption Strategy. The Council will also implement recommendations by  CSOs and international organizations.     At Gosselin, we do not tolerate corruption and are committed to compliance with international  anti-bribery standards, as stated in the Global Compact and local anti-corruption and bribery  laws.     We report our policy on bribery and corruption in the compliance and ethics section. All  businesses assess, remedy, monitor and report their possible risks related to corruption in the  normal course of business. If we become aware of any risks related to corruption, we take  appropriate action.     Gosselin strengthened the construction of the punitive and preventive systems, revised  and  formulated with regard to operation, finance, labor, personnel, supervision management, risk  management, internal audit and performance monitoring, etc.                     Gosselin transparancy and Anti-corruption  14        Gosselin and the environment  Besides the green brand of the Gosselin Group, Gosselin is also actively committed to  contributing to the environment.    Some of the recent initiatives in this field :    - Inland container terminal : by using the inland waterways to carry our customers containers  to and from the port of Antwerp and Rotterdam, we reduce road traffic with +/- 115 trucks per  working day / 500.000 ton/year. By using this well known barge-transportation-systemover  the inland waterways we contribute in a meaningful way to our environment.    - Recycling of packing materials : at Gosselin we have committed ourselves to provide and  use environmentally sound products whenever possible. All our boxes and packing materials  are recyclable. Each of us has a stake in preserving resources for future generations by  reducing the amount of material we send to landfills.     - Green energy : we have an agreement with a provider of fotovoltaic solar panels. Since the  end of April 2009 a total of 30.000m2 of our warehouse roofs are covered with fotovoltaic  solar panels. This way Gosselin contributes in a significant way to our environment.    As our business grows we want to make sure we minimize our impact on the earths climate.  Therefore we are taking every step we can to implement innovative and responsible  environmental practices across our company to reduce our carbon footprint, ensure efficient  computing and help our employees to be green !    GOSSELIN THINKS GREEN ..   BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR PLANET !           15        Geographic Coverage  17   We can offer you :    Full moving & relocation assistance   Extensive knowledge of the European, Central-Asian and Caucasian moving market  Moving & forwarding specialists  Highest quality standards : ISO9001, FAIM-ISO, AEO  Own airfreight department at Brussels Airport  Own inland container terminal  70.000 m2 customs bonded, heated and protected warehouses  In-house customs department  Handling of your FCL, LCL and groupage shipments  Optimization of your consolidation by shipping through ONE port  Transhipment via the Port of Antwerp   On-line tracking system  Plywood boxes for storage and overseas shipments  Excellent communication through our Headquarters in Antwerp  All differrent forwarding & trucking solutions      www.gosselingroup.eu  18        Gosselin Georgia  Gosselin Georgia started operating in Georgia in 1995 under the name Nomad  Express. We built a secured warehousing system in 2007 in Didi dighomi close to  Goodwill store. Reason for this location was that as Gosselin Georgia is handling  mostly truck and containerized transport, all transport comes from the Western part of  Georgia through Mtscheta and we did not want to overload traffic in Tbilisi center with  our transports. Now all our trucks can drive through Mscheta and turn at Goodwill to  our warehouse.  We are currently in communication with Global Compact to find a solution for the  recycling of unusable packing material.  We welcome any cooperation with other Georgian companies who also have a  considerable amount of packing material to join efforts and organize a weekly pick up  and move to factories who can use these materials to make new boxes e.g.    We offer a wide range of the following removal services:     Packing  Local removal services  International removal services worldwide out/to Georgia  Office & project removal services  Freight forwarding – trucking – airfreight - containerized  Customs Clearance at its own customs bonded warehouse  Warehousing / storage solutions (24 hours secured)    Our highly qualified staff is looking forward to serve you every day except Saturdays  and Sundays, between 9am and 5 pm.         19        Gosselin Georgia - Achievements  Gosselin Georgia is pleased to announce  the opening of  a new customs bonded  warehouse for diplomatic  cargo in Sakartvelo, the Georgian name for the republic of  Georgia.     Having considerable experience with both the business and diplomatic  communities   has  made Gosselin acutely aware of  issues such as security, special handling of   irreplaceable items and consideration for employee schedules that can often change at  a moments notice.     With this in mind Gosselin Georgia has become the first freight forwarder in the  Caucasus region to operate a dedicated customs bonded warehouse for diplomatic  goods, and the facility has been granted the code GEH 01.     All  diplomatic goods entering  by truck via the border or via container through the  ports of Poti or Batumi can be directly send to this bonded warehouse in Tbilisi. Here  these goods can be stored  long-term and then distributed on demand to our offices in  Baku (Azerbaijan) or Yerevan (Armenia) or imported directly into Georgia.     Security, Service and Savings     This gives our customers both extra service and security as our  warehouse is  monitored 24/7 and is operated by the same company that can deliver these goods to  the final destination. This also provides a huge advantage in cost and time for our  customers, as diplomatic goods for the entire Caucasus region can stay at our bonded  warehouse until our clients instruct us to deliver, then they can be consolidated into a  single delivery.           20        Started to meet local needs  Gosselin Georgia started exactly 15 years ago in Tbilisi as  a small removal  company   under the  name Nomad  Express. Since then there has been a strong local need for  organizing house hold moving services and export transportation.  In effect, moving companies barely even existed in this part of the world,and very    soon Nomad Express became a solid  partner for many embassies and  the  international business environment in Tbilisi, says John Braeckeveldt, Director of   Gosselins branch in Georgia.     Gosselin Group CEO Marc Smet and Director Stephan Geurts Sr. highlight that from  the first day, Nomad Express established a strong relationship with Gosselin World  Wide Moving (Belgium) because  Nomad Express  wanted  to work with the best  export packing material,  material  produced  under the Gosselin brandname.     An interactive cooperation has been indeed running and Nomad Express operated    many times as subcontractor for Gosselin and whenever possible Nomad counted  upon the Gosselin international network and intermodal transportation solutions,    notes John Braeckeveldt.      Nomad Joins Gosselin     In 2004, Nomad Express changed its name to Gosselin Georgia and became part of  The Gosselin Group Moving Division as Gosselin Caucasus & Central Asia. This  brought direct access to the resources of the Gosselin Moving, a multinational  organization  with 47 branch offices in 32 countries, more than 600 employees, and  one million square feet of warehousing and 200 vehicles providing service  from the   western border of China to the United States.    All together, the Gosselin Group provides a tremendous  amount of resources to be  applied to all aspects of the relocation process as well as to move quickly to solve  any  situation that may be presented during the process, says Braeckeveldt, In fact, each  customer has the benefit of only having to deal with one office or one organization for   all  aspects of relocation.     21     New Warehouse Constructed     This name change accompanied the construction of new warehouse and offices close to the  American Embassy in Georgia to better meet local customer needs.     The 15,000 sf  (1400 sm) building, is divided into two warehouse units of 7000 sf  (650 sm)  each, connected by a staging area with two loading docks. This arrangement facilitates  operations  including  container stuffing/stripping and loading/ unloading of vehicles.  The new building was shipped from Belgium to ensure the quality of materials used were in  accordance with  the  company standards.  The warehouse  is located  on a 25000 sf (2300   sm)  piece of property that is fully fenced and is under 24-hour security surveillance.        Customs Clearance Added     Maintaining their investment in customers services, in 2009 Gosselin Georgia started  their  own sub- company Customs Made Clearances Georgia, CMC Georgia. Gosselin Georgia is  now able to provide their customers with in-house customs clearance, including customs  procedures and declarations at their facility in Didi -Dighomi.        This gives a tremendous benefit to customers as CMC Georgia has the customs experts in- house, and customers  can rely on the best  and smoothest import/export clearances for  their goods and possessions.  Also   Gosselin  Georgia teamed  up  with  Government  Logistics  N.V., a newly   formed  company in  Belgium.  Government Logistics has a complete range of services and facilities  available to meet the needs of US Government moves and relocations    Caucasus Transportation Hub     The latest service improvement from Gosselin Georgia is to establish Georgia as a  transportation hub from the US and EU through Georgia to the Caucasus and Central-Asia  regions. Georgias central geographic location, bridging several economic regions, provides  it with a unique competitive   advantage as   a transit country.     Situated  at the  crossroads  between  Europe and Central Asia,  Georgia is  the  shortest   route  for transporting  raw materials,  finished  goods, gas and oil between Azerbaijan and  Central Asia and the West. At the same time, Georgia functions as the north-south  transportation link between Russia and Turkey and, via Armenia, to Iran.  22       Caucasus Transportation Hub     The latest service improvement from Gosselin Georgia is to establish Georgia as a  transportation hub from the US and EU through Georgia to the Caucasus and Central-Asia  regions. Georgias central geographic location, bridging several economic regions, provides  it with a unique competitive   advantage as   a transit country.

Meeting Customer Needs      Gosselin Georgia is continually striving to maintain flexibility and adaptability to meet our  clients demands for extraordinary service, John Braeckeveldt says.
