SuStAINABILIty REPORt 2011  Letter from our CEO The sustainable side of air filtration This is why we incorporate sustainable  principles and practices in everything  we do, from concept to finished filter.  Sustainability has always been a  natural top priority, allowing us to con- stantly carry out concrete measures  that contribute to a better world. Our sustainability goal We have stated that we aim to be the  greenest and cleanest air filtration  company in the world and we are well  on our way, if not there already.  To live up to this ambition, we  continue to do what we have been  doing for half a century – work hard  to help our customers improve health  and productivity, and at the same time,  help them become more sustainable  and environmentally friendly. We help  them save energy and reduce their  environmental footprint with our clean  air solutions.  Eco-efficient filtration also makes  our customers more attractive and  more economically viable. When our  customers purchase Camfil Farr prod- ucts and systems, they are making a  sound investment that benefits their  business and end-customers. Sustainable R&D Some say that sustainability is no  rocket science. That can certainly be  debated, because the development of  green product solutions requires sub- stantial research and years of industry  experience.  Our R&D is an example. We have our  own unique resources, such as our state- of-the-art Technology Centre in Sweden,  and tech centres in other world regions.  Around the globe we carry out research  projects in association with institutes to  develop methods, techniques and mate- rial for sustainable filtration solutions for  today and tomorrow.  We constantly source new ideas and  inspiration. With eco-thinking embedded  in all our research and development,  we can focus on the real sustainability  job at hand – the creation of green filter  solutions that improve indoor air quality,  cut operating costs for ventilation sys- tems, and save energy. Life cycles and energy efficiency One primary focus of our research is  the overall life cycle performance of  our products: how we deliver air qual- ity of maximum benefit while minimiz- ing our environmental impact as much  as possible. We accomplish this by  selecting the right materials, using the  right production methods, minimizing  transportation and ensuring appropri- ate end-of-life treatment.  Equally important is the energy  efficiency of our filters. Cleaning dirty  air requires energy and contributes to  carbon emissions related to energy  production. But the considerable  power appetite of heating and ventila- tion systems in commercial, industrial  and public buildings is being reduced  today by installing Camfil Farr filters,  which have the least air flow resistance  and cut energy usage in air handling  units.    Allow me to put a number on this  to give you an idea of what we mean: For every percent we improve  the energy performance of our  product portfolio, our customers  save more than 100 million kWh  of electricity per year with the  added major benefit of better  IAQ. A t Camfil Farr, we have taken sus- tainability seriously for decades.  We can proudly say that we pioneered  the concept of eco-efficiency in the air  filtration industry, and in almost every  way, we are far ahead of our competi- tors when it comes to developing and  supplying green solutions.  When we operate our business  in a sustainable way, we are sure  that our filtration solutions, services  and actions deliver the all-important  product of clean air in an eco-efficient  way that helps preserve the environ- ment and natural resources for future   generations. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 / 2  Balancing health and   eco-efficiency Camfil Farrs air filtration experts  have pursued the ambition to develop  energy-efficient solutions that benefit  the operations of customers globally,  using life-cycle thinking for solution  design and life-cycle costing method - ology and tools.  However, in todays era of climate  change, the circumstances that create  opportunities for the air filtration busi- ness unfortunately pose dilemmas for  decision-makers. Which path should  they prioritize – the protection of peo- ples health or the reduction of carbon  emissions? What is most important  in the long term – the economic and  social impact of air pollution on human  health or stopping climate change?  The answers might lie somewhere  in-between and Camfil Farrs products  can make the difference to find a sus- tainable balance. What all of this means is that we  aim to remain the leading filtration  company to bring our sustainable  clean air solutions to the world. We  have a bright and sustainable future  together, so lets make it together! Alan OConnell President and CEO Camfil Farr Group  Results: Camfil Farr recorded another successful year of higher sales and earn- ings. Net sales amounted to SEK 4,851 M (4,575), an increase of SEK 275 M,  compared with 2010. Underlying operating profit, excluding restructuring costs and  items affecting comparability, was SEK 493 M (478), an increase of SEK 15 M and  corresponding to an operating margin of 10.2% (10.4).  Redemption of minority shareholding: The Camfil Farr Group once again  became a 100-percent-family-owned company when the Parent Company, Camfil  AB, redeemed all shares previously held by the private equity company Ratos during  more than 10 years of close cooperation. Ratos became a shareholder in the Camfil  Farr Group in 2000 in connection with the acquisition of Farr in the United States.  New subsidiary in Dubai: At the end of 2011, Camfil Farr established a new  Middle Eastern base and subsidiary in the Jebel Ali Free Trade Zone in Dubai. The  Dubai subsidiary will help expand Camfil Farrs footprint in the region. Middle East  business will be conducted primarily through independent distributors.  Expanding in India: Three years ago the Camfil Farr Group acquired a 76% share  of Anfilco in India, forming Camfil Farr Air Filtration India Ltd as a joint venture with  Anand International Pte Ltd. Over the years, Camfil Farr India has been gradually  integrated into the Camfil Farr family, more than doubled its sales and quadrupled  its profit. In 2011, the remaining shares (24%) were acquired, making Camfil Farr  India a wholly owned subsidiary. The company has also set up a modern fabrication  hub for Power Systems in Trichy, 300 km south of Chennai, to serve major global  OEM customers.  Expansion of North American sales organization: In the first quarter of 2011,  the Camfil Farr Group acquired Exfil, a U.S. distributor, to increase Camfil Farrs  presence in the Michigan market. Camfil Farr also acquired Solution Air in Beauport,  in the province of Quebec, Canada. The two acquisitions are expected to contribute  approximately SEK 57 M to consolidated sales.  Divestment of Railroad business: At year-end 2011, an agreement was reached  to divest the Railroad business unit to Parker Hannafin Corporation during the first  quarter of 2012. The Railroad business unit had sales of SEK 141 M in 2011, with  operations primarily in Canada, India and Australia. The divestment is part of Camfil  Farrs strategic plan to focus exclusively on core air filtration business.

As regulations tighten up, Camfil  Farr has anticipated the new standards  and positioned itself early to gain a strong  competitive advantage, in a well-timed  manner.   This has been accomplished over the  years by managing product performance  and energy efficiency proactively instead  of reactively. As a result, Camfil Farr   supplies the most energy-efficient air filtra- tion solutions on the market today, helping  customers to save energy and reduce  their environmental footprint. Camfil Farr is the industry leader in  sustainability and eco-efficient filtration  solutions. For example, in 2007, Camfil  Transforming air filtration   into an eco-efficient industry Farr was the first air filtration provider to  launch an energy classification system  for air filters. This system was later  adopted to become the official certifica- tion process for the European air filtration  industry through the EUROVENT program. In Europe, Camfil Farr also took the  lead to revise the new version of the   EN 779 standard for classifying air filters,  which now sets the minimum performance  requirements for products. Sustainability as a growth driver Camfil Farr believes that sustainability is  vital for the companys continuing growth.  We recognize that climate change, and  a growing awareness about conserving  resources in society, also requires respon- sible actions and solutions from the air  filtration industry. Delivering high indoor  air quality, reducing the energy consump- tion of air handling systems with better  filters, and continuing our cradle-to-grave  approach to product management, all play  a role in this process.   Driving the industry towards true sus- tainability and reducing our own envi- ronmental footprint also involves steady  improvement of company processes,  practices and products from a sustain- ability standpoint, as well as designing  sustainability into Camfil Farr products  and services. This is why we benchmark our pro- gress with key performance indicators  and create reliable internal data for our  sustainability reporting.   Building a strong internal eco-culture  through Group-wide sustainability pro- grams and initiatives is equally important.  This is being accomplished through our  annually recurring Camfilcairing Week  program. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 / 6  Myriam Tryjefaczka Corporate Sustainability Manager Camfil Farr Group myriam.tryjefaczka@camfil.fr Ongoing  Road Show  campaign The Road Show is the first of its kind in  the air filtration industry. The 13-metre- long trailer is drawn by an eco-efficient  Scania truck with Ecolution package  for the highest possible fuel efficiency  and the lowest possible carbon dioxide  emissions. Inside, the trailer is equipped  with a mobile lab and facilities for test- ing air quality at Road Show venues. Air  filter performance and efficiency is also  demonstrated in the mobile lab. Air quality is monitored continuously at   several remote sites in Trosa (Sweden),  the New York area and Paris, France to  demonstrate how air pollution varies region- ally. Data from these sites are transferred  to a global database and the mobile lab  accesses the information with a 3G mobile  connection and displays it on gauges. During 2011, the truck visited key cities  in the United Kingdom, Sweden, France,  Germany, Switzerland, Slovakia, Finland,  Norway, Denmark and Belgium. During these  visits, we informed politicians, decision- makers, the press and the public about air  pollution and poor IAQ and the impact on  human health and performance.  The Road Show initiative has received  much attention and is proving to be a highly  effective tool to spread Camfil Farrs clean  air message. To learn more, please visit  our Road Show campaign pages on our   cor porate website, where you can also  see the next scheduled venue. www.camfilfarr.com/RoadShow SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 / 7  Camfil Farr was the first company to  develop energy and air quality rating  systems for air filters. these proactive  systems, introduced several years ago,  have been adopted by the European air  filtration industry. EuROVENts introduc- tion of a new energy efficiency classi- fication system in 2012 is an example. The new classification, based on EN 779:2012,  gives customers a clearer understanding of a  filters annual energy consumption, initial efficiency  and minimum efficiency. This information makes it  easier to select the right filter for the right applica- tion for the best energy efficiency and filtration.   This will become more and more important  as EU directives require public and commercial  buildings to improve energy efficiency. Today,  10 to 20% of all electrical power in buildings is  consumed to operate heating, ventilation and air  conditioning systems.    In addition to reducing energy consump- tion and environmental impact for sustainability  reasons, building owners also need to cut oper- ating costs as power prices increase. Selecting  the right quality air filters with the lowest energy  consumption can boost their eco-efficiency and  also increase IAQ for a better and healthier work  environment.  preservation of natural and fossil resources,  reduction of waste and emissions,  operational energy efficiency,  pollution risk prevention,  reduction and substitution of hazardous substances, and  use of recycled materials and the development of     alternative product recycling methods. Helping our customers save energy Designing environmental aspects into the companys air filters has  been a Camfil Farr priority for years. By maintaining a constant  dialogue with filter media suppliers and evolving our filter designs,  we have been able to reduce the air-flow resistance of our filters,  directly improving the energy-efficiency of ventilation systems that  use our products in air handling units and other filtration systems.        Product design and process control integrate a number of  eco-efficiency considerations, including: Eco-designing products An energy-efficient   product range In 2011, our most energy-efficient filter solu- tions for ventilation accounted for 67% of our  global sales in the Comfort Air products seg- ment. This share has grown 8% since 2007.  Since 2007, 21% of our Comfort Air product  sales volumes have been converted into  energy-efficient filters that also improve IAQ.

The Camfilcairing name is built around Camfil, our environ- ment, caring and air – key words that are associated with the  Camfil Farr name.    Camfilcairing is designed to communicate our long-term  commitment to care about our people, our shareholders, our  customers and their processes, and the environment. The internal Camfilcairing platform is built on a number of  pillars  (illustration) covering everything from energy efficiency and  IAQ, to dialogues with stakeholders, green products and risk   management.   For example, risk management is being fine-tuned globally.  Camfil Farr is continuing to secure risk management processes  at local management level through benchmarking practices and  training at Camfilcairing Network Seminars in various countries.   These seminars focus on safety and environmental risk   management in operations and also evaluate emergency   procedures and local disaster recovery processes. The outcome  of these efforts will be the development and establishment of  a common methodology for risk analysis, mitigation measures,  prioritization and evaluation.   At corporate level, Camfil Farr is structuring the Groups  comprehensive global business risk assessment system, which is  updated every six months. This process is leading to action plans  for mitigation and control actions.   The risk assessment process allows global involvement of  management and decision-makers at both local and corporate  level. Camfilcairing pillars Camfil Farr supports the United Nation Global Compact initiative and has integrated its principles   in the Camfilcairing Code. Camfil Farr reports in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative.  The GRI matrix is available on our sustainability pages at www.camfilfarr.com. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 / 9  Camfilcairing activities in 2011 Camfilcairing activities in 2011 con- tinued to embrace energy conser- vation programmes, life cycle assess- ments to mitigate the environmental  impact of products and operations, the  introduction of green measures, and   caring for people in our local markets  through community-oriented initiatives.    In early 2012, the fourth con- secutive Camfilcairing Week was held  across the Group. As in previous years,  employees were actively engaged in a  wide variety of sustainability-related activi- ties ranging from sharing local environ- mental good practices and green tips  for offices, to sustainability activities,  employee health programmes, energy  conservation and waste reduction mea- sures, and local community actions. The  latter ranged from raising funds for chari- ties and research, collecting clothes for  the needy, and a number of social and  humanitarian actions, such as hiring the  disabled for mailing and packing services.  Camfil Farr now has a global Human Resources Director, who is establishing corporate guidelines to standardize and improve HR processes.  This important investment in human resource management completes our approach to eco-efficiency by developing the social aspects of   sustainable development. Learn more on page 12. A number of Camfilcairing-related initia- tives – such as informing customers  about our energy-efficient filters with  Internet conferences (webinars) – also  help profile us as a green enterprise and  support our overall objective to increase  awareness about the importance of filtra- tion for air quality, health, performance  and eco-efficiency.

The following are a few examples of  environmental, energy and work environ- ment measures that were carried out in  2011 at Camfil Farr facilities around the  world. EN 16001. As part of the certification  process, meters were also installed to  effectively monitor, control and reduce  consumption of energy and water in   production processes. The French R&D  centre has also introduced GaBi 4 soft- ware to perform Life Cycle Assessments  for products made in France and at other  Camfil Farr subsidiaries. malaysia: Camfil Farrs local production  company was the first in the country to  successfully obtain ISO 50001 certifica- tion for its energy management system.  Equipment has also been installed to  compress scrap media and reduce truck  transports of waste to the local land- fill, reducing carbon-dioxide emissions   significantly. united Kingdom: Camfil Farr UK adapted  and certified the companys energy man- agement system to the new ISO 50001  standard. Over the past two years, trade  organizations, magazines and associa- tions have awarded more than 10 prizes,  awards and commendations to the com- pany (see page 15). united States: Camfil Farrs U.S. facili- ties are steadily focusing on increasing  eco-efficiency and reducing their carbon  footprint by continuing to implement energy- saving concepts, including installations  of light-switch motion sensors, energy- efficient windows, new and more efficient  HVAC units for all offices, and white reflec- tive membranes on roofs. Environmental  Magazine also awarded a prize to the U.S.  subsidiary in 2011 (see page 15). SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 / 10  waste destination  LANDFILL     INCINERAtION     RECyCLINg 2011 32% 18% 50% Measuring is controlling Lower raw material   consumption Based on energy, water usage and waste  indicators, raw material consumption is  decreasing within Camfil Farr. However,  the eco-efficiency ratio indicates that the  entire Camfil Farr Group is still capable  of producing more by using less. Our  resource consumption is stabilizing and  the organization as a whole is becoming  more and more efficient, allowing us to  grow our business while reducing our  overall environmental impact.  Energy use Doing good is a long-term commitment and sustainability initiatives need time to  mature before a company can reap the full benefits of organizational efforts. In the  Camfil Farr Group, global resource usage trends remain positive. At almost all Camfil  Farr sites, resource efficiency programmes have been fine-tuned for continuing  success.  These efforts are creating additional resource-saving opportunities and enabling new  improvements. Reduced water consumption Regarding water consumption, the overall  volume decreased by 14% between 2007  and 2011 (albeit with overages in 2008  and 2009). Process efficiency, along with  user vigilance to ensure careful use of  scarce resources in some regions, has  improved by 26%, despite higher produc- tion volumes in Group plants. Less waste Waste was significantly reduced for the  first time, compared to 2007. The Groups  eco-efficiency was also slightly better than  in 2008. Waste management needs to be  improved and focused on more. However,  better practices at manufacturing facilities  allowed us to increase our waste recycling  from 30% in 2007 to 50% in 2011, reduc- ing landfill waste. Plants are more   energy-efficient Compared to the benchmark year of  2007, energy consumption was 21%  lower in 2011, while the energy efficiency  of our manufacturing plants improved by  38%.   Camfil Farrs ongoing sustainability  programmes are also contributing signifi- cantly to controlling energy costs within  operations, which helps increase the  Groups profitability. 80    60    40    20    0  2009 2010 2011  ENERgy CONSumPtION OF FACtORIES gwh  EEI = COgS/ENERgy uSE SEK m/gwh water use  tOtAL wAtER uSE m3      EEI kSEK/t wAtER m3  100000    75000    50000    25000    0 50 - 38 - 25 - 13 - 0 - 2009 2010 2011 EEI TOTAL WATER USE M3 waste  520    390    260    130    0 6400 -  - 4800 -  - 3200 -  - 1600 - 0 - 2009 2010 2011  tOtAL wAStE tONNES     EE INDEx kSEK/tONNE kSEK/TONNE     TOTAL WASTE TONNES  LANDFILL     INCINERAtION     RECyCLINg 2007 51% 19% 30% SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 / 11  Committed employees for successful,   sustainable business Sustainability is a key focus for our employees and Camfil Farrs Human Resources (HR) initiatives  are serving to drive the company toward successful sustainable development.  We develop, manufacture and sell prod- ucts that provide something as essen- tial as clean air, so we naturally need  to ensure that our own environmental  footprint is as small as possible while  operating with the highest possible ethi- cal standards. With this firm commitment  to eco-efficiency, we can meet societys  evolving criteria for sustainable business  and good corporate social responsibility. Internally, we work on all parts and  processes of our company, but we also  remember how we really provide one of  our largest contributions to sustainability  – through our people. This is why it is  imperative to recruit and retain top talent,  create incentives for exceptional perform- ance and enhance critical competencies  to build a solid personnel platform for  driving additional success and increasing  eco-efficiency. With employees committed to sustain- ability through HR actions, we achieve our  business goals and increase long-term  customer value by integrating our eco- nomic, environmental and social opportu- nities in Camfil Farrs business strategy. The companys recently established- corporate HR function represents another  major step toward integrating sustain- ability firmly in the mindset of Camfil Farr  staff around the globe. Our company can only succeed in  eco-efficiency if we have people who  can meet the sustainability challenges of  today and tomorrow. Committed employees drive  successful business At Camfil Farr, HR serves as the vital  link between employee commitment and  customer satisfaction. The importance of  a sustainable HR agenda is confirmed by  the fact that an increasing number of job  applicants now pre-assess the social and  environmental performance of companies  before choosing an employer. Sustainability therefore provides stra- tegic business opportunities for Camfil  Farr when attracting the best future   talents. Aiming to become First   Choice Employer At Camfil Farr, we also depend on creating  a work environment that retains talented  people. During 2011, a pilot survey was con- ducted to measure staff satisfaction –  the Camfil Personnel Attitude Involvement  Research survey (CAMPAIR for short).  The purpose of this survey was to  identify Camfil Farrs strengths and weak- nesses and gather information to improve  our business. A survey generates valuable  data, measurements and findings that can  be processed and assessed to create  more value for employees, and ultimately,  for our customers and owners.  The plan is to implement a full-scale  CAMPAIR survey in 2012 in which all  Camfil Farr employees, in all Group com- panies, will participate.

Camfil  Farr has also been active within industry associations at national and European level.  As a result, Camfil Farr contributes to the development of recommendations and  methodologies for the selection and application of appropriate high-quality filtration  solutions in buildings.    In 2011, Camfil Farr continued to develop a dialogue with stakeholders  involved in the policy-making process at European level, including Commission   officers involved with energy regulations, HVAC professional associations, NGOs,  expert groups and institutions mandated by the EU to prepare a new regulation  framework that will impact the air filtration business in the future.    The objective is to share Camfil Farrs expertise on the best available   tech nology for air filtration and the options for ensuring that IAQ and public health  will not be compromised by the next set of European regulations for the energy  efficiency of buildings and ventilation systems.    Another purpose is to encourage debates and build awareness of how   low-energy air filtration solutions can play a key role in reducing the energy   consumption of buildings while also improving IAQ and impacting both sustainability  and human health positively.  Activities   Outreach program in Brussels – a  stakeholders meeting was held  in Brussels targeting Members of  Parliament (MEPs) and European   policy professionals. An informal dis- cussion brought together experts and  MEPs for a Road Show event at  Place de Luxembourg, in front of the  Parliament.   Camfil Farr also sponsored an Air  Quality links dossier and a Special  Report published on euractiv.com,  Camfil Farrs media partner in  Brussels.   Camfil Farr sponsored a roundtable,  organized by Euractiv, on the next air  quality regulations. European MEPs,  European Commission representa- tives and NGOs participated in the  discussions.   Camfil Farr developed closer collabo- ration with ventilation trade associa- tions and experts to communicate the  importance of developing regulations  for energy efficiency that will not   compromise IAQ and public health.    Camfil  Farr  currently  chairs  EUROVENTs Filter Working Group  and Certification Committee. In 2012,  Camfil Farr joined EVIA (European  Ventilation Industry Association), a  newly created European trade asso- ciation. For several years, Camfil Farr  has also been supporting REHVA, the  independent European association of  HVAC experts and engineers.   In 2011, Camfil Farr became the  first gold sponsor of the Clean Air in  London (CAL) campaign that aims to  build public understanding of indoor  air quality, initially in the British capi- tal. The Road Show was arranged in  London in 2011 to invite and gather  City of London representatives, the  press and particularly experts and  practitioners of air quality. The Road  Show will return to Canary Wharf in  May 2012.    In the Netherlands, Camfil Farr BV  has formed an alliance with Erasmus  University (Rotterdam) and the NULA  association of lung specialists to con- duct a Clean Air for Everyone project  to educate the general public on the  benefits of clean air and good IAQ.   In Austria, Camfil Austria GmbH has  entered into a partnership with Meine  Ramluft, an NGO advocating better  IAQ to educate the public about clean  air and the dangers of air pollution.  An event is planned together with the  Road Show in Vienna during 2012.   In association with UNICLIMA, the  French union for HVAC and refrigera- tion professionals, Camfil Farr's Road  Show was installed at the Pollutec  exhibition in France, the largest  event for environment professionals  in Europe. Persons interested in air   quality measurements and indoor  air pollution mitigation technologies   visited the mobile lab and attended  several conferences to which Camfil  Farr was invited as a contributor.   Back in December 2010, Camfil Farr  sponsored the General Assembly of  the Architects Council of Europe (ACE)  to disseminate information about the  importance of effective air filtration  in building ventilation systems. ACE  organized a high-level conference  in the European Parliament, where  one of our experts was invited to  speak. Camfil Farr is continuing activi- ties to disseminate information to  the European Parliament. The exhibi- tion Sustainable Architecture across  Europe, launched at the Parliament  in 2011, travelled across European  capitals during the year and in early  2012.

The 2011 monsoon season in Thailand caused severe flooding that impacted the lives of more than 13 million people in 65 of the countrys   77 provinces, including 15 Camfil Farr Thailand employees. To help them, the company rented temporary apartment units and gave cash assistance to those who were most affected.
