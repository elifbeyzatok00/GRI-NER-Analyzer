Multidisciplinary steering committee Our  CSR management structure comprises a multidisciplinary Steering  Committee. This is supervised by our three Executive Vice Presidents of  Human Resources, Marketing and General Counsel.  The committee meets twice to approve the sustainability improvement  strategy and review achievement against plans. Sub-committees including  staff from the relevant functions in the company meets every two or three  months to review progress of our main sustainability projects.   Materiality For 2011, similarly to 2010, Gemalto has prioritizing its main projects based  on its experience and knowledge, the requests of customers and other  stakeholders, and HSE regulations taking into account main characteristics  such as : Background : Gemalto CSR approach (1/2) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 6 such as : - The global spread of our industrial plants - The number of cards we deliver worldwide - A global supply chain involving thousands of people worldwide along its  entire length Main resulting risks or issues are environmental impact s - on the air  at first  (mostly green house gas emissions), then on soils (consumption of resources  and waste generation) while having a smaller impact on water  - and supply  chain ethical weak management  Materiality (contd) In 2010, our main achievements were driven by:  - the yearly action plans implemented by our ISO14001 certified plants. These  address critical topics highlighted by environmental risk analysis, mostly  resource consumption and waste generation/reduction - the decision to measure all Gemalto-associated greenhouse gas emissions,  including all impacts along the supply chain.  - the continuation of more eco-friendly card development and production, plus  product end-of-life improved management.  - the definition and structuring of our Responsible Purchasing strategy. In 2011, we continued projects in that same direction. In parallel, we are  currently running a methodical CSR risks and opportunity analysis for our  activities worldwide in order to identify all our potential stakes, better prioritize   improvement projects / resources and optimize the set of indicators monitoring  our CSR performance and our progress Background : Gemalto CSR approach (2/2) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 7 Yearly CSR program Both 2010 and 2011 programs included specific projects aiming at improving  our performance in the areas of: - Operational Environmental impacts - Business offer  i.e. greener product development  - Social & Ethical and Governance principles The Carbon Footprint initiative , the Responsible Purchasing project and the  implementation of a yearly stand-alone Sustainability Report are the 3 topics  that we are detailing in our 2011 COP to the UN Global Compact community.  For more convenient reading,  please see page 7, 8 and 10 of our 2010 Sustainability  report at http://www.gemalto.com/companyinfo/sustainability/ Background : 2010 Highlights at a glance (1/1) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 8  Context As illustrated by our ISO14001 certification policy  (22 certified sites by end  of 2010), environmental sustainability has been at the core of our company ethos  and, since many years, Gemalto manufacturing sites have been  conducting   environmental risk  / impact analysis and implementing  yearly associated  improvement action plans mainly addressing consumptions (e.g. of energy, water,  paper and manufacturing materials) and waste reduction / management. With climate change come new challenges for individuals, communities and global  companies like Gemalto. As part of our global commitment to environment care, it is  crucial to go further than above usual areas of actions, monitoring and reducing the  global carbon emissions linked to our overall business and therefore limiting its  contribution to the global warming issue Objectives In 2009, we embarked on an ambitious, proactive program aiming at  measuring the global CO2 emissions induced by our activities. We decided to  perform it according to the cradle to grave concept therefore including: Measuring our CO2 global emissions (1/3) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 9  all our activities e.g. not only manufacturing ones but as well those related to all  other functions such as R&D, Business or Support functions, therefore all Gemalto  sites / people   all steps along the whole Life Cycle of the products e.g. not only the steps  performed at Gemalto but as well the ones, upstream, related to material  generation / transformation at suppliers and the ones ,downstream, at customers /  end users.  Decided targets were:  to complete to whole measurement roadmap over a 3 year period  to develop 2  custom tools aimed at easing: - the data collection process and ensure method consistency between sites  and with further data collection campaigns. - the calculation of  the footprint of a given product for a given customer  e.g.  taking into consideration its main fabrication and delivery specificities   Actions / Results Developing of a data collection customized tool As a first step, we have selected an Carbon footprint external expert to  provide us with training sessions on the  common method to apply worldwide  and support us during  the  early phases of the overall project: this included the  generation of the initial version  of a data collection tool and its deployment /  usage in pilot sites which has been completed in H1 2010 The Bilan Carbone method developed by the ADEME (French Environment  and Energy Management Agency) has been selected for Gemalto CO2  emissions measurement worldwide:. This method is well recognized at European level, applies the from cradle to  grave concept and provides conversion coefficients (emissions factors)  internationally validated .  The tool we developed is actually a customization of the ADEME database:  the 8 basic spread sheets which respectively consolidate data on energy  Measuring our CO2 global emissions (2/3) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 10  the 8 basic spread sheets which respectively consolidate data on energy  consumption , incoming materials and outgoing products, incoming and  outgoing freights, waste, people transportation and  amortizations, have  been simplified to highlight only relevant lines for Gemalto products /  activities  graphs have been embedded in the files and are automatically generated  /updated when feeding the data  many data are extracted from corporate data bases (ex: purchasing,  logistics, .), sorted by site and then directly provided to them  Pertinent approximations / extrapolations have been investigated and  deployed In perspective for the coming months is the writing of operating guidelines for  this tool as well as corporate directive/procedure regarding C02 emission  measurements at Gemalto  Actions / Results (contd) Deploying a worldwide  footprint measurement roadmap over a 3 years period  First pilots started in 2009 have been completed in Q1 2010.  By end of 2010, we had realized 10 sites  including 8 main production plants  By end of August 2011,  data collection was completed in 8 more sites  including 2 Not-Mfg headquarters and 5 personalization centers  Based on above data, new actions have been identified toward reduced CO2 emissions both at corporate level (ex: project regarding freight impact  reduction) and in several sites  We are now able to provide significant information to the Carbon Disclosure  Project which is an independent not-for-profit organization holding the largest  database of primary corporate climate change information in the world In perspective for the coming months is the completion of the footprint for the few  remaining plants / personalization centers and an extrapolation of the impact of the  people located in small offices (ex: sales or Technical Consultant functions)  not  Measuring our CO2 global emissions (3/3) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 11 people located in small offices (ex: sales or Technical Consultant functions)  not  included in the already measured  perimeter. At that time, we will be able to consider  that we cover more than 95% of  Gemalto activities Building a Gemalto card CO2 emissions model If Carbon footprint measurements per site provide the pertinent data for  identifying areas for CO2 emission reduction actions and associated action owner,  they do not easily provide the data our customers are very much interested with,  i.e.  the weight of CO2 equivalent that can be associated to the cards we deliver them In order to meet their expectations, we have developed a simplified product CO2  emission model based on the data collected during site footprints. The model takes as main variables of the calculation formula, the materials used to  fabricate the cards, the different plants where fabrication steps are actually  performed  (e.g. module assembly, card printing / embedding and card  personalization) and the delivery location at customer. Other parameters have been  defined as constants.  Simulations show that chip size , travel distance and travel means are key  parameters are can induce C02 emissions varying from simple to triple (from 170 g  eq C02 up to 500 G eq C02  Context Since several years, Gemalto had observed a significant increase of  customers requests regarding CSR topics, initially mostly focused on environment  or health aspects (very often in link with substances contained in our  materials/products), then, more and more, with additional questions regarding the  management of potential social impacts at suppliers. Moreover, because of Gemalto global footprint and because of our wide port-folio,  not only these requests were more numerous, but they were also looking for  much more detailed information and demanding commitments evidences from  not only Gemalto but as well from our suppliers (analysis reports, certificate of  compliance, eco-friendly materials, etc ) Looking for improvement actions reflecting our adhesion to the Global Compact  charter, we decided to challenge our Purchasing Management System toward  Responsible Purchasing best practices Objectives Formalizing our Responsible Purchasing approach (1/3) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 12 A specific project named Responsible Purchasing has been approved  within the 2010 then 2011 CSR programs First objective was to perform a methodical CSR diagnosis of current  purchasing policy, processes and practices  in order to identify then close the  gaps with the Responsible purchasing companys model Second main deliverable was the realization of an overall supplier-related  purchasing risk analysis in order to make and implement the more relevant  improvement decisions and priorities,  Finally, in order to complete and perpetuate such a global evaluation of CSR  risks at suppliers, it was decided to add to our supplier performance monitoring  process, a regular assessment of their CSR performances while using it as well  for sharing our own best practices with them.  Actions / Results Upgrading Policies and processes As a first step for this objective, both internal and external surveys have been  performed in order to establish an accurate global status of the current Purchasing  positioning in terms of CSR. This process, performed by an external CSR expert, has  involved all concerned  stakeholders: -16 peoples from all 4 business regions (Latam, Noram, Asia and EMEA) and  from managers of all main contributing functions (purchasers of course but as well  internal requestors from HSE, Legal, IT, Process engineering ) have been directly  interviewed. In parallel, 100 of questionnaires have been sent to usual purchase requestors from  above functions, with a high response rate at 75%. - 67 suppliers have also been either interviewed and/or surveyed through an  on line questionnaire, covering all our purchasing segments (i.e. manufacturing  materials, subcontracting and indirect purchases), all business regions and the  different type of supplying structures (holding, state company, family, big or small):  again we reached a high response rate at 70%. Formalizing our Responsible Purchasing approach (2/3) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 13 again we reached a high response rate at 70%. - As for customers  we did not directly interviewed or surveyed them but their  inputs / positioning has been deducted from the analysis of their usual demands  (specific questionnaires or within their calls for tenders. The results of these 360 surveys has allowed us to map the respective expectations  of all stakeholders and to define an aligned Gemalto model with documented  principles, rules and tools.  - The Purchasing Policy has been updated and operating /procedures of key  processes such as supplier selection or supplier performance monitoring have been  upgraded,  - A Purchasing CSR Charter (10 golden rules applying to both Gemalto and its  suppliers) has been created.  Training sessions have been delivered to internal  teams worldwide (46 people) both on the charter content and on the associated new  or upgraded tools.  Actions / Results (contd) Performing Purchasing CSR Risk Analysis Gemalto has also developed a specific tool for performing its Purchasing CSR  risks analysis, based on the 3 usual pillars: social, environmental and business.  For the 3 of them, different risks factors and quotation grills, using both available  external benchmarks / evaluations and on our own experience,  have been defined.  The analysis identified at first the main stakes of Gemalto purchasing activities and  their initial risks, such as geographic location or substance dangerousness, then it  assessed residual risks when taking into account all actions implemented by  ourselves and by the suppliers to mitigate them and increase their CSR performance. Main current suppliers have been rated, in order to cover all existing portfolios, and at  least 80% of the purchase amount of each portfolio.  Then, prospects have been  (and will continue to be) included. Bottom line, about 200 suppliers have been  evaluated. It allowed us to confirm our confidence on social, environmental and economical  performance of our suppliers while, objectively, pointing out some risks, which  appear, thus, easier to  share / communicate to concerned companies in order to  define associated corrective and/or preventive actions. Formalizing our Responsible Purchasing approach (3/3) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 14 define associated corrective and/or preventive actions. Assessing Supplier CSR performance To be efficient, the Supplier CSR performance must be continuously  assessed. For this purpose a Self-assessment Questionnaire has been created,  covering the various CSR items, not only towards our suppliers but as well towards  their own suppliers. As of today, this questionnaire has been sent to 31 most risky and/or short listed  suppliers. To support them and to get evidences of their statements, meetings or  conference calls are organized to review their answers and exchange about  Responsible purchasing. We also started on site CSR audits / visits at 4 of them. We plan to more  systematically include CSR  topics in the agenda of usual supplier audits looking for   supplier increased CSR awareness, best practices sharing and therefore improved  performance.  Context During the last years, Gemalto has been receiving more and more  requests from its key customers about many aspects of  its CSR approach  and performance, questions being either raised during their bid process or  through  specific questionnaires from their Purchasing department. Several  CSR rating agencies also begun to include Gemalto in their assessment  panels for investors.  In order to address these explicit demands as well as more implicit  expectations of other stakeholders, Gemalto decided to  put more emphasis /  visibility on its CSR strategy and performance,  Objectives It was decided to develop projects/actions to improve both internal and  external communication.  - As for external communication, the objective, set by the end of Q1 2010, was  to address main key stakeholders i.e. customers, investors/shareholders and  suppliers through a  yearly stand-alone Sustainability report.  Improving our CSR communication (1/3) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 15 suppliers through a  yearly stand-alone Sustainability report.  Target was set to generate the first edition within the 2010 year focusing on  the status and achievements by the end of 2009 - As for internal communication, the objective was to address employees  providing them with detailed information on what the company was doing in  terms of CSR and therefore increasing their awareness and their willingness  to personally engage themselves into actions  Targets were to develop a Sustainability website on the Gemalto intranet and  to build on the organization of the Gemalto Sustainable Development Day  (GSDD) event for promoting its content as well as highlighting main corporate  and local CSR actions - In order to support above 2 communication objectives, it quickly became  obvious that a special project focusing of CSR indicators had to be started  immediately. Target was to have an initial set of indicators available for the  Sustainability report  Actions / Results Implementation of a CSR dashboard As said, a preliminary project was kick off to formalize the initial CSR  dashboard of our company. We performed at first a benchmark of the indicators that  others companies, similar to Gemalto, were highlighting in their Sustainability reports.  Workshop were then organized with concerned internal functions to select a  comparable set of metrics for our company consistent with the existing capability of  collection and consolidation of these data at least for the 2009 year Bottom line a set of 32 indicators were identified with associated owners, 16 of them  being very consistent with GRI recommendations, others being more company  specific.  Data sources and providers were also identified as well as the collection process. On going or in perspective for coming months are the following actions: - realization of a methodical analysis of Gemaltos  CSR Risks &  Opportunities. It will allow to pertinently upgrade our CSR score card - writing and deployment of an internal procedure describing the collection  process and providing precise definition of metrics  Improving our CSR communication (2/3) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 16 process and providing precise definition of metrics  - working with data providers to improve data reliability and collection user- friendliness Realization of a yearly Sustainability report Again the starting point was an external benchmark then the definition of the  format and the style corresponding to Gemaltos CSR culture and maturity. Owners  for the various developed chapters were also identified to provide the specific  contents, the Communication department ensuring the overall consistency First report, focused on end of 2009 status, has been publicly published by early Q4  2010. Posted on our external website, it has as well been pushed to our main  stakeholders (customers, suppliers, investors,.) by the usual interface functions  (Sales, Purchasing,.)  while also internally published / promoted toward our  employees. A survey was organized to collect their feedback and take them into account for the  Second edition, focused on 2010 achievements, which has just been released in July  2011 Both documents can be downloaded from the  Sustainability  section of our external  web site at http://www.gemalto.com/companyinfo/sustainability/  Actions / Results (contd) Realization of a dedicated internal Sustainability website and  Organization of the Gemalto Sustainable Development Day (GSDD) Achievements of this project result from close collaboration between  Corporate Communication and Corporate HSE departments. Expected outputs  were to:   Raise employees  CSR awareness and understanding of sustainability  Share examples of internal best practices;   Inspire employees to get involved in SD and HSE initiatives across the  company.  This Sustainability internal portal has being kick off during the GSDD  event on June 4th, 2010  (which was also the UN World Environment Day) and is  directly accessible from the intranet home page since that date.  It provides generic information about CSR as well as specific information and  examples on the way it is integrated  / implemented at Gemalto providing direct  links to key documents such as the Code of Ethics, the HSE & SD strategic  agenda  or to the descriptions of on going projects. Improving our CSR communication (3/3) Communication On Progress to UN Global Compact – September 2011         Public 17 agenda  or to the descriptions of on going projects. In 2010, we marked the GSDD event with a video broadcast from our  CEO, Olivier Piou, who spoke about his views on corporate responsibility and  outlined Gemaltos sustainability strategy and ethos. This video was broadcast  via some sites conference rooms, and was viewed more than 2300 times on our  intranet. If Corporate departments ensure global coordination and coherence of the  event, the GSDD animation is mainly done at local level .   In 2010,a total of 23 sites took part. Some held workshops and seminars  where employees could discuss CSR and environmental issues. Others  showed local presentations on Sustainability, while many organized local  volunteering initiatives. In most of the sites, HSE managers and  communication champions  promoted a Paper Free day (no use of printers)  and invited employees to watch one of two movies exploring environmental  themes (i.e. Home by Y. Arthus-Bertrand and  The Age of Stupid by  F.Armstrong,) and promote the GSDD as a Paper Free day  In June 2011, 36 sites participated in the event around various activities on  the theme " Waste and recycling".
