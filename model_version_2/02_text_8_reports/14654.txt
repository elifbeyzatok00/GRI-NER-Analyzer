Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 9  To Our Stakeholders 10  To Our Stakeholders  During the year ended March 31, 2011, the second year of the Shine 2011 medium- term management plan, Sojitz built on its successes in enhancing its operating base by  focusing on strengthening its earnings foundation to restart growth.   With emerging countries in Asia and elsewhere driving the global economy, Sojitz  accurately linked earnings to recovering demand. As a result, we achieved targets such  as profitability in all business segments, which we had planned for the final year of  Shine 2011. This enabled us to substantially exceed our initial plan. At the same time,  we made steady progress in new investments and loans that will generate growth in  the future by expanding energy and mineral resource interests and accumulating other  quality assets.  During the year ending March 31, 2012, the final year of Shine 2011, we will gear up  efforts to strengthen our earnings foundation with a view to full-scale growth during  the medium-term management plan that will start in the year ending March 31, 2013.  We will focus our efforts on areas that we expect to grow and in which we can  effectively exercise our unique strengths and originality. Creating original businesses will  enable us to continuously take on challenges for sustained growth beyond Shine 2011.  At the same time, providing sustained support for reconstruction in the wake of the  Great East Japan Earthquake will remain an urgent task during the year ending March  31, 2012. With a record of contributing to development at a national level in various  areas, we can assume a significant role in the reconstruction. We intend to deploy the  experience and expertise of all Sojitz Group employees in supporting the reconstruction.  Since the year ended March 31, 2010, we have issued our Annual Report and CSR  Report together as a single publication. In Annual Report 2011, the feature article  explains the Sojitz Groups unique initiatives in businesses and regions where it has a  strong presence. In addition, the section titled The Sojitz Groups Corporate Social  Responsibility introduces relevant Group activities and initiatives under four CSR  priority themes. We hope that Annual Report 2011 will enhance reader understanding  of our initiatives aimed at sustained growth.  We are counting on the continued understanding and support of all our stakeholders. Sojitz aims to meet stakeholder expectations by accelerating initiatives  to strengthen its earnings foundation and achieve sustained growth. August 2011 Yutaka Kase President & CEO Gearing Up for  Sustained Growth Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 11  An Interview with President & CEO Yutaka Kase Before covering results and strategies,  please explain the impact of the Great  East Japan Earthquake and future re- construction initiatives.     We have a signi cant role to assume in  reconstructing the affected areas and the  Japanese economy as quickly as possible.   The Great East Japan Earthquake struck the  Japanese archipelago on March 11, 2011, a truly  unprecedented disaster that wrought unimaginable  damage. Tragically, a number of employees of Sojitz  Group companies and their families lost their lives in  the disaster.   Our thoughts and prayers go out to those who  perished, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to  the victims of the disaster.   Sojitz provided support to the stricken area  immediately after the earthquake, including a monetary  donation and equipment for evacuation centers and  transportation support. This quick response successfully  ful lled one of our responsibilities.    The bigger responsibility going forward is to provide  constant support for reconstruction. Sojitz has  contributed to the development of many countries at  the national level, and recognizes that it has a  signi cant role to assume in reconstructing the disaster  area and Japans economy. Naturally, we will secure and  supply raw materials as a trading company. In addition,  we have established a reconstruction and education  fund to help university students who are having  economic dif culties attending school because of the  disaster, and implemented a system to support the  volunteer activities of executives and employees. Further,  we are reviewing reconstruction support operations in  collaboration with various economic organizations, and  we are also formulating our own medium-term  reconstruction support plan. The earthquake  reconstruction fund we are planning to set up is  particularly signi cant. While strengthening overseas  cooperation, Sojitz intends to create a new regional  industry model and social contribution scheme.   The earthquake caused direct losses that impacted  Sojitzs performance in the year ended March 31, 2011.  We also expect it to have a considerable impact on our  operations going forward because consumer spending  and the production activities of domestic companies  will take time to recover. However, I believe that Sojitz  certainly has the capacity to address the external  environmental changes, just as it has done in the past.   After the earthquake, Sojitz received condolences  and encouragement from governments and business  partners worldwide, which reaf rmed the strong  bonds of trust that Sojitz has built. At the same time,  we will demonstrate the strength of Japanese  companies by generating strong growth in a  challenging environment as we prevail over  unprecedented dif culties. Q A We will overcome the challenges we face while advancing swiftly toward sustained growth.   Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 12  Yutaka Kase President & CEO Sojitz exceeded its targets in the year  ended March 31, 2011. What is your eval- uation of the second year of the Shine  2011 medium-term management plan?     We steadily rebuilt and strengthened our  earnings foundation in ways such as  achieving our goal of making each divi- sion pro table a year ahead of plan.   Performance in the year ended March 31, 2011  exceeded our targets as our initiatives to date began  to generate positive results.   The year ending March 31, 2012 is the  nal year  of Shine 2011, our current medium-term management  plan. A key theme for the year will be establishing a  strong earnings foundation for sustained growth.  Although results did not improve in the year ended  March 31, 2010, the  rst year of the plan, Sojitz  concentrated on establishing a  rm footing and  achieved de nite successes such as reducing  inventories and building a system to control risk.   These successes were the basis for initiatives to  generate growth in the year ended March 31, 2011  as we advanced at full speed toward the goal of  strengthening our earnings foundation.   Consequently, all business divisions performed  well against the backdrop of global economic  recovery driven by emerging countries. Coal and   Shine 2011 Highlights Establish a strong earnings foundation conducive to sustained growth by improving earnings quality Key themes of Shine 2011  Accumulate quality businesses/assets: Secure medium/long-term earnings foundation     (Build quality asset holdings in absolute-volume terms)  Branch into new business: Cultivate new business in pursuit of sustained growth      (Groundwork for future growth)  Ensure asset liquidity: Pursue asset structure that is resilient to market fluctuations  Develop globally competent human resources: Develop human resources capable of     achieving sustained growth Targets to be achieved  Build an earnings foundation that is resilient to change    Net DER: approximately 2.0 times   Optimize asset portfolio    Risk assets: Under 1.0 times shareholders equity  Toward sustained growth Consolidated ROA 3% Consolidated ROE 15% Q A Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 13 An Interview with President  & CEO Yutaka Kase  ferroalloys supported the strong performance of the  Energy & Metal Division, while the Chemicals &  Functional Materials Division signi cantly increased  earnings by meeting steadily expanding demand in  Asia. The recovery in the Machinery Divisions  automotive business and strong results in the  Consumer Lifestyle Business Divisions fertilizer  business supported substantial improvement in  earnings in these divisions as well.   Ordinary income increased 31.6 billion, or  231%, compared with the previous  scal year to  45.3 billion, signi cantly exceeding our initial  target of 26.0 billion. Net income increased 7.2  billion, or 82%, year on year to 16.0 billion,  surpassing our initial target of 11.0 billion. Sojitz  was therefore able to increase cash dividends per  share by 0.50 year on year to 3.00.   Sojitzs earnings foundation is steadily  recovering and strengthening as a result of the  key initiatives of Shine 2011. In addition, we  achieved our target for the final year of Shine  2011 of making each division profitable on an  ordinary income basis one year ahead of  schedule. This is the most notable demonstration  to stakeholders that the initiatives we have been  implementing are yielding results.  During the year ended March 31, 2011,  Sojitz aggressively made new invest- ments and loans to achieve future  growth. Please comment on the progress  of these initiatives.     We made investments and loans consis- tent with our targets in multiple areas,  thus progressing steadily toward a stron- ger earnings foundation.   Under Shine 2011, we plan to make new  investments and loans totaling approximately 150.0  billion over the two-year period ending March 31,  2012. During the year ended March 31, 2011, we  made a total of 73.0 billion in new investments and  loans, thus progressing steadily toward a stronger  earnings foundation.   In the core Energy & Metal Division, we signi cantly  expanded our interest in a coal business in Australia,  while in our rare metals business we invested in a  Brazilian niobium producer and added to our  molybdenum interests in Canada.   Sojitz also made numerous new investments and  loans in areas outside of the Energy & Metal Division,  including contracts for three independent power  producer (IPP) projects in the Middle East. In other  moves, we built on our traditional focus on logistics in  the Chemicals & Functional Materials Division with the  decision to further enhance our strength in rare earths  by acquiring an equity stake in Lynas Corporation  Limited of Australia. Moreover, the divisions  investment in a marine chemical project in India to  produce potash fertilizer and industrial salt was a  signi cant accomplishment. Elsewhere, we established  an agricultural business in Argentina to build our  position in this new  eld, which I strongly expect to  grow in strategic signi cance in the future.   Sojitz focuses on asset reallocation in making new  investments and loans. We avoid expanding our  balance sheet, keeping our  nances sound by  structuring a balanced portfolio of businesses and  earnings. In the year ended March 31, 2011, we  maintained a sound  nancial position and met the  targets of Shine 2011 with an equity ratio of 15.6%, a  net debt equity ratio of 2.1 times, and a ratio of risk  assets to shareholders equity of 0.9 times as of March  31, 2011. Our credit rating remained BBB.

We certainly need to meet our target for  earnings. At the same time, we will gear  up efforts to strengthen our earnings  foundation with a focus on future growth.   The year ending March 31, 2012 is the conclusion  of Shine 2011. It is a critical 12 months in which we  will set the stage for full-scale growth during the  subsequent medium-term management plan. We  intend to gear up and accelerate our efforts to  establish a strong earnings foundation.   The impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake,  currency movements and other factors forced us to  revise our quantitative targets of 56.0 billion for  ordinary income and 25.0 billion for net income to  46.0 billion and 16.0 billion, respectively. These   gures are essentially the same as our results for the  year ended March 31, 2011. The factors necessitating  the revisions were external and unforeseen, but I am   rmly convinced that we can achieve our targets now  that we have revised them.   Similarly, I am emphasizing new investments and  loans to achieve future growth. We plan to make new  investments and loans in the 70.0 to 80.0 billion  range to accumulate the quality assets that will be  integral to establishing a strong earnings foundation  for the next medium-term management plan.   Sojitz intends to maintain cash dividends per share  at 3.00 for the year ending March 31, 2012 to  provide stable, continuous dividends while addressing  issues such as increasing internal capital reserves to  enhance corporate value.  Please explain your strategies for gear- ing up initiatives to strengthen the  earnings foundation.     We will accelerate overseas business de- velopment while concentrating on ex- panding existing businesses, expanding  resource businesses and cultivating future  business fundamentals.   Given that emerging countries are driving the global  economy, Sojitz clearly must accelerate overseas busi- ness development and expand its earnings foundation  in emerging countries and elsewhere. In doing so, we  are executing three key strategies of Shine 2011: ex- panding existing businesses, expanding resource busi- nesses and cultivating future business fundamentals. Expand and enhance energy and mineral resource interests Expansion of resource portfolio Recovery of fertilizer business Strengthen existing businesses Recovery of automotive business Strengthening of overseas business foundation Shine 2011 Expand resource businesses  Mineral resources Food resources Forest resources Expand and enhance energy and mineral resource interests rests Expansion of resource portfolio Recovery of fertilizer business Strengthen existing businesses Recovery of automotive business Strengthening of overseas business foundation Shine 2011 Expand resource businesses  Mineral resources ces Food res urces Food resources Forest resources Cultivate future business fundamentals  New energy and environment Agribusiness Year ended March 31, 2010: Strengthen foundation for sustained growth April 1, 2010 – March 31, 2012: Establish earnings foundation April 1, 2012 and beyond: Toward sustained growth Expand existing businesses  Establishing a Strong Earnings Foundation during Shine 2011 Q Q A A Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 15 An Interview with President  An Interview with President  & CEO Yutaka Kase & CEO Yutaka Kase An Interview with President  & CEO Yutaka Kase    In expanding existing businesses, we are  concentrating on adding to our energy and mineral  resource interests because they are a source of stable,  long-term earnings. In addition to expanding existing  interests, we are acquiring interests in coal, rare  metals, and non-ferrous metals such as copper and  alumina, areas in which we have a competitive  advantage and where we expect demand to increase  in the future. Expansion of our Australian coal  interests substantially increased our share of coal  production, which we expect to reach approximately  7 million tons in the year ending March 31, 2012. We  will continue to concentrate on expanding existing  coal interests to further raise our share of production.  In the rare metals business, we acquired an equity  stake in a Brazilian niobium producer with world- leading market share, thus building a stable, long- term supply structure. Sojitz will expand its interests  and product offerings in the rare metals business,  which is well suited to its capabilities. Moreover, Sojitz  will deploy its many years of experience in the IPP  plant business to win contracts for projects in  Southeast Asia and the Middle East, where demand  for power is growing. We will also grow the  automotive business in Southeast Asia and in Central  and South America. In the chemicals and functional  materials business, we will build on recent upstream  investments and loans in areas such as rare earths and  industrial salt that enhanced our earnings foundation.  While investing in businesses and other quality assets,  we will further strengthen our value chains.   Expanding resource businesses will involve  accelerating business development with an emphasis on  securing food resources. We have a signi cant advanced  chemical fertilizer business in Southeast Asia, and are  moving to serve additional areas such as Indonesia.  In Vietnam, we completed the largest specialized port  for grains in the ASEAN region. This port infrastructure  is a strength we will use to expand earnings in the  grain business. Sojitz also operates a tuna farm and a  shrimp farm in the marine products business, which we  have targeted for full-scale expansion to secure  marine resources.   Cultivating future business fundamentals is  strategic in terms of medium-to-long-term growth.  Sojitz is concentrating on two key areas: new energy  and environment, and agribusiness. In the bioethanol  business, a major business integration in Brazil in  February 2010 created one of the worlds largest  producers of sugar cane-based bioethanol. We will  work to grow this business in the future. In the solar  power generation business, Sojitz is aggressively  moving to build a value chain integrated from the  silicon metal used as a solar panel raw material to  power generation. Further, Sojitz will carefully  monitor risks in strengthening the agricultural  business it initiated in Argentina in 2010. What kind of management will Sojitz  promote to achieve the sustained growth  it is aiming for beyond Shine 2011?     We will build both the scale and quality of  earnings by concentrating the deployment  of resources in businesses and regions in  which Sojitz is strong.   We are formulating our next medium-term  management plan so I cannot be too speci c, but I  can outline our current concept.   First is the scale of earnings. I want Sojitz to get  back to ordinary income of 100.0 billion, the level  prior to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, as quickly  as possible. However, the source of Sojitzs earnings  will shift from the focus on trading (distribution) prior  Q A Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 16 An Interview with President & CEO Yutaka Kase  to the Lehman collapse to earnings that we generate  from quality assets such as investments in interests  and businesses.    We will make this transition by concentrating  near-term allocation of resources in the Energy &  Metal Division. This will help us build a strong  earnings foundation, because the resource business is  currently driving earnings. At the same time, we will  accelerate the structural reforms currently under way  in the Machinery, Chemicals & Functional Materials  and Consumer Lifestyle Business divisions to increase  pro tability in non-resource businesses while  increasing the scale of earnings. I want to promote  these initiatives to build a portfolio in the future with  equivalent proportions of resource and non-resource  assets and earnings.   One key will be concentrating the deployment of  resources in businesses and regions in which Sojitz is  strong to accumulate quality assets. This will be  highly effective in strengthening our earnings  foundation, because investment and asset ef ciency  are high in these businesses and regions, and  quantifying risk and building partnerships are  relatively easy.    Currently we have established the Sojitz name in a  number of areas, including Africa and scarce  resources such as rare metals and rare earths.  Increasing our involvement in unique regions and  businesses such as these is directly related to  accumulating quality assets. Only eight years have  elapsed since the merger that created Sojitz. As a  young company, we intend to enhance our presence  and make the Sojitz brand known globally through  these initiatives. (Please see the feature article Many Banners, One Sojitz on pages 19 to  27 for a detailed explanation of Sojitzs initiatives to further reinforce  activities in businesses and regions in which it is strong.) Sojitz operates in a broad array of  countries. Please explain Sojitzs focus  in CSR.     We will continue to focus on CSR priority  themes in responding to the expectations  of society. At the same time, the Sojitz  Group will unite to carry out its most  pressing CSR task: supporting reconstruc- tion in the aftermath of the Great East  Japan Earthquake.   Sojitz believes that CSR is a management responsi- bility. Our CSR consists of ful lling our responsibilities  as a trading company by stably securing and supplying  goods and resources, and contributing to the industrial  development of many countries through our various  corporate activities. At the same time, we believe that  conducting corporate activities with consideration of  the environment and society leads to the sustained  development of both Sojitz and the communities we  serve. For this reason, we joined the United Nations  Global Compact in April 2009.

During the year ended March 31, 2011, we  continued to concentrate on responding to societys  expectations with a focus on these themes.   In addition to the CSR initiatives we undertake  through our businesses, we also energetically engage  in activities that contribute to regions and local  communities. A project that supports education in  Tanzania is representative. Building on its traditionally  deep relationships in Africa, Sojitz has constructed a  pre-school facility in a village and provided study  materials to the children. In the year ending March  31, 2012, we plan to improve sanitation and nutrition  conditions of the village. We also plan to build a  second pre-school facility in another village as part of  our ongoing activities aimed at co-existence with  local communities.   Our biggest and most pressing CSR task in the year  ending March 31, 2012, however, is supporting  reconstruction in the aftermath of the Great East Japan  Earthquake. As I mentioned earlier, we have important  responsibilities as a trading company and a Japanese  corporation. As a member of society, the Sojitz Group  will unite in undertaking support activities under the  theme of working toward a brighter future for the  people and local community with the goal of  completing reconstruction as quickly as possible. In closing, please share your vision and  intentions for the future with stake- holders.     Sojitz will meet the expectations of stake- holders by overcoming the challenges it  faces while maintaining its swift advance  toward sustained growth.   The twenty- rst century is the century of the  emerging country. For a trading company, these  emerging countries will be large markets with power  that will sometimes create rivalry and sometimes  strong partnerships. The opportunities that emerging  countries offer are virtually limitless, and the  businesses we can enter and collaboratively develop  are countless. I am con dent that the century of the  emerging country will also be the century of the  trading company.   As global competition intensi es, Sojitz will  capture these business opportunities and accelerate  overseas business development. Collaborating with a  wide array of partners will be key. An order Sojitz  recently received for a fertilizer plant in the Republic  of Tatarstan, Russia is a good example. Rather than  simply involving Japanese partners, the deal involves  a team of four partner companies from Japan, China  and Russia. Bringing together optimum members  with superior competitive advantages from each  country has maximized competitiveness. Our network  of excellent partners around the world is an asset we  intend to utilize fully to create quality businesses. This  is our surest way to prevail against global competition  and achieve sustained growth.   I have instructed Sojitz employees to energetically  examine every growth opportunity that arises to  create businesses that are unique to Sojitz. These  initiatives are gradually yielding results and creating a  strong earnings foundation. We will promote the  initiatives I have explained here to strengthen our  earnings foundation and move us within striking  distance of our key performance targets of ROA of  3% and ROE of 15%.   We expect a dif cult business environment due to  factors such as the impact of the Great East Japan  Earthquake. However, Sojitz will move even more  quickly as it continues to take on challenges with the  aim of sustained growth.   Sojitz is absolutely determined to meet the  expectations of stakeholders by overcoming the  challenges it faces while maintaining its swift advance  toward sustained growth. Q A Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 18 An Interview with President & CEO Yutaka Kase  Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 19 Feature: Many Banners, One Sojitz Sojitz is known as a supplier of scarce resources. And it is known as a leader in business  development in Africa. These are among the many banners that define Sojitz because of  its broad array of strengths in multiple regions and businesses. This feature article  describes several Sojitz initiatives to concentrate the deployment of resources under  these banners, to build its presence in regions and businesses in which it is strong. Sojitz is building on the many representative businesses and regional affiliations it has  created in implementing a new phase of initiatives to generate sustained growth.  We want Sojitz banners   The Sojitz banner flies in areas in which the Company is strong  – regions and businesses in which we have a thorough  understanding and a broadly based network. We are able to  quickly and efficiently strengthen our earnings foundation in  these areas because we can develop business ahead of other  companies and identify risks more easily.  Sojitz is building its global presence by creating operations in  many regions and businesses. We intend to accelerate such  business development because it is the fastest way to generate  sustained growth.  We will continue to unfurl Sojitz banners worldwide. Yutaka Kase President & CEO  Sojitz is building a powerful business base in ASEAN, from fertilizer and  automobile sales in Thailand to LNG development and production in  Indonesia, forest products in Malaysia, and nickel in the Philippines. In  Vietnam, Sojitz contributed in many ways to the post-war recovery and  now has a strong position in businesses including chemical fertilizer, flour  milling, port silos, power generation, industrial parks, and woodchips and  afforestation. Sojitz will further enhance its presence in ASEAN by  accelerating business development.  Sojitzs Brazilian bioethanol business is expected to become  the worlds largest producer of sugar cane-based bioethanol.  We will continue to expand production capacity to enhance our  ability to supply the  rapidly growing  global market for  biofuels.  Sojitz is a leader  among trading  companies handling  industrial salt, which  is an irreplaceable  raw material for  inorganic chemicals.  We are now building on a recent investment in a marine  chemical business in India involved in industrial salt and potash  fertilizer from production to marketing.

Feature: Many  Banners, One Sojitz  Brazil has been Sojitzs base for developing business in Central and  South America since Sojitz established a subsidiary there in the 1950s.  Complementing its industry-leading trading volume in iron ore, Sojitz has  taken an equity stake in a Brazilian company that is a leading global  producer of the rare metal niobium. Our broad range of businesses in  Brazil also includes a bioethanol company that is integrated from sugar  cane cultivation to bioethanol and sugar production, and the first oil  development project involving Japanese companies to commence crude oil  production. We employ our advantageous relationships with outstanding  Brazilian partner companies such as Petrleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras),  Brazils national oil company, in concentrating on the continuous creation  of businesses that are unique to Sojitz.  Sojitz operates a  methanol  manufacturer in  Indonesia, and sells  its output and other  companies  methanol in Asia,  Europe and North  America. Our annual methanol trading volume is now 1 million  tons. Strengths in areas such as delivery drive this companys  business model, which we intend to employ in developing  business in other regions.  Sojitz has been involved in power generation for more than  two decades, and positions it as a key business that will be a  stable source of earnings over the medium-to-long term. The  business has generated steady success, including participation  in three independent power producer (IPP) projects in the  Middle East during  the year ended  March 31, 2011,  and Sojitz will  continue to  aggressively acquire  new orders.

We have  one of the largest domestic trading volumes of  these resources and a portfolio of interests that  covers a broad range of products, including the  seven primary rare metals. Sojitz is therefore able  to build on its solid position.  Sojitz has been a driving force in rare metals and  rare earths since the 1970s, and has extremely close  relationships with customers and suppliers.  Customers appreciate that we have interests in  these resources that are termed rare because only  a few areas supply them, as well as our long-term  record of continuous, stable supply and specialized  expertise. We have increased the number of  customers we serve despite the historical volatility  of conditions in the rare metals and rare earths  markets, building strong bonds of trust with  suppliers through sustained procurement and a  history of collaboration.   The rare metals and rare earths markets have a  specialized supply and demand structure. Sojitz  handles the volumes and broad product line  needed to balance demand and supply and deliver  value to the market as a whole. We are proud of  our accomplishments as a trading company.  The markets for scarce resources are expected to  expand significantly in the future. Demand for rare  metals that are essential for high-grade steel  products is likely to increase further because of  expansion of global crude steel production and the  ongoing development of the high-end steel  segment. Demand for rare earths is also forecast to  increase steadily because they are crucial materials  for products ranging from electric vehicles to  magnets and electronic components.  Given this environment, Sojitz has focused  investment on outstanding upstream interests with  the aim of building a stable supply framework. In  the year ended March 31, 2011, we began  expanding our existing molybdenum interests and  have made new investments and loans for two  highly significant projects.  One of these involves the rare metal niobium. We  invested in and concluded a long-term offtake  agreement with Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia  e Minerao (CBMM), a Brazilian company that  produces 70 thousand tons of niobium annually and  has an overwhelming share of the global market.  Sojitz has built solid trust with CBMM over more  than 40 years as trading partners, and the niobium  procurement framework that Sojitz has structured is  extremely close-knit.  The other project involved investment in Lynas  Corporation Limited, which develops rare earth  resources in Australia. We signed a long-term  procurement agreement with Lynas under which we  will supply 8,000 to 9,000 tons of rare earths to the  Japanese market annually. This is approximately  30% of rare earth consumption in Japan. About  90% of global rare earth production is concentrated  in China, underscoring the importance of adding  stability to the supply of rare earths by diversifying  supply sources.  Sojitz is also expanding existing interests.  Expansion is currently in progress at a molybdenum  mine in Canada that will increase production by  approximately 60%. We plan to raise our share of  production to about 2,000 tons annually by 2012.  We are also moving forward with plans to increase  production at a tungsten mine in Portugal by  improving operating efficiency.  Sojitz will also work actively to accumulate quality  interests in areas in which it is not yet number one,  including rare metals such as manganese and a variety  of medium and heavy rare earths.   Our progress in the rare metals and rare earths  businesses symbolizes our initiatives to enhance its  capabilities in areas in which we are strong. We will  continue to fulfill our mission as a leading company  to ensure a stable, sustained supply by targeting  further growth. A solid position built over 40 years.

In addition to  rising demand for food-grade grains, demand for feed- use grains is also expanding strongly because of the  rapid increase in meat consumption in emerging  countries with changes in dietary customs. However,  the amount of land under cultivation worldwide is not  growing. As a result, the balance of demand and  supply is tight.   Given these circumstances, food is an important  resource. The agribusinesses of fertilizer and agriculture  are key to increasing production of and securing food  resources. Sojitz has therefore designated them as key  businesses and is aggressively developing them. In  particular, since fertilizer is essential to increasing grain  production, Sojitz sees its mission as exercising its potent  and unique strengths in the fertilizer business to  generate additional growth. Fertilizer is central to Sojitzs  agribusinesses. With operating companies handling  advanced chemical fertilizer production and sales in  Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, Sojitz has built  the largest advanced chemical fertilizer production  capacity and sales network in Southeast Asia. Compared  to straight fertilizers, advanced chemical fertilizers can  significantly increase crop yields. They therefore  contribute to increased food production in emerging  countries, where demand for food is growing rapidly.  Our products have the leading share of the market for  advanced chemical fertilizers in each of these countries  because we have been serving them for 40 years, and  our brands are consistently trusted for their quality.  We are now expanding the fertilizer business beyond  Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines into contiguous  countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. In  Indonesia, a promising growth market, we aim to build  a production and marketing business. We have  targeted the start of distribution and sales in  collaboration with an Indonesian partner during the  year ending March 31, 2012. Sojitz will leverage the  strong name it has cultivated in fertilizer over many  years to take its fertilizer business to a higher level.  Agriculture is a new challenge for Sojitz in supplying  food resources that will complement its contribution to  increased food production through the fertilizer business.  Conventionally, general trading companies such as  Sojitz have not been deeply involved in large-scale  agricultural production and processing businesses  overseas. A major reason was that these businesses are  heavily influenced by external factors including weather  and insect damage that make risks difficult to manage.  However, circumstances have changed significantly for  reasons including the use of weather insurance,  geographical diversification through leasing, and  technological advances that have improved varieties of  agricultural commodities. Because of these changes,  Sojitz has expanded into the upstream food resource  business of agriculture.  Sojitz initiated a full-scale agricultural business by  establishing a subsidiary in Argentina, Sojitz Buenas  Tierras del Sur S.A., during the year ended March 31,  2011. Sojitz decided to develop this business in  Argentina because it found an outstanding partner,  and restrictions on the participation of foreign  companies are few. Other merits included a well- developed market for leasing agricultural land. This  venture will concentrate on producing soybeans,  demand for which is expected to grow dramatically as  a feed crop, as well as other grains including corn,  wheat and sunflowers. Sojitz will export the harvest to  Japan and other countries in Asia. We have achieved  steady production and shipments, and see great  promise for future growth in this business.  Sojitz plans to rapidly expand the area under  cultivation from the current 11 thousand hectares to  approximately 300 thousand hectares in five years to  build a business that can make a substantial contribution  to earnings. This will raise crop yield to about 1 million  tons, which will give us a solid market presence.  In the near term, Sojitz plans to expand in South  America in Argentina and Brazil, where it is strong and  which have significant potential for growth. We are also  looking at future development in Africa and elsewhere  as we nurture agriculture into a full-blown business. Sojitzs fertilizer business supports agriculture in Southeast Asia.

For example, Sojitz began exporting cotton  from Egypt to Japan in the 1890s, and in 1923  became the first Japanese general trading company  to establish a representative office in Egypt. We  have financed and developed oilfields in Angola that  contributed to the countrys recovery from civil war,  constructed pipelines in Kenya and developed  resources in South Africa. These initiatives show  how we have helped African nations develop  indigenous industries through our businesses. And  as a result of such initiatives, Sojitz has built an  extensive network of relationships in Africa. We  have gained strong trust among government  officials and the leading companies we partner with  particularly in countries such as Angola and Nigeria.  The future potential of African markets is  enormous. For example, the population of Africa  is expected to grow rapidly, doubling from  approximately 1 billion today to about 2 billion in  2050, representing an increase from approximately  15% to 25% of the global population. Yet the  country risk of African nations is high, and issues  are numerous.  Based on Sojitzs advantages and the business  environment in Africa, we are taking a medium-to- long term approach in African markets. We are  identifying projects that have the potential to  quickly contribute to earnings while creating  future sources of earnings as well. We have  dispatched strategic personnel* to Africa twice,  and opportunities for various new projects have  emerged. In April 2011, we moved to realize  potential with actual business by dispatching  additional personnel to Africa. We are now  deepening our partner strategy and strengthening  collaboration with existing partners in various  countries, while finding new and reliable partners. * People selected from each business division to take on missions that include  developing specific projects and building our operating foundation  To remain as a leader in Africa, it is crucial for us  to create businesses that set us apart from others in  terms of scale and profitability, matching businesses  in which we have a competitive edge with countries  where we can exercise our strengths. Moreover, we  must contribute to society through our business  activities as we have done in the past, developing  businesses that vitalize industries in the countries  where we operate. We therefore focus on  development of infrastructure, resources, energy,  and indigenous demand.  Developing new businesses is not easy, but we  have made steady progress through our day-to-day  activities. Preparations to launch the woodchip  business in Mozambique during the year ending  March 31, 2012 are proceeding steadily, and we  continue to strengthen relationships with partner  companies in building businesses including fertilizer,  agriculture, foodstuffs and energy in selected  countries in Africa.   My focus in developing businesses is to link them  organically to exercise Sojitzs many strengths rather  than treating each business discretely. For example,  rather than limiting our efforts to a gas exploration  project, we need to diversify into businesses such as  LNG, fertilizer plants and power generation as well.  Sojitz has divisions organized by product, so people  like me who manage regions and operating bases  must use our local relationships to tie businesses  together in our respective regions to increase  business opportunities.  Sojitz will use its solid advantages in Africa to  attain the leading position and create future sources  of earnings.

Each segment was profitable against a backdrop  of recovery in global demand, especially in  emerging countries. Sojitz made new investments  and loans for large-scale coal and niobium projects  in the energy and mineral resource sector that will  generate earnings in the future, as well as  investments and loans to build existing businesses  including rare earths, marine chemicals  encompassing industrial salt and potash fertilizer,  and the independent power producer (IPP)  business. We also began participating in new  businesses such as agriculture in Argentina.  During the year ending March 31, 2012, the  final year of the Shine 2011 medium-term  management plan, Sojitz will further strengthen its  efforts to enhance its earnings foundation. In  accumulating quality assets, we will emphasize  speed and efficiency in initiatives such as  expanding existing projects and building operations  in businesses and regions where we are strong. In  the near term, we will focus on investments and  loans in energy and mineral resource interests.  Going forward, we will build a strong earnings  foundation by increasing involvement in food  resources, forestry resources, new energy and the  environment, which are areas with considerable  growth potential where Sojitz can effectively  exercise its strengths.  The world changes with each minute, which  gives a general trading company such as Sojitz  unlimited opportunities. All Sojitz employees will  share opportunities and issues in proactively and  boldly taking on the challenge of achieving  sustained growth.

This was  primarily due to progress in restructuring our  automotive business, which recorded a considerable  loss in the previous fiscal year. We worked to reduce  inventory and use assets more efficiently in the Russia  and NIS automotive business, which was in a slump in  the previous fiscal year. At the same time, we  established a mechanism to comprehensively gauge  and manage risk exposure, as well as a system for  managing currency fluctuations and other risks. We  successfully expanded earnings by focusing on the  fast-growing regions of Asia and Central and South  America. In the Venezuela automotive business, we  addressed labor problems through labor-management  agreements and are returning to stable production.    The infrastructure business picked up significantly.  We received orders for three large IPP projects in Saudi  Arabia and Oman, and concluded an agreement for a  large-scale fertilizer plant in the Republic of Tatarstan  in Russia. Having steadily accumulated a backlog of  orders in the year ended March 31, 2011, we expect  stable earnings in the future.   In the IT business, we initiated and completed a  takeover bid to acquire a majority interest in equity- method affiliate SAKURA Internet Inc., making it our  consolidated subsidiary. This action will lead our  information and communication technology (ICT)  business to further growth.    The marine business remained relatively firm over  the course of the year despite a sharp drop in cargo  movement in the dry bulk carrier business due to  flooding in Australia. In the aircraft business, we  continued our steady performance as Japans top sales  representative for commercial aircraft. In the promising  growth area of business jets, we established a  foothold in the Philippines with a business that  operates six aircraft.  Strategies for the Future    We have established a new mission for the division:  Lead new businesses with technological innovation, and  Machinery Division In the year ended March 31, 2011, the  Machinery Division improved earnings in  the automotive business and achieved  profitability across the board. We will  continue moving toward sustained  growth through ongoing improvement of  our earnings foundation and by shifting  to businesses that provide long-term,  steadily growing returns.  Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 32  Review of Business  Operations create new value by establishing and operating public  and production infrastructure. Based on this mission,  we will advance initiatives aimed at sustained growth.  We will continue working to improve our earnings  foundation. At the same time, with a focus on strong  growth in the next medium-term management plan,  we will expand investment in businesses that provide  long-term, steadily growing returns. The business  reform verification team established in April 2011 will  lead a thorough examination of asset efficiency,  drastically narrow its focus on priority areas, enhance  growth sectors and aggressively reallocate assets.    Specifically, in the automotive business, we aim to  maximize earnings while continuing to strictly manage  risk exposure. We expect significant improvements in  profitability in Russia, the NIS and Venezuela. At the  same time, we will grow the business in Southeast  Asia and Central and South America, where robust  demand can be expected.    In the infrastructure business, we will step up  active investment in the plant business, which we  expect to contribute to earnings over the medium-to- long term. We aim to aggressively build a backlog of  orders in fertilizer plants and also actively invest in the  IPP business to accumulate good assets. These  businesses are the key to realizing steady returns over  the medium-to-long term.    In the IT business, we will work to achieve  significant growth in the promising ICT business by  strengthening coordination among Group companies  with a focus on Nissho Electronics Corporation, which  became a subsidiary in the year ended March 31,  2010. We will grow earnings from service businesses  such as cloud platform and IT outsourcing, which we  hope to develop into fields of expertise for Sojitz.    In the marine business, we will continue to secure  income from our stable earnings foundation of ship- owning, newbuilding and second-hand ship trading.  At the same time, we will develop new products in the  environment and energy conservation fields, and focus  on market development in Central and South America.  In the aircraft business, we will expand the range of  products handled by our sales representative business  while strengthening the promising growth areas of  business jets and components.    In addition, in April 2011, we established the  Environment & Urban Infrastructure Development  Office under direct control of the Machinery Division.  Through this office, we intend to strengthen inter- and  intra-divisional coordination to build a multi-faceted  business in the field of smart cities, a market with  considerable growth potential.    In the past, the Machinery Division was a major  pillar of earnings for Sojitz. Although we were not  able to contribute to earnings in the past two years,  the structural reforms we enacted got us through the  crisis and have invigorated the division. By fully  exercising our unique ability to organize projects,  we will create synergies with other divisions and grow  once more into an earnings driver for Sojitz. 10 11 12 (Forecast) 56.2 68.0 56.1 80 (Billions of yen) 60 20 40 0 (Years ended / ending March 31) 10 11 12 (Forecast) (Years ended / ending March 31) (4.1) 7.5 2.0 10 (Billions of yen) 5 (5) 0 (10) Gross Trading Profit Ordinary Income (Loss) Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 33 Yoshihisa Suzuki President, Machinery Division    Fast-developing countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and other regions  are planning numerous IPP projects open to foreign investment to address rapidly  rising demand for electricity.

Operating Environment    The key markets of Russia and the NIS have begun to recover.  Demand remains solid in Southeast Asia while markets in Latin  America are expanding steadily.   Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   Sojitz has an upstream-to-downstream value chain in the auto- motive business that extends from production-related fields such  as equipment and engineering to CBU vehicle export, local vehicle  assembly, wholesale, retail and beyond, to tires and components.  We are looking to expand the earnings foundation by operating  world-class, cost-competitive automobile import and sales busi- nesses in growing emerging countries.    Strategies for the Future   In the year ended March 31, 2011, Sojitz established a mecha- nism for comprehensively monitoring and managing exposure.  We will employ this mechanism to thoroughly manage risk while  conducting asset replacement. At the same time, we aim to   optimize our portfolio with a focus on rapidly growing emerging  countries.  Operating Environment    Focused on emerging and resource-rich countries, which were  the first to recover after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, demand  remains strong for backbone infrastructure: steel, fertilizer, energy  and power plants. Business opportunities are expanding in these  sectors, including opportunities to invest in businesses and to sell  advanced technologies.  Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   Sojitz has cultivated expertise in large-scale projects through a  track record of results built by working closely with top global  manufactures and developers. We have also accumulated exten- sive knowledge of building strong networks in Asia, the Middle  East, Russia and the NIS and Africa, where we have concentrated  management resources. These strengths enable us to respond precisely to various consumer needs.    Strategies for the Future   Sojitz has positioned the IPP business as a key sector and aims  to accumulate outstanding assets globally as long-term stable  sources of earnings. We are also working to increase the number  of orders in our plant business. These initiatives will help establish  a strong earnings foundation.

Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   Sojitz is taking steps to firmly establish stock-type IT services  that are in tune with current trends. We have positioned Nissho  Electronics Corporation, a comprehensive IT solution provider, as  the core company of our information and communication tech- nology (ICT) business. We are also promoting coordination among  Group companies such as Sojitz Systems Corporation and  SAKURA Internet Inc., which have unique strengths in a variety of  ICT fields. Strategies for the Future   Sojitz will expand the IT services business of Nissho Electronics and  develop it in Asian markets. We will also strengthen the business in  the field of software and services by pursuing capital alliances with IT  service providers in Japan and overseas.  Operating Environment    The dry bulk carrier market, the focus of our shipping business,  was firm throughout the year despite the effects of flooding in  Australia. In the airline industry, the defense business is  experiencing environmental changes, but the commercial aircraft  agency business is stable.   Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   The strength of our marine business is our ability to provide  one-stop, comprehensive services encompassing maritime and  shipbuilding fields from ship equipment, newbuilding, second- hand ships and ship chartering to ship owning. In the aircraft busi- ness, Sojitz is the sales representative for major overseas manufac- turers. We also offer comprehensive business jet services from  sales to operational management as a result of our association  with Aviation Concepts Inc., which has a U.S. air operating certifi- cate for on-demand charter flights.     Strategies for the Future   In the marine business, Sojitz will expand business with overseas  shipyards and equipment manufacturers and develop new environ- ment-related products in fields such as water treatment and wind  power generation. We will also cultivate new business in the markets  of Central and South America. In our ship-owning business, we will  continue to replace assets. In the aircraft business, we will develop  the parts business and the business-jet business in Asia.

Based on this theme, our aggressive initiatives in the year ended March 31, 2011 generated  significant results in terms of both earnings and investment.    We significantly expanded income through  increased trading volumes of products including  coal and ferroalloys, and strong performance in the  steel business. Earnings from trading were steady  amid expanding demand in emerging countries  including China and other Asian nations, in  addition to solid returns from prime assets  accumulated in the past.    It was also a significant year in terms of  investment. We made multiple investments for  future growth under a policy of focusing on large- scale projects. Our coal project is particularly  noteworthy. We raised our stake in the Minerva Coal  Joint Venture in Australia to 96%, expanding our  share of production and assuming control of coal  mine operations. With the expertise we gain in  operations, we aim to expand the scope of this  business and achieve significant growth in the future.  As the leading importer of rare metals to Japan,  Sojitz initiated one of its largest ever investment  projects by acquiring shares in a Brazilian niobium  producer. Demand is expected to grow for niobium, a  rare metal indispensable to the production of high- grade steel. Given the Brazilian companys top share  in the global market for niobium, we foresee stable  returns and have strong expectations that the long- term offtake agreement we concluded will boost  earnings in trading. We also made an additional  investment in the Lake Vermont Coal Mine in  Australia, as well as in alumina and molybdenum, to  increase our share of production. In the energy  business, we steadily increased our share of  production by adding to our oil field interests in  Qatar and commencing oil production at the Phoenix  Oil Field in the United States. Energy & Metal Division In the year ended March 31, 2011, we  made a number of investments for future  growth, generating significant results.  Looking ahead, as we accelerate  investments in prime assets that will  drive growth over the next 10 to 20  years, we will enhance our trading  business and build a strong earnings  foundation for sustained growth.  Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 36  Review of Business  Operations Strategies for the Future    In the year ending March 31, 2012, the final  year of Shine 2011, we will generate steady  earnings from our recently expanded investment  portfolio and also enhance trading. In coal and  other mineral resources, we aim to expand earnings  by accurately meeting strong demand in China,  Asia, and Central and South America in addition to  trading products destined for Japan.    Aiming for sustained growth, we will continue  to emphasize acquisition of prime assets and  improvement of asset efficiency through asset  reallocation. In addition to accumulating prime  assets, we are poised to make focused investments  in projects in which we can be truly competitive:  projects in large markets, sectors with growth  potential, and areas in which we are traditionally  strong. Coal, for example, is an area in which we  are strong. We expect our investments in the year  ended March 31, 2011 to boost our total share of  coal production to about 7 million tons, and plan to  further accelerate investment in the future. We will  also step up efforts to develop new iron ore mines  to address the expected increase in demand as the  economies of emerging countries expand. In the  energy business, we will respond to new proposals  including development of unconventional shale oil  and gas in the United States. Moreover, in new  energy and environment, a key field for the entire  Company, we will aggressively develop business.  Initiatives will include expanding the business of the  Brazilian bioethanol producer that is expected to  become the industrys largest in 2014, and  advancing into high-purity silicon metal used in  solar panels.    Energy and mineral resources are key areas  requiring a long-term approach. Most of our  current earnings are based on investments made 10  to 20 years ago; we see many examples in which  Sojitzs advantageous position is directly tied to  supply sources built up over decades of  transactions. The mission of our division is to make  maximum use of the earnings foundation and  relationships with customers and suppliers that we  have built over time, and to accelerate investment  in prime assets that will drive future growth.  Achieving this mission makes it critical that we view  human resource development from a medium-to- long-term standpoint. We will therefore cultivate  highly skilled personnel with broad perspectives  through measures including active job rotation  within and outside the division to provide varied  work experience. Through such initiatives, we are  aiming for sustained growth. 10 11 12 (Forecast) (Years ended / ending March 31) 37.1 48.0 41.7 60 (Billions of yen) 40 20 0 10 11 12 (Forecast) (Years ended / ending March 31) 12.6 29.5 28.7 30 (Billions of yen) 20 10 0 Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 37 Gross Trading Profit Ordinary Income Shigeki Dantani President, Energy & Metal Division  Main Businesses of the Energy & Metal Division Energy Development  Focusing on acquisition of upstream energy interests and securing  regionally balanced interests Coal and Copper Businesses  Pursuing synergies between trading and investment growth Al Karkara Oil Field, offshore Qatar Lake Vermont Coal Mine in  Australia Operating Environment   Despite political instability in North Africa and the Middle  East and other destabilizing factors, global energy demand is  expected to continue expanding, especially in emerging  countries. At the same time, attention is focused on factors  expected to have a medium-to-long-term impact on energy- related businesses, such as the promotion of renewable  energy in Japan and overseas and the possible revision of  energy plans in Japan. Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   In the oil and gas upstream interests business, Sojitz aims  to increase its prime assets by diversifying investment through  its global network. We contribute to Japans energy industry  in the nuclear power business with our experience and know- how as distributing agent in Japan for Areva NC of France. Strategies for the Future   Sojitz aims to raise the efficiency of its upstream oil and  gas interest assets. At the same time, we will maintain a  sound risk-return profile by promoting a regionally diverse  portfolio and securing new interests. We will achieve steady  earnings from the shale oil, gas and tight-sand gas business- es, which are gaining attention as unconventional oil and gas  sources. Operating Environment   Demand for copper, aluminum and other base metals in  emerging markets is expected to increase. In addition, coal is  expected to continue playing an important role in energy  supply due to its fairly even regional distribution, abundant  reserves, and price competitiveness. Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   The coal business has several outstanding interests in  Australia and Indonesia, and the top share of coal imports to  Japan from Russia and Indonesia. Moreover, we have begun  managing a coal mine in Australia. The non-ferrous metals  business acquired a 12.5% equity interest in the Gibraltar  Copper Mine in Canada, making it an earnings driver along  with world-leading Worsley Aluminas integrated bauxite and  alumina production business. Strategies for the Future   In the coal business, we have positioned trading and  upstream interests as the twin pillars of growth, and will work  for a stable supply of coal by continuing to increase produc- tion volume and maximize earnings from existing interests. In  the non-ferrous metals business, we will work to strengthen  the business foundation based on upstream interests in alumi- na and copper.

Demand is  expected to grow firmly with economic development over the  medium-to-long-term, especially in emerging countries.  Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   Sojitz is further strengthening synergies in the field of rare  metals by trading and securing interests. Our rare metal mine  investments include molybdenum, tungsten and nickel in the  Americas, Europe and Asia. We have also acquired an interest  in a niobium mine in Brazil. In the import of iron ore, Sojitz  ranks in the top group of importers to Japan, where the prod- uct comes mainly from Brazil. In addition to trading, we are  focusing on developing our iron ore mine interests in West  Australia.  Strategies for the Future   We will fortify our business base for rare metals, a strong  area for Sojitz, through initiatives such as expansion projects  at our existing interests. The iron ore business will establish its  earnings foundation through its traditional sales to Japan  while promoting the development of iron ore interests in  Australia. Operating Environment   Demand for sugarcane-based bioethanol is growing,  primarily in major producer Brazil, due to its effectiveness in  reducing CO2 emissions. Demand for other renewable  energies such as solar power, solar thermal and biomass is  also expected to increase.  Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   We will continue to promote new business development to  expand company-wide environmental and new energy busi- nesses. In collaboration with our existing energy businesses,  we will work to quickly establish the earnings foundation  through initiatives in biofuel, solar power, solar thermal and  other renewable energy businesses, as well as effective appli- cation of low-grade coal.  Strategies for the Future   Sojitz's high-purity silicon metal business has the top share  of imports into Japan. In addition to increasing distribution to  other countries, we aim to expand into the silicon manufac- turing business overseas. Moreover, we will promote projects  that contribute to reducing environmental impact, including  next-generation environmental materials, new energy materi- als, and effective use of low-grade coal.

Earnings expanded steadily in the year ended  March 31, 2011 as we accurately responded to  growing demand in Asia, including China. Market  prices were favorable for methanol, and the rare  earths, industrial salt, and lithium businesses also  contributed to earnings.    Against this backdrop, three investment and  loan projects during the year stand out as  noteworthy achievements of the division, which  focuses on the logistics business.   The first of these is our investment and  participation in a marine chemical project in India.  This business produces potash fertilizer from the  potassium of salt marshes that form during the  monsoon season. Sojitz plans to sell the industrial  salt produced as a by-product (2 million tons  initially, 5 million tons in the future) to Asian and  Middle Eastern growth markets. The second  investment and loan project is our participation in  the butadiene business in Brazil. Under a long-term  (five and a half years) purchase agreement with  Braskem S.A., the largest petrochemical company in  South America, we built a stable supply structure  for butadiene, demand for which is expected to  expand globally. We also plan to commercialize  high-value-added butadiene derivatives in the  future. The third project involves an investment in  and loan for Lynas Corporation of Australia in our  rare earths business. Through this project, we have  addressed procurement issues by preparing a  structure to stably supply the Japanese market with  rare earths for 10 years. This is a considerable  achievement, because it will further augment  Sojitzs strength in the rare earths business while  fulfilling the Companys responsibility as a leading  supplier in the industry.  *C5: Chemicals with five carbon atoms, such as the organic solvent pentane.  Chemicals & Functional  Materials Division The Chemicals & Functional Materials  Division utilizes its extensive network  and expertise to step up initiatives to  strengthen value chains and achieve  sustained growth. We are further  enhancing Sojitzs areas of strength,  including investments in upstream  businesses, and expanding them globally  to accumulate prime assets.  Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 40  Review of Business  Operations Strategies for the Future    The Chemicals & Functional Materials Division  handles diverse products, with a focus on  intermediate products for a wide range of  applications in rapidly changing markets and  operating environments. Responding appropriately  to these changes requires that we view industries  from a broad perspective and quickly absorb  information through the logistics value chains we  are building. The customer base we have  developed over time is one of our key assets. Our  role is to make maximum use of collected  information to change and evolve together with  customers, and to encourage innovation from a  forward-looking perspective.    Accordingly, we intend to step up initiatives to  strengthen value chains to achieve sustained  growth. The division will further enhance Sojitzs  areas of strength, including investment in  upstream businesses, and expand those areas  globally to accumulate prime assets.   In areas where Sojitz is strong, we have solid,  longstanding relationships and networks with  partners and customers. We also have high-level  expertise across the value chain, including facility  construction, operation, production and sales. These  are areas in which we are able to gather information  easily and build business foundations efficiently and  quickly. The three investment and loan projects  mentioned earlier involved investing in and financing  longstanding partners, and were largely made  possible by the expertise and experience we have  cultivated in the respective businesses.    As we move ahead, a truly global perspective  will be the key to all our initiatives. Although we  make our livelihood in overseas development, we  tend to view other countries from a Japanese  perspective. Therefore, to accumulate prime assets  overseas, it is important that we view all countries,  including Japan, from a global standpoint. If the  talented, skilled personnel in the division adopt such  a perspective in their work, the quality and strength  of our business foundation is sure to increase.  Going forward, we will assign even more personnel  overseas and focus on human resource development  as we work to achieve sustainable growth. 10 11 12 (Forecast) (Years ended / ending March 31) (Billions of yen) 31.9 37.5 36.3 40 30 10 20 0 10 11 12 (Forecast) (Years ended / ending March 31) (Billions of yen) 2.9 6.0 6.8 8 6 2 4 0 Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 41 Gross Trading Profit Ordinary Income Satoshi Mizui President, Chemicals & Functional Materials Division  Main Businesses of the Chemicals & Functional Materials Division Industrial Salt Business  A key raw material for basic chemicals, with broad applications Methanol Business  Rising demand as a chemical raw material as well as for fuel  applications Salt stocks before  shipment in India Methanol manufacturing  facilities in Indonesia Operating Environment   Alkaline products and chlorine derivatives made with  industrial salt have a wide range of applications as basic raw  materials essential to many industries. Strong demand for  industrial salt is expected over the medium-to-long-term in  the Far East Asia, China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East,  which are Sojitzs main markets.  Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   Sojitz handles industrial salt produced in Australia and  India, and has a leading share among trading companies in  the Japanese market. Annual salt production fluctuates with  the weather, but we obtain supplies from multiple salt evapo- ration ponds. This has enabled us to spread the climate risk  inherent in procurement and ensure a stable supply to users  over many years.  Strategies for the Future   Sojitz will maintain steady procurement to meet strong  demand by further strengthening its efforts in India, one of its  existing supply sources. We will also work to increase the vol- ume we handle by utilizing our production, logistics and mar- keting knowledge gained over many years to develop new  markets and supply sources.  Operating Environment   Methanol has traditionally been used mainly as a chemical  raw material in products such as adhesives, synthetic fibers  and high-performance plastics. However, applications for fuels  such as LPG and biodiesel are expanding. Demand for  methanol as a gasoline additive is growing rapidly, especially  in China.  Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   Sojitz sells 1 million tons of methanol annually, primarily in  Asian markets. The mainstay of this business is the Indonesia- based methanol manufacturer PT. Kaltim Methanol Industri  (KMI), in which we hold an 85% stake. KMI has been highly  evaluated by customers for its prompt and flexible delivery,  which takes advantage of the company's proximity to demand  in Asian markets. Strategies for the Future   Sojitz will strengthen its market presence by building a  business equal to KMI. At the same time, we plan to extend  the use of our methanol sales and distribution functions to  other liquid chemicals.  Chemicals Unit Businesses     Chemical resources: Import and overseas sales of industrial salt; import and sales of rare earths and lithium; sales of aluminum  hydroxide   Organic chemicals: Production and sales of methanol and high-performance resin monomers; import and domestic sales of raw  materials for paints Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 42 Feature Topic for the Year Ended March 31, 2011   Demand for rare earths is growing year by year with  increasing use in hybrid vehicles, energy-saving appliances  and other products aimed at creating a low-carbon society.  Sojitz will seek new sources of rare earths while maintaining a  stable supply from China, its main source. In collaboration  with the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation  (JOGMEC), we have decided to invest in and provide loans to  Lynas Corporation Limited of Australia to develop rare earth  resources. Under a long-term agreement concluded in con- junction with the investment and loans, Sojitz will serve as  sole distributor and agent in Japan for 10 years, supplying  approximately 8,500 tons (500 tons) annually of rare earths  produced by Lynas, which is equivalent to approximately 30%  of Japans current demand.

Aramid resin is used as a  substitute for steel to make tires lighter, while polyimide resin  is used to make mobile phones and smart phones thinner.  Demand is also expected to grow for high-performance resin  monomers in solar cell and lithium ion battery applications. Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   For 10 years, Sojitz has handled a variety of chemical prod- ucts as the sole agent in Japan for Aarti Industries Inc. of  India. Amid increasing dependency on China for procurement  of raw materials, we diversified our sources by adding India,  which has enabled us to maintain a stable supply. Strategies for the Future   Solpit Industries, Ltd. has developed solution-based soluble  polyimide, a resin which until now could only be distributed in  film form. With the development of applications now possible  in new fields, Sojitz plans to expand its high-performance  resin business by promoting initiatives that cover the range  from raw materials to finished product.  Operating Environment   The need for plant-derived materials is growing in every  industrial sector with the progress of global market initiatives  to create a low-carbon society. Tencel is a plant-derived fiber  with eucalyptus as its main ingredient. Demand for Tencel is  growing in the apparel sector as a substitute for cotton. It is  also gaining attention as a bio-resin compound material.  Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   For over a decade, Sojitz has handled the Tencel and rayon  products of Lenzing AG of Austria, one of the worlds largest  producers of cellulose fiber. As Lenzings sales agent in Japan,  we have approximately a 50% share of total cellulose fiber  imports into Japan (about 7,500 tons), making us the leading  importer in the cellulose industry.  Strategies for the Future   Sojitz will focus on continuing expansion of its share of  existing textile markets and the development of markets for  bio-resin compounds and other products in non-textile fields.  We intend to develop the fiber-reinforced plastics market for  Tencel, which has a lower specific gravity than glass fibers.

Our aim is to shift from Japanese to overseas  markets, and from our traditional trading-based  business to a business investment model that creates  higher value-added.    Under this policy, in the year ended March 31,  2011 we shifted the focus of our efforts from  solidifying our foothold to more aggressive initiatives.  Earnings were higher than planned due to strong  performance by the fertilizer business in Asia. At the  same time, we made steady progress in transforming  our earnings structure.    The Foods Resources Unit established a wholly  owned agricultural business in Argentina. The  company produces soybeans and other crops, and in  its first fiscal year successfully harvested and shipped  products without incident. In forest products, the  woodchip and afforestation business added to  existing operations in Vietnam and Australia by  establishing a woodchip processing company in  Mozambique, Africa. In textiles, the apparel brand  business launched a new brand and has begun  retailing it at stores. In the real estate business, we  resumed sales of condominiums.  Strategies for the Future    Accelerate transformation of the earnings  structure   In the year ending March 31, 2012, the final year  of Shine 2011, our employees will unite to carry out  growth strategies that accelerate transformation of  the earnings structure. We will actively develop  businesses in growing overseas markets based on  three growth strategies: shift from trading to a  business investment model; secure upstream  resources in the agriculture, forest products and  marine products sectors; and shift from Japanese to  overseas markets.    Business opportunities abound in emerging  countries with growing populations and abundant  Consumer Lifestyle  Business Division The Consumer Lifestyle Business Division  intends to establish stable business  foundations in food, clothing and shelter  that have a direct connection to peoples  lives. We will execute growth strategies  in order to accelerate transformation of  our earnings structure by investing in  higher value-added business at every  point along the value chain, from  resource procurement to the end user. Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 44  Review of Business  Operations resources. In our shift to overseas markets, we will  focus on countries where we expect growth,  including China, Vietnam, Indonesia, India and Brazil.  In the two years since the start of Shine 2011, our  division has dispatched about 20 additional personnel  to overseas posts in these countries as well as to  Cambodia and Russia. We are also planning to send  additional staff to Indochina and Africa.    One example of how we are accelerating  transformation of our earnings structure in the year  ending March 31, 2012 is our use of the port facilities  of the leading Vietnamese flour milling company  Interflour Vietnam Ltd. (IFV), in which we have a 20%  stake. In addition to handling grain in general, we will  use the facilities to develop a compound feed  business. We will also expand the agricultural business  we launched in Argentina, adding cropland in Brazil  and elsewhere in Central and South America. We will  accumulate experience and expertise with the aim of  achieving grain output of approximately 1 million tons  in five years.    Sojitz Tuna Farm Takashima Co., Ltd., which we  began in 2008, made its first product shipment in  December 2010, and shipped about 1,300 bluefin  tuna in its first fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. We  are also actively engaged in joint research with Kinki  University to shift completely to raising artificially  hatched tuna. Our aim is to build a sustainable  business while preserving natural resources by  increasing catch ten-fold by March 31, 2015. We will  also move to develop similar businesses overseas for  marine resources other than tuna.    In forest products, we are implementing plans to  double annual production at our woodchip joint  venture in Vietnam from the current 500 thousand tons  to 1 million tons (BDT*). We will actively supply  woodchips not only to Japan but also to areas in which  demand is growing, such as China and elsewhere in  Asia. Demand is growing for environmentally  responsible products such as timber from plantations  and certified forests in North America, the South Seas  and elsewhere. As with woodchips, we will increase  overseas trading with a focus on China, Vietnam, India,  and other Asian markets where demand for timber is  expected to grow.   We will also focus on expanding our real estate  operations overseas. By developing and selling lots in  industrial parks in Vietnam and India, we hope to  contribute to local growth.   Developing human resources is paramount to  transforming our earnings structure and achieving  sustained growth. In all of our businesses, we will  develop global personnel who have a sense of  ownership in their work and can succeed in any field  in any country. They will implement strategies and  achieve successes one step at a time by becoming  familiar with their work and its importance to the  Company as a whole. Everyone in the division will  work to realize higher value-added overseas  businesses that grow, process, make and then sell,  as we continue expanding our business involving  food, clothing, and shelter across the globe.  *BDT: bone dry ton.

Employing thorough quality control  to ensure safety and taste, we made our first shipment of  high-quality bluefin tuna in December 2010. Sojitz is a leader  among general trading companies in tuna business initiatives.  We handle approximately 15% of total annual tuna imports  into Japan from locations including the Mediterranean,  Australia, and Mexico, and have established a company in  China for ultra-low temperature storage, processing, and  sales. Aiming for stable supply of  food resources, we will further  expand our tuna farming business  while raising both natural juvenile  tuna and artificially hatched juvenile  tuna obtained from a joint research  project with Kinki University.

Moreover, the countrys population is  forecast to exceed 90 million in 2012. Demand is therefore  expected to increase for grain and feed raw materials in the  future. Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   In 2010, Interflour Vietnam Ltd. (IFV), one of the top  Vietnamese flour milling companies in which Sojitz has invested,  completed facilities at its specialized grain port, now the largest of its kind in the ASEAN region that can accommodate  Panamax-class cargo vessels. IFV aims to become Vietnams  leading flour milling company by doubling its milling capacity  with the addition of new milling lines by March 2012. Strategies for the Future   While promoting its compound feed business in Vietnam,  Sojitz will utilize IFVs port facilities to expand food and feed  grain imports and grow the flour milling business. We aim to  develop and grow the food industry in Vietnam and the rest of  Asia by achieving a stable supply of food resources. Operating Environment   Needs for consumer products have diversified with the rapid  transformation of the economy and social environment. Sojitz  must meet potential consumer desires by combining diverse  values in everyday life, such as eco-friendliness, simplicity, and  interpersonal connections. Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   Sojitz has launched McGREGOR CLASSIC, a new  McGREGOR brand, and has begun retailing it with a family  theme at stores in shopping malls. We target emerging life- styles with various brands, including Admiral casual shoes  and REEF surfing goods. Strategies for the Future   Sojitz will use its experience in the brand business in Japan  to develop retail businesses in emerging markets that are  expected to grow rapidly. Accurately determining diversifying  consumer trends, Sojitz will propose and enable the lifestyles of  the future in new markets.

Securing a stable supply of  pulp for the future from multiple regions and coping with price  volatility have become issues. Going forward, demand is also  expected for biomass fuel as a source of renewable energy that  counters global warming. Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   Sojitz will use its experience and expertise gained in Vietnam  and Australia to promote development of afforestation and  woodchip production businesses in Africa. Trees grown on  plantations in Swaziland, South Africa will be processed in  woodchip production plants established in Mozambique for  export to Japan. We will move proactively to supply woodchips  to China and other Asian countries where demand is rising. Strategies for the Future   Sojitz is taking steps to build a stable supply system and  strengthen sales through new initiatives in Africa and by imple- menting plans to double the volume of woodchips it handles in  Vietnam. We will supply products for diverse applications in  addition to paper production, such as biomass fuel for power  generation, demand for which is expected to grow in devel- oped countries.  Operating Environment   The ongoing push by Japanese, Chinese and Korean  companies to establish operations in Vietnam and India has  created a need for experienced industrial park management. In  addition to providing standard requisite functions such as  favorable location, water supply and disposal, power and  communications, industrial park managers must handle an  array of issues associated with customers. Strengths, Distinguishing Features and Initiatives   Sojitz can provide diverse high-value-added services tailored  to the needs of individual customers because it is involved in  the entire industrial park process from development to man- agement and operation. For example, we provide transplant  assistance that ranges from helping establish local offices to  providing logistics functions, raw materials and standard facto- ries, as well as factory design and construction contracting. Strategies for the Future   Sojitz will develop industrial infrastructure to assist the  growth of emerging countries by advancing the development  of and sale of lots in new Long Duc Industrial Park in addition  to Long Binh Techno Park in Vietnam, which is now under full  operation, and SMIP Industrial Park in India.

We maintain soundness and transparency in the  relationship between management and employees,  and in the relationship between Sojitz and society. We  set clear goals, and then work together to achieve  them. At the same time, we clarify how efficiently we  have progressed, and indicate internally and externally  how we will resolve difficulties should they arise. This  sound, transparent and efficient management draws  fully on Sojitzs latent strengths and earns the trust of stakeholders.  I have led meetings of the Board of Directors since  becoming its Chairman in April 2007. This has  improved management and supervision and enhanced  corporate governance by segregating business  management and execution. In addition, in order to  strengthen supervision of business execution, we  established the Internal Control Committee, the  Compliance Committee and the CSR Committee as  internal executive bodies under the President & CEO  to promote necessary actions from a company-wide  standpoint. This has further strengthened our  corporate governance.  Annual Report 2011 incorporates the CSR Report  formerly published separately, an approach we  initiated with Annual Report 2010. We have adopted  this new format in order to report on the CSR  initiatives of the Sojitz Group to our wide-ranging  stakeholders. Recognizing that a strong management  foundation is essential for promoting robust CSR, in  Annual Report 2011 we have reported on our  management structure in greater detail.  We will continue working to further enhance  corporate governance in a variety of ways. These  include augmenting the legal and ethical compliance  functions of the entire Sojitz Group to prevent illegal  or unethical behavior, as well as building an advanced  internal control system and mechanisms for effective  decision-making, business execution, management,  supervision and disclosure. A Message from Chairman Akio Dobashi We work to realize the Sojitz Group  Statement by aiming for sound,  transparent and efficient management  while enhancing corporate governance. Management Foundation Akio Dobashi Chairman Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 49  Basic Corporate Governance Policy  Companies have many objectives, including  securing profit and enhancing corporate value.  Continuing to promote the ceaseless strengthening of  corporate governance is essential for establishing a  foundation that enables continuous achievement of  corporate objectives and creates a corporation that  stakeholders, including shareholders, customers,  business partners and employees, continue to trust.  The Sojitz Group is composed of a diverse array of  business types, business functions, countries, regions,  people and other features. For that reason, and to  further strengthen its competitiveness as a global  corporation, it is particularly important for the Sojitz  Group to continuously study more effective styles of  corporate governance for the Group as a whole.   Based on this view, the Sojitz Group is executing  various policies on behalf of shareholders and all other  stakeholders to clarify management responsibility and  accountability and establish a highly transparent  management structure. To date, the Sojitz Group has  promoted initiatives including a system of internal  control, efficient decision-making, the creation of  mechanisms for handling execution and supervision,  development of the audit function and enhancement of  information disclosure. These efforts are never complete,  because the Sojitz Group must work to constantly raise  the sophistication of its governance structure. Under the  Sojitz Group Statement, The Sojitz Group produces  new sources of wealth by connecting the worlds  economies, cultures, and people in a spirit of  integrity, the Sojitz Group aims to provide  outstanding value from the perspective of all  stakeholders. As a company, Sojitz is working to  enhance corporate governance while identifying and  applying concepts, approaches, and initiatives that will  allow it to continue producing new sources of wealth. Corporate Governance Framework  Sojitz employs an executive officer system that  separates management decision-making and business  execution to clarify authority and responsibility and  expedite business execution. The term of directors and  executive officers has been set at one year so that the  Sojitz Group can respond quickly and appropriately to  its rapidly changing operating environment.  Sojitz is a company with a board of corporate  auditors who are independent from directors and  audit their business performance. In addition, Sojitz  appoints outside directors to give management an  external perspective and further strengthen  supervision of execution of duties. The Company also  has a Nomination Committee and Remuneration  Committee, which are consultative organizations for  the Board of Directors and are chaired by outside  directors of the Company. 1. Board of Directors  As the Companys chief decision-making  organization, the Board of Directors debates and  resolves basic policies and important matters. It  consists of seven directors, including two outside  directors, and is striving to add greater efficiency and  depth to discussions and expedite decision-making. In  principle, the Board of Directors convenes at least  once each month, and holds ad hoc meetings if crucial  matters arise.   To improve management oversight and further the  separation of management and execution, the  position of Chairman of the Board is filled by the  Chairman of the Company, not by the President &  CEO, who is the head of business execution. 2. Board of Corporate Auditors  The Board of Corporate Auditors consists of five  members, three of whom are outside corporate  auditors. In addition, three of the corporate auditors  on the Board are full-time auditors. Independent from  the Board of Directors, the corporate auditors audit  the business performance of directors. 3. Nomination Committee  The Nomination Committee is chaired by an outside  director. It discusses and proposes standards and  methods for selecting director and executive officer  candidates, and considers candidate proposals. 4. Remuneration Committee  The Remuneration Committee is chaired by an  outside director. It discusses and proposes  remuneration levels and various systems of evaluation  and remuneration. Corporate Governance  Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 50  Management Foundation 5.  Other Management and Execution Systems  Sojitz established the Management Committee as  an organization that oversees business execution.  Chaired by the President & CEO, it includes executive  directors and the heads of business divisions and  corporate departments. In principle, the Management  Committee meets twice a month.  Sojitz established the Finance & Investment  Deliberation Council because investments and loans  are among the Sojitz Groups business activities with  the most significant impact on management. Chaired  by the Executive Vice President (Corporate  Management), the council consists of executive  directors, the heads of corporate departments and  other members. In principle, it meets twice a month to  expeditiously and accurately debate and resolve  important issues concerning investments and loans.  Moreover, Sojitz has established and operates the  following four internal committees under the  President & CEO to promote the execution of matters  that should be handled on a company-wide basis. Internal Control Committee   The President & CEO chairs the Internal Control  Committee, which monitors progress in  implementing internal control systems and  formulates related policies. Compliance Committee     The Chief Compliance Officer chairs the Compliance  Committee, which studies and makes decisions on  basic policies regarding compliance.  CSR Committee      The senior managing executive officer responsible  for public relations chairs the CSR Committee,  which studies and formulates policies and measures  concerning the promotion of the Sojitz Groups CSR  activities. Portfolio Management Committee     The Portfolio Management Committee studies and  proposes policies and measures for structuring an  optimum Group asset and business portfolio.

The Company appointed two outside  directors: Mr. Yoshikazu Sashida, Adviser of Nisshinbo  Holdings Inc., and Mr. Toru Nagashima, Chairman of  the Board of Teijin Limited. Neither Nisshinbo Holdings  Inc. nor Teijin Limited is a major transaction partner of  the Sojitz Group. For this and other reasons, the  Company determined that the appointments  maintained independence. Each outside director chairs  either the Remuneration Committee or the  Nomination Committee to ensure fair, transparent  compensation and appointment of directors. In  addition, the outside directors provide the Board of  Directors with appropriate advice from an objective  perspective.  Name  Yoshikazu Sashida  Toru Nagashima  Position  Adviser,    Chairman of the Board,   Nisshinbo Holdings Inc. Teijin Limited        Sojitz determined that the candidates had  successively held important posts in the  business world and are able to provide advice  relevant to the Sojitz Groups businesses  drawn from their broad management  knowledge and deep insight.   (As of June 23, 2011) Initiatives to Strengthen Corporate  Governance under Shine 2011  Under Shine 2011, the Sojitz Group has set the  goals of establishing a strong earnings foundation that  ensures sustained growth and developing globally  competent human resources, and is building higher- level corporate governance as a global corporation. As  Sojitz steps up its overseas expansion, it is  emphasizing policies to strengthen corporate  governance to respond appropriately to such issues as  compliance, cash management, and optimal levels of  inventory at Group companies overseas. Specifically, it  is creating a system that determines corporate  participation in administrative categories set according  to relative impact on Group management and  corporate management. The objective of this system is  to strengthen checks and balances covering overseas  Group companies under the direct control of the  Business Group.  Going forward, the Company will develop checks  and balances for overseas Group companies and  formulate policies for further strengthening the  management foundation in overseas regions. Major Board and Committee Meetings  Major board and committee meetings convened  during the year ended March 31, 2011 were as  follows.

Remuneration of corporate auditors is  deliberated and decided by the Board of Corporate  Auditors as a general rule. However, remuneration for  directors and corporate auditors is within the limits set  by the resolutions of the General Shareholders Meeting  on the maximum amount of remuneration.   Moreover, the Company has entered into  agreements with the outside directors, Mr. Yoshikazu  Sashida and Mr. Toru Nagashima, and the outside  corporate auditors, Mr. Kazuhiko Tokita, Mr. Yukio  Machida and Mr. Mitsuaki Yuasa, whereby their  liability is limited to the greater of 10 million or the  amount provided for in Article 425, Paragraph 1 of  the Companies Act of Japan.

Corporate auditors: Resolution at the Ordinary General  Shareholders Meeting on June 27, 2007 150 million annually Independent Officer  Pursuant to a partial revision to the Securities Listing  Regulations implemented in December 2009 (Rule  436-2), listed companies are required to secure an  independent officer in order to protect general  shareholders. An independent officer is an outside  director or corporate auditor who is unlikely to have a  conflict of interest with general shareholders. An  independent officer is expected to protect general  shareholders of listed companies by providing necessary  opinions at Board of Directors and other meetings to  ensure their interests are taken into consideration in  decisions related to the execution of duties. The  Company designated Mr. Yukio Machida, one of its  outside corporate auditors, as independent officer. Name  Yukio Machida Position  Lawyer, Nishimura & Asahi Reason for Designation as Independent Officer    (As of June 23, 2011) Votes For and Against Proposals  Sojitz aims to hold open General Shareholders  Meetings. The Notice of Convocation is sent three  weeks prior to the General Shareholders Meeting.  The date of the meeting is selected so that as many  shareholders as possible may attend and participate.  Since the General Shareholders Meeting in June  2005, we have used mobile phone and Internet voting  in addition to voting by mail so that shareholders who  are unable to attend can exercise their voting rights.  Moreover, since the General Shareholders Meeting in  June 2006, we have used an electronic voting  platform for institutional investors so that institutional  investors with material voting rights may exercise  those rights. In addition, Sojitz provides video of the  General Shareholders Meeting via its website after  the meeting has ended with the objective of fair  information disclosure.   At the General Shareholders Meeting on June 23,  2011, voting rights exercised in writing and via the  Internet represented shares held by 62,807  shareholders, of which 1,133 shareholders including  17 directors, corporate auditors and executive officers  attended the meeting, and accounted for 62.41% of  total voting rights.

After working mainly as a public prosecutor  on criminal cases for over 30 years and  having held an important post at the Public  Prosecutors Office, Mr. Machida now  monitors the management of Sojitz as an  outside corporate auditor of the Company.  Sojitz determined that he is suitable for the  position of independent officer because he  maintains independence as an outside  corporate auditor by offering accurate advice  and proposals in and outside of Board of  Directors meetings from an independent  standpoint and with an objective view, and  carries out all the responsibilities of that  position appropriately. Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 53  Basic Policy for Information Disclosure  To ensure highly transparent management and  remain accountable to all stakeholders, it is essential  that Sojitz promptly, accurately, and fairly discloses  important corporate information and information that  facilitates understanding of its business activities from  the perspective of stakeholders. Sojitz discloses  information via stock exchanges in a timely manner in  accordance with provisions for publicly listed  companies, and uses media organizations and the  Company website to provide information to as many  stakeholders as possible.   Initiatives to Incorporate the Views of  Shareholders and Investors in  Management  Sojitz emphasizes active communication with all  investors and shareholders because it recognizes the  importance of listening attentively to their opinions  and incorporating their views in management.  Specifically, Sojitz holds an informal discussion  session for shareholders after the Ordinary General  Shareholders Meeting, and held a briefing for 253  shareholders in Osaka in February 2011 as an  additional venue to facilitate dialogue. To  communicate with analysts and institutional investors,  Sojitz holds regular briefings at the time of quarterly  earnings announcements, as well as proactively  convening one-on-one meetings.   For overseas shareholders and investors, Sojitz  conducts meetings twice a year in the United States and  Europe, and once a year in Asia, in addition to actively  providing information on the Company website.   Internal Control System  Beginning with the fiscal year ended March 31,  2009, the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law  requires publicly listed companies to have their  management executives prepare assessment reports  concerning internal controls on financial reporting and  have those reports audited by an external auditor. This  is known as the internal control reporting system. In  practice, this means that more visibility in operational  procedures is required so that management executives  can assess and confirm the effective functioning of  mechanisms to ensure appropriate and accurate  financial reporting and other information disclosure,  and an outside auditor can then audit such assessment.  Sojitz is treating the legislation of the internal  control reporting system as an opportunity to move  beyond the basic legal requirements to ensure  appropriate operational procedures and reliable  financial reporting. Its policy is more broadly focused  on promoting activities that further enhance the  effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency of Group  management in general. In the year ended March 31,  2011, management executives evaluated the status of  the internal control system for financial reporting and  its operation and concluded that the Sojitz Groups  internal control system for financial reporting does not  have any material weaknesses.  Going forward, the Sojitz Group will work to further  enhance its internal control system.     Main Initiatives Aimed at Strengthening  the Internal Control System November 2005   Internal Control Committee, chaired by the  President & CEO, is established      Decides the Sojitz Groups internal control  policies and monitors progress in  establishing internal controls      Executes initiatives to focus the attention of  Group executives and employees on the  internal controls in general May 2006   The Board of Directors adopts a resolution  regarding the Companys basic policy for  establishing a system to ensure proper and  ethical business operations (an internal  control system) (Partially revised in April 2008) April 2008   The Board of Directors adopts a resolution  regarding the Companys basic policy to  ensure appropriate financial reporting Timely  disclosure Secretariat Board of      Directors Management      Committee Finance &      Investment      Deliberation      Council Administration & Project Proposal Corporate      Departments Business Divisions Corporate Departments Public Relations Department Employees responsible for handling information Investor Relations  Office Public Relations Department Information disclosure   Group Internal Report and Information  Disclosure Framework Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 54 Corporate Governance   Improving Management Transparency   As an auditor, I think it is important to monitor Sojitzs management from the perspective of social norms and  values, as well to ascertain whether the Company is complying with laws and regulations. Therefore, in addition to  conducting audits in accordance with auditing plans, I attend regular meetings and create  other opportunities to exchange information with Company of cers, employees, and  Group company auditors in Japan and overseas in order to determine whether  management is satisfactory.    Through this ongoing dialogue, I sense that the quality of governance at Sojitz is  improving every year. Only eight years have passed since the merger that created Sojitz,  but I believe the level of governance already exceeds that of other companies.    Transparency is of prime importance in corporate management. I hope to make Company  management clearly visible to shareholders and other stakeholders  by enhancing audit functions. This will also help people overseas  better understand the general trading company form of business,  which is unique to Japan. Audit Structure  Corporate auditors, accounting auditors, and the  Audit Department enhance the effectiveness of their  respective audits by exchanging information to ensure  their efforts are complementary and efficient. 1. Audits by Corporate Auditors  Corporate auditors attend important meetings of  the Board of Directors, Management Committee,  Finance & Investment Deliberation Council, and other  managerial organizations in accordance with auditing  plans, assignments, and other auditing standards set  by the Board of Corporate Auditors. In addition, the  corporate auditors oversee and monitor the operations  of the Sojitz Group by conducting audits using means  such as interviewing directors and other members of  senior management regarding business execution,  inspecting important documents relevant to major  business decisions, and obtaining business reports and  other information from subsidiaries. 2. Accounting Audits  In accordance with the Companies Act of Japan,  which requires accounting audits, and the Financial  Instruments and Exchange Law, which requires  auditing of financial statements, quarterly reviews, and  internal controls, Sojitz has appointed the independent  auditing firm KPMG AZSA LLC. The accounting  auditors explain their auditing plan to the corporate  auditors and periodically report on the status of the  audits they are conducting. The accounting auditors  share information with corporate auditors to enhance  the effectiveness of accounting audits. 3. Internal Audits  Internal audits of the Company are led by the Board  of Corporate Auditors and the Audit Department. Based  on auditing plans approved by the Board of Directors at  the beginning of each fiscal year, audits cover business,  finance and other departments in the Companys  corporate division and consolidated subsidiaries and  overseas affiliates. To speed amelioration of problems  and improvement of points raised during audits, audited  departments are required to submit reports on the  status of amelioration and improvements three months  and six months after the audit, and follow-up audits are  conducted for confirmation.  Moreover, the Sojitz Group has introduced a system  under which business departments and Group  companies conduct self inspection to promote swift  discovery of problems and operating efficiency,  preclude losses, and enhance awareness of risk  management. Every six months the Audit Department  follows up on the progress of improvements, verifies  and evaluates the status of internal management risks,  reports its findings to the President & CEO, and  submits plans to improve effectiveness. Susumu Komori  Corporate Auditor Management Foundation Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 55  Initiatives to Strengthen Portfolios  For the Sojitz Group to achieve sustained growth, it  is essential to build a stable, strong earnings foundation.  We must identify and allocate management resources  to areas of growth and areas in which we can exert our  strengths. In April 2009, Sojitz established the Portfolio  Management Committee to build a quality asset  portfolio and an optimal business portfolio by  promoting the reallocation of management resources.  In the year ended March 31, 2010, the first year of the  medium-term management plan, the Portfolio  Management Committee chaired by the Executive Vice  President of Corporate Management made balance sheet  optimization a priority task and worked to improve and  strengthen the balance sheets. As a result, we reduced the  net debt equity ratio from 2.7 times as of March 31, 2009  (following the collapse of Lehman Brothers) to 2.1 times  as of March 31, 2010. We also reduced the ratio of risk  assets to shareholders equity from 1.1 as of March 31,  2009 to 0.9 as of March 31, 2010.   In the year ended March 31, 2011, the second year  of the plan, the President & CEO chaired the Portfolio  Management Committee, leading efforts to achieve  sustained growth. Focusing on risk and return, the  Committee deliberated asset replacement and the  reallocation of management resources to growth areas.  Issues discussed included the necessary earnings  structure and composition of assets and businesses for  achieving sustained growth.   In the year ending March 31, 2012, we will continue  working to build the optimal business portfolio and  accelerate our efforts to achieve sustained growth. Evaluation of Risk and Return Using SCVA  Since 2004, the Sojitz Group has used a common  management indicator known as Sojitz Corporation  Value Added (SCVA). SCVA is the sum of capital cost  (risk assets multiplied by the shared cost rate) reflecting  risk deducted from profit. It is a quantitative indicator  that measures the balance between risk and return for  each business unit meticulously categorized by  business model. It also serves as a standard for  qualitative evaluation of market growth potential and  competitive advantage that indicates the priorities of  each business unit. We will continue to use SCVA as a  tool in building our business portfolio, for reallocating  management resources when withdrawing from  businesses that have low profitability and investing in  growth areas. Basic Risk Management Policies  As a general trading company, the Sojitz Group is  engaged in a diverse, globally dispersed range of  businesses. Due to the nature of its businesses the  Group is exposed to a variety of risks.   In compliance with its Basic Code of Corporate Risk  Management, the Sojitz Group defines and categorizes  risk, and manages it according to the nature of each  risk. For quantifiable risks such as market risk, business  investment risk, credit risk and country risk, integrated  risk management involves quantifying risk and  managing it based on a calculation of risk assets. Non- quantifiable risks such as legal risk, compliance risk,  environmental risk, financing risk, disaster risk and  system risk are managed in the same manner as  quantifiable risks, using the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)  cycle for reporting the status of the risk and other  issues to management, based on the Risk Management  Policy and Plan formulated by the executive officer  responsible for managing that risk. Risk Measurement and Control  The aims of integrated risk management are to  1) control numerically quantified risk so that it is within  the scope of the strength of the Company (its  shareholders equity), and 2) maximize earnings in line  with the level of risk exposure. In other words, the  Sojitz Group manages risk with a focus on both  acceptability and profitability.   The Sojitz Groups objective for risk control has been  to manage risk assets so that they total less than  shareholders equity. We are currently promoting risk  control with this objective under Shine 2011 by working  to accumulate quality businesses and assets through new  investment. On the other hand, the Sojitz Group has a  policy of steadily replacing underperforming risk assets  to build a quality, resilient balance sheet. This policy  involves withdrawing from business with low  profitability and revising the existing portfolio. As a  Portfolio Management and Risk Management Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 56  Management Foundation systems and risk management policy and measuring  risk. Risk Management Department 1 and Risk  Management Department 2 are in charge of examining  individual business proposals and monitoring business  investments. This structure facilitates fast and  meticulous operations.   The Finance & Investment Deliberation Council  chaired by the Executive Vice President of Corporate  Management examines each new investment and loan  proposal. The council has established rules to visualize  risks to facilitate deliberation. For example, single page  documents are required, covering downside scenarios  as well as expected scenarios. The general managers of  Risk Management Department 1 and Risk Management  Department 2, not the relevant business division,  explain proposals to ensure objective evaluation of risk.   Simply establishing rules is not sufficient to build a  risk management system. Rather, the system must  permeate the work of all employees who run it. In  order to spread awareness of risk management to all  employees, the risk management departments provide  training for groups of employees prior to their  promotion to management positions and for managers  at Group companies. Training entails the use of case  studies of actual situations to learn from the mistakes  of the past. Going forward, we will work to expand the  scope of training and further spread awareness of risk  management issues. result of these initiatives, the ratio of risk assets to  shareholders equity as of March 31, 2011 was 0.9,  maintaining a level in line with our target of 1.0 times or  less. We will continue to steadily reallocate risk assets in  order to strengthen the balance sheet.  The Sojitz Group also employs level of risk exposure  when examining individual investment projects as part  of new investment discussions. In addition, risk for all  projects is measured quarterly and reported to the  Board of Directors and the Management Committee,  and each business unit receives results of analysis of  the change in risk assets for application in day-to-day  risk management activities. Note:  Please refer to pages 94 to 97, 7. Business and Other Risks  in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Operations  for information on each risk category. Risk Management System  Sojitz continues to strengthen and increase the  sophistication of its risk management while enhancing  and expanding its risk management system. We  reviewed the system to further enhance the awareness  and practice of risk management in operations  throughout the entire Group and now carry out risk  management in a three-department structure  consisting of Risk Management Departments 1 and 2,  and the Risk Management Planning Department.

Sojitz recognizes that  thoroughgoing compliance is essential to living up to  these requirements. We work to preclude legal and  regulatory violations not simply through control, but also  by working to share awareness of compliance within the  Company. Teamwork through communication among  employees is important to this effort, and the entire  Company is working diligently to cooperate. In a  challenging business environment, each frontline  operation is carrying a heavier burden than ever. That is  why the Sojitz Group is increasing its focus on  meticulous compliance.  Sojitz has established the Sojitz Group Compliance  Program, which lays out procedures to ensure  thorough compliance. The Company has also prepared  the Sojitz Group Code of Conduct and Ethics and  distributes a booklet of case examples to all employees  in order to enhance understanding and practice of  compliance. Sojitz updated its Group-wide compliance  conduct guidelines by introducing The Sojitz Group  Code of Conduct and Ethics in the year ended March  31, 2010. This code integrates the earlier Sojitz Group  Compliance Code of Conduct with the Compliance  Code of Conduct Manual. Moreover, because sound  and steady reinforcement of policies is crucial for  ensuring thorough understanding of compliance,  Sojitz conducts a variety of training programs such as  e-learning and compliance training using visual  materials containing specific case examples. Compliance Framework  The Compliance Committee, chaired by the Chief  Compliance Officer (CCO), is at the core of activities  to ensure adherence to laws, regulations, and  corporate ethics. The CCO, the president of each  division and the presidents of consolidated Group  companies use meetings and other venues to  exchange opinions on how the Group can eliminate  legal and regulatory violations.  Compliance supervisors and assistants have also  been assigned in Sojitzs domestic and overseas  operating bases and consolidated Group companies in  order to promote the establishment of frameworks for  each region and company. They also promote  educational activities and training, including for locally  hired employees. Sojitz has set up five regional  compliance committees that cooperate with the head  office to carry out local compliance activities.  Moreover, Sojitz has a hotline (reporting system) that  provide access to the CCO and outside legal counsel,  and a consultation desk where Compliance Committee  Secretariat members can be contacted, to help prevent  or rapidly detect violations of compliance regulations.

This tells me that initiatives to establish  compliance are paying off. In the year ended March 31, 2011, I visited 22 major  subsidiaries to conduct issues awareness interviews and share views about compliance.  I con rmed that the level of management at Group companies is steadily improving.    However, establishing compliance is an endless process. Simply obeying rules and  mechanisms is not enough. Our efforts wont lead to sustained growth unless every  employee is infused with a compliance mindset and working with  integrity is constantly promoted. Eliminating noncompliance  requires steady, repeated efforts, so we will continue advancing  initiatives step by step throughout the Group. Compliance Highlights  Highlights of compliance initiatives and framework  enhancements during the year ended March 31, 2011  follow here. Initiatives to Promote Group Compliance  Sojitz is working to make the Sojitz Group Code of  Conduct and Ethics available in multiple languages to  promote thorough understanding and practice. Currently  available in 23 languages including Japanese and English,  the code has been introduced at Group companies to  achieve a shared mindset regarding compliance among all  employees in Japan and overseas. To deepen understanding  of the code, Sojitz has developed related e-learning  materials and is conducting training at the head office,  Group companies in Japan and overseas subsidiaries.  Moreover, as another method to identify noncompliance  or potential noncompliance within the Group, Sojitz is  phasing in a multi-lingual ethics hotline that Group  executives and employees can contact 24 hours a day,  365 days a year, in addition to the previously mentioned  hotlines that provide access to the CCO and outside  legal counsel. Comprehensive Compliance Inspections  Sojitz works to eliminate noncompliance by  conducting comprehensive inspections at the head  office, overseas sites, and major Group companies in  Japan and overseas. In the year ended March 31,  2011, inspections were conducted at the head office,  50 overseas sites including subsidiaries, and 126  Group companies in Japan and overseas. Sojitz reviews  and revises the list of inspection items every year  based on the results of past inspections to flexibly  respond to the rapidly changing environment.  Inspections covered 93 items in the year ended March  31, 2011. Sojitz analyzes inspection results item by  item and shares the findings across the Group. Initiatives Aimed at Protecting  Personal Information  Sojitz introduced rules for protecting personal  information when the pertinent legislation came into  effect in April 2005. To address subsequent social and  legislative changes concerning personal information,  we have revised our original rules for the first time and  formulated a new method for administering them.  Specifically, we have established a series of steps that all  employees must adhere to when handling personal  information, from acquisition to disposal. We have also  introduced a system for recording the status of personal  information in a personal information register in order  to centralize administrative control.

We  hope for the earliest possible recovery.   In addition to its four CSR priority themes, Sojitz  recognizes the urgency of supporting the reconstruction in  the areas affected by the earthquake. Leveraging our full  array of resources, we will make every effort to support  the people, our partners and other businesses in the  affected areas, under the theme of working toward a  brighter future for the people and local community.   Note:  Please see CSR Priority Themes on page 62 for more  information.     Sojitzs Initiatives to Support the Reconstruction The Sojitz Group donated 100 million in  March 2011. An additional 16 million  was collected by 5,100 Group executives  and employees in Japan and overseas.* The Company established the Sojitz  Reconstruction and Education Fund  endowed with a total of 500 million. We  will provide scholarships to college  students who are experiencing financial  difficulty because of the disaster. In each of  the five years starting with the year ending  March 31, 2012, we will select 30 students  (150 in total) to receive scholarships for up  to four years. We support volunteer activities of  executives and employees by giving them  special leave and helping offset expenses  related to their activities.

(http://www.sojitz.com/en/csr/index.html) Initiatives to Promote CSR Awareness  In the course of its business activities, the Sojitz  Group comes into contact with society in a variety of  ways. Accordingly, we believe it is important for each  Group employee to be always aware of society and  work with sincerity to meet the expectations of  society. We implement various initiatives to raise CSR  awareness among employees. Sojitz Group CSR Seminars  The Sojitz Group holds CSR Seminars that incorporate  the views of experts outside the Company in order to  encourage each Group employee to practice CSR.  Following the first seminar held in November 2009, we  held two seminars in the year ended March 31, 2011  under the themes described below.  Second Seminar   Next-generation energy and environment  businesses expected of general trading  company groups  Third Seminar   Knowledge and practice of industrial waste  risk management Other Initiatives  The Sojitz Group uses liaison meetings between  Group company presidents, its CSR & Environment  intranet website and its internal business magazine  HORIZON to introduce Group CSR initiatives and social  contribution activities, and to explain environmental  laws and other pertinent  information. In the year ended  March 31, 2011, we also distributed  the booklet Sojitz Groups CSR vol. 2  to inform all Group employees  primarily about CSR initiatives in the  Sojitz Groups supply chains.

Sojitz  agrees with this purpose and joined the UN Global  Compact in April 2009. Participation in Section Committee  The Global Compact Japan Network, consisting of  companies belonging to the United Nations Global  Compact, organizes several theme-based section  committees. In the  year ended March 31,  2011, Sojitz joined  the Supply Chain  Section Committee.  Consisting of 20  companies from  various business sectors,  the Supply Chain Section Committee exchanges views  on how to develop CSR initiatives for supply chains  and how to solve a variety of issues. We incorporate  these views in the Sojitz Groups activities.   The UN Global Compacts Ten Principles Human   Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the  Rights    protection of internationally proclaimed      human rights; and   Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in       human rights abuses. Labour  Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of     association and the effective recognition       of the right to collective bargaining;   Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and       compulsory labour;   Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and   Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect       of employment and occupation. Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary       approach to environmental challenges;   Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater       environmental responsibility; and   Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion       of environmentally friendly technologies.

In this report, we have presented the Sojitz Groups  CSR initiatives with a focus on these CSR priority themes. More detailed information about the Sojitz Groups  CSR initiatives and the latest information following the issue of this report are available in the Corporate  Social Responsibility section of the Sojitz website. (http://www.sojitz.com/en/csr/index.html) Notes: 1.  The priority themes are not permanent. We plan to revise them as appropriate to re ect societal demands or changes in the  Sojitz Groups circumstances.   2. In addition to the priority themes, we recognize the urgency of reconstructing the areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake. The Sojitz Groups CSR Priority Themes Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 62 Making the Sojitz Group Statement a Reality  The Sojitz Groups Corporate  Social Responsibility The Sojitz Groups CSR –  Advancing with Its Supply Chains  For the Sojitz Group, which conducts a diverse  range of businesses on a global scale, promoting CSR  initiatives in supply chains is important. In April 2010,  we formulated the Sojitz Group CSR Action Guidelines  for Supply Chains to clarify our initiative policies both  inside and outside the Group. The guidelines are  based on the previously mentioned Ten Principles of  the United Nations Global Compact. We will share  these guidelines with suppliers with the aim of  working together to do business in harmony with  society and the environment. Main Initiatives Progress in the  Year Ended March 31, 2011 Inculcation of CSR Action Guidelines for  Supply Chains  We explained CSR promotion in the supply chain to  each department in the Company. Moreover, we  presented the Sojitz Groups CSR Action Guidelines for  Supply Chains to 56 suppliers selected on the basis of  the value of their transactions and the importance of  their regions and industries in terms of factors including  CSR supply chain- related international  indices, and  conducted a survey  about their CSR  initiatives. Their  responses revealed no  urgent issues requiring  immediate attention. Future Initiatives  We will continue conducting surveys of suppliers as  in the year ended March 31, 2011 and expand  initiatives to Sojitz Group companies. We also plan to  send Company employees to talk to suppliers. In the  future, we will continue to promote CSR in supply  chains by emphasizing communication with suppliers  and Group companies. Promotion of CSR Supply Chain Management Sojitz Group CSR Action Guidelines for  Supply Chains (Excerpt) 1.  We shall respect the human rights of employees, and  never treat employees in an inhumane manner.  2.  We shall prevent forced labor, child labor and unfair low- wage labor.  3.  We shall not practice discrimination in hiring and  employment.  4.  We shall respect the rights of employees to organize for  smooth negotiation between labor and management.  5.  We shall strive to provide employees with a safe, sanitary  and healthy work environment.  6.  In the course of conducting business activities, we shall  duly consider the need to conserve ecosystems as well as  local and global environments, and strive to prevent the  occurrence of any environmental pollution. 7.  We shall observe all relevant laws and regulations, ensure  fair transactions and prevent corruption. 8.  We shall ensure the quality and safety of products and  services.  9.  We shall disclose information regarding the above items  in a timely and appropriate manner.   Asian Transmission Corporation (ATC) has been guided by its corporate mission: continuing growth through highest quality, for  lifetime partners, investors, suppliers and the government. ATC has undertaken several initiatives in observance of this corporate  mission, including: implementing fair labor standards; providing employees with a safe and healthy work environment; and operating its  own waste water treatment facility to contribute in the abatement of pollution in Laguna Lake in the Philippines.   Without consciously knowing it, these initiatives are the main ingredients of what we call CSR. We all have a  responsibility to each other and the world around us. Our actions affect a large number of stakeholders. It is  therefore necessary that a CSR strategy should be aligned with Sojitz and other partners so that we head in a  common direction together. Mr. Roderick M. Tan Vice President - Personnel & Legal Asian Transmission Corporation A Suppliers View Sojitz Group Supply Chain CSR website Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 63  What We Can Do as a General Trading  Company to Help Prevent Climate Change   Given the search for global sustainable growth,  Sojitz has designated the new energy and  environment business as a new growth field under the  Shine 2011 medium-term management plan. Sojitz  shares information through the Environment and New  Energy Business Committee to develop company-wide  environment and renewable energy businesses that  help prevent climate change.  In April 2011, Sojitz also established the  Environment & Urban Infrastructure Development  Office in the Machinery Division to focus on the  smart city business, which will use IT to realize a  sustainable low-carbon society. Main Initiatives and Progress in the  Year Ended March 31, 2011 Bioethanol Business in Brazil  In order to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Sojitz has  been working since 2007 to establish an integrated  business from sugar cane cultivation to bioethanol and  sugar production in Brazil through ETH Bioenergia S.A.  (ETH), in which Sojitz has an equity interest.  Bioethanol produced from sugar cane emits CO2 when  used as a fuel, but it is carbon neutral, since sugar  cane, the main plant source of bioethanol, absorbs an  equivalent amount of CO2 through photosynthesis as  it grows. Also, compared to corn-based bioethanol,  sugar cane-based bioethanol has minimal impact on  food supply. Moreover, the bagasse left over after the  juice is extracted from the sugar cane is used as fuel to  generate power, thus recovering CO2-free energy.  Sojitz and ETH are  building a biofuel  supply chain in which  ETH provides a portion  of its bioethanol to a  major Brazilian  petrochemical company  as an ingredient for  bioplastic and bio-Ethyl Tertiary-Butyl Ether (bio-ETBE),  and Sojitz sells a portion of the bio-ETBE produced to  customers in Japan and Europe as an ingredient for  biogasoline.  In February 2010, ETH further expanded its business  by undertaking a  strategic business integration with  Brenco Holding S.A., a major company in the same  sector. The new company will have bioethanol  production capacity of nearly 3 million kiloliters  annually by 2012, when nine plants are scheduled to  be in operation, making it one of worlds largest  production bases for sugar cane-based bioethanol. Solar Power-Related Business  Among all renewable energy sources, Sojitz places  special focus on solar power generation. The  expansion of solar power generation is desirable  from the perspective of reducing CO2 emissions.  Moreover, its broad base of associated businesses  and globally distributed technologies, logistics and  markets make it a field in which a general trading  company can put its strengths to use.   For solar power generation and related businesses,  the Sojitz Group has created the value chain  illustrated on the next page and is involved in  Promotion of Businesses That Contribute to  Preventing Climate Change The Morro Vermelho plant of ETH  Bioenergia S.A. in Brazil   Sojitzs environmental management system (EMS) is one of the mechanisms supporting the new  energy and environment business. Sojitz and relevant Group companies have acquired ISO 14001  certification, the international standard for environmental management, and are using environmental  management systems based on this standard.   In its EMS, Sojitz has set the company-wide objective of promoting environmentally friendly  businesses. In line with this objective, each department establishes and operates in accordance with  goals that are compatible with its business activities. Sojitz offers various training and an e-learning  program to improve employees knowledge of its EMS and the environment. We also provide  information on our CSR & Environment intranet website. In addition to continually encouraging  employees to take the Eco Test, in the year ended March 31, 2011 we instituted the Sojitz Group Forest  Preservation Campaign, in which approximately 30 participants engaged in grass mowing and tree- thinning activities at the Higashi Toyoda nature preservation area in Hino City. Environmental Management System The Forest Preservation Campaign Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 64  The Sojitz Groups Corporate  Social Responsibility numerous upstream to downstream projects in Japan  and overseas.  To meet expanding demand for solar power  generation, Sojitz is focusing on the upstream  business of importing high-purity silicon metal, the  main raw material used in making solar batteries. We  have concluded an agreement with the worlds  largest silicon metal manufacturer, Globe Specialty  Metals Inc. of the United States, to be its general  distributor in Asia for silicon metal. As a result, Sojitz  now supplies about 50% of Japans high-purity  silicon metal. Until now, we depended on China as  our main supplier. However, we aim to stabilize our  supply by increasing procurement from the United  States and Brazil, and supply about half of the rapidly  increasing demand in  South Korea, Taiwan  and elsewhere in Asia. Initiatives in Power Storage Technologies  Sojitz is also developing power storage technologies,  which are the key to efficient power use. We have  invested in Advanced Capacitor Technologies, Inc., a  manufacturer of lithium-ion capacitors, which hold  considerable promise as rechargeable and long-lasting  power storage devices. The company increased its  production capacity for high-quality capacitors by  starting operation at a new plant in 2010. It is also  applying its technology by developing a new power  conditioner that stabilizes the output of residential solar  power generation systems.   Sojitz also supplies the nonwoven fabric separator  for lithium-ion batteries, which are used in the  production of electric vehicles (EV) by a leading  German automobile  manufacturer. In Japan, the  batteries are being developed  as storage cells for wind and  solar power generation. Lithium-ion batteries using  the nonwoven fabric  separator supplied by Sojitz   Sojitz Marine & Engineering Corporation (SOMEC) is a dealer in Japan for ballast water  treatment systems for ships manufactured by Ecochlor, Inc. of the United States.   Used to stabilize vessels at sea, ballast water is taken on in ports where cargo is unloaded  and discharged in ports where new loading occurs. However, this raises a concern that marine  creatures (alien species) in the ballast water from one port will invade native species at the  next port where the water is discharged, resulting in damage to the ecosystem. The  International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted the International Convention for the  Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments in 2004. The convention is  expected to go into force in 2012, after which all ships in the world will be required to have a ballast water treatment system after a  phase-in period. The system sold by SOMEC is compliant with United States Coast Guard standards, which are stricter than the IMO  standard, and with the standards of individual U.S. states. A ship owned by Sojitz scheduled for completion at the end of 2011 will  be the first in Japan to be equipped with this system.

Main Initiatives and Progress in the  Year Ended March 31, 2011 Contributing to Environmental Measures  and Energy Efficiency Improvement in the  Russian Far East  In November 2010, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.  and Sojitz concluded an agreement with the Russian  government-affiliated corporation Far Eastern Center  for Strategic  Research on Fuel  and Energy  Complex  Development to  jointly undertake  combined heat  and power  cogeneration  projects in the  Russian Far East.   A component of  Russias environmental  improvement measures  and energy efficiency  improvement, the project  will provide highly  efficient cogeneration  systems to municipalities  located along a  1,800-kilometer-long  natural gas pipeline  linking Sakhalin, Khabarovsk and Vladivostok,  scheduled to open in 2012. The cogeneration systems  will replace aging boilers currently in use in the Russian  Far East, supplying energy-efficient electricity and hot  water while significantly cutting CO2 emissions.   A total of 30 gas turbine power generation systems  and ancillary facilities are scheduled for delivery in the  first phase of the project, from 2012 to 2014.  Significantly lower electricity and heating costs due to  fuel savings are expected to attract industry to the  Russian Far East and reverse the regions ongoing  population decline.   Positive evaluation of an earlier project awarded to  Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Sojitz for the provision  of seven cogeneration systems to be used at the 2012  APEC summit site in Vladivostok was key to winning  these most recent contracts.

The facility includes two classrooms, an office, a  kitchen, toilets and playground equipment. We also supplied study materials, and conducted  awareness-raising activities and training in pre-school education for teachers and community  leaders. We expect that such activities will result in high-quality classes relevant to the ages of  the children and nurture their sound physical and mental growth.  *  Plan Japan is a member of Plan, a non-profit organization that provides assistance for community  development involving the children in 50 countries worldwide.

Production is scheduled to  begin in 2015.  As the worlds top producer of natural gas, Russia  plans to promote industrial development by adding  value to natural gas. The new fertilizer plant will use  natural gas as a raw material. With demand for  fertilizer forecast to steadily increase as food production  rises to feed a growing global population, the fertilizer  plant is expected to contribute to the development of  industry and agriculture in Russia.   Sojitz is building a partnership with the Republic of  Tatarstan through framework agreements, and has  already taken part in initiatives in the region such as  establishment of a joint venture to produce and  market trucks. Our success in getting the fertilizer  plant project contract reflects the recognition of these  achievements. Contributing to the Development of Local  Communities through Tree-Planting Activities  Sojitz engages in the woodchip processing business  through four joint ventures in Vietnam that export  processed woodchips, mainly for use as raw materials  by Japanese paper manufacturers.  The timber that serves as the raw material is  produced through tree-planting activities initiated by  Sojitz in 1995, primarily on degraded lands in Vietnam.  We provide loans and free seedlings to local farmers,  who raise the trees and sell the timber to us. The area  of forest created under this program has grown to  about 53,700 hectares. In the future, we plan to extend  this community development-oriented program to  Mozambique and Laos as well.   In 2009, we also initiated our school plantation  program. Under this program, we distribute free  seedlings to junior and senior high schools in Vietnam  while conducting environmental education, and buy the  mature trees. We also provide free fertilizer for the  program via Japan Vietnam Fertilizer Company, a Sojitz  Group company that manufactures and sells fertilizer in  Vietnam. After initial care, the distributed seedlings  require little hands-on attention and mature to  harvestable thickness in seven years. Students learn the  importance of nature through this program, while  schools use the proceeds earned to cover a portion of  their expenses, such as educational material purchases  and equipment  repair. We intend to  continue expanding  the planted area  under the program,  which reached 150  hectares in 2010. At a school near the Vung Ang Factory in  Vietnam Future Initiatives   In the year ending March 31, 2012, we plan to improve sanitation and nutrition conditions in Maliza village by constructing water wells,  conducting hygiene training and supplying gardening and poultry farming equipment. We plan to build similar educational facilities and  provide training in Mahina Kati village of Mwanza region as well.    Improving the pre-school environment to promote early childhood education is one of the key goals of international education agreed upon  by the international community led by the United Nations, and the need for and significance of such projects is increasing. We also aim to have  community residents volunteer for the projects and utilize their experience to help attain the self-reliance of the entire region.   We will continue to implement such social contribution activities with the aim of co-existence with local communities, in line with the theme  of education.   Before, the floors got wet and dirty when it rained, but now we can have fun playing in the classroom. (Kabula, age 4)    We now have desks, so I can learn letters and shapes with my friends. (Mwishamda, age 3)    Maliza Kindergarten has become a model kindergarten for the region. Our kids are all happy and enjoy coming here. Were really thankful to Sojitz  for their support. (Mr. Paschal, Maliza Village Chairman) Comments from the Local Community Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 67 Signing ceremony  The Sojitz Groups Approach to Human Resources  The Sojitz Group depends on its employees for  growth and development. Sojitz implements various  personnel and employee development systems to make  it a rewarding company to work for and creates  fulfilling workplace environments that support a  diversity of people and work styles. Sojitz has identified  developing globally competent human resources as one  of its key themes under the Shine 2011 medium-term  management plan, and confirmed the importance of  training all employees in the Sojitz Group. A Rewarding Company Human Resources Development Policy  Sojitz defines globally competent human resources  as self-aware, self-driven people who create a more  affluent society by combining four strengths and three  qualities to provide added value in an international  business environment and by aiming to improve the  organization overall. When recruiting, we carefully  interview candidates and select those with the  potential to become globally competent human  resources. We provide employees with opportunities  for independent action and an environment that  enhances their ability to create value. We focus on  cultivating self-driven, independent-minded employees  who act responsibly. Diverse Training Programs  Sojitz has prepared a menu of training programs to  hone the skills and personal qualities required for  every type of work. We augment the menu with new  content in response to changes in the work  environment. In the year ended March 31, 2011, we  strengthened training to enhance communication  skills and on-the-job training functions, and our  system for making employees more globally minded. Note:  Please see the Sojitz website for details regarding the training  menu and achievements. (http://www.sojitz.com/en/csr/employee/index.html) Job Rotation System  Sojitz employs a job rotation system to promote  systematic human resource training from a medium-to- long-term perspective. By experiencing several different  jobs, employees acquire diverse expertise and skills, and  well-rounded thinking and behavior. As a component  of our job rotation system, in the year ended March 31,  2011 we implemented a career navigation system – a  database of employees work experiences – for use in  dialogues with and reviews by supervisors.  Fulfilling Workplace Environments Promoting Work-Life Balance  Sojitz offers systems that enable employees to  balance work with child and nursing care. In the year  ended March 31, 2010, we revised our child care system  to extend child care leave until the child is two years and  six months old, at the maximum, and introduced a  system of shortened work hours for employees raising  children. We also introduced a program to support  employees taking child care leave. In the year ended  March 31, 2011, we launched a subsidy system for the  use of babysitters. As a result of this series of initiatives,  more male employees have used the systems to take  Making the Sojitz Group Statement a Reality The Sojitz Group provides all employees with the opportunity and facilities to learn, interact and grow.

Sojitz received  the Kurumin Mark for its efforts as  a corporation to support the next  generation.  In April 2011, we moved to  further promote work-life balance  by launching four new nursing care programs that  increase the number of family care leave days, reduce  working hours for caregivers, re-hire employees who  leave the Company to care for family members, and  allow employees to take long-term leave for family  care multiple times.  Promoting Diversity  To further develop an environment in which  women can flourish, we hold comprehensive and  supplementary training for female employees with  the aim of helping them acquire management skills  and create networks. In addition, the Sojitz Group  actively employs persons with disabilities. Global Human Resources Strategy and  Group Human Resources Strategy Global Human Resources Strategy  The Sojitz Group is actively strengthening human  resources overseas. We assign overseas employees to  serve as Global HR Representatives in each of our five  overseas regions (the Americas; Europe, Russia & NIS;  China; Asia & Oceania; and Middle East & Africa).  They develop personnel systems at overseas offices,  conduct training on the Sojitz Group Statement and  the Companys history, and implement other initiatives  to hire, train, and utilize talented human resources.  The Global Human Resources Team, which manages  the Global Human Resources Strategy, undertakes  initiatives such as promoting the creation of bilingual  versions of internal documents, providing e-learning  for overseas offices, and reinforcing language and  cultural adaptability training for head office  employees.  In the year ended March 31, 2011, Sojitz enhanced  the English ability of head office employees assigned  to overseas posts, sent young employees overseas as  trainees and systemized head office training for  overseas employees. Group Human Resources Strategy  To develop and strengthen the Sojitz Groups human  resources, Sojitz provides Group company employees  with a portion of its new employee training curriculum  and the same basic and risk management training as it  does for head office employees in Tokyo. We also have  a system that offers practical training at the head  office corporate division.  In addition, to develop, strengthen and build a  network of the next generation of executive personnel  and core Group management, from the year ended  March 31, 2010 Sojitz has been progressively  introducing cross- Group training  programs for  specific levels of  management. Comments from a Child Care Leave User and the Supervisor Yoko Miyata, Nuclear Energy Department   Thanks to the child care leave system, I could devote myself to child-rearing and spend quality time with my  family. Although I felt some anxiety returning to the office after a long absence, I could fully enjoy the system  because I knew I had the support of my colleagues. Now that I'm back at work, I am doing my best to show my  gratitude to them.  Noboru Kataoka, General Manager, Nuclear Energy Department    I think its important for employees taking child care leave, and their coworkers, to be aware of a couple of things.    The first – which isnt limited to child care leave – is that relationships of trust with people inside and outside the  Company and mutual understanding are built through daily efforts. In addition, its important for coworkers to  respect each other and each others way of life.

In this environment, Sojitz increased sales  and earnings as a result of recovery in the prices of  products it handles and increased demand. We also  began to see signs of a fundamental recovery in  profitability.  Furthermore, we achieved steady success in  strengthening the balance sheet, a goal of the  Shine 2011 medium-term management plan. Our  basic approach in making new investments and  loans was asset reallocation that did not expand  the balance sheet. Sojitz worked to increase asset  efficiency by withdrawing from businesses with low  profitability or without growth potential and  redeploying funds to businesses in which Sojitz is  strong and can expect growth.  As a result, Sojitz achieved the numerical targets  of Shine 2011 as it did in the previous fiscal year,  with a net debt equity ratio of 2.1 times and a ratio  of risk assets to shareholders equity below 1.0  times at 0.9 times. The appreciation of the yen  caused net assets to decrease compared with the  previous fiscal year-end, but Sojitz was able to  remain in line with the levels of the previous fiscal  year by strengthening the balance sheet.  Sojitz maintained a stable funding structure and  sound finances, with a long-term debt ratio of 72%  and a current ratio of 142%. Moreover, Sojitz  complemented an existing 100.0 billion  commitment line by concluding an agreement for a  US$300 million multi-currency commitment line to  further enhance liquidity.  Moving to generate sustained growth in the  future, in the year ending March 31, 2012 Sojitz  will continue to accumulate quality assets and  businesses with a view to increasing asset  efficiency. We will also further our efforts to  maintain a sound financial foundation and build a  strong earnings foundation. A Message from Executive Vice President Yoji Sato Aiming for sustained growth, Sojitz will  continue to enhance its earnings foundation  by maintaining sound finances and  accumulating quality assets through asset  reallocation.

Financial Summary For the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 83 Financial Section  1. Overview  The year ended March 31, 2011 began with a  gradual recovery in the global economy supported  by fiscal and monetary measures. While the  developed economies of Europe and the Americas  recovered slowly, Asian economies generally grew  briskly, led by China and India. The U.S. economy  avoided the recessionary relapse that had been a  concern in the previous year, with improved  corporate earnings and increased consumer  spending supporting continued recovery despite  persistently high unemployment. Germany led  gradual economic recovery in Europe, although  political turmoil erupted at fiscal year-end, with  Irelands ruling party voted out of power and  Portugals prime minister announcing his  resignation. These events gave rise to renewed  sovereign credit concerns.  The Japanese economys growth rate turned  negative in the fiscal third quarter (October –  December 2010) for the first time in five quarters.  Positive growth was initially expected to resume  from the fiscal fourth quarter and the economy  did regain momentum.  However, the repercussions of the Great East  Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011 have created  uncertainty in the outlook for economic recovery  in Japan due to concerns including the resulting  nuclear power plant problems and electricity  supply issues.  In addition to the above, the global economy faces  risks from rising crude oil prices and unrest in the  Middle East and Africa that has engulfed Tunisia,  Egypt and Libya. Another risk factor that bears  monitoring is intermittent monetary tightening in  emerging countries, mainly in Asia. Under these  conditions, economic recovery and growth rates are  diverging among regions and countries. 2. Business Results  In the year ended March 31, 2011, the second  year of the Shine 2011 medium-term management  plan ending March 31, 2012, Sojitz moved to  reinforce the earnings foundation of businesses  that have been slow to recover and to accumulate  high-quality businesses and assets. As a result,  consolidated ordinary income was 45.3 billion  and consolidated net income was 16.0 billion.  We therefore achieved both our forecast at the  beginning of the fiscal year for ordinary income of  26.0 billion and net income of 11.0 billion and  our forecast announced on October 29, 2010 for  ordinary income of 40.0 billion and net income  of 12.0 billion.   The following is an analysis of business  performance for the year ended March 31, 2011. (1) Net Sales  Net sales increased 4.4% year on year to  4,014,640 million. Sales decreased in the  Machinery segment due to lower aircraft-related  sales. Sales in the Energy & Metal segment  increased because of growth in coal trading  volume and both higher prices and increased  trading volume for several other products,  including precious metals and ferroalloys. Sales in  the Chemicals & Functional Materials segment  increased due to factors including higher methanol  prices and trading volume driven by demand  recovery in China and elsewhere in Asia. Sales in  the Consumer Lifestyle Business segment  increased because of growth in tobacco and forest  product sales. (2) Gross Trading Profit  Gross trading profit increased 14,522 million  year on year to 192,725 million as a result of  multiple factors, including higher sales and profits  in the Consumer Lifestyle Business segments  overseas fertilizer business, profit growth in the  Energy & Metal segment driven largely by  increased coal sales, and profit growth in the  Chemicals & Functional Materials segment  resulting largely from sales growth fueled by  demand recovery in China and elsewhere in Asia  and higher methanol prices.  (3)  Selling, General and Administrative  (SG&A) Expenses  SG&A expenses decreased 6,869 million year  on year to 155,205 million due to factors  including a decrease in provision for doubtful  receivables.

(5) Ordinary Income  Consolidated ordinary income increased 31,613  million year on year to 45,316 million as a result of  growth in equity in earnings of unconsolidated  subsidiaries and affiliates, most notably a bioethanol  producer and a steel-related company, in addition to  the increase in operating income. (6) Extraordinary Gains and Losses  Despite gain on subsequent acquisitions of  10,307 million and gain on sale and disposal of  property and equipment of 4,387 million,  extraordinary gains and losses totaled net loss of  6,004 million due to impairment loss of 9,687  million, restructuring losses of 5,097 million, and  loss and provision for loss on dissolution of  subsidiaries and affiliates of 4,856 million.  (7) Net Income  Income before income taxes and minority  interests was 39,312 million. After deduction of  income taxes of 11,400 million and deferred  income taxes of 9,103 million, income before  minority interests was 18,809 million. After  deduction of minority interests of 2,827 million,  net income was 15,982 million, an increase of  7,188 million year on year. 3. Segment Information (1) Machinery  Net sales decreased 2.9% year on year to  965,412 million despite increased automobile  sales in Europe because aircraft-related sales  declined. Net income increased 2,421 million year  on year to 3,392 million. An increase in equity in  earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and  affiliates and reduction in SG&A expenses more  than compensated for lower earnings at an auto  subsidiary in the Central and South America region.  Performance improved in the automotive business  during the year ended March 31, 2011 because a  recovery in automobile demand in the key Sojitz  Group markets of Russia and the NIS allowed Sojitz  to rationalize inventory. We forecast that results in  these markets will begin a full-scale recovery in the  year ending March 31, 2012. Demand remained  solid in Southeast Asia, and Sojitz expects robust  performance in its business there. In Venezuela we  will work to stabilize the assembly and sales  businesses and reinforce our business in the strongly  growing markets of Latin America.  In the plant and infrastructure business, during  the year ended March 31, 2011 Sojitz made steady  progress in building the foundation for stable  earnings over the medium-to-long term with  receipt of orders for three large-scale IPP projects  in Saudi Arabia and Oman. We will also expand  our equity-based generating capacity in  environmentally friendly electric power, as  exemplified by our participation in the solar power  generation business in Germany. In the Republic of  Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 85 Financial Section  Net Sales by Segment Net Income by Segment 10 11 (Billions of yen) (Billions of yen) Machinery Segments Energy & Metal Chemicals & Functional Materials Consumer Lifestyle Business Other (Including reconciliations) 10 11 3,844.4 4,014.6 8.8 16.0 20 40 0 (20) 0 2,000 4,000 5,000 1,000 3,000 (Years ended March 31) (Years ended March 31) Tatarstan, Russia, we received an order for a large- scale fertilizer plant, along with an order for a  cogeneration project in the Russian Far East. These  and other orders demonstrate the Sojitz Groups  steady success in accumulating a backlog of orders  in the plant business in emerging and resource- rich countries.  Results in the industrial systems and bearings  business were solid, supported by firm economic  conditions in the key market of China and in other  emerging markets.  In the information technology (IT) business, we  are coordinating and cooperating with related  companies to build a value chain in the  information and communication technology  business that is capable of providing integrated  services ranging from system development and IT  equipment sales and installation to maintenance  and operation. Moreover, we aim to strengthen  the data center business, which is critical in the IT  outsourcing business. Sojitz therefore deepened its  strategic partnership with Sakura Internet Inc. by  making it a consolidated subsidiary through a  tender offer to acquire a majority interest. Also,  we are expanding into the promising growth  market of Asia with the aim of serving it as a  single IT services market.  In the marine business, the impact of factors  such as floods in Australia from the end of 2010  resulted in a rapid decrease in cargo movement.  Overall, however, demand in the marine business  remained vigorous, which contributed to stable  earnings. We are also concentrating on developing  new sources of earnings in the environmental area  through businesses including the sale of water  treatment systems for complying with ship ballast  water discharge regulations.  In the commercial aircraft business, we delivered  a total of 27 aircraft including B737s and B777s to  Japanese airlines as the import and sales  consultant to The Boeing Company of the United  States. Also, we delivered five aircraft to civilian  customers and the Japan Coast Guard as the sales  agent for the commuter planes and business jets  produced by Bombardier Inc. of Canada.  (2) Energy & Metal  Net sales increased 15.9% year on year to  1,013,982 million, reflecting growth in coal  trading volume and both increased trading volume  and higher prices for several other products,  including precious metals and ferroalloys. Net  income increased 2,940 million year on year to  26,462 million as a result of increased equity in  earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and  affiliates, including a steel-related company and a  bioethanol producer, and a gain on subsequent  acquisition of an incremental interest in a mine by  a subsidiary that holds mining interests.  Highlights in the upstream oil and gas  businesses included the start of crude oil  production at the Phoenix Field in the Gulf of  Mexico in October 2010 and accelerated  development of tight-sand gas in Texas, U.S.A. We  expect our share of production volume to increase  because of the start of production at newly  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Operations Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 86  acquired concessions and additional drilling and  development at upstream concessions in which we  have an ownership interest. We will respond to  the global energy demand behind the persistently  high price of crude oil.  In coal and non-ferrous metals, we are enhancing  the foundation for generating growth by acquiring  resources and expanding the trading business  through ownership of upstream interests. Examples  during the year ended March 31, 2011 included the  acquisition of copper interests in Canada, expansion  of our alumina refining business at the joint venture  BHP Billiton Worsley Alumina Pty. Ltd. and  development of coal fields. In December 2010,  Sojitz raised its stake in the Minerva Coal Joint  Venture in Australia to 96% by acquiring an  additional 51% interest in the mine, and is now  employing its unique and proprietary capabilities as  one of the few general trading companies currently  engaged in coal mine management. Sojitz also  decided in December 2010 to add to its coking coal  interests by increasing investment in the expansion  of the Lake Vermont Coal Mine in Australia, and  expects that its share of production volume will  increase for coking coal for steel production in  addition to thermal coal for power generation.  Given firm markets for coal and non-ferrous metals,  we expect increased share of production volume to  contribute both to earnings and the stable supply of  resources from the year ending March 31, 2012.  In ferrous materials & steel products, Sojitz  initiated expansion of a molybdenum mine in  Canada. We also acquired shares of Companhia  Brasileira de Metalurgia e Minerao (CBMM),  which owns niobium interests in Brazil, via  investment in a special purpose company (SPC)  formed in March 2011. CBMM is a leading global  producer of niobium, which is a rare metal  indispensable to the production of high-grade  steel. The investment further strengthens Sojitzs  stable niobium supply capabilities. Moreover, our  progress in selling iron ore and developing iron ore  mines contributed to our efforts to establish a  stable earnings base from our own iron ore  interests and a framework for iron ore supply. We  also strengthened our cooperative relationship  with affiliate Metal One to sell steel products in  Japan and around the world, which will build a  solid base for an integrated business from steel  raw materials to finished product sales.  In new energy & environmental business, ETH  Bioenergia S.A., a Brazilian bioethanol company  that has integrated bioethanol and sugar  production and biomass power starting from sugar  cane cultivation, made steady progress in business  expansion. It is constructing two new plants that  will complement its seven plants currently in  operation, for a total of nine plants in operation  by the end of 2011. This is projected to make it  the largest sugar cane-based producer in Brazil. In  addition, Sojitz is the leading importer to Japan of  high-purity silicon metal, which is a key raw  material in solar panels. We will use this strength  in our initiatives to supply raw materials to the  solar power business. (3) Chemicals & Functional Materials  Net sales increased 11.8% year on year to  612,511 million due to factors including higher  methanol prices and trading volume driven by  demand recovery in China and elsewhere in Asia.  Net income increased 1,459 million year on year  to 2,712 million.  The Groups business model for the Chemicals &  Functional Materials segment focuses on  distribution. We work to increase earnings by  investing in upstream businesses to build a  distribution value chain that ranges from the supply  of raw materials to sales for strategic products, such  as industrial salt, rare earths and methanol. All of  these strategic products are basic raw materials, and  we therefore expect business to grow in tandem  with global economic development.  Trading volume increased in the chemicals  business during the year ended March 31, 2011  because of recovery in demand centered on China  and elsewhere in Asia. We expect this trend to  continue in the year ending March 31, 2012. In  November 2010, we concluded a strategic alliance  agreement with Lynas Corporation Limited of  Australia covering a project to supply and expand  production of rare earths. In March 2011, Sojitz and  Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation  agreed to acquire 0.73% of Lynas shares. Sojitz  Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 87 Financial Section  also moved to meet the challenge of providing a  long-term stable supply of rare earths to Japan by  signing a sole distribution and agency agreement  for the Japanese market. Additionally, in February  2011 Sojitz decided to invest in a marine chemical  project in India to produce potash fertilizer and  industrial salt. These initiatives exemplify our moves  to strengthen our distribution value chain by locking  in sources of supply for strategic products that we  expect to be in demand in the future.  In functional materials, the plastics business was  steady because demand recovered in China and  elsewhere in Asia during the year ended March  31, 2011. We expect this trend to continue during  the year ending March 31, 2012. Wholly owned  subsidiary Sojitz Cosmetics Corporation made  progress in developing its own cosmetics brands.  In April 2010, it launched naturecia, a natural  cosmetics brand that uses 100% natural water as  its base, and in February 2011 it launched  AMIJOUE, an anti-aging care cosmetics brand  containing amino acids. Sojitz Cosmetics will focus  on developing appealing new brands in the future. (4) Consumer Lifestyle Business  Net sales increased 1.0% year on year to  1,378,001 million because of growth in tobacco  and forest product sales. Net income totaled 1,089  million, compared to a net loss of 3,226 million in  the year ended March 31, 2010. Factors in the  return to operating profitability included improved  earnings from the overseas fertilizer business.  In food resources, the robust fertilizer business  in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines drove  segment earnings during the year ended March  31, 2011. Moving to secure food resources, Sojitz  established a wholly owned agricultural business  in Argentina to produce soybeans and other  agricultural products. Sojitz is the first Japanese  general trading company to establish and operate  an agricultural business overseas. We plan to  increase land under cultivation in South America  and use the expertise we acquire to expand  operations in emerging countries in Asia, Africa  and elsewhere.  In marine products, in December 2010 wholly  owned Sojitz Tuna Farm Takashima Co., Ltd. in  Takashima, Nagasaki Prefecture began shipments of  the bluefin tuna it raises. In overseas businesses, we  completed a specialized port for grains for investee  Interflour Vietnam Ltd. With 3 million tons of  annual cargo-handling capacity and a warehouse  and silos for grain storage, it is the largest  specialized port for grains in the ASEAN region.  Interflour Vietnam also added a flour milling line  with the intention of doubling flour production  capacity by the year ending March 31, 2012 to  become the leading flour producer in Vietnam.  In forest products, Sojitz and Sojitz Building  Materials Corporation have obtained CoC (Chain  of Custody) certification verifying that the forest  products they handle come from certified forests.  We will strengthen our business in this area by  focusing on securing environmentally responsible  forest products that come from certified  plantations and forests. In the woodchip and  afforestation businesses, Sojitz is strong in  Vietnam. We plan to establish the country as our  most important base for woodchip production by  doubling production capacity at our woodchip  production bases there through moves such as  plant expansion. We also established a woodchip  processing and export company in the African  country of Mozambique in 2010. Sojitz will expand  its woodchip business in anticipation of increasing  demand for paper in China as well as Japan, while  moving to expand sales in European markets to  meet projected growth in biomass demand.  In real estate development, we have been  concentrating on selling existing condominium  projects. We also plan to become involved in  businesses overseas such as participation in the  development of industrial parks in Vietnam and  other emerging countries.  In textiles, we built on the 90-year tradition of  the McGREGOR American casual brand by  launching the new McGREGOR CLASSIC brand in  June 2010. We are complementing our established  presence in department stores by developing  relationships with stores in urban shopping malls in  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Operations Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 88  metropolitan Tokyo. In general commodities &  retail, we import branded goods such as shoes and  suitcases for sale in Japan and overseas. Our  strategy for this business involves plans to develop  retail businesses that benefit from the rapid growth  of consumer markets in emerging countries. (5) Other  Net sales decreased 28.9% year on year to  44,734 million. Net loss improved 3,648 million  compared with the previous fiscal year to 5,458  million, largely because the absence of the  extraordinary loss on devaluation of securities  related to the preferred shares of Japan Airlines  Co., Ltd. in the year ended March 31, 2010 more  than offset the recognition of restructuring losses  resulting from asset reallocation. 4. Earnings of Group Companies  As of March 31, 2011, the Sojitz Group comprised  475 companies, a decrease of 15 companies  compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. Of this number, 320 companies (93 in Japan, 227 overseas) were consolidated subsidiaries, and  155 companies (42 in Japan, 113 overseas) were  affiliated companies accounted for under the equity  method. Companies included in the scope of  consolidation that reported net income included  208 consolidated subsidiaries, or 65.0% of the total  (197 consolidated subsidiaries, or 59.9%, in the  previous fiscal year), and 120 equity-method  affiliates, or 77.4% of the total (122 equity-method  affiliates, or 75.8%, in the previous fiscal year). On  an overall basis, 69.1% (65.1% in the previous  fiscal year) reported net income for the year ended  March 31, 2011. The operating performance of  companies included in the scope of consolidation is  presented in the table below. 5. Financial Position (1) Consolidated Balance Sheets 1) Assets  At March 31, 2011, total assets decreased 43,958  million from a year earlier to 2,116,961 million.  Current assets decreased 18,648 million from a  year earlier to 1,266,630 million.

Investments and long-term receivables  decreased 27,864 million from a year earlier to  448,797 million due in part to sale of investment  properties totaling 19,267 million.   Property and equipment decreased 6,890  million from a year earlier to 215,775 million.   Other non-current assets increased 9,444  million from a year earlier to 185,759 million. 2) Liabilities  At March 31, 2011, liabilities decreased 22,065  million from a year earlier to 1,761,450 million.  Current liabilities increased 49,012 million from  a year earlier to 890,545 million. Primary factors  included an increase of 37,348 million in trade  notes and accounts payable due largely to growth  in tobacco, coal, and non-ferrous metal sales.  Non-current liabilities decreased 71,077 million  from a year earlier to 870,905 million due  primarily to repayment of long-term loans and  redemption of bonds.  Total interest-bearing debt decreased 77,215  million from a year earlier to 1,116,303 million.  Net interest-bearing debt, calculated as total  interest-bearing debt less cash and deposits,  decreased 37,182 million from a year earlier to  700,608 million, resulting in a net debt equity  ratio of 2.1 times at March 31, 2011. 3) Net Assets  Owners equity increased 12,869 million from a  year earlier to 471,689 million as net income after  dividend payments more than compensated for  reduction in retained earnings due to changes in  accounting standards. In accumulated other  comprehensive income, net unrealized gains (losses)  on available-for-sale securities decreased 2,535  million from a year earlier due largely to fluctuation  in stock prices and exchange rates. Moreover,  foreign currency translation adjustments reduced  accumulated other comprehensive income by an  additional 32,433 million compared with a year  earlier. As a result, total net assets including minority  interests at March 31, 2011 decreased 21,893  million from a year earlier to 355,511 million. (2) Cash Flow 1) Cash Flows from Operating Activities  Net cash provided by operating activities  decreased 39,360 million year on year to  67,863 million. In the year ended March 31,  2011, increase in trade payables partially offset  the use of cash for increases in trade receivables  and inventories. 2) Cash Flows from Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities totaled  19,903 million. In the previous fiscal year,  investing activities provided net cash totaling  28,439 million. In the year ended March 31,  2011, payments for purchase of property and  equipment used cash totaling 27,253 million,  with acquisitions including ferroalloy, oil and gas  field facilities and alumina refining facilities.  Payments for purchase of intangible assets used  cash totaling 21,196 million for acquisitions  including coal mine, oil and gas concessions.  Payments for purchase of investment securities  totaled 20,647 million including investment in a  company that produces the rare metal niobium.  Proceeds from sale/redemption of investment  securities totaled 14,229 million, reflecting in  part the redemption of bonds issued by oil and  gas development companies, while collection of  long-term loans receivable totaled 11,174  million due in part to repayment of loans by  equity-method affiliates. 3) Free Cash Flow  As a result of the above, free cash flow for the  year ended March 31, 2011 totaled 47,960  million, a decrease of 87,702 million from  135,662 million for the previous fiscal year. 4) Cash Flows from Financing Activities  Net cash used in financing activities decreased  30,543 million year on year to 72,054 million.  In the year ended March 31, 2011, the use of cash  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Operations Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 90  for repayment of loans and redemption of bonds  and commercial paper exceeded proceeds from  long-term debt and issuance of bonds.  As a result of the above, cash and cash  equivalents at the end of the fiscal year, including  the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash  equivalents and the decrease in cash and cash  equivalents resulting from change of scope of  consolidation, decreased 39,001 million from a  year earlier to 415,261 million. (3) Liquidity and Funding  As in the previous fiscal year, the Sojitz Groups  fundamental policy under the Shine 2011  medium-term management plan is to maintain  and improve the stability of its funding structure.  Specific measures include continuing to flexibly  shift from short-term to long-term funding to  create a stable funding structure while ensuring a  stable financial base by maintaining sufficient  liquidity to accommodate changes in economic  and financial conditions. As a result, as of March  31, 2011 the current ratio was 142% and the  long-term debt ratio was 72%.  Unsecured bonds are one method Sojitz uses to  procure long-term funding. Sojitz issued a total of  20.0 billion in unsecured bonds during the year  ended March 31, 2011, consisting of a 10.0  billion issue in May 2010 and a 10.0 billion issue  in October 2010. Sojitz will continue to base  future decisions to issue bonds on interest rates,  market trends, appropriate timing and cost.  Moreover, Sojitz ensures stable liquidity for  dealing with unforeseen contingencies in both yen  and foreign currencies through a 100.0 billion  long-term commitment line and a US$300 million  multi-currency commitment line.  6.  Summary of Significant  Accounting Policies  The consolidated financial statements of the  Company and its subsidiaries are prepared in  conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted in Japan. The reported amounts relating to  assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent  liabilities and the appropriate recording of revenues  and expenses for the reporting period used in the  preparation of the consolidated financial statements  are based on estimates and assumptions as  determined by the Companys management. The  Company constantly reviews and verifies estimates  and assumptions relating to the evaluation of  receivables, investments and inventories, fixed assets,  recognition of revenue, income taxes, deferred tax  assets, Group business reorganization, and  restructuring costs including those for affiliated  companies, retirement and severance benefits,  contingent liabilities, and other items. Estimates,  assumptions and decisions made by the Company  are based on historical performance and other  factors that are deemed most relevant to the  situation. In the event that insufficient facts exist to  enable the Company to make an objective decision  regarding the accounting for assets and liabilities and  income and expenses, the Company bases its  decisions on estimates and assumptions. Accordingly,  differing assumptions and changes in conditions may  cause estimates and actual results to differ.  The following are significant accounting policies  adopted by the Company and its consolidated  subsidiaries. (1) Evaluation of Receivables  The Company provides for probable losses  arising from uncollectible notes and accounts  receivable and loans receivable by maintaining an  allowance for doubtful receivables based on past  credit loss experience over the preceding three  years. For doubtful receivables, the Company  records an allowance after evaluating the  probability of recovery, considering the estimated  realization value of collateral and amounts to be  recovered by guarantees.  In order to accurately assess the allowance for  doubtful receivables, the Company periodically  verifies each customers financial position, credit  rating, conditions for collection of receivables,  changes in payment terms and conditions,  economic trends in the industry, conditions in the  region in which the customer operates, and all  other relevant information.  The Companys management believes that the  Company maintains sufficient and adequate  allowances for doubtful receivables. Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 91 Financial Section  (2) Evaluation of Investment Securities  The Company maintains a significant level of  investments that are classified according to the  purpose for which they are held, with valuation  subject to a variety of assumptions. Available-for- sale securities with available market values are  stated at fair value based on market prices as of  the balance sheet date with unrealized valuation  gains and losses, net of tax, included in net assets  in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company  recognizes devaluation losses on investment  securities whose values have declined by at least  50% of their book value. In cases in which the  values have declined 30% to 50%, and where  conditions remain substantially unchanged from  the previous fiscal year, the Companys  management evaluates the probability of recovery,  and recognizes devaluation losses except when the  value is deemed to be recoverable.  Available-for-sale securities with no readily  available fair market value are valued at cost using  the moving-average method. The Company  assesses these securities by comparing its equity in  the net asset value of the issuer with the book  value of the investment. In the event the  Companys equity in the net asset value of the  issuer has declined by at least 50% of the book  value, the Companys management assesses the  probability of recovery considering each situation,  such as venture investments or temporary declines  due to initial losses in the start-up of companies,  and recognizes devaluation losses except when the  value is deemed to be recoverable. Furthermore, in  the event the Companys equity in the net asset  value of the issuer has declined to less than 50%  of the book value, and there is no probability of  recovery, the Company recognizes the impairment  loss. In the case of bonds, the amortized cost  method is applied on an individual basis and a loss  recognized for the estimated non-redeemable  portion based on credit risk.  In the non-consolidated financial statements, the  Company prepares for any future investment losses  in connection with marketable securities of related  companies by maintaining an investment loss  allowance for estimated losses calculated on an  individual basis according to prescribed criteria after  considering such factors as the financial position  and business value of the issuer.  In recognizing devaluation losses on investment  securities and in deciding the investment loss  allowance, the Companys management reaches a  decision after considering not only the financial  position of the issuer but also specific factors  pertaining to the industry, location and region of  the issuer. (3) Evaluation of Inventories  Inventories held for sale in the ordinary course  of business are stated on the balance sheet at the  lower of acquisition cost or net selling value that  reflects any decline in profitability. Moreover,  inventories held for trading purposes are stated on  the balance sheet at the market price, and any  gain or loss arising from revaluation of inventories  for trading purposes is presented in net sales.  The market value of real estate for sale is valued  on an individual property basis by selecting the  most appropriate value from among sales price,  appraisal amount, official announced value, and  appraised value for inheritance tax purposes,  taking into consideration various conditions at the  time of appraisal. In the event conditions are  unchanged, this value is carried forward to the  following fiscal year. (4)  Depreciation and Valuation of Property,  Equipment and Intangible Assets  The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries  principally depreciate property and equipment  other than leased assets by the declining-balance  method, and depreciate intangible assets other  than leased assets by the straight-line method  based on the estimated useful lives of the  respective assets according to the Corporate Tax  Law. However, buildings acquired after April 1,  1998 are depreciated by the straight-line method.  Leased assets in finance lease transactions without  transfer of ownership are depreciated using the  straight-line method based on the assumption that  the useful life is equal to the lease term and the  residual value is equal to zero. The accounting  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Operations Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 92  treatment of the Company and its domestic  consolidated subsidiaries for finance lease  transactions without transfer of ownership that  commenced prior to April 1, 2008 is similar to that  used for ordinary rental transactions. Investment  properties are depreciated mainly using the  straight-line method, with useful lives principally  calculated according to the Corporate Tax Law.  A certain domestic consolidated subsidiary  revalues commercial-use land pursuant to Law  Concerning Revaluation of Land (Law No. 34  enforced on March 31, 1998). The related  unrealized gains or losses are recorded as land  revaluation difference in net assets in the  consolidated balance sheets. This revaluation  method is applied using the appraisal value as  prescribed in Article 2-5 of Guidelines for  Enforcement Regulations of the Law Concerning  Revaluation of Land (Ordinance No. 119 enforced  on March 31, 1998).  Impairment losses of the Company and its  domestic consolidated subsidiaries are determined  by comparing the carrying amount of assets or an  asset group with their undiscounted estimated  future cash flows. If the undiscounted estimated  future cash flows are less than the carrying  amount, the difference between the higher of  either net selling price or present value of future  projected cash flows and the carrying amount is  recognized as an impairment loss. Accumulated  impairment losses are deducted directly from the  corresponding assets. (5) Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities  Where temporary differences exist between the  amount of assets and liabilities for financial  reporting purposes and the bases of such assets  and liabilities as measured by tax laws, deferred  tax assets and liabilities are recorded taking into  account the tax loss carryforwards in accordance  with tax-effect accounting standards.  The Company evaluates the probability of  realization of the benefits of those deferred tax  assets based on future taxable income estimates  and tax planning. A valuation allowance is  established to reduce certain deferred tax assets  relating to deductible temporary differences and  net operating loss carryforwards where it is more  likely to be unable to realize the benefits of those  deferred tax assets as a result of rigorous  assessment by the Companys management.  Although the Companys management believes  that the realization of deferred tax assets, less  amount of valuation allowance, is probable, the  valuation allowance may change depending on  changes of estimates for future taxable income. (6)  Employees Retirement and  Severance Benefits  Employees retirement and severance benefits  are accrued based on the present value of  projected benefit obligations attributed to  employee services rendered by the end of the year  and the fair value of the pension plan assets at  fiscal year-end.  The Company has adopted a Defined  Contribution Pension Plan with a Lump-sum  Payment Plan or a Prepaid Retirement  Allowance Plan as its retirement and severance  benefit scheme. Domestic consolidated  subsidiaries maintain employees welfare pension  fund plans, tax qualified pension plans and lump- sum payment plans as defined fund plans for the  most part. Some consolidated subsidiaries have  established a retirement allowance trust. Some  foreign consolidated subsidiaries also have defined  benefit plans. (7)  Directors and Corporate Auditors  Retirement Benefits  Certain domestic subsidiaries recognize  retirement benefits for directors and executive  officers based on internal regulations to provide  for expected retirement benefits for directors and  corporate auditors as of the balance sheet date,  based on Auditing Treatment Relating to Reserve  Defined under the Special Tax Measurement Law,  Reserve Defined under the Special Law and  Reserve for Director and Corporate Auditor  Retirement Benefits (Auditing and Assurance  Practice Committee Report No. 42 issued by the  Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants  on April 13, 2007). Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 93 Financial Section  7. Business and Other Risks (1) Business Risks  As a general trading company, Sojitz is engaged  in a wide range of businesses globally, including  buying, selling, importing, and exporting goods,  manufacturing and selling products, providing  services, and planning and coordinating projects,  in Japan and overseas. The Group also invests in  various sectors and conducts financing activities.  These operations are inherently exposed to various  risks. The Group defines and classifies risks and  manages them in accord with their nature. For  quantifiable risks (market risks, credit risk, business  investment risk, and country risk), the Group  conducts comprehensive risk management,  measuring risks and monitoring them based on  risk asset scores derived from risk measurements. Although the Group is strengthening and  upgrading its risk management to deal with various  risks, it cannot completely avoid these risks. 1)  Risk of changes in the macroeconomic  environment  As a general trading company with global  operations, Sojitz operates a wide range of  businesses in Japan and overseas, including  Machinery, Energy & Metal, Chemicals & Functional  Materials, and Consumer Lifestyle Business. The  Groups earnings are influenced by economic  conditions in Japan and other countries and the  overall global economy. A global or regional  economic slowdown can adversely affect the Groups  operating performance and/or financial condition. 2) Market risks  The Group is exposed to market risks, including  exchange rate risk associated with transactions  denominated in foreign currencies in connection  with international trade or business investments;  interest rate risk associated with debt financing  and portfolio investment; commodity price risk  associated with purchase and sale agreements and  commodity inventories incidental to operating  activities; and market price risk associated with  holding listed securities and other such assets. The  Group pursues a basic policy of minimizing these  market risks through such means as matching  assets and liabilities (e.g., long and short  commodity exposures) and hedging with forward  exchange contracts, commodity futures/forward  contracts, and interest rate swaps. (a) Currency risk  The Group engages in import and export  transactions, and offshore transactions,  denominated in foreign currencies as a principal  business activity. Whereas the revenues and  expenditures associated with such transactions are  mainly paid in foreign currencies, the Groups  consolidated reporting currency is the Japanese  yen. The Group is therefore exposed to the risk of  fluctuations in the yens value against foreign  currencies, and hedges its foreign currency  exposure with forward exchange contracts to  prevent or limit losses stemming from this currency  risk. Even with such hedging, however, there is no  assurance that the Group can completely avoid  currency risk. The Groups operating performance  and/or financial condition could be adversely  affected by unanticipated market movements.  Additionally, the Groups dividend income from  overseas Group companies and the profits and  losses of overseas consolidated subsidiaries and  equity-method affiliates are largely denominated  in foreign currencies. Their conversion into yen  entails currency risk. The Group also owns many  foreign subsidiaries and operating companies.  When these companies financial statements are  converted into yen, exchange rate movements  could impair the Groups net assets through the  foreign currency translation adjustment account. (b) Interest rate risk  The Group raises funds by borrowing from  financial institutions or issuing bonds to acquire  fixed assets, invest in securities, and extend credit  (e.g., through trade receivables). An increase in  funding costs due to a sharp rise in interest rates  could adversely affect the Groups operating  performance and/or financial condition through  income derived from and expenses incurred on  assets and liabilities on the Groups balance sheets. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Operations Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 94  extended trade credit to identify those that meet  certain criteria. It then reassesses the selected  customers creditworthiness and the status of the  Groups claims against these customers. Through  this approach, the Group is endeavoring to more  rigorously ascertain credit risk and estimate  provisions to allowance for doubtful accounts for  individual receivables. For credit risk associated  with deferred payments, loans, and credit  guarantees, the Group periodically assesses  whether profitability is commensurate with credit  risk on a case-by-case basis. For transactions that  do not generate risk-commensurate returns, the  Group takes steps to improve profitability or limit  credit risk.  However, even with such credit management  procedures, there is no assurance that the Group  can completely avoid credit risk. If, for example,  receivables are rendered uncollectible by a  customers bankruptcy, the Groups operating  performance and/or financial condition could be  adversely affected. 4) Business investment risk  The Group invests in a wide range of businesses  as one of its principal business activities. In doing  so, it assumes the risk of fluctuations in the value  of these investments. Additionally, because many  business investments are illiquid, the Group also  faces the risk of being unable to recoup its  investment as profitably as initially anticipated.  With the aim of preventing and limiting losses  from business investments, the Group has  established standards for rigorously prescreening  prospective business investments and monitoring  and withdrawing from investments.  In screening prospective investments, the Group  analyzes business plans, including cash flow  projections, and rigorously assesses the businesses  prospects. It has also established procedures,  including an IRR (internal rate of return) hurdle  rate screen, to enable it to identify investments  with the potential to generate returns  commensurate with risk.  Once the Group has invested in a business  venture, it closely monitors the business through  (c) Commodity price risk  As a general trading company, the Group deals  in a wide range of commodities in its various  businesses. It is consequently exposed to the risk  of commodity price fluctuations. For market- traded commodities, the Group manages  exposures and controls losses by setting (long and  short) position limits and stop-loss levels for each  of its organizational units. The Group also imposes  and enforces stop-loss rules (i.e., organizational  units must promptly liquidate losing positions and  are prohibited from initiating new trades for the  remainder of the fiscal year if unit losses, including  valuation losses, exceed the stop-loss level). Even  with these controls, however, there is no assurance  that the Group can completely avoid commodity  price risk. The Groups operating performance and/ or financial condition could be adversely affected  by unanticipated market movements. The Group  also monitors commodity inventories by business  unit on a monthly basis to control inventory levels. (d) Listed securities price risk  The Group has large holdings of marketable  securities. For listed shares in particular, the Group  periodically reviews its portfolio. Nonetheless, a  major decline in the stock market could impair the  Groups investment portfolio and, in turn, adversely  affect the Groups operating performance and/or  financial condition. 3) Credit risk  The Group assumes credit risk by extending credit  to many domestic and foreign customers through a  variety of commercial transactions. The Group  mitigates such credit risk by assigning credit ratings  to the customers to which it extends credit, using  an 11-grade rating scale and objective rating  criteria. The Group also controls credit risk by  setting rating-based credit limits on a customer-by- customer basis and enforcing the credit limits thus  set. The Group also employs other safeguards (e.g.,  collateral and guarantees) as warranted by the  customers creditworthiness. Additionally, the  Group has a system for assessing receivables in  which it screens the customers to which it has  Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 95 Financial Section  such means as periodic reassessment of the  businesss prospects to minimize losses through  early identification of problems. To identify  problems with business investments at an early  stage and minimize losses on divestiture or  liquidation, the Group sets exit conditions and acts  decisively to opportunely exit investments that  have failed to generate risk-commensurate  returns.  Even with such procedures for screening  prospective investments and monitoring existing  investments, the Group cannot completely avoid  the risk that investment returns will fall short of  expectations or the risk that businesses will fail to  perform according to plan. Moreover, the Group  could incur losses when exiting business ventures  or may be precluded from exiting business  ventures as intended due to circumstances such as  relationships with partners in the ventures. Such  events could adversely affect the Groups  operating performance and/or financial condition. 5) Country risk  To minimize losses that may result from country  risk, the Group recognizes that it must avoid  concentrated exposure to any single country or  region. In conducting business in countries that  pose substantial country risk, the Group generally  hedges against country risk on a transaction-by- transaction basis through such means as  purchasing trade insurance.   In managing country risk, the Group assigns  country-risk ratings to individual countries and  regions and sets net exposure (gross exposure less  trade insurance coverage and/or other country-risk  hedges) limits based on the countrys size and  assigned rating. The Group limits its net exposure  to individual countries to no more than the net  exposure limit. However, even with these risk  controls and hedges, the Group cannot completely  eliminate the risk that businesses will fail to  perform according to plan or the risk of losses due  to changes in political, economic, regulatory and  societal conditions in the countries in which the  Group conducts business activities or countries in  which the Groups customers are located. In the  event of such losses, the Groups operating  performance and/or financial condition could be  adversely affected. 6) Impairment risk  The Group is exposed to the risk of impairment  of the value of its real estate holdings and other  property, equipment and intangible assets such as  machinery, vehicles, mining rights and leased  assets. The Group uses asset impairment  accounting and recognizes necessary impairment  losses at the end of the fiscal year in which they  are identified. If assets subject to asset impairment  accounting decline materially in value due to a  decline in their market prices, recognition of  necessary impairment losses could adversely affect  the Groups operating performance and/or  financial condition. 7) Financing risk  The Group largely funds its operations by  issuing bonds and borrowing funds from  financial institutions. Accordingly, in the event  of a disruption of the financial system or  financial or capital markets, or a major  downgrade of the Groups credit rating by a  rating agency, the Groups operating  performance and/or financial condition could be  adversely affected by funding constraints and/or  increased financing costs. 8) Environmental risk  The Group regards environmental preservation  as one of the most important management  considerations. The Group has prescribed  environmental policies and is proactively  addressing environmental problems through such  means as complying with environmental laws and  regulations and assessing the environmental  impact of prospective investments and loans and  development projects. Despite such measures, the  Groups business activities could still pollute the  environment. In such an event, the Group could  incur costs due to project suspension,  environmental remediation and purification, and/ or litigation. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Operations Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 96  9) Compliance risk  The Groups diverse business activities are  subject to a broad range of laws and regulations,  including corporation laws, tax laws, antitrust  laws, foreign exchange laws and other trade- related laws, and various industry-specific laws,  including chemical regulations. To ensure  compliance with these laws and regulations, the  Group has formulated a compliance program,  established compliance committees, and promotes  rigorous regulatory compliance on a Group-wide  basis. However, such measures cannot completely  eliminate the compliance risk entailed by the  Groups business activities. Additionally, the  Groups operating performance and/or financial  condition could be adversely affected by major  statutory or regulatory revisions or application of  an unanticipated interpretation of existing laws or  regulations. 10) Litigation risk  Litigation or other legal proceedings, such as  arbitration, may be initiated in Japan or overseas  against the Group or certain of its assets in  connection with the Groups business activities. As  of March 31, 2011, the Group was not involved in  any litigation, arbitration, or other legal  proceedings with the potential to have a material  impact on its operating performance or financial  condition. 11)  Information system and information  security risks  The Group has prescribed regulations and  established oversight entities, mainly internal  committees, to appropriately protect and manage  information assets. The Group also has  implemented safeguards, such as installation of  duplicate hardware, against failure of key  information systems and network infrastructure.  Additionally, the Group is endeavoring to  strengthen its safeguards against information leaks  through such means as installing firewalls to  prevent unauthorized access by outsiders,  implementing antivirus measures, and utilizing  encryption technologies.  While the Group is working to strengthen overall  information security and prevent system failures, it  cannot completely eliminate the risk of important  information assets, including personal information,  being leaked or damaged by an unknown  computer virus or unauthorized access to its  computer systems. Nor can the Group eliminate  the risk of its information and communication  systems being rendered inoperable by an  unforeseeable natural disaster or system failure. In  such an event, the Groups operating performance  and/or financial condition could be adversely  affected, depending on the extent of the damage. 12) Natural disaster risk  The Group could be directly or indirectly  affected in the event of an earthquake, flood,  storm, or other natural disaster that damages  offices or other facilities or injures employees and  their family members. The Group has prepared  disaster response manuals, conducts disaster  response drills, and has established an employee  safety confirmation system and a business  continuity plan, but it cannot completely avoid the  risk of damage from natural disasters. The Groups  operating performance and/or financial condition  could be adversely affected by natural disasters. (2)  Risks Related to the Shine 2011  Medium-term Management Plan  As noted in 8. Group Management Policy  below, the Group has formulated a new medium- term management plan, Shine 2011, for the  period from the year ended March 31, 2010 to the  year ending March 31, 2012 (April 1, 2009 to  March 31, 2012). Despite the Groups efforts,  there is no assurance that all Shine 2011 plan  targets will be achieved. Initiatives directed at  achieving the targets may not progress as planned  or may not be as successful as anticipated. 8. Group Management Policy (1) Fundamental Policy  Sojitz has adopted a fundamental policy of  establishing a strong earnings foundation that will  ensure sustained growth by improving earnings  Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 97 Financial Section  quality. Toward this end, Sojitz formulated a  medium-term management plan named Shine  2011 – Toward Sustained Growth for the three  years from the year ended March 31, 2010  through the year ending March 31, 2012. Sojitz  will carry out the Shine 2011 plan by realizing its  Management Vision of the company it aspires to  become and the common principles it embraces in  accord with the Sojitz Group Statement below. Sojitz Group Statement The Sojitz Group produces new sources of wealth by connecting the worlds economies,  cultures and people in a spirit of integrity. Sojitz Group Slogan Sojitz Group Management Vision   Unrelentingly enhance the Groups trading  company functions, as demanded by  clients, by fully grasping and anticipating  clients diverse needs (Function-oriented  trading company)   Take advantage of changes and  continuously develop new business fields  (Innovating trading company)   Become a company in which each and  every employee can work with pride and  pursue challenges and explore  opportunities to realize his or her own  personal goals and ambitions (Open and  flexible company)   Seek to harmonize the Groups corporate  activities with the society and the  environment by consistently putting the  Groups statement into practice (Socially  contributive company) (2) Targeted Performance Indicators  Under Shine 2011, Sojitz aims to optimize its asset  portfolio while pursuing qualitative improvement by  accumulating high-quality businesses and assets and  establishing a strong, risk-resistant earnings  foundation by reconfiguring its operations. Future  key performance targets are consolidated ROA of  3%, and consolidated ROE of 15%.  Sojitz continues to place priority on maintaining  financial soundness and improving the stability of  its funding structure. Its basic policy is to maintain  the financial ratios shown in the table below.  Sojitz will further strengthen its financial base by  targeting a net debt equity ratio (DER)* of  approximately 2.0 times, which it will maintain by  limiting additional borrowings through means  including asset reallocation.       Value at      Target  March 31, 2011 Ratio of long-term   Approximately  debt to total debt  70%  72% Current ratio  At least 120%  142% Net DER (times)*  Approximately 2.0  2.1 * The figure for equity used as the denominator in the net debt equity  ratio excludes minority interests.  In addition, risk assets were 0.9 times  shareholders equity at March 31, 2011. Sojitz has  an ongoing target of limiting its risk assets to no  more than 1.0 times its shareholders equity. To do  so, Sojitz will constantly devise and execute  measures such as exiting low-margin businesses,  rationalizing inventory and reducing holdings of  listed stock. (3)  Medium-to-Long-term Business  Strategy  Under the Shine 2011 medium-term  management plan intended to achieve sustained  growth, Sojitz aims to establish a strong earnings  foundation by improving earnings quality, thereby  ensuring growth.  In accord with the four themes of Shine 2011  below, Sojitz will continuously work to strengthen  existing businesses, expand resource businesses and  cultivate new businesses, particularly in the  environmental, new energy and agribusiness fields. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Operations Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 98  9. Basic Policy on Dividends  Sojitz considers the stable, continuous payment  of dividends to shareholders one of the most  important management issues. An equally  important issue is the need to enhance  competitiveness and shareholder value by  increasing internal capital reserves and using them  effectively.  Sojitz decided to pay a year-end cash dividend  of 1.50 per share for the year ended March 31,  2011 after considering factors including  shareholders equity and its requirements for  funding investments in growth. Year-end dividends  paid totaled 1,877 million. Including the interim  dividend of 1.50 per share paid on December 2,  2010, cash dividends per share for the year ended  March 31, 2011 totaled 3.00 per share, and  dividends paid totaled 3,753 million. The payout  ratio for the year ended March 31, 2011 was  therefore 23.5%.  Sojitzs Articles of Incorporation permit the  payment of interim cash dividends by the  resolution of the Board of Directors as stipulated  by Article 454, Paragraph 5 of the Companies Act  of Japan. As a result, Sojitzs basic policy is to pay  dividends twice annually, with the interim dividend  being approved by resolution of the Board of  Directors and the year-end dividend being approved  by the Ordinary General Shareholders Meeting. 1.  Accumulate high-quality businesses and assets Secure medium/long-term earnings foundation  (Build high-quality asset holdings in absolute  volume terms) 2.  Branch into new businesses Cultivate new businesses in pursuit of sustained  growth (Groundwork for future growth) 3.  Ensure asset liquidity Pursue an asset structure that is resilient to  market fluctuations 4.  Develop globally competent human resources Develop human resources capable of achieving  sustained growth  In the year ended March 31, 2011, the second  year of Shine 2011, Sojitz worked to reinforce the  earnings foundation of businesses that had been  slow to recover while accumulating high-quality  businesses and assets. Results of these efforts  included improved earnings in the fertilizer  business and rationalized inventory in the  automotive business.   In resource businesses, Sojitz continued to secure  resources by expanding existing interests while  replacing existing assets with new ones.  Sojitz also made progress in building a medium- to-long-term earnings foundation, mainly in the  environmental and new energy fields. Examples  included participation in businesses related to solar  power, reduction of supply risk in the rare earths  business, participation in environmental and  infrastructure projects in China, and IPP projects in  the Middle East. Additionally, we made progress in  one of our new areas – agribusiness – by launching  an agricultural business in Argentina.  In the year ending March 31, 2012, the final  year of Shine 2011, Sojitz aims to establish the  strong earnings base required for sustained growth  by accumulating high-quality businesses and assets  and improving earnings in existing businesses.  Looking ahead to future growth, we will also be  aggressive in new areas. Asset reallocation will  continue to be our fundamental consideration in  selectively deploying new investments and loans to  increase asset quality in businesses that generate  stable earnings and growth.

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Sojitz Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries For the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 107 Financial Section  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Sojitz  Corporation (the Company) and consolidated subsidiaries are  prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese  Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting  regulations and in conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted in Japan (Japanese GAAP), which are different in certain  respects as to the application and disclosure requirements from  International Financial Reporting Standards.   The accounts of overseas subsidiaries are prepared based on  International Financial Reporting Standards or accounting principles  generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP),  with specific required adjustments.   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been  reclassified and translated into English from the consolidated financial  statements of the Company prepared in accordance with Japanese  GAAP and filed with the appropriate Local Finance Bureau of the  Ministry of Finance as required by the Financial Instruments and  Exchange Law of Japan. Some supplementary information included in  the statutory Japanese consolidated financial statements is not  presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.   Certain reclassifications and modifications have been made to  present the accompanying consolidated financial statements in a  format which is familiar to readers outside Japan, and certain  amounts of the prior year financial statements have been reclassified  to conform to the presentation of the financial statements for the  year ended March 31, 2011.   For the convenience of readers outside Japan, the accompanying  consolidated financial statements are also presented in United States  dollars by translating Japanese yen amounts at the exchange rate of  83 to U.S.$1, the approximate rate of exchange at the end of  March 31, 2011. Such translations should not be construed as  representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted  into United States dollars at the above or any other rate. Change in accounting policies   Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Associated  Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method  Accounting Standard for Equity Method of Accounting for  Investments (Statement No. 16 revised by Accounting Standards  Board of Japan (hereafter ASBJ) on March 10, 2008), requires  adjustments to be made to conform the associates accounting  policies for similar transactions and events under similar  circumstances to those of the parent company when the  associates financial statements are used in applying the equity  method unless it is impracticable to determine adjustments.    The Company applied this accounting standard effective April 1,  2010. As a result, the Company recognized reductions of 361  million (U.S.$4,349 thousand) both in its ordinary income and  income before taxes and minority interests, and a reduction of  1,343 million (U.S.$16,181 thousand) in its beginning retained  earnings.   Asset Retirement Obligations In the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company and domestic  consolidated subsidiaries adopted Accounting Standard for Asset  Retirement Obligations (Statement No. 18 issued by ASBJ on  March 31, 2008) and Guidance on Accounting Standard for Asset  Retirement Obligations (Guidance No. 21 issued by ASBJ on  March 31, 2008).    The effect of this change was to decrease operating income and  ordinary income by 107 million (U.S.$1,289 thousand), and  income before income taxes and minority interests by 1,068  million (U.S.$12,867 thousand). The asset retirement obligation  recognized firstly in applying this standard was 2,017 million  (U.S.$24,301 thousand).   Business Combination On December 26, 2008, the ASBJ issued a revised accounting  standard for business combinations, Accounting Standard for  Business Combinations (Statement No. 21 issued by ASBJ on  October 31, 2003), and the revised standard was applicable to  business combinations undertaken on or after April 1, 2010.    Under the revised standard, the acquirer recognizes the bargain  purchase gain in profit or loss immediately on the acquisition date  after reassessing and confirming that all of the assets acquired and  all of the liabilities assumed have been identified after a review of  the procedures used in the purchase allocation, although the  previous accounting standard provided for a bargain purchase gain  (negative goodwill) to be systematically amortized over a period not  exceeding 20 years. Additional information Presentation of Comprehensive Income The Company applied Accounting Standard for Presentation of  Comprehensive Income (Statement No. 25 issued by ASBJ on June  30, 2010), from the year ended March 31, 2011. Under this  accounting standard, a consolidated statement of comprehensive  income is required from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 and  has been presented herein. Also, accumulated other comprehensive  income is required to be presented in the consolidated balance sheets  and the consolidated statements of changes in net assets.    Accordingly, the minimum pension liability adjustments which are  recognized in overseas subsidiaries are reclassified into accumulated  other comprehensive income from retained earnings. The effect of  this change was to increase retained earnings by 797 million (U.S.$9,602 thousand).     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Sojitz Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries  1 BASIS OF PRESENTING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 108  Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the  Company and its 320 (329 for the year ended March 31, 2010)  significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant  intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.   Investments in 155 (161 for the year ended March 31, 2010)  unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, with minor exceptions, are  accounted for by use of the equity method.   Goodwill, and negative goodwill recognized through business  combinations undertaken before April 1, 2010, which is the  difference between the book value of the Companys investment in  the consolidated subsidiaries and in the above unconsolidated  subsidiaries and affiliates, and its equity in net assets, is being  amortized over a period of 5 to 20 years using the straight-line  method.   The accounts of the subsidiaries that have a fiscal year end within  three months prior to March 31 have been included in the  consolidated financial statements based on their fiscal year, with  reasonable adjustments that would have been made to conform to  the accounts as of March 31. Cash equivalents The Company considers time deposits and highly liquid investments  that are readily convertible to cash with a maturity of three months  or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Foreign currency translation Current and non-current receivables and payables denominated in  foreign currencies are translated at current rates prevailing at the  balance sheet date and the resulting exchange gains or losses are  recognized in earnings.   Translations of foreign consolidated subsidiaries financial  statements are made at the year-end rate for balance sheet items,  except for net assets, which is translated at historical rates, and at  the annual average rate for income statement items. Resulting  translation adjustments are reflected in the consolidated financial  statements as foreign currency translation adjustments under  accumulated other comprehensive income in a separate component  of net assets. Allowance for doubtful receivables The allowance for doubtful receivables is stated in an amount  sufficient to cover probable losses on collection of receivables  outstanding based on estimates of individually uncollectible  amounts. General reserve for other receivables is calculated based on  the past credit losses experience. Inventories Inventories held for sale in the ordinary course of business are  principally stated at the lower of cost using the specific-identification  method or on a moving-average basis, or net selling value. Foreign  subsidiaries state inventories at the lower of specific-identified cost  or market.   Inventories held for trading purposes are stated at the market price. Capitalization of interest costs Interest costs on certain real estate under construction are  capitalized until sales are realized to enable better matching of  revenue and costs. Short-term investments and investment securities Short-term investments and investment securities are classified as  either (a) securities held for trading purposes (hereinafter referred to  as Trading Securities), (b) debt securities intended to be held to  maturity (hereinafter referred to as Held-to-Maturity Debt  Securities) or (c) securities other than the above (hereinafter  referred to as Available-for-Sale Securities).   Trading Securities, Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities and Available- for-Sale Securities are stated in the following manner: (1)  Trading Securities gains and losses realized on sales and  unrealized gains and losses from market value fluctuations are  recognized as gains or losses in the period of the change. (2)  Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities are stated at amortized cost. (3)  Available-for-Sale Securities with available fair market values  are stated at fair value. Net unrealized gains and losses on  available-for-sale securities are stated, net of tax, in net assets  on the balance sheet. Available-for-Sale Securities with no  readily available fair market value are stated at cost using the  moving-average method. (4)  Certain write-downs of securities are recognized in earnings  when the securities have substantial losses and are not  expected to recover such losses in the near future. Investments  in a limited partnership for investment or a similar partnership  (that can be considered as securities in accordance with Article  2, Paragraph 2 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law)  are stated at their net equity value on the most recent financial  statements that are available on the settlement report day as  specified in the partnership agreement.   Short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at  the time of acquisition are included in cash and cash equivalents.  The amount as of March 31, 2011 was 4,125 million (U.S.$49,699  thousand). Deferred charges Pre-operating and start-up costs of consolidated subsidiaries are  amortized using the straight-line method over 5 years or less. All  costs incurred in connection with the issuance of new shares and  disposal of treasury stock are amortized over 3 years using the  straight-line method. Bond issue expenses are amortized using the  straight-line method over the period through redemption. Property and equipment (other than leased assets) Property and equipment are principally depreciated using the  declining-balance method, except that the buildings acquired after  March 31, 1998 are depreciated using the straight-line method.   The estimated useful lives of Buildings and structures and  Equipment, fixtures and others are mainly 2-60 years and 2-40  years, respectively. Intangible assets (other than leased assets) Intangible assets are principally depreciated using the straight-line  method. Internal use software is included in intangible assets and is  amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful  life of 5 years. Some consolidated subsidiaries amortize mining rights  using the production output method. Leased assets Leased assets in finance lease transactions without transfer of  ownership are depreciated using the straight-line method based on  the assumption that the useful life is equal to the lease term and the  residual value is equal to zero. The Company and its domestic  consolidated subsidiaries account for the lease transactions that  commenced prior to April 1, 2008 and do not transfer ownership of  the leased property to the lessee as operating lease transactions.   2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 109 Financial Section  Information regarding each category of securities classified as trading and available-for-sale with available fair market values at March 31, 2011  and 2010 is as follows:     Millions of yen March 31, 2011  Cost   Unrealized gains   Unrealized losses   Book value  Securities classified as: Available-for-sale with available fair market values:  Equity securities ..................................................................................  65,439   17,232   (7,520)  75,151  Debt securities  Government bonds ........................................................................  10   1   —   11   Foreign bonds ................................................................................  88   494   —   582  Other  .................................................................................................  1,005   22   (20)  1,007  Total  ......................................................................................................  66,542   17,749   (7,540)  76,751      Thousands of U.S. dollars March 31, 2011  Cost   Unrealized gains   Unrealized losses   Book value  Securities classified as: Available-for-sale with available fair market values:  Equity securities  .................................................................................  $788,422  $207,614  $(90,602)  $905,434  Debt securities  Government bonds ........................................................................  121  12  —   133  Foreign bonds ................................................................................  1,060  5,952  —   7,012 Other  .................................................................................................  12,108  265  (241)  12,132 Total  ......................................................................................................  $801,711  $213,843  $(90,843)  $924,711    In addition to the securities listed above, the Company and consolidated subsidiaries hold trading securities of 810 million (U.S.$9,759  thousand) which are equal to their fair value, as of March 31, 2011. The net holding losses on trading securities included in earnings for the  year ended March 31, 2011 amounted to 94 million (U.S.$1,133 thousand).   The Company and consolidated subsidiaries hold no securities held to maturity at March 31, 2011. Investment properties Investment properties are principally depreciated using the straight- line method.   The estimated useful lives of Buildings and structures and  Equipment, fixtures and others for investment are mainly 7-50  years and 10 years, respectively. Employees retirement and severance benefits The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries provide for  employees retirement benefits based on the present value of  projected benefit obligations attributable to employee services  rendered by the end of the year and the fair value of the pension  plan assets at the end of the fiscal years. Directors and corporate auditors retirement benefits The provision for expecting payment of directors and corporate  auditors retirement benefits of certain consolidated subsidiaries is  recognized based on internal regulations. Net sales (total trading transactions) and gross trading profit As general trading companies, the Company and certain of its  consolidated subsidiaries act either as principal or agent in trading  transactions. Net sales represent the sales volume of all those  transactions in which the companies participate, whether as  principal or agent. Gross trading profit consists of the gross margin  (sales less cost of sales) on transactions in which the companies act  as principal and commissions on transactions in which the  companies serve as agent. Impairment loss The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries reviews their property,  equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or  changes in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset or  asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be  recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds  the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from  the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.   The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the  carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is  the higher of the discounted cash flows from the continued use and  eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated  future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the  carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and tax  losses which can be carried forward, and are measured using the  enacted tax rate which will be in effect when the differences are  expected to be recovered or settled. The Company and some domestic  subsidiaries apply the consolidated tax return reporting system. Net income per share The computation of net income per share is based on the weighted  average number of shares of common stock outstanding in each  period. Diluted net income per share is based on the weighted  average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus any  potentially dilutive securities. Derivative financial instruments The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries state derivative  financial instruments at fair value and recognize changes in fair value  as gains or losses unless derivative financial instruments are used for  hedging purposes.   If derivative financial instruments are used as hedges and meet  certain hedging criteria, the Company and its consolidated  subsidiaries defer recognition of gains or losses resulting from  changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments until the  related losses or gains on the hedged items are realized.   If interest rate swap contracts are used as hedges and meet certain  hedging criteria, the net amount to be paid or received under the  interest rate swap contract is added to or deducted from the interest  on the assets or liabilities for which the swap contract was executed.

Additional paid-in capital and legal earnings  reserve may be used to eliminate or reduce a deficit, if any, or be capitalized by resolution at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.  All additional paid-in capital and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively,  which are potentially available for dividends. Additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve are included in capital surplus and retained  earnings, respectively. (c)  The Companies Act of Japan does not have a definition about the classification of paid-in capital between common stock and preferred  stock. Accordingly, the Company states its capital in the total amount paid by issuing common stock and preferred stock.   The maximum amount that the Company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the non-consolidated financial statements of the  Company in accordance with Japanese laws and regulations.   The Company paid interim cash dividends amounting to 1,877 million (U.S.$22,614 thousand) in accordance with the resolution at the  Board of Directors Meeting held on October 29, 2010.   At the Ordinary General Shareholders Meeting of the Company on June 23, 2011, the shareholders approved year-end dividends amounting  to 1,877 million (U.S.$22,614 thousand).  Such appropriations have not been accrued the consolidated financial statements as of March 31,  2011. Such appropriations are recognized in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders. Details of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended March 31, 2011 and  2010 are as follows:        Thousands of     Millions of yen  U.S. dollars     2011  2010  2011 Directors remuneration and salaries for employees ....................................................................     56,308    56,827  $   678,410 Employees retirement and severance benefits  ...........................................................................   4,212   3,591   50,747  Welfare ......................................................................................................................................   9,984   10,816     120,289 Travelling expenses .....................................................................................................................   6,552   6,514   78,940  Rent  ..........................................................................................................................................   11,748   12,729   141,542  Legal and professional fees .........................................................................................................   11,079   11,547  133,482  Depreciation  ..............................................................................................................................   5,475   5,505    65,964  Provision for doubtful receivables ...............................................................................................   620   5,429  7,470  Amortization of goodwill  ...........................................................................................................   5,140   5,181    61,928  Other ..........................................................................................................................................   44,087   43,935   531,168  Total  .......................................................................................................................................   155,205   162,074  $1,869,940  Classification of extraordinary gains (losses) is in accordance with Japanese GAAP.

In order to carry out these businesses, the Group has set up a target of long-term debt  ratio and raises funds, not only through indirect financing from financial institutions, but also through direct financing by securitization as well  as issuance of bonds and commercial papers. In this manner, the Group aims at maintaining and improving the stability of its funding structure.   Furthermore, the Group is exposed to market risks, including foreign exchange risk associated with transactions denominated in foreign  currencies in connection with international trade or business investments; interest rate risk associated with debt financing and portfolio  investment; commodity price risk associated with purchase and sales agreements and commodity inventories incidental to sales activities; and  market price risk associated with ownership of listed securities and other such assets.    To hedge and minimize these risks, the Group utilizes derivatives such as forward exchange contracts, commodity futures, forward  commodity contracts, and interest rate swaps.

Trade notes and trade accounts receivable, long-term loans receivable (including current portion) and doubtful receivables are stated net of  individual allowance for doubtful receivables.   3. Investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates without fair market value amounting to 192,527 million are not included.   4.  Doubtful receivables are included in long-term loans, receivables and other on the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of long-term loans,  receivables and other excluding doubtful receivables amounting to 25,047 million is not presented above.    5. Derivatives are stated in net of assets and liabilities.   The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of instruments. Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term loans receivable (excluding current portion of long-term loans receivable): The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term loans receivable (excluding current portion of long-term loans receivable)  approximate their book value due to the relatively short maturities of these instruments. Trade notes and trade accounts receivable and long-term loans (including current portion): The fair values of trade notes and trade accounts receivable and long-term loans (including current portion) are measured at the amount discounted at the assumed  corporate discount rate separately set for each classification of assets. Forward exchange contracted amounts which are assigned to associated assets are reflected  on those presented in the balance sheet, and therefore, fair values of forward exchange contracts are included in the fair value of the receivables. Short-term investments and investment securities: The fair values of short-term investments and investment securities are measured at quoted market prices. Investment securities without fair market value are not  included in above. These are presented in Note 3. Investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates: The fair values of investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are estimated using quoted market prices. Doubtful receivables: The allowance for doubtful receivables is stated in an amount sufficient to cover probable losses on collection of receivables outstanding based on estimates of  individually collectible amounts through collaterals and guarantees. Therefore, the fair value of doubtful receivables approximates the balance of doubtful  receivables, net of allowance for doubtful receivables, in the balance sheet as of the fiscal year end. Short-term debt (principally unsecured), commercial paper and income taxes payable: The estimated fair value of short-term debt (principally unsecured), commercial paper and income taxes payable approximate their book value due to the relatively  short maturities of these instruments. Payables: The fair values of payables are measured at the amount to be paid at maturity discounted at the assumed corporate discount rate separately set for each  classification of liabilities. Forward exchange contracted amounts assigned to associated liabilities are reflected on those presented in the balance sheet, and  therefore, fair values of forward exchange contracts are included in the fair value of the payables. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 118  Long-term debt (including current portion): The fair values of bonds issued by the Company are based on the market price.  The fair values of other long-term debt (including current portion) are estimated by  discounted cash flow analysis, using rates currently available for similar types of borrowings with similar terms and remaining maturities. As to long-term debt with  variable interest rates, interest rate swaps which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not remeasured at market value and the fair  value of such interest rate swaps is included in that of long-term debt. Hence, fair value of such debts is measured at the amount discounted by the rates available  for similar types of borrowings with similar terms. Derivative instruments: The fair values of derivative instruments are estimated using the valuation methodology set forth in Note 13.

Planned repayment amounts after the balance sheet date for long-term debt are explained in Note 6. Sojitz Corporation     Annual Report 2011 119 Financial Section  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements In order to avoid adverse effects of fluctuations of the market risk  associated with financial activities and commodity trading activities,  the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries enter into foreign  exchange contracts, currency options, swaps and various types of  interest rates, bonds, equity and commodity-related forwards, futures  and options. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries utilize  these derivative transactions to reduce the risk inherent in their assets  and liabilities and hedge effectively so that these transactions are not  likely to have a major impact on the performance of the Company  and its consolidated subsidiaries.  In accordance with the Companys internal regulations on derivative  transactions, the Finance Division of the Company is responsible for  managing market and credit risks of these transactions, and this  division manages position limits, credit limits and status of derivative  transactions.  For the purpose of minimizing credit risk exposure, the Company  and its consolidated subsidiaries select financial institutions as  counterparties, which are appreciated to be reliable by internationally  acknowledged rating agencies. The Company and each consolidated  subsidiarys accounting sections also confirm the outstanding  positions and fair values with counterparties. The results of these  procedures are reported to the Companys audit section. The  Company and its consolidated subsidiaries evaluate hedge  effectiveness quarterly by comparing the cumulative changes in cash  flows or the changes in fair value of hedged items and the  corresponding changes in the derivative instruments.  The following summarizes hedging derivative financial instruments  used and items hedged: Hedging instruments: Currency-related contracts:  Foreign exchange contracts, non-deliverable forward  exchange contracts, currency swap contracts and currency  option contracts Interest rate-related contracts: Interest rate swap contracts and option (cap) contracts Commodity-related contracts:  Future contracts, forward contracts and option  contracts Hedged items: Currency-related contracts:  Foreign currency receivables and debts and securities and  foreign currency forecasted contracts Interest rate-related contracts: Interest on financial assets and liabilities Commodity-related contracts:  Commodity trading contracts and commodity  forecasted contracts The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the  fair value of each derivative transaction: Forward exchange contracts:  The estimated fair value amounts of forward exchange  contracts were determined using forward exchange rate  at the end of fiscal year. Non-deliverable forward exchange contracts, currency option contracts, currency swap  contracts, interest rate swap  agreements and interest rate cap contracts:  The estimated fair value amounts were determined using  quotes obtained from financial institutions. Commodity futures trading:  The estimated fair value amounts of future contracts were  determined using market information on the Tokyo  Commodity Exchange or Tokyo Grain Exchange or other  exchanges. Commodity forwards trading:  The estimated fair value amounts of forward contracts  were determined using the value calculated by  quotation to the public or major transaction partners.

For the year ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 In March 2008, the ASBJ revised ASBJ Statement No. 17 Accounting Standard for Segment Information Disclosures and issued ASBJ  Guidance No. 20 Guidance on Accounting Standard for Segment Information Disclosures. Under the standard and guidance, an entity is  required to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable segments. Reportable segments are operating segments or  aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. Operating segments are components of an entity about which separate  financial information is available and such information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate  resources and in assessing performance. Generally, segment information is required to be reported on the same basis as is used internally for  evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments. This accounting standard and the  guidance are applicable to segment information disclosures for the fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 2010.   The segment information for the year ended March 31, 2010 under the revised accounting standard is also disclosed hereunder as required. 1. Description of reportable segments     Reportable segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated  regularly by the Board of Directors Meeting in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
