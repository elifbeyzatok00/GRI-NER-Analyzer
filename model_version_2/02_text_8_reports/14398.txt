More than a decade has passed since we entered the 21st century and we are losing faith in things  we previously accepted without question. For example, the use of fossil fuels such as coal and oil,  which served as the prime driving force for modern economic growth, is now striking back as climate   change. the neoliberalism which replaced Keynesian economics and served as the core philosophy  behind many new global policies that shaped todays global economy is under heavy criticism and  viewed by many as the cause of the current global economic crisis and deepening social inequali- ties. nobody is free from the threats and unrest caused by this aforementioned phenomena. People used to value unhindered competition as a rightful means to achieving maximum output but  now many are beginning to realize how it can weaken the fundamental values that sustain us all. in  this light, rising emphasis on sustainability is a necessity as we begin to make an effort to preserve  our fundamental values. in 1997, Mirae asset was founded with an emphasis on promoting four core values of clients first,  independence and competitiveness as an investment specialty company, faith in the value of  the individual and team work and recognition of social responsibilities. using these values as our   guidelines, we strived to not only increase the value of our clients assets but to also create values for  the whole of society which we see as our responsibility as a top financial service provider in Korea.   For example, we established the Mirae asset Park Hyeon Joo Foundation, which provides scholar- ships for young students and funded many local community support initiatives. Mirae asset securi- ties has also been operating its own social contribution programs including volunteer activities and  purchasing locally produced products. We are also collaborating with volunteer groups to provide  free medical services and home building services in communities overseas. We are also working with international agencies. For example, we joined the un Global compact in  2009 and pledged our support for its ten principles for achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  We also participated in the carbon Disclosure Project 2011 as one of the key signatories in order  to promote carbon reduction from businesses. in 2009, we were selected as one of the Dow Jones  sustainability index Korea members in recognition of our sustainability management achievements.  We also received excellent reviews from the economic research institute of sustainable society and  a number of other sustainability management evaluation agencies. i sincerely hope that this report serves as a channel for openly sharing our achievements and is a  window of communication between stakeholders and us. Lastly, all employees of Mirae asset se- curities, including myself, pledge to sustain solid economic, social and environmental performance,  and ultimately contribute to the sustainable development of humanity. thank you choi, Hyun Man Vice chairman, Mirae asset securities Message from the Vice Chairman We will pursue shared growth Mirae asset Securities is committed to contributing to the sustainable development  of humanity, using our business philosophy We value our people and embrace the  future with an open mind and our four core values  MirAe ASSeT  SecuriTieS SuStainability  RepoRt 2011 cOMPANY OVerVieW  9  MirAe ASSeT  SecuriTieS SuStainability  RepoRt 2011 cOMPANY OVerVieW  8  Company Overview established in 1999, Mirae asset Securities quickly became a company that led the growth  of the securities market, with continuous innovation and client-focused management.

Mas has an independent compliance department which is responsible for internal   control systems, compliance monitoring, legal review, government collaboration support,   employee ethics training and much more.

CuStoMeR SatiSfaCtion ManageMent StRuCtuRe All employees of MAS recognize that customers are a key stakeholder group, integral to the com- panys existence, and are therefore making the utmost effort to enhance customer value.  As competition increases, it is increasingly becoming challenging to provide differentiated services  and products, making strong customer loyalty an important source of competitiveness.  Understanding such change, we are making the maximum effort to improve overall quality of our  services, enhancing customer experience so it is the finest in the industry. Currently, we are focusing  on three themes: In-depth design of customer experience; provision of integrated and coherent  customer experience; and reflection on customer feedback.

Additionally, we are strengthening employee training and  assessment in order to increase employee capacity and raise awareness, which are the keys to   enhancing customer satisfaction. enhancing CS Manager Capacity CS managers of all MAS sales branches are subjected to annual capacity building training. The  managers also report CS activity results each month which serves as the basis for the assessment  of CS performance of each branch. The managers also take improvement measures using funding  allocated by HQ. There are annual quality service assessments and the CS managers with strong  performance records are rewarded for their contribution. Sales branch Service evaluation MAS regularly conducts service assessments of all the sales offices. The assessment is conducted   every quarter and is designed to check that all branches are implementing the customer service   improvement measures. The evaluation score contributes to the overall branch performance score.  Branches with high scores are given modest cash prizes. Branches with low scores receive extra  support in the form of monitoring, and one to one on-site coaching in order to identify areas where   improvements can be made and to improve customer satisfaction. Responsible Sales program In December 2008, MAS launched a newly enhanced sales program. This includes a mandatory   detailed explanation of the product characteristics and suitability in order to provide enhanced   protection to the customer and improve our customers overall experience.

For example,   the Proactive Customer Liasion and Catching complaints before they happen programs iden- tify customers who are likely to raise complaints and prompts MAS employees to contact them  in order to proactively address issues they may have. The company website, sales branches and  customer service center also serve as important channels for customer communication, gathering  their opinions and suggestions for improvements. We also have an integrated Voice of Customer  management system in place to analyse and implement customers suggestions in MAS man- agement. Thanks to our proactive effort with regard to customer complaints, we did not have a  single complaint from customers in 2010. next-generation Ceo program Next-generation CEO program ISO 27001 Information security man- agement system standard certificate  handover ceremony Customer Satisfaction Survey We conduct telephone surveys with customers who have visited our sales offices. The survey results   are used to enhance customer services and to improve the marketing strategy of each office. The tele- phone survey is conducted with twenty customers each quarter within one week of their visit to the  sales office. The survey result is then analyzed and used as a performance indicator for the respective  sales office. MAS received 96 out of 100 in the 2010 Korea Service Quality Indicator assessment con- ducted by the Korea Management Association, which was the highest score in the industry. Seventy  four organizations in fifteen industry sectors, including ten securities trading companies, were included  to the survey. The survey was conducted using the mystery survey method between March and April  of 2010. In addition, MAS was placed second amongst securities trading companies, on the National  Customer Satisfaction Survey conducted by the Korea Productivity Center. The survey was carried out  through face to face interviews with customers who had used the services of the companies. Honorary branch Manager In 2010, we implemented the honorary branch manager system which promotes respected VIP custom- ers and opinion leaders as honorary branch managers. The honorary branch managers serve for one year  as members of the respective branches and participate in management as both advisors and representa- tives of MAS customers. The honorary branch managers have meetings with branch managers and are  invited to MAS-sponsored cultural events as part of our plan to enhance customer satisfaction. Raising awareness about protecting Customer information Protecting customer information is becoming an important social issue as customer information has  been revealed due to inadequate management, leading to major customer complaints. As a result,  ensuring customer information is protected has become an important legal and social responsibility  for all companies that manage customer information. Recognizing this issue early on, MAS orga- nized a dedicated department in March 2008 responsible solely for the protection of our customers  information, ahead of other companies in the industry. establishing an information protection System A comprehensive customer information protection system has been established to ensure the high- est security in all areas from our internet service to internal management activities. Dedicated expert  teams are also monitoring customers information protection status 24 hours a day throughout the  year to respond to any issues and threats. information protection activities and achievements All MAS employees receive annual training on information protection. In December 2010, a special  information protection training session about the regulations and using case studies was conducted  to further increase awareness. The dedicated information protection teams are constantly review- ing and amending the security rules, checking for blind spots and devising protection measures, in  addition to conducting regular evaluations, auditing and implementing new measures to ensure the  highest possible protection of our customers information. Thanks to the comprehensive customer  information protection measures and implementation of cutting edge system to deal with security  breaches, MAS was awarded ISO 27001 certification which is an internationally recognized certifi- cation given to companies who have comprehensive information protection measures in place. pRoteCting CuStoMeR infoRMation program modules Detail Leadership  development Meeting with the CEO, management strategy simulation, leadership style  analysis, effective network management Character building Humanity and arts experience Economics and  financial industry knowledge Understanding financial industry, analysis of corporate finance and cash  flow Global mindset Overseas subsidiary visit, global cultural experience Next-generation CEO Program voice of Customer Management process VOC processing Registration     of issue Customer    feedback Collection Registration Classification Search Analysis Analysis of     cause Assessment     of Response VOC  committee     (monthly) CS evaluation Incorporation    of lessons in     management Removal of cause Lesson sharing Submission Registration internal processing implementation  of improvement  Measures utilization of  lessons learned Honorary Branch Managers Dinner  Event  ISO 27001 Certification CuStoMeR CoMMuniCation Online  service  team System  team Information  security team it  Management HQ it Division Customer Information     Protection Team IT  audit team Customer Information   Security Management  System by   Work Process C.

MAS has  taken great care of my assets leading to significant gains. I make deposits into my CMA account  whenever I have spare money and consult regularly with my asset manager on its management.   I have also asked for advice on assets that I have invested in other financial service companies and  in real estate, I have always found the MAS experts advice very helpful. In addition to excellent Wealth Management and a first class advisory service, I thoroughly enjoy  the cultural events they host. I particularly enjoyed an art museum tour last year, where MAS had   organized a special tour by an expert. The experience proved once again that MAS people were  paying attention to the details that really mattered. I have heard that MAS plans to host a wide   variety of cultural events in the coming year and I am looking forward to them all. In the future, I think it would be helpful if MAS could create an investor community, where people  with a particular interest in economic affairs can network.

Our performance management system links  together promotion, training programs, and all matters of personnel affairs.  peRFoRManCe evaluation and ReMuneRation The new program also facilitates understanding of the company goals with its members, linking the  objectives of the company and individual employees and evaluating both, ultimately providing a  sense of direction for all MAS members. The individuals increased role in the evaluation process is  expected to benefit all parties involved by increasing communication, strengthening objectivity and  fairness and ultimately making personnels affairs more satisfying for all. The PDP program has a four step evaluation process: employee target setting, interim-term review  (ad hoc), end of term review and feedback every six months. The process is designed so that em- ployees are not only given opportunities to learn the goals of the organization and to set goals for  themselves, but also to have opportunities to develop within their areas. Performance evaluation is conducted twice a year following a systematic three step procedure of  self evaluation, 1st evaluation and 2nd evaluation. The employees are evaluated on job performance  and three criteria: core values, job skills and leadership capacity. The result of the evaluation is used  as the basis for other personnel decision including immediate benefits such as adjusting base salary  and bonus pay to longer-term benefits of promotion, transference, special training opportunities and  so on. Overall, the evaluation scheme and remuneration scheme are managed in such a way that  they motivate employees to produce strong performances and to increase their skills. 360 degree leadership evaluation Since 2008, staffs have conducted evaluation of their heads of department using ten key competen- cies. The evaluation result is key when decisions are made on personnel affairs.  Fair Remuneration Scheme MAS has a fair remuneration scheme which consists of financial and non-financial measures including   base salary, performance bonus, fringe benefits and so on. The system is reviewed each year and  adjustments are made each year in order to ensure it is fair and competitive. We also conduct  comparison studies every year with similar organizations to ensure that we are in line with our coun- terparts in the industry. The annual salary system is adjusted for individual performance to encour- age good performance and the fair compensation of individual employees contribution. Individual  performance pay is used to motivate employees to use their full capacity to obtain the best results.  MAS also has team performance pay which promotes teamwork and allows team members to  share the fruits of their outstanding achievements when they beat their profit targets. employee rank evaluation criteria total performance  evaluation Capacity evaluation value leadership Job skills Head of department or higher 30 20 50 - 100 Team leader/branch manager 30 40 - Associates 40  30  Evaluation Criteria Composition  people development program MAS is preparing for an innovative change to the performance management process with the   introduction of the PDP program.

Gender equality is a valued principle at MAS, and we strive to support employees  having a good work-life balance and being able to fulfill their maternal and paternal responsibilities.  For example, we guarantee monthly off day for female staff and paid maternity leave of up to 90 days  as well as extended unpaid maternity leave, following the recommendations of the National Human  Rights Committee. We also strictly prohibit child labor and forced labor. All employees receive training  on sexual harassment prevention once a year. We offer a competitive and comprehensive benefits package which boosts morale and helps   employees concentrate on their work with less worries about other issues in their lives. For example,  we offer special loans for home purchasing and also provide tuition and medical expense support.  We also provide employees with access to condominiums and fitness clubs to help them enjoy their  free time. Policies are in place for promoting work-life balance such as social security, pension, and  maternity support programs. eMployee beneFitS  MAS Employee   Benefits Package benefits  type description  of benefits Off-work  leisure  support Condominium   access / fitness club  membership support Maternity  support Paid maternity leave / congratulatory  bonus Housing  and  disaster  relief support Home purchasing loan /  Housing down payment  loan / disaster relief  support Medical/ health support Medical expense sup- port / health checkup Education support Tuition support for  children Special  personal  event support Congratulatory or   condolence money,  flower services  Special  celebration support Birthday gift, anniver- sary day off, traditional  holiday gift, day off for  school entrance and  graduation of children Legally  mandated  benefits Materniity leave,   paternity leave, annual  leave, four public   insurances including  social security fund MAS actively supports the association and activity of labor organizations within the company.   All members of MAS may communicate their demands and ideas through their representatives in  the labor-management counsel meetings. Individual employees may also communicate directly any  issues of concern through the grievance management process. labor-management Council  The labor-management council meeting is held once every quarter in order to strengthen communi- cation between the two parties. Ad-hoc meetings are also held when the need arises. As defined in  the labor-management council management rules, the council consists of four members including   the CEO and employee representatives. A wide variety of matters that impact on employee per- formance including productivity improvement, distribution of profits, personnel affairs (recruitment,  placement, training, grievance handling, physical environment improvement, employee health con- cern) are discussed in the meetings. grievance Management System A grievance management system is in place, as required by the labor-management council manage- ment rules and labor law. Two MAS members, one executive and one working level member of staff  are appointed as grievance management committee members and work together to address issues  raised. In addition to serving as a communication channel for employees, the committee members are  also making an effort to make improvements by understanding the issues and potential solutions. Mirae Asset Securities has became a dominant player in the securities trading industry in just one  decade. It was the pioneering and cutting edge spirit which made the successful establishment of  MAS possible but what has brought MAS this far is the strong teamwork combined with a respect  for the individual employee and the excellent communication links between top management and  the working level employees. When I joined MAS in 2007 MAS the company was preparing to   expand its operation into a number of new strategic business areas and to further stabilize its opera- tion in its main business areas. The total number of employees nearly doubled and I was concerned  that such rapid expansion may destabilize the company. However, the new members quickly fitted  in, getting to know existing staff and becoming familiar with MAS corporate culture through events  such as the MAS Culture Festival, town hall meetings with CEOs and Creativity and Innovation  Olympics. It was remarkable how quickly I and the other new comers felt part of the MAS commu- nity and took pride in MAS successful growth and expansion. Top management continues to com- municate regularly with working level employees by explaining corporate strategies and creating  consensus. I believe this kind of effort has made MAS success possible. Trust and communication  are the two values that are at the core of MAS competitiveness and this makes me feel very proud.  I hope all employees and the top management will continue to work to maintain these values. We value individual employees whilst recognizing  the importance of teamwork interview: park, Young Sun (Manager- retirement pension consulting Department) Dynamic business ventures are the norm for Mirae Asset Securities, as one of Asias leading finan- cial services companies. There is no gene for maintaining the status-quo in the corporate DNA  of MAS. I know from my experience that top management are already working on the next great  thing. Although some people have expressed concern about MAS fast growth and industry-leading  initiatives, I think MAS is on a stable growth path because we stay true to our sound principles and  clear corporate philosophy. Many expressions are used to describe MAS, such as industry leader,  differentiated service provider, investor in people and corporate social responsibility but I want  to describe my experience at MAS as a decade that gave me a vision for the millennium. I am con- fident that Mirae Asset Securities will be a world class company that will ensure great prosperity for  its clients in the free market economy of the future. a decade that gave me a vision for the millennium interview: oh, Jun Hyung (Deputy manager–Bundang branch) laboR-ManageMent CollaboRation  1,218 No. of employees who made donation  (Mar. 2010-April 2011)  1,967 No. of students receiving  the Global Exchange Scholarship (cumulative)  1.24 Total amount of donations  made (cumulative,  up to March 2011,  excluding matching  grant fund) 1,736 No. of local  scholarship recipients  (cumulative)  Citizenship Profoundly aware of our responsibilities as a good corporate citizen,  we give back to the communities that nurture us and pledge to continue to support  a range of community initiatives.

Under the slogan Beginning new semester with confidence and a new school uniform,  the support program has attracted the participation of NGO experts to distribute school uniforms  to those in need. Mirae Asset provides the financial support to purchase summer and winter school  uniforms for middle and high school students from low income households recommended by na- tionwide regional children centers and welfare institutions. Mirae Asset has consistently increased  the budget size of this support program over the years and in 2010 a total of 270 students received  financial support from this program. Supporting basic living expenses and Meal plans for needy Children Since 2000, Mirae Asset has concluded cooperation agreements with local borough offices, social  welfare institutions and community centers to support the basic living expenses of children and  youths from low income households where they are raised by grandparents or children who are the  head of their own household. Furthermore, Mirae Asset supports meal plans for children from low  income households during the school break where the school cafeteria is the main source of their  meals. In 2010 a total of 1,300 childrens meal plans (estimated 150 million KRW) were supported  through this program.

Bookclub for Global Cultural Experi- ence Rehabilitation program for hope  and sharing happiness Supporting school uniforms for low  income households Supporting basic living expenses and  meal plans for needy children MAS has been operating special programs ranging from scholarships for young talent to welfare   programs for low income families, children and the disabled. Since 2005, MAS has been an impor- tant partner of the ChildFund Korea working on a range of programs including the free lunch program  for children of low income families, school uniform support, and free Kimchi making and distribution   program. It is remarkable that MAS began its social contribution activities so early in its establishment set- ting a remarkable example, particularly as increasing emphasis is placed on corporate social responsibili- ties (CSR). I think MAS business philosophy of building on principles is also an important CSR activity.  In addition to MAS welfare programs targeted at underprivileged members of communities, I think the  programs designed to identify and nurture young students with potential to become a globally competitive  workforce are remarkably valuable. MAS has been an excellent leader in CSR, with its activities based on firm principles. I hope this will be  further strengthened by the publication of its first sustainability report. I also look forward to a continued  partnership with the ChildFund Korea in its existing programs and to new innovative programs in the fu- ture. Lets continue to work together to help all our children become valuable leaders of our society. principles that sustain and guide  Mirae asset Securities social contribution activities interview: Lee, Je Hun (Chair of ChildFund Korea )  MiRAE ASSET  SECuRiTiES SuStainability  RepoRt 2011 RESPONSibiLiTy  64  MiRAE ASSET  SECuRiTiES SuStainability  RepoRt 2011 RESPONSibiLiTy  65  Culture of Sharing Since the early stages of Mirae assets social contribution activities, all of our support  projects to community centers, welfare institutions and local bookclubs have been  implemented in close collaboration with the volunteer activities of our employees.

Not only can Mirae Asset em- ployees but to anyone interested in helping others participate in this program by visiting the website  of Park Hyeon Joo Foundation. The matching fund is appropriately allocated to welfare projects  selected by donors and the complete expenditure details of the fund is accessible on the website.  The I love you donation movement is distinguished by three types of sponsorship: regular spon- sorship, temporary sponsorship and urgent sponsorship. Regular and temporary sponsorships are  for childrens welfare projects, seniors welfare projects and welfare projects for the disabled. On the  other hand, urgent sponsorship is for situations where urgent and unexpected help is needed. In  this case, funds are raised in a short time period to address the urgent situation. one Company-one Fishing or Farming village bonding program MAS One Company-One Fishing or Farming Village Bonding Program is about more than just  providing volunteer services. It has become Mirae Assets ideal social contribution activity that  seeks to achieve our corporate objectives of coexistence and sharing. Mirae Asset Securities and  Seosan Woong-do village initiated this program in 2006. As part of the program, volunteer services  and feasts for senior citizens are provided in May, the month of celebrating family values. In 2010,  MAS held feasts for senior citizens and provided medical equipment as gifts. Furthermore, the com- pany provided cleaning services around the seashore and the village. As a result, five tons of solid  waste and fish waste was collected and treated.  MAS will continue to expand the exchange programs between the city and village which will solidify  the bonds between them. volunteer Medical Service for vietnam In November 2010, MAS provided volunteer medical services in Ngoc Linh Hospital in Ho Chi Minh  City and our volunteers helped construct houses in collaboration with Water Love Exchange As- sociation in Tien Giang and My Tho.

In Korea, the government  has shown a strong political will to nurture the clean energy industry with the announcement of the   Korean New Deal policy and a special support program for new growth engine industries including   renewable energies. The pressure on polluting industries is also becoming stronger with the   announcement of new regulations. MAS has launched various green investment products. For ex- ample, the Mirae Asset Maps Green Index Fund has become a flagship green fund in Korea both in  terms of its size and performance. The index fund is created using the MKF green index as the basis.  The MKF Green Index is made up of stocks from twenty companies, listed on the Korea Exchange,  that specialize in renewable energy, energy efficiency and green growth businesses. The index fund  mainly consists of companies that specialize in LEDs, batteries, solar photovoltaics and smart grid  companies. The Mirae Asset Maps Renewable Energy Private Equity Fund was recently registered  as a Clean Development Project at the UNFCCC. The product is expected to yield 12,996 tons of  CO2 reduction credits, which will be sold at a profit at exchanges and through off-board transactions.

The Economics Class for Children is an interactive educational program tailored for elementary  school students. The participants learn about economics and consumption patterns in Korea,  Industry and production, Three key players in the modern economy, Savings and investments  through custom-made board games and other educational tools. We have been offering an Eco- nomic program called Childrens School Tour since 2010, which offers economics classes at public  libraries and schools. The Economics Class for Children was launched in March 2011 to enable us  to make the class available for young students all over the country.  aging Society and Retirement products The importance of post-retirement asset management has increased greatly with the retirement of  baby boomers in 2010. For example, the pension fund product which provides salary-like monthly  dividend payments is gaining great popularity amongst retirees. Early products had an emphasis  on low risk, and therefore mainly consisted of bonds issued by governments in developed nations.  However, the product portfolio is becoming increasingly diversified as the target has changed.  MAS launched a wide variety of funds, all of which had a minimum A+ credit rating and provided  a monthly dividend payment for clients with different risk preference. For example, the Mirae As- set Perpetual Salary Global Dynamics Fund and the Franklin Templeton Monthly Dividend Global  Fund are designed for mid-risk, mid-profit, with the aim of providing a perpetual salary payment  and therefore consists of low risk government bonds and some currency hedging to provide a profit  margin higher than bonds. We also sell high risk, high return products, such as the AB Monthly Divi- dend Global High Profit Fund and the Franklin Templeton Monthly Dividend High-yield Fund and  Black Rock Monthly Dividend US Dollar High-yield Fund. We also offer a wide range of products  including the Monthly Dividend Brazilian Bond Trust and personal pension funds with different com- bination of stocks and bonds for clients from different age groups and with different preferences.

In 2010, we established a  sustainability management system and an assessment response system to help promote green  management. In 2011, we launched a number of initiatives including a carbon emission credit prod- uct, clean technology investment products and introduced high efficiency equipment in our offices.  We will continue to strive to manage MAS in a green way while raising environmental awareness and  building green management skills. Since MAS established its sustainability management plan in 2009, MAS has undertaken a number  of measures including defining annual implementation targets and the systematic instillation of an en- vironmental management process. Achievements are assessed against departmental environmental  management targets, and improvement plans are created to address any issues. The improvement  measures are also incorporated into the organizational rules and corporate management plan. environmental Regulation Compliance MAS has never been subjected to a financial or non-financial penalty for violation of any environ- mental regulation. As a financial services provider, MAS does not make any direct impact on the  environment such as the air, soil or water quality. However, we are aware of the indirect impact our  business may have on the environment and are trying to promote compliance within our relevant  business activities. environmental performance Management   MAS is a financial service provider and therefore its business activities do not lead to any significant  environmental impact. However, we are making every effort to make a positive contribution to global  environmental issues such as climate change, by managing our energy consumption, as well as ad- dressing the indirect environmental impact from the operation of MAS. We are committed to man- aging environmental data in a systematic manner and reducing our environmental impact in order to  set an example as a green financial company. MAS has been recording environmental data for over one hundred offices since 2008. Using the  data, we have set targets to reduce CO2 emissions and our paper consumption and launched activi- ties to achieve these. Green Management Activities and Achievements as a financial service provider, Mirae asset Securities can not make a direct impact on  the environment. nevertheless, we have established a green management structure  and reward scheme for environmental achievements in order to ensure we make an  active contribution to addressing global environmental concerns. enviRonMental iMpaCt ReDuCtion aCtivitieS  Environmental   Management Key   Implementation Areas 2010 -  Appointment of an executive  as environmental manager -  Establishment of environmental  management system as a part  of sustainability management  system -  Establishment of environment  management achievement  assessment response system 2011 -  Promotion of carbon credit  business  -  Launch of financial products  in clean technology -  Introduction of high  efficiency equipment to  reduce environmental impact -  Energy saving campaigns -  Environmental awareness  raising -  Introduction of environmental  training courses on issues  including climate change  response  StRenGtheninG ouR enviRonMental ManaGeMent SkillS energy use MAS has been making a sustained effort to save energy,  following the Energy Saving Action Plan. Actions include  turning off lights during lunch time and other non-working  hours, minimizing air conditioner use, reduction of electric  heater use and minimizing elevator use. Such behavior has  been promoted through internal campaigns. We have also  replaced indoor and outdoor halogen lamps with energy   efficient LED lights. We are also changing all light fittings  in our headquarters with LED lamps. Thanks to the cor- porate wide energy reduction effort made, Headquarters  electricity consumption has decreased from 4,316 Mwh  in 2009 to 4,226 Mwh in 2010. We will continue to moni- tor energy use and eliminate any unnecessary electricity  use. Water use    All water used by MAS is municipal water, the use of both  ground water and recycled water is zero. Regular mainte- nance checks on piping and faucets are made to prevent  any unnecessary water use due to leakage.  Greenhouse Gas emissions   MAS manages GHG emissions in two groups: Scope2 and Scope3 emissions. GHG emissions  over the last three years did not change much. Even though MAS is not responsible directly for any  emissions an effort is made to reduce indirect GHG emissions through campaigns such as banning  paper cups, reducing paper use and encouraging double sided printing. Wastewater and Solid Waste Management    All Wastewater generated from MAS operations are domestic sewage water which is treated at  the Seoul municipal Wastewater treatment facilities. Solid waste generated by MAS is also general   domestic waste, consisting of paper, glass bottles, aluminum cans and plastics. We make every   effort to classify waste to ensure maximize recycling of solid waste.

With regard to the financial data included in the key figures on page 76, our procedures were limited to verifying that they were  correctly derived from the audited financial statements of MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES. To obtain a thorough understanding of  MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES financial results and financial position, the audited financial statements of MIRAE ASSET SECU- RITIES for the year ended 31 March 2011 should be consulted.  Criteria  MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES applies the criteria set out in the AA1000APS (2008) for the three principles of inclusivity, material- ity and responsiveness. In preparing the report, MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES applies the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (G3)  of the Global Reporting Initiative as set out on Report Overview  assurance Standards   We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000): Assurance  Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance  Standards Board, and with the AccountAbility AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008).    Readers should note that limited assurance in ISAE 3000 is consistent with a moderate level of assurance as defined by AA1000AS (2008).    Among other things, these standards contain requirements regarding the independence and competency of the assurance team.  independence, impartiality and Competence We conducted our engagement in compliance with the requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants  which requires, among others, that the members of the assurance team (practitioners) as well as the assurance firm (assurance  provider) be independent of the assurance client, including not being involved in writing the Report. The Code also includes  detailed requirements for practitioners regarding integrity, objectivity, professional competence, due care, confidentiality and  professional behavior. KPMG has systems and processes in place to monitor compliance with the Code and to prevent con- flicts regarding independence. We conducted our engagement with a multidisciplinary team including specialists in AA1000APS/AS, stakeholder engage- ment, auditing, environmental, social and financial aspects, with experience in similar engagements in the sector.  Work undertaken   Our work included the following activities:   An evaluation of the results of stakeholder consultation processes of MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES.    An evaluation of processes for determining the material issues for key stakeholder groups Independent Assurance Report We were engaged by MiRae aSSet SeCuRitieS Co., ltd. (MiRae aSSet SeCuRitieS) to  provide assurance on the information presented in the Sustainability Report 2011 (the Report).  MiRae aSSet SeCuRitieS is responsible for preparing the Report, including the identification  of stakeholders and material issues. our responsibility is to provide an opinion on the Report.   A media analysis and an internet search for references to MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES during the reporting period    Interviews with a selection of MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES senior managers and key stakeholders to understand the current status of  sustainability activities and progress made during the reporting period   An evaluation of the design, existence and operation of the systems and methods used to collect and process the information report- ed, including the aggregation of data into information as presented in the Report   Reviewing the internal documentation and intranet sources   With regard to the financial data included in the key figures on page 76, verifying that they were correctly derived from the 2010 audited  financial statements of MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES. During our investigation, we discussed the necessary changes to the Report with MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES and verified that  these changes were adequately incorporated into the final version.  Conclusions  On the AA1000APS Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness:  in Relation to the principle of inclusivity:   MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES operates a communication channel with the customers, employees, stockholders/investors,   NGOs, peers and others through the stakeholder participation process. We are not aware of any key stakeholder groups which have been excluded from dialogue in the Report. Going forward, we suggest    improving the communication channels to deal with local communities and supplier on aspects of sustainability management.  in Relation to the principle of Materiality: MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES operates a materiality determination process regularly to define which issues should be considered   in stakeholders priorities for setting mid-term strategy. We are not aware of any material aspects concerning its sustainability performance which have been excluded from the Report.   We recommend establishing advanced materiality process to reflect changes of business environment and relevant risks.  in Relation to the principle of Responsiveness: MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES has appropriately responded to stakeholders demands and   material issues. With the exception of the issues highlighted in the Report in relation to materiality, we are not aware of any additional issues of   stakeholder interest that are not currently being managed by MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES. It is recommended that the materiality   process would be improved and thus the communication procedure and conclusion would be described to the next report,   which would contribute to enhance the responsiveness of sustainability management.  on the Content of the Report:  Based on the above work, we conclude that the information in the Report does not appear to be unfairly stated.  Comments Without prejudice to our conclusions presented above, we believe the following matters can be considered:   MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES provides sustainability information effectively to stakeholders through this first sustainability report.   To upgrade the level of sustainability management, there is a need for developing systematic evaluation process of needs of   stakeholders.   We recommend MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES to establish long-term sustainability vision, and to build up integrated   process and scheme to manage detailed program. We have discussed our observations regarding the reporting process and reported outside the scope of our assignment with  MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES management. They were receptive to our comments.
