www.seagate.com FY2011 Global Citizenship Annual Report Facebook: facebook.com/seagate Twitter: @Seagate   @Seagate_con  Welcome to Our FY2011 Global Citizenship   Annual Report Seagate is committed to developing and maintaining sustainable, responsible practices  in all aspects of our global operations through investments and innovation unmatched in  our industry. We apply the same leadership and vision to enabling sustainability as we do  to implementing environmentally protective manufacturing processes and energy-efficient  storage solutions. Following are highlights of our Global Citizenship program:  	 Climate change continued to be a major focus. Seagate has participated in the Carbon  Disclosure Project for four years and, in FY2011, we made our first public disclosure of  data. We expanded our Greenhouse Gas inventory to include employee commute as a  part of Scope 3 reporting. In addition, recognizing our ability to have a positive influence on  our partners, we requested that key direct material suppliers participate in the Electronics  Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Carbon Reporting System. 	 We expanded the scope of our environmental reporting to align with Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI) indicators. 	 For the first time, we completed a Life Cycle Assessment of one of our products.   Quantifying the full range of our Momentus drives environmental impacts will enable us  to improve our processes and make more informed decisions. We already have plans to  complete LCAs on additional products.  	 Seagate and its employees contributed to disaster relief efforts in Thailand and Japan, and  launched a product donation program in collaboration with TechSoup. 	 Seagate was recognized with an Award for Excellence and Innovation from Corporate  University Exchange for outstanding work in corporate learning and talent development,  and received a Certificate of Merit from Chief Learning Officer magazine for leading work in  Global Learning.  	 We ranked 170 out of 500 in Newsweek magazines Green Ranking of major  corporations. 	 Our U.S. executive offices in Cupertino, CA, earned LEED Gold certification.  Global Citizenship challenges touch us all and require collaboration among governments,  communities, organizations and others around the world. As an industry leader, Seagate  promotes the industrys corporate social responsibility position through membership in  the EICC and strongly supports the United Nations Global Compact and its principles and  standards.

All rights reserved.  Governance and Ethics Seagates corporate governance standards are set at the highest level of the company,  starting with the Board of Directors, and flow down through every level of the company. Corporate governance at Seagate spans many aspects of the companys operations,  practices and procedures and includes guidelines and mechanisms that promote ethical  corporate behavior designed to protect shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers  while maximizing investor returns.  Corporate Governance Guidelines Seagates Board has long adhered to sound corporate governance practices. The Board  has adopted and disclosed Corporate Governance Guidelines to clarify how it exercises its  responsibilities to the companys stakeholders. Additionally, these guidelines demonstrate  that the Board has the necessary authority and practices in place to review and evaluate the  companys business operations as appropriate and to make decisions that are independent  of the companys management. Board Independence Seagates Board currently consists of a substantial majority of directors who meet the  applicable NASDAQ listing standards for independence. Committees of the Board The Board has four standing committees: The Audit Committee, the Compensation  Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the Finance  Committee. Each of the four committees is composed entirely of independent directors, and  the charters of each committee are available on Seagates website. Lead Independent Director The Board periodically selects a director, who must be independent, to serve as the Lead  Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director coordinates the activities of the other  non-management directors, presides over meetings of the Board at which the Chairman of  the Board is not present and each executive session of independent directors, serves as  liaison between the Chairman of the Board and the independent directors, approves meeting  schedules and agendas for the Board, has authority to call meetings of the independent  directors, and is available for consultation and direct communication if requested by major  shareholders. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  To help maintain its high ethical standards, the company has an established Code of  Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code) that is applicable to all employees, officers and  directors of the company and its subsidiaries. This Code summarizes the companys ethical  standards and key policies in areas such as compliance with laws and regulations, insider  trading, conflicts of interest, fair dealing, and interaction with public officials, and provides  relevant information about expected behavior. A copy of the Code in the appropriate  language is available to all Seagate employees on the companys intranet and is available in  English on the companys external website.   8   2011 Seagate Technology.

Supplier Engagement Seagate reaffirmed its strong commitment to Global Citizenship in its supply chain by:  	 Having a management system that supports conformance to the Code and its standards. 	 Requiring the companys next-tier suppliers to acknowledge and implement the Code. 	 Engaging with stakeholders to obtain input for further development of the Code. 	 Participating in EICC and other industry work groups, meetings and audits. FY2011 Highlights Actions and accomplishments included: 	 Establishment of an EICC Steering Committee to enhance current procedures and  processes. 	 Hire of two EICC Program managers located in China and Thailand to work with suppliers  and ensure compliance. 	 Implementation of a sourcing strategy which includes screening of supplier candidates  using a self-assessment questionnaire. 	 Enhancement of the Compliance Manager System to provide better reporting capabilities,  track progress for all key suppliers and inclusion of high-risk indirect suppliers and labor  suppliers. 	 Completion of several supplier audits and establishment of an audit plan for FY2012. In addition, for several years Seagate has embedded GC language and requirements in its  contracts and required supplier adherence to those standards. We also require suppliers to  meet our Product Stewardship standard: components in Seagate products and packaging  are certified to meet stringent materials content requirements.  Seagate Commodity Management teams work with suppliers to complete self-assessments  of their factories, train their organizations on the five key elements of the EICC Code of  Conduct and encourage them to do the same for their key suppliers.  Materials and Supply Chain Mission To provide Seagate a Competitive Advantage  in Materials by establishing a Best-in-Class  Strategic Supply Base offering access to  Technology, Time to Volume, World-Class  Manufacturing Capability, Component  Quality, Flexibility and Lowest Overall Cost,  while maintaining the ultimate goal of  Customer Satisfaction.  10   2011 Seagate Technology.

Commodity Management  teams continue to hold Quarterly Business Reviews with key  suppliers throughout the year. Additionally, Seagate executives meet with supplier CEOs at  the companys annual Supplier CEO Advisory Council to share  product information and discuss issues in an open forum. Supplier Education and Training   Seagate believes that supplier training and capacity  building is an integral and necessary part of our supply  chain responsibilities. We educate suppliers by ensuring  they understand GC requirements in their contracts before  signing, acknowledging that GC is of critical importance to our  customers and us—and sharing information about emergng  developments that may impact future requirements and  practices  We provide valuable information to suppliers such as audit  documents, self-assessment tools, risk assessment scoring  and extractive documents, which are available on the EICC  website, and invite suppliers to workshops, training and  seminars offered by the EICC and customers. Supplier Diversity Seagate encourages diversity in its supplier base. The  company recognizes the value of—and buying power  generated through—minority-owned businesses. Diverse  suppliers in the U.S. are welcome to participate in Seagates  competitive bidding process, including businesses owned  and operated by minorities, women, gays and lesbians,  and veterans, or small businesses located in historically  underutilized business zones. Seagate contracts with diverse suppliers who qualify and  successfully compete for Seagates business. Seagate gains  access to solutions that meet customers requirements and  additional sources of high-quality goods and services. Diverse  suppliers get opportunities to grow their businesses and create  jobs, which strengthens the communities where Seagate  operates. Seagate also recommends its U.S. suppliers use a diverse  supply base in their procurement process.  11    2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.  Environmental Sustainability Seagate considers environmental responsibility to be the foundation of a sustainable  business and has a comprehensive management system in place to provide a framework for  identifying and managing risks to the environment from operations. Seagate also encourages  employees to take an active role in conservation. Seagate sets improvement targets and reports progress through key performance indicators.  We believe strongly that focusing on environmental issues such as waste generation,  resource depletion and climate change positions the company for continued success.     Progress in FY2011 included meeting targets for energy conservation, hazardous waste  generation and solid-waste recycling and the implementation of an automated materials  content reporting system to meet increasing customer and regulatory substance restrictions.  Hazardous waste minimization remained a focus and challenge due to increasingly complex  production processes and limitations in waste treatment capabilities.  Environmental, Health and Safety Management Systems Seagate is committed to reducing the impact of operations and providing a safe and healthy  workplace for employees. Our management systems approach enables sustainable and  effective methods needed to enhance company-wide EHS performance.   The management system is guided by principles set out in the Environmental, Health and  Safety Policy, which was updated this year to reflect changes in our operational footprint.  A copy of the policy is available on page 32 of this report. A set of 32 internal standards— Corporate Standard Operating Procedures (CSOP)—establish best-in-class control measures  and guidance to protect human health and the environment.  Assessments of compliance with internal standards and local regulatory requirements and  the effectiveness of management systems are verified by two independent review methods:  	 Corporate EHS Audit: A formal third-party audit for site compliance with EHS, CSOP and  local requirements is conducted at all locations every four years, with more frequent audits  occurring when indicated by the sites risk profile. In FY2011, three Corporate EHS audits  were conducted with root cause confirmed and corrective actions established for each  finding. Corrective actions were implemented and tracked to closure.   	 Quality Systems Review (QSR): EHS management systems at all manufacturing facilities  are certified to the International Standards Organizations 14001 standard (ISO 14001)  for Environmental Management Systems and the Occupational Health and Safety  Assessment Series 18001 standard (OHSAS 18001) for health and safety management  systems. 	 DEKRA, an internationally recognized third-party certification organization, provides  Seagates EHS Management Systems certifications, which are a component of the  companys Quality Systems Review (QSR) program. Surveillance audits are conducted  every two years; internal audits annually. During FY2011, four manufacturing sites  underwent surveillance audits. 	 No major non-conformances were identified and continued registration was  recommended. Sites developed root cause and corrective action plans to address all  findings. Seagate is not considering certification of non-manufacturing sites because they  are low-risk and internal management systems are in place to manage existing risks. Five  surveillance audits are scheduled for FY2012.  12   2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.

This was a 1.75%  increase in absolute measure compared to the previous year.  However, when normalized to production, we realized a 1.83%  reduction.   Seagate does not landfill hazardous waste unless, based on  comprehensive investigation, no other viable treatment method  is available. During the year, 87% of hazardous waste was  treated, 7% recycled and the remainder incinerated, recovered  or landfilled.  Our central challenge continued to be the Johor, Malaysia  site, which lacks sufficient in-house treatment capabilities  needed to meet full compliance with stringent wastewater  discharge parameters and increased production volume. This  necessitated hauling large quantities of hazardous waste to an  off-site treatment facility. Plans initiated in FY2010 to enhance  in-house capabilities at Johor are on schedule and anticipated  to positively affect hazardous waste generation in FY2012.   We have established a hazardous waste generation target not  to exceed 17,843 tons for FY2012, a 16.5% reduction from  the current year.  Hazardous Waste Minimization Project:  Solvent  Waste Reduction The Korat site engineering team worked on various solvent  minimization projects and reduced the amount of waste  solvent generated by replacing DOTP and Acetone with  Cyclohexane and introducing new technology. In FY2011,  these minimization projects resulted in a reduction of  approximately 50 tons.   Solid Waste  Seagates solid-waste focus is on reducing waste generation  and promoting recycling. For FY2011, we reduced the  absolute tonnage of solid waste generated 15%, or 18,711  tons, compared to the previous year. We exceeded our   annual target of at least 70% for solid-waste recycling by  achieving 79.3%. This was a 3% increase compared to the  previous year.    13   2011 Seagate Technology.

In the coming year, U.S. sites will explore  consolidating solid waste management and working with a  specialist service provider to better leverage recycling options.  Solid Waste Minimization Project: Plastic   Tray Reuse The Korat Manufacturing Services team implemented a return  process to reuse plastic trays used in the packaging of a  production part. The plastic trays are returned to the vendor,  where they are washed and reused. The project, implemented  in October 2010 reduced the number of new trays used by an  estimated 38,100 kg per year. Climate Change  Seagate recognizes climate change is real and will have  social, economic and environmental consequences for  everyone. Reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions  identified by various studies and reports, including the work  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),  is necessary to mitigate impacts of climate change. Seagate  conducted a baseline GHG inventory in 2008 to understand  its carbon footprint (see Greenhouse Gas Emissions). The  link between energy conservation, cost and GHG emissions  continue to drive company sustainability strategies and  actions.  Seagate has established a cross-functional committee that  meets quarterly to identify and quantify enterprise risks, which  are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Site-level impact  assessments on climate change are addressed through the  Environmental Management System. Seagate monitors potential regulatory changes and no  significant climate change-related risks have been identified  to date. We do not anticipate specific company risks beyond  global effects of potentially damaging frequent storms and  increased energy demand required to mitigate temperature  changes. Increased stakeholder awareness of climate change has driven  demand for more energy-efficient products. At present, we are  unable to quantify financial implications of the opportunities  driven by climate change since discussion associated with  energy-efficient product regulation is still in its infancy. We  anticipate these regulations will be influenced by global  economic conditions and considerations.  Greenhouse Gas Emission  Baseline emissions were established in CY2007, utilizing  the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for  Sustainable Development (WRI/WBSCD) GHG Corporate  Reporting and Accounting Standard, 2006, methodology  (GHG Protocol.) The baseline included Scope 1 Direct  Emissions (emissions resulting from fuel used at facilities,  physical and chemical processing, and fugitive emissions);  Scope 2 Indirect Emissions (electricity purchases); and Scope  3 Indirect Emissions (business travel.) The inventory included  facilities in Asia, Europe and North America owned, leased  and/or operated by Seagate. Seagate used the inventory data  to develop GHG minimization strategies and actions, and  support external reporting, including comprehensive disclosure  to stakeholders. GHG emissions increased by 4% in CY2010 to 1,307,378 tons  of CO2 e, compared to the previous year. This years Scope 3  inventory was expanded to include emissions from company- paid employee commute, capturing those associated with our  contracted fleet of buses used mainly in Asia.  Scope 1 Emissions decreased by 8% during CY2010  compared to the previous year. The majority of Scope 1  Emissions are from the use of Vertrel at the Woodlands facility.  The site is working on projects to reduce the use of this  chemical and exploring alternate technologies to replace it.  Scope 2 Emissions from the purchase of electricity increased  by 8.3% to 944,098 tons CO2e in CY2010. The increase  was due primarily to the power generation mix resulting from  a reduction in the overall use of electricity at our operations.  Details on purchased electricity are provided in the Energy  Conservation section below. Seagate continued to focus on  conservation/minimization to offset its carbon footprint and  procured green energy (wind power) to supply the Springtown,  Northern Ireland, location with 100 percent of its energy  requirements. A total of 83,456,759 kWh of green power was  purchased in FY2011. Seagate also participated in GHG reporting initiatives with  third-party organizations and customers, including: 	 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain Program.  Seagates submission is accessible to the public. 	 EICC Carbon Reporting System, which enables companies  in the electronics industry to calculate GHG emissions  and share the data with other companies. In addition to  Seagate, key suppliers were invited to participate. 	 Sustainable Silicon Valley.   14   2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.

Purchased electricity  is the largest contributor to our carbon footprint. In FY2011,  Seagate reduced electricity usage by 7.1% as normalized  to production units, completing the year at 7.83 kwh/drive  versus the target of less than 8.43 kWh/drive. Total electricity  consumption during the year was 1,559 GWh, a reduction of  4.2% year-over-year, and more than 12,363 MWh of electricity  was saved through conservation.  Reduction efforts continued to focus on production and  infrastructure equipment. Key action areas included equipment  efficiencies, process modifications, alternate energy  evaluations and building infrastructure improvement. The  company has set a target of 30,000 MWh in savings from  energy conservation projects for FY2012.  Seagate also supports electricity conservation by reducing  the energy consumption of our products (See Product  Stewardship).  15   2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.

Energy Conservation Project: Free Cooling Tower The Springtown Facilities team replaced a chiller system with  a free cooling tower that uses ambient air temperature during  cool weather to cool water for process tool use. The project  saved 2.4MWh.  Water Conservation  Seagate recognizes water is a vital resource for our  communities and operations, and conservation strategies  and actions have been implemented for a number of years. In  FY2011, operations consumed approximately 9.9 million cubic  meters of water, an 8% increase compared over prior year  usage; approximately 1 million cubic meters was recycled.  Water is sourced from Municipal Water Supply /Other Water  Utilities. Pollution is a very real threat to this resource, and we  have taken steps to ensure that wastewater generated at our  facilities is treated to meet discharge quality standards.  Green Building Seagates new U.S. executive offices in Cupertino, California  received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  (LEED) Gold designation. LEED is an internationally recognized  green building certification system, which provides a  framework for identifying and implementing measurable green  building design, construction, operations and maintenance  solutions.  Seagates green building will reduce energy use by 24%- to-50% over conventional building methods (reducing carbon  emissions by 33%-to-39%), lower water use by as much as  40%, and reduce solid-waste generation by up to 70%. This  is Seagates second green building. The Woodlands 3 facility  earned a Platinum Green Mark Award from the Singapore  Building and Construction Authority.   Environmental Inspections and Spills  There were 40 environmental regulatory inspections at  our facilities during the year with no notice of violation or  fines. These inspections centered on general environmental  compliance and wastewater discharge monitoring. There were  no significant spills recorded at any facility.    16    2011 Seagate Technology.

As a member of IPC-Association  Connecting Electronics Industries, Seagate participates in developing and adopting  industry standards (IPC-1752) for product material content and manufacturing information  data exchange.  	 We share compliance system methods with other companies, inside and outside our  industry, to promote standardization and transparency.    	 We gain supplier support for ensuring availability of this data and implementing a  standards-based strategy.  	 We share supplier training materials and systems with suppliers and customers.  In addition to ensuring efficient, cost-effective compliance, we realize the following  advantages:  	 When concerns are raised about a substance as the result of a regulatory change,   health or environmental report, we can quickly identify the substances in any product  dating to 2008.  	 Full material disclosure prior to product launch avoids the costs of polling our supply chain  each time a new substance of concern is identified.  	 We apply insights gained from our experience with substances to develop products  through a planned and controlled process that eliminates chemicals of potential concern  without compromising product reliability.    	 Suppliers indicate they prefer our approach to compliance to others used in the industry.

All rights reserved.  Product Content - Specific Materials  Although no laws require low-halogen products, Seagate  proactively works with suppliers to develop reliable alternatives  to plastics, adhesives, inks and flame retardants containing  halogens, and rigorously qualifies them in next-generation  products. This industry-leading initiative, which took two years  to develop, has reduced all forms of chlorine and bromine  from our disk drives to industry-defined negligible levels. Seagate also restricts certain phthalates to 1000 ppm at the  homogeneous material level. This level exceeds regulatory  requirements and common industry specifications. Product Content - Conflict Minerals  Seagate continued to address concerns related to mining of  minerals (columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite and gold)  associated with human rights atrocities in the eastern region  of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and surrounding  countries.   While the mining of mineral ore in Africa is several steps  removed from the manufacture of high-tech electronics, we  have responded along with our industry. Seagate participates  in the EICC Extractives Working Group and subcommittees,  and endorses the EICC/Global eSustainability Initiative  (GeSI) Conflict Free Smelter program. The program, aimed  at developing a responsible approach to conflict-free mineral  sourcing from the region, incorporates:  	 International Tin Research Institute Supply Chain Initiatives  Bag-and-Tag system for certifying conflict-free status of  ore from mine of origin to smelter. 	 Conflict-Free Smelter program, which certifies a smelters  business processes for effective control of raw materials  derived from non-conflicted sources. 	 EICC-GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template, a  standard format for acquiring supply chain documentation  back to smelters used by suppliers. We are establishing internal due diligence disciplines for  risk analysis and direct supplier certification. Documented  procedures and specifications will be completed when final  Securities and Exchange Commission Dodd-Frank regulations  are released.   See Seagates Conflict Minerals Policy Statement. Design for Environment  Product power consumption contributes substantially to  the carbon footprint and environmental impact of electronic  devices. Seagate is committed to developing products   and technologies that minimize environmental impact.   For example, the Pulsar.2 MLC Enterprise Solid State Drive,  which can replace three or more competitive SSDs, saves  6W of operating power per system and reduces energy costs  by 40%. PowerChoice drive power management delivers the  lowest power usage ever offered in an enterprise hard drive. Seagate also participates in developing the following energy- focused standards and benchmarks: 	 U.S.	Environmental	Protection	Agency	(EPA)	ENERGY	 STAR	Program – Supports global harmonization of  definitions and test methods that enable comparability  of results and produce cost savings for consumers,  government and industry. The Program, which was aligned  with the Spring 2011 edition of the Storage Networking  Industry Associations (SNIA) Dictionary and the SNIA  Emerald Power Efficiency Measurement Specification,  Version 1.0 (August 23, 2011), incorporates industry input.[iii] 	 Storage	Networking	Industry	Association	(SNIA)	 Emerald	Program – The Program  provides public  access to storage system power usage and efficiency  through a well-defined testing procedure, and additional  information related to system power. The measurement  procedure,  SNIA Emerald Power Efficiency Measurement  Specification, was developed, released and  maintained  by the Green Storage Technical Working Group (GS-TWG)  under guidance of the Green Storage Initiative (GSI) of the  SNIA.[iv]  	 Storage	Performance	Council	SPC-1CE	Benchmark  – Enables end users to better understand energy costs in  storage device idle and active states.[v]  In addition, Seagate enterprise self-encrypting drives (SED)  offer Instant Secure Erase, a feature that renders data  on the hard drive unreadable in less than a second via a  cryptographic erase of the data encryption key. With Instant  Secure Erase, Seagate drives may be re-used without fear of  losing confidential information. Drives that otherwise would be  destroyed are given new life. Managing electronic waste (e-waste) from end-of-life  computers, mobile phones and other electronic products  is a global concern. As a components manufacturer, our  products typically are not subject to recycling or e-waste laws.   However, Seagate believes the biggest impacts on a products  environmental footprint occur during design, and we are  focused on increasing recyclable content of our disk drives,  which may account for up to 90% of product weight.

Analysis of a product life cycle is an  important element in understanding a products environmental  footprint and contributing to product design improvements.   The analysis is a cradle-to-grave inventory that includes  raw material extraction and processing, manufacturing and  assembly, transportation and distribution, product use, and  end-of-life.  Seagate initiated a process to evaluate its product families  and completed a pilot Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the  Momentus 5400.6 (500GB) hard disk drive (a representative  notebook product). Seagate teamed with a leading global  consulting and technical service firm, WSP Environment &  Energy, to assist in aligning with ISO14040 and 14044 LCA  methodologies. EarthShift, a leading international provider of  sustainability consulting and training services, provided a third- party critical review of the report. We are working to complete  similar analyses of other products.   With industry-standard value not yet established from which  comparisons can be readily made, the useful life of a drive  was assumed to be three years for the purpose of the study.   Our analysis used actual product bill-of-materials information,  transportation and distance data from supplier locations to  our factories and factories to customers. We also factored  in the energy usage profile of the product over its useful life,  incorporating Seagate power-saving software effects.  Climate change impact, by todays standards, essentially  equals the carbon footprint of the product, which is  calculated using formulas that include energy consumption  from component manufacturing, assembly operations,  transportation, actual usage of the product over its lifetime and   end-of-life  disposal or recycling. Energy consumption can be  translated into carbon footprint when consumption is factored  against the source of that energy. For instance, electrical  energy generated from burning coal has a different carbon  footprint than electrical energy produced from wind, water and  solar sources. When known, this information can be used in  the life cycle assessment. Source data for several aspects of  the life cycle analysis comes from industry average databases.  Results:  The products climate change potential (carbon  footprint) equals 7.34 kgCO2 equivalents for a 500 GB  HDD operated for three years in the U.S. Sensitivity analysis  conducted on input assumptions suggests climate change  potential ranges from 6.7 to 8.2 kg CO2 eq (20% of the base  case) depending on location and use intensity. This is roughly  equivalent to driving a compact car for 30 miles. Highlights are  noted in Tables 1 and 2. Table: Climate change impact by life cycle stage We learned much from this pilot. Future LCA process  enhancements include greater utilization of actual supply chain  information—where industry average data is presently used— tools to give decision makers comparative bill-of-material and  supplier selection choice data during product design and   procurement, and  actual water consumption data.

This  core belief is at the heart of Seagates commitment to the safety and well-being of more than  50,000 employees. With the Seagate EHS policy (See Environmental Health and Safety  Policy in this document) as the foundation, robust health and safety management systems  provide a framework for continuous improvements in risk reduction and mitigation. It is  Seagates fundamental belief that all work-related incidents are preventable.   Measuring Progress  For more than a decade, Seagate has collected and tracked a variety of health and safety  performance indicators to monitor trends and establish strategies and actions for continued  reduction of work-related injury and illness. Consistency in the analysis of safety performance  indicators (occupational injury and illness case rates, and lost work day case rates) is assured  through the application of  U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) reporting criteria to all Seagate locations worldwide.   During FY2011, Seagate experienced a 39% increase in its recordable case rate (0.32 cases  per 100 employees) compared to the previous year, with a days-away case rate (0.13 cases  per 100 employees) increase of 30%.  We do, however, continue to significantly outperform the industry average for U.S.  manufacturers of computer and electronic equipment as indicated by our year-end OSHA  recordable rate of 0.32—a nearly fivefold difference.      20   2011 Seagate Technology.

Our  strategy includes emphasis on early reporting of symptoms  to minimize injury severity through early care and mitigation  of risk. This has had a positive impact on minimizing injury  severity, and was reflected in a 50% reduction in CTD cases  that resulted in lost or restricted work time and a 20%  reduction in actual days of lost or restricted work. We have set aggressive injury reduction targets. In addition to  focusing on established programs and processes based on  leading best-known practices, specific strategies have been  developed to support a 33% reduction in recordable case  rate and a 30% reduction in the days-away case rate, which  include:  	 Execution of targeted risk reduction action plans for all  sites, with particular focus on those experiencing increases  in FY2011.  	 Revision of the Corporate Standard for Ergonomics  Program Management, including rollout of a new  application for enhanced management of issues related to  risk mitigation in the office environment.  	 Refocus of the Behavior-Based Safety program. Health and Safety Management System Our global management system approach to safety assures  a sustainable process for the identification and mitigation of  workplace risks and hazards.   Global Standards A set of global health and safety standards (Corporate  Standard Operation Procedures) establish best-in-class  control measures, which often go beyond regulatory  requirements, and guidance to protect the safety and well- being of  employees. In line with Seagates focus on integration  and accountability, each standard delineates a set of  requirements, training and a chart of responsibilities to ensure  clear accountabilities—from the plant manager to individual  employees.    Global Standards - Equipment Safety Standard Procedures for equipment safety, from design  through decommissioning, have been integrated into  worldwide operations. Before Seagate introduces new  equipment into the workplace, we partner with companies  experienced in equipment testing and certification to ensure  the equipment meets recognized international standards,  such as SEMI and NFPA, in addition to specific Seagate  requirements. Equipment that passes design reviews must  be installed following rigorous checklists that cover layout,  electrical, chemical, fire protection, interlock, and operational  safety requirements. Once installed, thermal imaging is  conducted to detect potential fire hazards in equipment.   In FY2011, more than 26,000 pieces of production and  research equipment were imaged, in addition to the electrical  distribution systems, connections and other equipment and  systems controlled by the Facilities operations. At the end of  life, standard procedures are followed to safely decommission  and dispose of equipment. Training Employees and contractors receive a wide range of safety  training targeted to specific jobs and assigned tasks. Utilizing  instructor-led and web-based training strategies helps  individuals to understand their general safety responsibilities as  well as safety knowledge and skills needed for specific tasks  (such as chemical safety, ergonomics and electrical safety).   Courses are provided in native languages and tailored to  meet local needs. In FY2011, nearly 45,000 EHS e-Learning  courses were completed, an increase of 31% compared to the  previous year.  21   2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.

We believe the key to building  and maintaining a safety culture is through integration and  involvement. In FY2011, more than 10% of our employee  population was engaged in safety committees and teams.   Evaluating Performance for Continuous  Improvement We closely monitor the effectiveness of our control measures  through job/task risk assessments, work area inspections,  and health surveillance programs designed to ensure that  employees with potential exposure to chemical or physical  hazards are not adversely affected by their work environment  and assigned tasks. Formal third-party audits are periodically  conducted at all locations to verify compliance with company  and local regulatory requirements. All manufacturing sites  undergo regular audits to maintain OHSAS 18001 certification,  the internationally recognized standard for occupational safety  and health management systems. (See Health and Safety  Management System section.)  Health and Wellness Seagate is committed to driving a culture in which employees  are healthy and productive, and have information needed to  make informed and healthy lifestyle choices. A portfolio of  health benefits plans and wellness programs are customized  for each country and designed to encourage employees to  evaluate, improve and maintain their health and the health of  their families. In addition to the companys benefits programs, occupational  health and wellness priorities are established at the site level to  customize programs targeted at local health issues sensitive  to cultural differences. We continued to offer programs  throughout the year targeted at disease prevention and  informed lifestyle choices. A range of programs were delivered  across the company, including on-site flu immunization clinics,  health screenings, health risk assessments, periodic medical  examinations, smoking cessation programs, weight control  programs and health seminars/awareness campaigns about  a variety of health issues. In addition, the company continued  to sponsor on-site fitness centers and recreational facilities at  many locations to provide employees with a convenient way to  improve and maintain their physical well-being. External Recognition Seagate facilities worldwide received external recognition  awards for their EHS performance.  22    2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.  Community Engagement Employee involvement is the heart of Seagates community engagement efforts. Employees  consistently come together to meet the needs of our communities by generously donating  their time through volunteer and outreach initiatives. Regional plans provide local volunteer  opportunities, awareness events and resources, and ways for employees to make a  difference. Seagate has significant operations in Thailand and strong, long-standing relationships with  customers and suppliers throughout Asia. We were saddened and deeply concerned about  those affected by the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and floods in Thailand. Seagate contributed funding and collaborated with Give2Asia, a leading organization  committed to social responsibility and philanthropy in Asia, to support flood relief efforts in  Thailand. In addition, more than 120 employees volunteered to distribute food and basic  supplies to flood victims (photos below). The company also contributed funding for Japans  tsunami relief and recovery efforts.  23   2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.

Recognizing the valuable role that our storage products play in  the community, Seagate launched a product donation program  in partnership with TechSoup, one of the largest nonprofit  providers of technology products and services to NGOs and  nonprofit organizations worldwide. The initial donation of  560TB of storage products will enable eligible nonprofits to  conduct day-to-day operations, reduce costs and maximize  use of their limited funds.   Areas of Focus Seagates community engagement and corporate giving  efforts are aligned under the program theme Capacity to  Care, which aligns company giving with employees localized  interests and leverages the impact of our combined financial  and volunteer contributions. Capacity to Care, which  increases opportunities for engagement beyond our traditional  focus on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)  education, focuses on the following: 	 Get Smart – Enhancing STEM education for children. 	 Tread Lightly – Reducing our impact on the planet. 	 Be Well – Encouraging healthy lifestyles and wellness  among employees and our communities. 	 Reach Out – Helping those most in need. The following charts illustrate Seagates commitment by   focus area. In each of these areas, Seagate sites worldwide committed to  enhancing community partnerships and provided employees  meaningful ways to contribute to a cause. Employees came  together with coworkers, family and friends, to help provide  better education for children; reduce, reuse and recycle more  in our facilities, homes, schools and communities; create  healthier lives for themselves and others; and lend a hand to  those in need.  24   2011 Seagate Technology.

Longmont, Colorado Volunteers spent a weekday morning clearing brush along a  mountain trail maintained by the Wild Bear Mountain Ecology  Center.   28    2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.  Work Environment  Seagate believes people are its competitive advantage. Successful individuals are the driving  force behind a successful enterprise, and attracting, retaining and motivating the best people  will position Seagate at the forefront of the industry. Seagate has a diverse workforce with a major presence in six countries including China,  Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the U.K. and the U.S. The company also has a sales  presence in numerous other geographies. In FY2011, Seagate employed approximately  53,600 employees, temporary employees and contractors worldwide. Nearly 46,000 are  located in the companys Asian operations. Seagates human resources policies align with the UN Global Compact Principles and reflect  our commitment to the EICC Code of Conduct (Code.) In particular, Seagates Human  Rights policy articulates global standards covering respectful treatment, due process,  freedom of association, reasonable limitation of working hours, fair compensation, and  freedom to express opinions, all of which are important to creating and sustaining a positive  and productive work environment. (Read Seagates Human Rights Policy included in the  appendix of this report.)  In support of these requirements, Seagate conducted internal  human resource audits at all major locations to ensure processes and practices adhere to  human resources policies and the Code. Seagates Talent Acquisition Practices and Strategies  Seagate is dedicated to continually improving talent acquisition methodologies and practices  relating to candidate attraction, applicant treatment, assessment processes, and on- boarding experience. The global Talent Acquisition leadership team conducts annual reviews  of all policies, practices, tools and processes to ensure that Seagate remains in the forefront  of recruitment innovation and performance. Seagate took several steps to ensure continued  implementation of best practices and programs that enable it to meet long- and short-term  strategic Talent Acquisition objectives.  During FY2011, Seagate established proactive operator hiring strategies for its Asia region,  including a framework for managing the recruitment of contract, foreign and local (national)  factory operators. Establishing these proactive strategies enhances our ability to improve  awareness, responsiveness and compliance with UN Global Compact Principles and  the Code. Seagate also set goals to hire an increased percentage of in-country, locally- based operators as direct employees, while decreasing the percentage that are hired as  contractors. These practices will enable Seagate to provide greater stability in its workforce.  Additionally, following a review of foreign worker contracts and practices in Malaysia, we  improved practices among Malaysia foreign worker contractors to ensure they comply with  legal regulations and EICC guidelines. The Seagate staffing function consistently conducts quarterly internal client satisfaction  surveys to measure our level of service and effectiveness to hiring managers, new  employees and internal transferees. The survey allows us to identify and evaluate our  employees perspectives about the hiring process and helps us identify areas of strength and  opportunities for improvement. Based on feedback from these surveys and other initiatives to  assess the needs of our internal and external stakeholders, Seagate is placing an increased  emphasis on hiring university students for internships and recent college graduates for entry- level positions.   29   2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.  We developed an 18-month international, rotational  engineering program for qualifying New College Graduates  (NCGs.) The program enhances the knowledge of hard disk  drive technologies and accelerates the rate of technical and  business competency of NCGs. Our new focus on university- based hiring demonstrates Seagates commitment to help  build the next generation of global technology leaders.     Seagate has maintained its commitment to filling open  positions with current employees and soliciting candidates  identified by employees through our Employee Referral  Program. These practices demonstrate our commitment  to developing current employees and providing them with  opportunities to grow and advance, and drawing high-quality  candidates into our applicant pool for open requisitions.   Talent Management and Employee  Engagement  Seagate embraces the concept of talent management and  has leveraged its Integrated Maximizing Alignment and  Performance (iMAP) system to integrate three key people  management processes: performance management, learning  management and succession management. Our employees and leaders are committed to effective  performance management processes that support the  achievement of individual, departmental and corporate  objectives. This means setting and aligning goals at the start of  each fiscal year. In FY2011, 98% of employees created goals  and development plans in the iMAP application at the start of  the year.  To support employee learning and development, iMAP  contains the Learning Management System, which enables  managers and employees to obtain learning resources and  information from a single, online application and complete  required learning that supports their role and corporate  compliance requirements. iMAP provided more than 94,000  learning instances, with offerings covering leadership,  professional and computer/IT development and functional  competencies from highly-recognized learning experts. In  addition, Seagate continued to offer its own custom, online  learning courses and facilitated blended learning programs— especially in leadership and management development—at  major sites worldwide.   In the tough macroeconomic climate of 2010-2011, Seagates  leadership development programs not only continued to build  leaders foundational skills, they helped leaders become more  effective at developing their employees and working in a global  environment. Leadership Development Program for Managers, a blended  solution based on Harvard Business Publishing (HBP)  content and re-designed for the virtual classroom in FY2010,  enrolled 188 managers. Based on participant feedback, 96%  indicated this training program was a worthwhile investment  in my career development, and 100% agreed, this training  program will improve my job performance. Strong demand  from supervisors at Seagates Asia facilities for the Leadership  Development Program for Supervisors drove enrollments  to 283. All participants indicated they agreed that this  training program was a worthwhile investment in my career  development and that this training program will improve my  job performance. Based on a successful global pilot program, we collaborated  with the Ken Blanchard Companies to deliver Situational  Leadership II to 165 managers and directors. SLII is  recognized as a business language and  framework for  employee development because it works across cultural,  linguistic and geographical barriers. The foundation lies in  teaching leaders to diagnose the needs of an individual or   team and use the appropriate leadership style to respond to  needs of the person and the situation. Ninety-two percent of  participants indicated this training program was a worthwhile  investment in my career development while 93% agreed, this  training program will improve my job performance. Eighty-four directors participated in the Maximizing Business  Results program, and 574 directors, managers and  supervisors globally participated in Seagates leadership  development programs. The transition to a virtual format  has enabled a 54 percent cost reduction while maintaining  high quality of the programs (90 percent graduation rate and  92 percent learner satisfaction.) Seagates virtual programs  received a Certificate of Merit from Chief Learning Officer  magazine for leading work in the Global Learning category.  Our Maximizing Business Results program won the Corporate  University Xchange (CUX) Awards for Excellence and  Innovation, Excellence in Alliances Award, for making the  best use of external providers to create impactful programs  resulting in measurable improvements in employee and  business performance. Bersin & Associates published a research paper about virtual  learning that featured the Maximizing Business Results  Program case study as a best practice. The paper noted that  virtual learning is a cost-effective development solution that  organizations such as Seagate use to effectively lower costs,  improve leadership skills, employee engagement and business  performance. Combined, these interrelated areas offer stability and  consistency to help managers ensure our diverse, global  workforce remains engaged and productive. Ensuring Employees Well-Being Seagate invests in a wide range of benefits programs around  the world to promote the health, well-being and productivity  of employees. Our benefits are benchmarked to local  market practice and cultural requirements, and reflect global  standards of a leading, multinational organization. Although   30   2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.  these programs take different forms depending on geography,  the plans provide cost-effective and flexible coverage to  employees and, in some cases, dependents.  Examples of these programs that reflect our commitment  to our people include health care plans, life and disability  coverage; wellness initiatives including fitness programs and  on-site fitness centers; preventive health screenings; vacation,  holidays and leave policies; retirement savings opportunities;  counseling  services; discounted retail products; adoption  support; and equity ownership opportunities. We provided financial incentives for U.S. employees to  complete biometric screenings and health-risk assessments  in an effort to improve the health of our population, and  conducted a health fair and health screenings in Northern  Ireland.  Rewarding and Recognizing Employees Employee compensation continued to reflect a philosophy  of design to sustain a diverse, high-performing team  environment. The companys compensation strategy focused  on providing base pay that is competitive with local market  conditions, supplemented by incentive pay opportunities that  reward performance.  Under company reward and recognition programs, employees  who make meaningful contributions that help Seagate achieve  business objectives are eligible to be rewarded and recognized  in a number of ways, ranging from monetary bonuses to letters  of commendation.   Our compensation program provides for variable rewards  based on individual and company performance in addition to  base pay, providing a tangible incentive for employees to excel.  The FY2011 bonus plans were funded and related bonuses  were paid in early FY2012 as the result of the company  achieving its performance objectives.   Seagate Equity Ownership Dedicated, focused employees who contribute their expertise  in the workplace each day are the fundamental engine driving  our ongoing success. Seagate believes such contributions  should be rewarded. The companys variable pay and  benefit programs included two vehicles by which employees  participated in Seagates success through equity ownership:  employee Seagate stock awards and the Employee Stock  Purchase Plan. Though each program is distinct in terms  of its provisions, they share a common objective of offering  employees the opportunity to build a long-term ownership  stake in the company. Executive Compensation  Seagates executive compensation strategy is designed  to drive high performance, strengthen its market position,  and increase shareholder value. The goals of our executive  compensation programs are to:  	 Attract and retain talented leaders through competitive pay  programs. 	 Motivate executives to achieve and exceed business  objectives approved by the Board. 	 Align executive and shareholder interests to optimize  shareholder return with acceptable risk.  	 Manage total compensation costs in support of our financial  performance. In FY2011, Seagate shipped 199 million units, which  represented 3% growth over the prior fiscal year. Revenues  were $11 billion, a 4% year-over-year decrease. The decline  in revenue reflected the cumulative effect of the competitive  pricing environment the industry experienced during the  middle of CY2010, partially offset by an industry-wide supply  constraint in the second half of FY2011 from what is believed  to be a reaction to possible supply chain disruptions stemming  from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.  Managing the costs of our compensation programs was  one of many operating actions taken throughout the year to  improve margins and preserve profitability.   Seagate set aggressive performance goals in anticipation  of an upswing in an uncertain economic environment.  Notwithstanding difficult economic conditions, we made no  changes to our executive bonus plan or equity incentive plan  goals due to our ongoing commitment to maintaining a pay- for-performance philosophy.  Key executive compensation decisions follow: 	 No increases in salary were made for executives. 	 No bonuses were paid to executives based on business  results.  	 A multiplier based on achievement of certain quality metrics  was added for funding the bonus plan because quality is  considered critical to our overall business performance. 	 Performance-vesting restricted share units (PSUs) were  introduced to the mix of equity-based awards to enhance  long-term strategic incentives for executives and promote  alignment with shareholder interests. Vesting of these PSU  awards is based on a combination of a three-year average  return on invested capital and relative total shareholder  return compared with a select group of peer companies.   31   2011 Seagate Technology.

Seagates publicly disclosed Compensation Discussion and  Analysis (CD&A) further details the executive compensation  strategy and practices for compensating our Named  Executive Officers (as defined in the CD&A.). The CD&A is  updated each year as part of the annual Proxy Statement  prepared for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders  which is generally held in October of each year.  Ensuring Diversity in our U.S. Workforce and  Work Practices   Seagate is committed to having a diverse workforce, and  to providing an inclusive and supportive environment where  all employees are valued and participate fully in the Seagate  employment experience. We believe employees talents will  be utilized to the fullest and organizational performance will  be strengthened in a diverse and supportive environment.  Working productively across cultures in a global team is  considered a business critical skill. FY2011 U.S .Diversity Summary Even with continued challenges and workforce reductions,  including a U.S. headcount decrease by 30 percent from  FY2008 to FY2011 and by more than 60 percent in the past  decade, our diversity trends from FY2004 to FY2011 remained  relatively constant.  Developing Diverse Employees In FY2011, we promoted diverse employees at a rate equal to  or greater than their workforce representation for Hispanics,  Asians, and Females, and came within one percent of meeting  this goal for African-Americans and American Indians.  Engage and Retain Diverse Talent Through site-level employee engagement opportunities, we  were also successful in achieving our goal of retaining diverse  employees at a rate equal to or greater than their workforce  representation for African-Americans and Asians and were  within one percent of our goal for Females, Hispanics and  American Indians.   We launched several programs aimed at supporting employee  diversity and global inclusion. A rotational engineering program  to attract and accelerate the development of NCGs has been  developed and implemented.   Additionally, Working Globally, a training program provided by  Aperian Global Inc., was implemented worldwide to support  the overall global inclusion and U.S. diversity initiative. The  objectives of this program are: recognize when culture counts,  know self and others and identify any differences, and bridge  those differences by utilizing new strategies and skills provided  in the training. Seagate collaborated with Aperian Global  to deliver the program to 153 leaders and key employees.  Leveraging theGlobeSmart web tool, Seagate created a  custom training program focusing on countries where we have  significant operations. One-hundred percent of participants  indicated, I gained new knowledge and skills from this  training program. The training will be provided to an increased  number of participants in FY2012.  32    2011 Seagate Technology. All rights reserved.

These Principles address  responsibility for the environment and other matters; however, most address the international  human rights and labor standards that must be upheld to ensure the well-being and dignity  of each person. We have developed policies to reinforce our commitment to uphold these human rights and  labor standards. We will abide by these policies or the local law in the countries where we  operate, whichever sets a higher standard.
