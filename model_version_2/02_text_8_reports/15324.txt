With the  change of schools, the baselines for our previous  SROI have changed; and as a result, we will only  report on our SROI in 2011 to enable adequate  time for data collection.   In measuring our SROI, we believe that we are  one of the first government-linked companies  (GLCs) in Malaysia to measure the value of our  community contributions.  This measure allows  us to evaluate the impact of our community  activities on our stakeholders, identify ways  to improve performance, and enhance the  performance of investments. Providing additional support To ensure that our PINTAR programmes are  maximised, we aim to take the results of our  PINTAR impact analysis further by developing  several projects to ensure that our students are  best supported by the school and their families.  In 2009, our PINTAR impact analysis raised  weaknesses in our students lives resulting in  poor academic performance:  1.  Lack of access to adequate academic resources 2.  Lack of motivation to excel due to the lack of  awareness of potential employment avenues 3. Lack of parental support We developed several programmes to assist our  students for the first two weaknesses through  intensive classes, motivational trips, exposure  of the students to the various employment  avenues available, organisation seminars and  workshops on academic-related topics and  lessons on attitudes and behaviour.  However,  we were not able to develop any programmes  to gain the support of parents to get involved in  their childrens academic life.   This is an area in which we will be working on to  gain parental support to incentivise and motivate  our students to perform better, thereby ensuring  a better future for themselves and family.   We  will measure our efforts in the level of parental  participation through future Parents - Teachers  meetings in our schools on a two yearly basis to  ensure that our efforts are in good effect.    Inclusion We support a range of charities and community  groups which address issues of social deprivation,  health and the environment.    In 2010, our major activity here was the Little  India Project. Little India covers the area  from Jalan Travers to Jalan Tun Sambanthan  and involves the development of new business  premises, a parking complex, and road  improvements with cultural affinity to reflect  the ethnic Indian community in Malaysia. The  Little India project is part of the Government all  inclusive plan which was put under the purview  of the Federal Territories and Urban Wellbeing  Ministry. An allocation of RM110 million was  also provided to improve the traffic conditions  in Brickfields and KL Sentral; as a mean to  complement the Little India project by facilitating  tourist arrivals to Little India, Brickfields. To  commemorate the occasion, we organised an  official launch ceremony for Little India on 27  October 2010.  Dignitaries invited were the Prime  Minister of Malaysia, YAB Dato Sri Mohd Najib  Tun Abdul Razak, the Prime Minister of India, The  Honorable Manmohan Singh, several ministers  and personnel from the Prime Ministers Office,  KL City Hall (Dewan Bandaraya KL, DBKL),  Ministry of Federal Territories and Urban  Wellbeing and most importantly members of the  Brickfields community as well as the media.    piNTAR at uKM  24 MRCB Annual Report 2010   xxxxxxx We are also heavily involved in other community activities in the Brickfields area, participating in  activities organised by the Brickfields Community and people with disabilities (orang kurang upaya,  OKU) at the Karnival Brickfields. This was an event organised by the Rukun Tetangga Brickfields  involving exhibitions by our Royal Police Force (Polis DiRaja Malaysia), fire department (Jabatan  Bomba), Information Ministry (Jabatan Penerangan), Association of the Blind Malaysia and Malaysian  Federation of the Deaf. We participate in these activities and organisations as it is our firm belief  that with our support, they are better able to raise awareness on current social issues affecting the  disadvantaged in our community.  That being said, we further recognise that we could better focus our community activities and for 2011,  we will be drawing up an action plan of our activities to ensure that our support is best utilised where  required.

Many  of the grouses relate to the perceived lack of  information provided by KL City Hall as many  of the hawkers located in the affected area were  required to move to a temporary site while their  existing area of business was being upgraded  prior being moved to their designated business  site which was still under construction. Local  residents were also unhappy with the proposed  road reflow plan and the perception that the  proposed road reflow would lead to greater  congestion. We were requested by the Federal Territories  and Urban Wellbeing Ministry to be the primary  developer as we have a strong presence in  Brickfields; as our headquarters are located at  KL Sentral and we were already involved in the  development of the Jalan Tun Sambanthan road  extension project. Work at Little India included  the building of a temporary hawker centre,  installation of new street lamps, upgrading the  pedestrian walk, construction of welcome arch,  one of the largest fountains in the country,  cultural arches, multi-storey Indian bazaar and  cultural stalls.     27 MRCB Laporan Tahunan 2010 It is unfortunate that we were involved in  this dispute between the local residents and  entrepreneurs with the local government.  Our  intention was to provide our expertise and  support to Government initiatives to improve the  quality of life to all residents.     Nonetheless, our approach to the redevelopment  works of Little India involved consultations with  the residents and business community, religious  and cultural groups, transport operators, public  authorities – police and fire department, and  Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) from  and around Brickfields.

We conducted post hand-over surveys after  completion of new projects; where projects are  evaluated in terms of design and specifications;  workmanship and customer service. The  feedback received on design and specifications  are satisfactory. Nonetheless, we will keep  improving our supervision and monitoring plans  to improve the level of workmanship. During the operations/management of our  buildings and facilities, we constantly seek  feedback from our tenants and customers  through direct engagement.   Our facilities management team holds regular  feedback sessions with our tenants and  customers to ensure that we are able to focus our  resources on the issues that are important to our  customers and tenants by providing an efficient,  user-defined service.

We  chose these two certification schemes as they  were the most established schemes operating  in our region, thereby being able to provide  assessment of our buildings suited to our local  environment. Apart from that we are also seeking  to achieve certification through the Malaysian  GBI.   These schemes were applied to three buildings,  namely Lot G, Lot E and 348 Sentral.    Lot E (also known as KL Sentral Park) is  scheduled for completion by the end of  2011, and will be in the forefront of our  development strategies, as this is seen as  the next generation of Malaysian urban  centres.  It will be our first project to utilise  CISCOs Smart and Connected Communities  (SCC) framework. The SCC is a business  model that works by creating IT solutions  for what MRCB describes as a sustainable,  green and smart urban development  practice.  One of the SCCs many features  involves the ease of tenants moving into  the KL Sentral Park lots as IT infrastructure  will be provided as the fourth utility besides  electricity, water and gas. These prospective  tenants will not have to worry about signing  up for their own separate phone service, as  these services will be provided by CISCO.  Lot E will also feature a multi-service Internet  Protocol (IP platform for easy Information &  Communication Technology (ICT) integration  and building automation networks, as well as  the availability of free Wi-Fi for all its tenants  and patrons.    Lot G (also known as Nu Sentral) is a RM1.4  billion integrated development comprising a  seven storey retail mall and 27-storey office  tower.      xxxxxxx  36 MRCB Annual Report 2010    348 Sentral is a new development, built on the  green concept and is slated to be completed  by 2012. 348 Sentral is looking to pursue  the GBI Malaysia Gold rating and the LEED  Platinum rating Accreditation. We recognise that the adoption of these green  building certification systems represent the first  step on a long journey in delivering sustainable  buildings to our customers. Our aim is to  ultimately plan and construct developments that  fulfil the principles of sustainable development  in the long term.  Detailed below are some of the initiatives  which we are undertaking within our Group of  Companies.  Integrating sustainable Designs and use of  Renewable technologies We face a unique challenge to meet demands for  new and renovated facilities that are accessible,  secure, healthy, and productive while minimising  their impact on the environment. We recognise  that in order to meet the needs of our customers  in future, we will need to consider the life cycle of  a building to ensure that we are able to improve  the environmental performance of each building  from the design through to end-of-life stage.   While we have undertaken a cost impact  analysis for the development of our three Green  buildings, we will be seeking to implement this  approach for all our developments in future to  ensure that we deliver the best cost options for  our customers.   We further recognise that there are opportunities  available for us to bring better value to our  customers in our building designs such as  incorporating renewable energy technologies  into our building designs and the design of  zero-emission buildings. These are long term  goals which we are currently working on to  incorporate into our building planning and  design departments.  Our targets for the achievement of these  objectives are: objective target Adoption of Life Cycle Thinking in  our Future Developments Use of Life-cycle Costing in  delivering better products to our  customers Incorporation of renewable  energy technologies in our  future building designs and  developments As mentioned in our last report, we already have  our Green Building Governance Structure and  this unit will be looking into these issues.    xxxxxxxxx   xxxxxxxxxxx dELivERiNG SuSTAiNABLE dESiGN  37 MRCB Laporan Tahunan 2010 BRiNGiNG vALuE (EC1-E9) MRCB is one of the founding members of the  Malaysian chapter for the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC).

Our risk  management approach is focused on minimising  potential adverse effects on the financial  performance of the Group. As such, issues such  as climate change are seen very much as part of  this process.    The impact of climate change particularly on  the choice of developmental areas in future  for us would be a critical factor, as purchasing  developmental locations in high risk areas such  as flood prone areas and water deficient areas  would increase developmental cost for us. Thus,  we are in the process of formalising climate  change risk into our management process.

For our business continuity, we  see it as an advantage for us to increase our pool of  female employees as it adds stability and continuity  to our activities.   approximately 44.0% employed as permanent staff  with the remaining 55.0% working as contract staff.  This difference is primarily due to the nature of our  business, which comprises primarily of construction  and development works. In Malaysia, it is not a norm  to have unions in the work place except for specific  industries. As such, there are no unions at MRCB but  we do not prevent our employees from joining such  organisations. In terms of gender breakdown, 71.0% of our staff  comprised of male employees while 29.0% were  females. While we try to decrease this perceived  gender bias, we still have an overwhelming number  of male job applicants as compared to females  due to the nature of business we are in. We are  working to correct this imbalance in our employee  gender numbers; however, while we practice equal  opportunity in our hiring programme, we cannot  influence job applications.    44 MRCB Annual Report 2010 We do not hire child labour nor forced labour in our  operations. We are pleased to report that in 2010  that there were no incidences of discrimination  reported and no incidences related to freedom of  association and collective bargaining was reported.  Our developments are located mainly in urban areas  and therefore do not infringe upon the rights of  indigenous people. A risk area from which human rights abuses may  occur is through our security personnel, which are  third party service providers to our Group.  We  manage this risk by ensuring that all our security  needs – on site and otherwise – is provided by one  service provider.  We have worked with our security  contractor for many years now and have encouraged  their management to take our requirements  seriously. As a result, they provide training to all  their security employees on all material aspects of  the law including individual and collective rights.  Their employees are also trained on basic human  rights, especially when dealing with visitors/ intruders through a formal training programme and  a performance appraisal for all their employees is  conducted annually.  On our part, we evaluate the  performance of our security service provider and  their personnel annually.   Whistle Blower Policy MRCB has established a whistle blower policy aimed  at preventing any fraud involving its stakeholders.  The policy is established to encourage both  internal and external stakeholders in reporting  misappropriation of the Groups business activities  without fear of being victimised, discriminated or  disadvantaged. The head of Corporate Governance and the  Audit Committee will be solely responsible in the  investigating and managing any report derived from  whistle blowers. The ethnic mix of our employees is a reflection of  our multi-ethnic society. In 2010, we have seen a  slight increase in the number of Chinese employees  by approximately 0.4% while our Malay employees  decreased by 1.0%. The number of Indian employees  and employees of other ethnicities has stayed nearly  the same. ethnicity % employed Malay 88.4% Chinese 6.1% Indian 3.7% Others 1.8% We wholly support the vision of our Prime Minister  in promoting the concept of 1Malaysia and practice  a system of meritocracy in our career development  and employee benefit programme. As a company  involved in a diverse business activities, we want  to attract the best and brightest of young people to  join us. We provide merit based remuneration for  our employees and we do not discriminate between  genders.    Our Company Executive Handbook lists out our  Grievance Policy and Procedures in detail for all  our employees. Fundamental to this procedure is  the belief that we need to listen to our employees  to ensure that they are well taken care of so that we  continue to grow as a business. This is of particular  importance to us given that majority of our employees  are below the age of 30. Any changes in operations or  organisation are conducted in consultation with our  managerial and supervisory employees. We reach  out to our employees through our internal newsletter  and our Employee Communication Programme  (ECP) which is conducted quarterly.  This is the forum  through which any matter pertaining to the Group is  conveyed to our employees; while giving them the  opportunity to air their views.  Participants in this  forum generally comprises of senior management  and employees.   Human Rights Our business brings us into close contact with  building contractors and a multitude of companies  who supply the necessary materials. Each of these  companies have employees, both of permanent and  contract, which all have rights as human beings.  Our policy of managing the issue of human rights  as a Group is institutionalised through our HR Policy  which extends on internal and external matters. 88.4% 6.1% 3.1% 1.8% 88.4% 6.1% 3.1% 1.8% Breakdown of Employees  by Ethinicity Malay Chinese Indian Others Age Group of Employees <30 30 to 40 40 to 50 > 50
