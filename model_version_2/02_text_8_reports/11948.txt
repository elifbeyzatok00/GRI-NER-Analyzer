Grupo Po de Acar stands  out as one of the first Brazilian companies to use it as a reference in preparing its  Sustainability Report.  6  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  > Message froM tHe cHief executive officer GRI 1.1, 1.2 The year 2010 was very positive for Grupo Po de Acar, due to a series of advances  and conquests, highlighted by the finalization of the association with Casas Bahia.  This  important transaction reaffirmed GPAs position as the largest retailing company in Latin  America, becoming one of the 10 largest companies in the world in the electronics and  appliances segment.   Notwithstanding this transaction, we have not changed our focus.  We continue to be  primarily a food distribution company, but we ensure significant balance in this mix,   lead by professionals who are specialized in each of the businesses.   This year was also marked by the restructuring of our management model.  In less  than two years, we ceased to be a multiformat company, and transformed ourselves into a  multibusiness group.  Accordingly, we find ourselves with the challenge of seeking synergies  and integrating the businesses in light of the corporate governance, while ensuring that each  keeps its specificity and expertise, to continue presenting positive results in its segment.   To be able to make this change without losing the benefits of centralized management,  we thoroughly reorganized our management model.  Guided by the idea of having the  right people in the right places, we appointed professionals dedicated to each business  and strengthened the corporate teams responsible for capturing synergies and ensuring  integration, while preserving the characteristics and identity of each segment.   Mindful of the importance of a united and cohesive team capable of overcoming  challenges and delivering the results expected of each of the businesses and activities, we  created a high performance model focused on the Groups values: humbleness; discipline;  determination and grit; and emotional balance.   In the retail food operations, some achievements are important for ensuring the  continued growth of the Group and the increasing creation of value, particularly the   process of converting the CompreBem and Sendas banners to Extra Supermercado,   which strengthens our position in this important format with broad appeal to middle   class consumers, which grew most in recent years, as well as the rationalization of brands  and the synergy of communications.   In cash-and-carry, we fomented strong organic expansion, which permitted Assa to  jump from 14 stores in 2007 to a total of 57 units at the end of 2010, and ensured robust  positioning in this segment in Brazil.   In our e-commerce operations, which culminated in the creation of Nova Pontocom   at the beginning of 2010, we have an example of a business that brings together the best   7  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  fundamentals in its segment: experienced management, a platform integrated with the  latest generation e-commerce, a broad portfolio of brands (Extra.com.br, Pontofrio.com.br  and CasasBahia.com.br) and a strong connection with the bricks-and-mortar world,   all supported by GPAs large size and outstanding logistics and IT.   The repercussions of this results-oriented posture have ensured the attainment of all  the planned guidance.  I must emphasize that the most important aspect of these numbers  is the quality of the result, which is sustainable, the fruit of work begun nearly three years  ago when we started the process of improving the gross margin through better cost  management – and we had a direct impact on the prices charged while maintaining GPA  Foods EBITDA margin.  Thus, we achieved efficiency, gained competitiveness in all formats,  and cemented an image of fair prices, which translates into client traffic and increased  average ticket.   The good times GPA enjoys also reflect positive prospects in the national environment.   Brazil is no longer just a promise.  Going forward, many factors – such as the World Cup, the  Olympics, the strength of the real estate sector, and even governmental programs – will heat  up the consumer market, which in practice means increasing purchasing power and the  arrival of more consumers in the middle class.   The favorable economic context in 2010, highlighted by the social ascension of an  important portion of the Brazilian consumer market, also had a direct positive impact on the  Groups performance.  This climb drove consumption of higher value-added products.  We have  also glimpsed a more balanced competitive market, wherein full deployment of the ICMS Excise  Tax Replacement program in several Brazilian states has attenuated the informal market.   In 2010, we also made important strides in sustainability, having included this theme  among the Groups strategic pillars, policies and guidelines with respect to sustainable  management, which represents an evolution of who we are and what we want for all our  employees, clients and chain of value.  Furthermore, we have kept our promise with the Global  Compact, seeking in our daily endeavors to consolidate fundamental values in the areas of  human rights, labor relations, environmental protection and the fight against corruption.   For 2011, we continue to be confident in the Groups growth.  It will be a year of  consolidating the Electronics business and capturing synergies from the integration of  Ponto Frio and Casas Bahia, and continuing the expansion of GPA Food.  Our outlook for  good results reflects positive expectations of the performance of the Brazilian economy, and  reaffirms our commitment to generate new jobs and contribute to the countrys growth, thus  reinforcing our PRIDE IN BEING BRAZILIAN. Enas Pestana  Chief Executive officer  8  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  > corporate profile In September 1948, Grupo Po de Acar began its history as a pioneer in the  retail food sector in Brazil.  Today, it is the largest national distribution company, with  diversified activities in several business segments: supermarkets (Po de Acar and Extra  Supermercado), hypermarkets (Extra Hipermercado), cash-and-carry (Assa), proximity (Extra  Fcil), electronics and appliances (Ponto Frio and Casas Bahia), e-commerce (Pontofrio.com.br,  Casasbahia.com.br, Extra.com.br), drugstores and gas stations. GRI 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 Headquartered in So Paulo, GPAs 1,647 stores in 20 states throughout Brazil and in   the Federal District have more than 2.8 million square meters of sales space.  These  numbers include the operations of Casas Bahia, resulting from the association finalized  in the second half of 2010 that permitted the Group to reaffirm its position as the largest  retail company in Latin America and become the largest private employer in the country,  with approximately 145,000 employees*. GRI 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.6  In 2010, gross sales from all formats operated by the Group, including Casas Bahia  (which has been consolidated as of November 2010), totaled R$36.1 billion.  Over the  course of the year, 41 stores were inaugurated and 526 units of Casas Bahia were added,  representing sales area growth of 61.1% compared to 2009. GRI 2.8, 2.9  Control of Grupo Po de Acar is shared with the second largest retail company in  France, the Casino Group, in a strategic partnership initiated in 1999 that ensures an  interchange of know-how and synergies between important areas like global sourcing   and exclusive brands.  GPAs shares have been listed on the Bovespa since October 1995,   and its Level III ADR program has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since   May 1997. GRI 2.3, 2.8 In 2010, GPA took important steps in strengthening its socioenvironmental efforts,  developing and establishing sustainability policies and guidelines, which have been  disseminated Company-wide.  In furtherance of its efforts to promote sustainability,   it inaugurated the first Green Distribution Center, in Braslia, where it was able to   apply effective practices to rationalize the use of water and electricity. GRI 2.9 The Group also acts directly or through associations that represent the supermarket  sector, such as the Associao Brasileira de supermercados (Abras), the federao   do Comrcio de Bens, servios e Turismo do Estado de so Paulo (Fecomrcio)   and the Associao Paulista de supermercados (Apas).

Over the course of the year,  approximately 20 workshops with the CEO,  officers and managers were held focusing  on training and raising the consciousness  of the leadership.  The goal is to expand  this process to all employees in 2011. In 2010, the Group also advanced  in its socioenvironmental activities,  by including Sustainability as another  strategic pillar for the business, and setting  sustainability policies and guidelines.   This new push represents an evolution  in what the Company is and wants to be  for its customers, and is aligned with the  Companys four pillars that sustain its  reason for being: the customer. > Mission   Guarantee the best buying experience for  all our customers, at each of our stores.

To accommodate this change,  without losing the benefit of centralized  management, responsible parties were  named for each business (Retail, Cash-and- carry, Specialized Businesses, Electronics  and Appliances and E-commerce) and so- called corporate departments were created  (Market Strategy; Commercial Strategy;  Corporate Relations; Supply Chain;   Corporate Services, Finance and IT; and  People and Management), which became  responsible for capturing synergies and  assuring integration, while preserving the  characteristics and identity of each business.   In this new model, the highlights were  the creation of two new departments:  Corporate Relations, which encompasses  the areas of investor relations,  sustainability and PA Publicidade,  responsible for the graphic project of  this report; and Market Strategy, which  is responsible for coordinating the  Groups strategy and monitoring it by  business.  Moreover, the human resources  department was renamed People and  Management, becoming responsible for  managing the performance indicators   of the Companys employees.

Toward this end, a high performance model  capable of providing for the Groups new  strategic positioning was created.  It starts with having the right people in  the right place, which, with the adoption  of a management model, of roles and  responsibilities and an organizational  structure, result in focused leadership,  with the proper tools, which are technical  knowledge and method.   Next, the Groups processes for  fostering client satisfaction, and thus  the satisfaction of our people and the  society and, in the end, our shareholders,  is highlighted, which cycles through in  returns and business growth.  There is a  feedback loop: to attain the results and  shareholder satisfaction, new guidelines  and goals are established.  And all this is  done in a happy environment, which is part  of the Groups DNA.   In this context, the variable  compensation system, which ratifies the  Groups meritocracy, was improved by  clear weighting and balancing between  individual and collective indicators.  19  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  > investMents  GPA invested R$1,191.2 million in 2010,  an increase of 64.7% compared to 2009  (R$723.1 million).

Capex of up to 2.0% of net revenue. > strategic axes  The change in the positioning of GPA,  which ceased to be a multiformat company  to quicken as a multibusiness group,  was also decisive in defining the Groups  strategy of pursuing absolute leadership in  the Brazilian retail market.   This orientation is the fruit of GPAs  Annual Strategic Planning Cycle, with  the direct and active participation of the  Board of Executive Officers and of the  Executive Committee, which includes the  main external shareholders and directors.   This cycle starts with the definition of  guidelines for growth and return for the  next three years.  From there, strategic axes  are defined, toward complying with the  guidelines established by the shareholders  and reinforcing the Companys Mission   and Vision.  They include:  Retail food  Expand the percentage of foods in   the Groups portfolio and maintain   the lead ranking of the Abras  (Associao Brasileira de supermercados).   Integrated diversification  Invest in non-food businesses to  synergistically leverage retail food.   Virtual channels Lead the e-commerce business.  Real estate businesses   Sustain GPAs growth and generate value  through leveraging real estate assets.  Sustainability   Be recognized as an agent for change  in educating Brazilian society on  sustainability matters.  21  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report   > coMpetitive advantages  A significant part of the value of Grupo  Po de Acar is in its intangible attributes  that, although they cannot be measured,  are perceived by a variety of strategic  constituencies as important competitive  differentials that contribute to attaining   the Companys strategic goals. Financeira Ita CBD, or FIC Due to the characteristics of the  business, which brings together two  large partners (GPA and Ita Unibanco),  which in turn contribute technology and  expertise in their respective areas (retail  and financial services), FIC has gelled as an  important competitive advantage for the  Group, with significant growth potential  and the capacity to attract and produce  loyal clients.   The operations numbers in 2010  reinforce this positioning: 14.0% of the  Groups sales, 7.8 million clients and  revenue of R$47.4 million, compared to  R$17.6 million recorded in 2009.   One of the highlights of the year was  incorporating Banco Investcred (Globexs  finance arm), which unified four platforms  into a single system, with the challenge  of maintaining the level of services and  products for consumers, and permitted FIC  to attain positive results through actions  developed in Ponto Frio stores, where the  financing unit accounts for 22.6% of sales. During the year, teams dedicated to  meeting the demands and particularities  of each business were constituted and  began to operate in the e-commerce,  electronics and appliances (Ponto  Frio), hypermarket, cash-and-carry and  supermarket (Extra Supermercado)  businesses, developing specific actions   and creating exclusive benefits for clients. Supply chain Centralization potential of 85%, capacity  to support the Groups growth and to  administer the predictability of existing  demand along the chain, adjusting the  assortment appropriate for each cluster  and for each banner.  These are some of the  characteristics that make the supply chain  one of GPAs main competitive advantages.   In 2010, there was significant progress  in expanding area, which will support the  Companys growth through mid-2012,  with the inauguration of seven distribution  centers: one DC with 40,000 square meters  in So Paulo (Ring road - Rodoanel); two  seafood operations, one in Rio de Janeiro  and the other in So Paulo (Ring road  – Rodoanel); two DCs dedicated to cash- and-carry operations (Assa); unification  of three existing operations in Braslia into  a single DC; and one for perishables in Rio  de Janeiro.  As of 2011, the strategy is to  review the logistics network for the entire  Group, covering all businesses, optimizing  the points in common, while assuring the  specificities of each business.   In seeking productivity gains, the  Company invested in technological advances,  using a radio signal in the course of  departing from the DCs, which has increased  accuracy, certainty and productivity.    22  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  During the year, there were also  advances in the distribution and  productivity platforms, due to the  implementation of a new system and  adoption of Oracle – Retail, which were  fundamental in the advance of the ERP in  the demand management platform.  In  2011, with the inauguration of the supply  module, the expectation is to capture gains  by reducing breakage and working capital. IT Mastery of technology is one of the  pillars of Grupo Po de Acar, which  invests constantly in IT initiatives.  In  2010, the Company was oriented toward  the continuity of the projects initiated  in 2009, highlighted by the conclusion  of Oracle – Retail, the Companys largest  investment in technology in recent  years.  All the stages of deployment were  finalized during the year and the roll-out,  by category, to all the stores and DCs will  commence in 2011.  With the application  of this supply tool, the expectation is to  appreciably reduce the levels of inventory  and breakage in the stores, optimizing  the work of employees (since statistical  calculations and adjustments in requests  will be done automatically) and consumer  perception in relation to the lack of  products on the shelves.   The other initiatives developed during  the year were:   SAP – Began operating in all areas  of GPAs financial back-office.  Since the  strategy is that SAP will be the platform  for integrating all the companies in  the Group, as of 2011, the system will  be expanded to the other companies,  starting with Assa and then Globex  (with the integration of Ponto Frio and  Casas Bahia being complete).  Among the  benefits of adopting a single platform,  the following stand out: better control,  integrity, and the uniformity of processes  among the companies.  DemandTec – The tool was deployed  at all of the Companys supermarkets,  hypermarkets and proximity retail outlets,  with the expected results: DemandTec   was fundamental to facilitating the   studies of price elasticity for many of the  products sold, and thus made it possible   to maximize the supply at the best price  and an improved margin.  Datacenter – During the year, the process  of outsourcing the Groups datacenter,  which started in 2009, was concluded.  Citrix – The prerequisites for deploying  Citrix, a technology that replaces the  desktop and is highlighted by lower   energy consumption and heat generation,  were reviewed during the year, and is  envisioned for future deployment.   23  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Personal shopper – The project, in   which clients themselves use a scanner   to purchase products without going   by the register, was expanded to two   Po de Acar stores in 2010.  Electronic labels – The project, which  provides for deploying electronic price tags  on the shelves, was deployed in two Extra  Hipermercado stores and one Po de Acar  store during the year, facilitating greater  flexibility in these stores commercial  strategy, by adding dynamism to the  lightning promotions and offers of the   day, among other advantages. Exclusive brands In constantly seeking to build customer  loyalty, Grupo Po de Acar has bet on  the so-called transversal exclusive brands  (present under all the banners) that carry  the guarantee and exclusivity of the Group,  and thus have become an important  competitive advantage, reinforcing the  Companys image and increasing the  profitability of sales.  In 2010, more than  400 products under the Groups exclusive  brands, like Taeq, Qualit, Casino and  Club des Sommeliers, among others, were  launched. In 2010, the sale of exclusive  brands accounted for 6.9% of the Groups  total supermarket and hypermarket sales. Taeq – Present in 3.3% of all the  Companys sale tickets during the year,  Taeq – which now has more than 1,000  items focused principally on foods and  textiles – added more than 40 new  products in 17 separate projects, as well  as Taeq Sports Spring/Summer and Fall/ Winter collections, which each has more  than 50 new items.  Among the launches,  highlights include zero gelatins; quinoa  flours, flakes, and cookies; filled cereal bars,  light cream cheese, and a variety of new  organic products.  For 2011, the objective  is to attain the threshold of approximately  15% sale growth, with gains in margin. Qualit – Sales under the Qualit   brand grew 30%.  Over the course of the  year, new product categories like cookware,  utensils for barbequing, organizer boxes,  accessories for cleaning clothes and poles  were introduced.  Casino – With 14.7% of the section for  imported products, sales of the exclusive  brand of the French partner Casino grew  34.6% compared to 2009.   24  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Club des Sommeliers – The Club des  Sommeliers wine brand increased 24%  compared to 2009, closing the year   with 13.3% of the wine category.  Global sourcing GPAs strategic positioning in global  sourcing has strengthened from year  to year.  With expertise in international  negotiation strategies, the department  focuses on developing international  suppliers and unique products that bring  value and profitability, increasing the  Groups competitiveness.   In 2010, import and export volumes  totaled US$269.3 million and US$10.5  million, respectively, growing 52.1%  and 23.5% compared to 2009.  Besides  the increase in the export index, which  remained above Brazilian exports, one of  the highlights was the cementing of GPAs  image as a provider of unique products at  competitive prices. During the year, the Group continued  to look worldwide for unique and exclusive  articles at prices to attract consumers  and compete in the retail market.  The  synergy with Casino was intensified by  the increase in the volume of the entire  existing line and by the introduction of  lines for salads, pastas, seasonal products  for Christmas and the Casino Dlice line,  with premium positioning. Among the variety of initiatives  employed in 2010, highlights included: in- and-out actions for promotional products;  battling the competition during the  seasons for Childrens Day and Christmas;  exclusive imports like toys; negotiation  with the Inter-American Development  Bank for international freight for all the  operations of the year.   Knowledge of the consumer The knowledge GPA has acquired  over the years regarding its consumers,  whether through surveys or internal  studies, is one of the Groups intangible  assets, which stands out in a retail  segment that is traditionally marked by  more empirical and less analytical activity.   In 2010, a survey on knowledge of the  cultures and habits of the regions where  the Company is active was conducted,  which contributed to updating the stores  to fit the regional client profile.  Another  highlight was the partnership signed with  Dunnhumby, a company specializing in  marketing solutions for consumer goods,  which gave GPA access to the most up-to- date concepts of management intelligence  in global retail. Consumers were also polled for their  opinions, including more than 715,000  clients surveyed in 16,000 quantitative  interviews, more than 700,000 approaches  in stores, close to 100 in-depth qualitative  interviews and 77 focus groups.  Analyzing  receipts also provides knowledge about  clients and sales conditions.  This year,  more than 541 million receipts issued   by the Group were studied. PR 5.  25  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  The Programa mais gained an  important channel for Po de Acar  clients, with the launch of a website  where they can register, update their data,  monitor and/or redeem their points by  exchanging them for shopping vouchers.   In 2010 alone, more than 219,000 points  were redeemed, totaling R$13.5 million  in vouchers used in Po de Acar stores.   Other program highlights during the year  included registering 170,000 new clients;  increasing the active client base by 13%; and  the 49.1% share of sales under the banner. Human capital GPAs employees constitute one of its  strategic pillars.  The Company employs  professionals with recognized experience  in each segment, while encouraging a  diversified and harmonious corporate  culture formed by people from diverse races,  religions and ethnicities.   To conserve this patrimony, the Group  invests continuously in technical and  behavioral training for its teams, promoting  employee access to technologies and  processes that aid in individual and  collective development. In 2010, embracing the new  centralized management model involved  reviewing the roles and responsibilities of  leadership, which, beyond the significant  importance of running the business, also  became responsible for Company-wide  dissemination of the Groups values.   Brand Grupo Po de Acars 63 years  of tradition is a strategic factor that  strengthens the Companys image and  functions as an important driver in its  expansion process.  Add to this the various  brands in the Groups portfolio, each with  a significant share in their respective  segments: Po de Acar (neighborhood  supermarket, focused on the upper and  upper-middle classes), Extra (umbrella brand  covering a variety of formats and types of  businesses), Assa (cash-and-carry), Ponto  Frio (electronics and appliance stores for the  upper- and upper-middle classes) and Casas  Bahia (electronics and appliance stores for  the lower-middle and poor classes).   Sustainability  Since it is integrated in managing the  business, sustainability – which is one  of the Groups strategic axes – is one of  GPAs important intangible assets.  As of  2010, with the definition of sustainability  policies and guidelines and the inclusion  of the theme as another strategic pillar  of the business, the Group redoubled its  efforts in this area.   As one of GPAs pillars, sustainability  involves understanding the economic,  social and environmental impacts on its  stakeholders, as well as adopting programs,  projects, practices and actions that  ensure and enable the balance of these  three aspects in the present and in the  future.  This new orientation represents  an evolution of what the Company is, and  what it wants to be for it stakeholders.  26 our   governance  27  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  our   governance > gpas corporate governance Model  GRuPo Po DE ACAR hAs ADoPTED A CoRPoRATE GovERNANCE moDEl GuIDED   By AGIlE AND suRE DIsClosuRE, A CommITmENT To ThE CAPITAl mARkET,   AND REsPECT foR shAREholDERs AND INvEsToRs.

Since  2003, it has maintained a working group  that analyzes the internal procedures  and controls that could affect the  Companys results.  This team is advised  by external consultants and integrates key  employees from a variety of the Companys  departments.  Actions focus on evaluating  any risks and irregular situations, which   are addressed with specific action plans   to improve the internal processes. > operating risks  Product The safety of the food sold in GPA stores  is ensured by a series of initiatives, from  certifying all suppliers of perishables, to  transporting and storing these products  in cold rooms with total temperature  and humidity control.  The Quality  Control Departments team is focused  on qualifying and developing several  kinds of suppliers, and conducted 256  evaluations, 1,983 lot inspections in  the countries of origin and more than  2,200 - microbiological and physio- chemical analyses in external labs in  2010.  Furthermore, the Group is the only  retailer to have an agreement with the  Biological Institute of the University of So  Paulo (Instituto Biolgico da universidade  de so Paulo), which attests to the quality  and origin of the fruits and vegetables  furnished by its main base of suppliers.   This precaution is also reinforced in the  product lines of exclusive brands, which  have a rigorous system for qualifying   and approving suppliers.  In 2010, close   to 200 audits and 460 consumer taste   tests were conducted. GRI PR1 Market To protect the performance of its sales  from the effects of the highly competitive  market and oscillations in the national  economy, GPA has some differentials  that allow it to overcome these risks:  the multibusiness structure, which  permits attention to different consumer  demands; the pricing policy with national  negotiations and greater autonomy in  the regions; a broad distribution network,  which ensures agility and efficiency;  economies of scale, which entails better  negotiating conditions; a diversified line   of products sold under exclusive brands;  and outstanding client service. > independent auditor  As required by the Brazilian Securities  Commission (CVM), GPA has adopted a  system for rotating independent auditors  every five years.  The Financial Statements  as of and for 2010 were audited by Ernst   & Young Terco.  33  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  > financial risks Credit and defaults GPA is not directly exposed to credit  risks: installment sales are effected  through third-party cards (without credit  risk for the Group) or cards issued by FIC,  the joint venture with Ita Unibanco,  which administers the company and uses  its own models to analyze and grant credit.   One of these tools is the RAROC (Risk- Adjusted Return On Capital), which permits  adjustments to the risk of conceding credit.   The performance of the FIC credit card is  among the best of Ita Unibancos cards. Liquidity At GPA, fundraising and the use of  proceeds follow the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  guidelines, with control of the maximum  permitted leverage, prohibitions on  exchange rate risks and maintenance of  elevated cash reserves invested in Brazils  largest financial institutions with proven  strength, with daily liquidity and rates as  a percentage of the overnight interbank  deposit rate (CDI). Credit card receivable securitizations and  some client food vouchers are funded by  the Po de Acar fundo de Investimentos  em Direitos Creditrios (PAFIDC), with set  conditions through December 2012.   The expectation is to maintain or lengthen  the Groups debt profile during 2011.  Technological Mastery of technology is one of the  pillars of GPA, which invests in updating  and modernizing its technological  infrastructure to maximize returns and  control the business various operations.   The continuity of this complex process in  stores and offices is buttressed by back-up  infrastructure capable of maintaining fully  functioning technological operations even  when there is a breakdown.  Structural Besides maintaining insurance coverage  for its installations and equipment, the  Group continuously monitors the condition  of each unit, with strict control of all  operations.  The physical safety of clients  and employees in the stores is assured  by an Engineering Risks department  responsible for identifying possible risks  and prioritizing actions to mitigate them.   Specialized companies also conduct  inspections each 18-24 months and  corrective and preventive actions are  taken based on their reports.  GPA also has  a Preventive Maintenance department,  which covers all the store equipment.  34  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Indebtedness The Groups consolidated net debt in  2010 was R$1,253.4 million and the ratio  of net debt/EBITDA reached 0.6x, less than  1x EBITDA, and in line with the leverage  permitted by Company policies. The funds are obtained through capital  market operations such as debenture  issuances and securitizations, or through  bank loans in reais, with interest rates  pegged to the overnight interbank deposit  rate (DI); financings in foreign currency,  fully hedged by swap transactions for  reais and interest rates pegged to DI;  and financings from the Banco Nacional  de Desenvolvimento Econmico e social  (BNDES), of which part is in reais and part  pegged to a basket of foreign currencies  (also hedged by swap contracts for reais/ CDI), plus annual interest.  The Groups total gross debt without  FIDC increased from R$3.0 billion at  December 31, 2009 to R$4.7 billion  at the end of 2010, primarily due to  investments over the year in Ponto Frio in  order to improve its operations and equity  situation, and the increased opening of  retail food stores. Exchange rate GPA is not exposed to exchange rate  risks and does not arbitrage in its debt  transactions or financial investments. All  transactions are effected in reais (R$) or are  fully hedged by swap contracts for real/CDI.  35 our econoMic-   operational perforMance  36  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  our econoMic-   operational perforMance THE FAVORABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT SEEN IN 2010, HIGHLIGHTED   BY THE RISE OF THE BRAZILIAN CONSUMER MARKET, HAD A DIRECT POSITIVE   IMPACT ON THE GROUPS BUSINESSES. The middle classes (categories B and C),  which in 2001 represented 48.5% of Brazils  population, expanded to 74.2% in 2009.   Consequently, the percentage classified  as poor (class D) diminished from 33.8%  to 19.5% over the same period, and class E  nearly vanished, falling from 13.2% to 1.8%. This shift was also significant in relation  to the total volume of income, which has  increased more than 40% over eight years,  from R$976 billion in 2002 to R$1.38 trillion  in 2010.  The lower-middle class (class  C), which was the second largest with  28% of all income, rose in 2010 to 31%, or  R$428 billion of all income available for  consumption.  At the same time, class D  jumped from 15% to 28%, reaching R$330  billion of disposable income.   This social migration reinforces  consumption of higher-value-added  products, and in the case of the lower  income groups, its first access to  computers, freezers, new furniture,  yogurts, household appliances,    flat-screen TVs, among other products.   Present for more than 60 years in the  lives of Brazilians, GPA closely followed  this recovery, which had a direct impact  on sales and contributed to the increasing  basket of purchases by consumers,  strengthening the average ticket resulting  from greater acquisition of leading  products and brands.   > sales perforMance In light of the social ascension of the  Brazilian consumer, GPA recorded gross  sales growth of 37.9% and net sales  growth of 38.0% compared to 2009; gross  sales totaled R$36.1 billion and net sales  totaled R$32.1 billion. Same-store gross sales increased 12.1%  in the year, or a real increase of 6.4%  when deflated by the IPCA consumer price  index.  Same-store net sales increased  13.2%.  On a same-store basis, food  products grew 9.3% over 2009, and   non-food sales grew 10.2%.    37  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  With rising market shares in a number  of food and non-food categories, the year  was particularly positive for food sales,  which recorded double-digit growth,  above the market average.  The highlight  was the increased consumption in  certain categories, like complementary  perishables (yogurts, cheeses), as well as  for high-value-added products, imports  and exclusive brands.  A reflection of the  entrance of new consumers in the market,  the experimentation also marked presence,  contributing to the good sales performance.  The fruit of the business model adopted  in 2008, the Group has remained focused  on the strategic pillars that generate sales  (assortment, pricing, communication  and client services), with evolution in the  supply, updated assortment, clustering,  competitive pricing policy, store display  (the strategy of enchanting the client) and  strong activity in promotions.   The Groups positive performance  in the year was also influenced by the  following factors:    Improved assortment of merchandise  – particularly with the global  sourcing of products for the general  merchandise.   Repositioning of textiles – assortment  appropriate for each region, with 20%  growth in the category.     Remodeling stores in the  hypermarkets – more practical new  layouts with greater product visibility.   All the stores remodeled in 2010 now  have this new layout, which will be  continued in 2011.   Electronics and appliances – better  display, more interactivity with the  consumer and investment in the  sales team.   Credit – better control over the cost  of granting credit.  Evolution in the  balance of better credit extension  and lower cost to the client.  Creation  of differentials for the FIC (joint  venture with Banco Ita) card, to  strengthen the base and build client  loyalty through the card, offering the  best practices for granting credit and  becoming the best financing option   in the Groups stores.   Redefinition of the supermarket  model – conversion of the Sendas  and CompreBem banners to Extra  Supermercado, not only to pursue  synergy with the Extra brand (like  reduced communications costs,  etc.), but also to attend to the new  consumption habits of classes C   and D.  The big trend is in updating   the store: stores with strong presence  in the refrigerated area (perishables),   better environment, comfort.  38  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  >  perforMance of tHe  businesses Supermarkets  For the fourth consecutive  year, the Po de Acar banner  maintained sales growth,  closing 2010 with gross sales of R$4,762.1  million, 13.2% higher than in 2009.   This performance is mainly due to the  policy of regular prices with little variation  from day to day and close to the average  charged by the competition, and also to  the constant challenge of maintaining and  guaranteeing the quality of client service  that is characteristic of the banner.   So that the excellence in service is not  diminished over time, Po de Acar runs  a training program for new employees,  and promotes on-going training for its  team, enhanced by actions encouraging  knowledge of the products in the Po de  Acar Way of Being and Serving program,  with the efforts of the Store Committees  formed by the employees themselves.   Other actions also contribute to the  good performance of the brand, such  as the launch of the magazine Po de  Acar mais as an exclusive vehicle for  200,000 clients of the banners relationship  program and the development of the PA  Delivery Mobile, with strong acceptance  and use by iPhone and iPad users.   39  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  In 2010, the process of  consolidating Extra as an  umbrella brand continued;  Extra covers a variety of formats and types  of business, including supermarkets.   Redefi ning the model was focused on  converting Sendas and CompreBem stores  to Extra Supermercado, to pursue synergies  with the Extra brand, such as reduced  costs for communication, marketing,  etc.  Another point in the evolution was  updating the stores to meet customer  demand for stores with strong presence in  the refrigerated area (perishables), a more  pleasant environment, and more comfort.   More than 80 stores were converted  during the year, and the expectation is that,  by the end of 2011, the conversion process  will be done, with the consolidation of this  close-by and convenient format supported  by the force of the Extra brand, focused on  prices and promotions. Hypermarkets The performance of Extra  Hipermercado was marked by  gaining market share and by  strengthening the main characteristics  of the format: its strength in promotions  (especially on Wednesdays and weekends),  seasonal events (Easter, World Cup,  Anniversary and Christmas) and the robust  sales performance of non-food products  throughout Brazil.   The continuous focus on  competitiveness, with promotional and  regular prices, was one of the main tools  setting it apart in the year, and that  assured signifi cant gains in market share.   In 2010, 24 stores were remodeled and  adapted to the new layout marked by the  more practical and visible assortment, and  this will continue in 2011.  The year was  also positive with respect to shrinkage,  reversing a negative trend and involving  changes in management control of internal  and accounting procedures, as well as  inventory management.  40  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Proximity The expansion of the  Extra Fcil model, which had been planned  for 2010, was postponed due to the  development of a process for repositioning  the stores, to adapt them to the new  consumer needs.   During the year, the product mix was  updated, emphasizing daily purchases like  breads, meats, and cold items.  The new  model was tested at six pilot stores, and in  light of the results, the expectation is that the  expansion process will resume in 2011/2012. Cash-and-Carry  In line with the restructuring  of the Groups management  model, the Assa banner  became a business in 2010, with a focus  on the cash-and-carry segment.  Sales rose  48.2% compared to 2009, highlighted by  the 18% increase in same-store sales.   During the year, 17 stores were  inaugurated, raising the total number to  57, highlighted by Assas entry into Braslia  and new states: Tocantins, Goinia and  Pernambuco.  The geographic growth,  focusing on regions other than So Paulo  state, attends to GPAs strategic premise of  cementing the brand as one method for  expanding the Group.   The process of capturing synergies  continued, with robust gains in expansion  work and logistics, which now has  dedicated distribution operated by GPA.   The inauguration of a new DC with 20,000  square meters of space also contributed to  assuring better productivity and reduced  shrinkage in the stores.   At fi rst, centralizing distribution  contributed to automated processes and  attendance to the stores.  The second  phase envisions adapting the operation  to the wholesale model, concentrating in  the DC only higher-value-added products,  whose logistical costs do not prevent their  distribution.  Less valuable items continue  to be delivered directly at the stores.   41  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  With the hiring at the end of the year of  an executive from the market specializing  in attending to other segments of the  cash-and-carry market, Assas business  model will be reformulated in 2011, with  the objective of expanding the activity of  the brand among resellers and users.   Electronics and appliances  Globex  For Globex, 2010 was  marked by two main  events: the incipient integration of the  operations of Ponto Frio, in July; and the  fi nalization of the association with Casas  Bahia, in November.   Initiated in the second half of the  year, the integration process covered the  departments for logistics, IT, commerce  (which includes marketing, purchase and  sales) and operations, which fed back  into results, sales growth and signifi cant  performance in regions where the brand  was already the leader, like Rio de Janeiro  and Minas Gerais.  In the same period,  Ponto Frios logistical and furniture assembly  structure came to be managed by Casas  Bahia, with signifi cant gains in quality.   The integration is being realized with a  focus on identifying the best practices and  processes of both companies.  There is no  paradigm.  The idea is to create something  new with the best of each business, in all  areas.  Besides ensuring compliance with  the provisional operating permit (Acordo  Provisrio de Reversibilidade da operao –  APRO) executed with the Brazilian antitrust  authority (Conselho Administrativo de  Defesa Econmica – CADE), the objective is  to take advantage of synergies, with correct  decision making, which do not affect  customer service.    42  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Toward this end, a Project Management  Office was created with the participation  of market consultants, responsible for  planning, executing, controlling and  finalizing integration projects, in a variety  of specialty areas.  In 2010, initiatives  on three fronts were implemented:  negotiation with suppliers, store operation,  and store marketing.  The actions focus on  quick wins, but with the customer first.  In  relation to GPA, the main synergies to be  captured are in the commercial, operations  (back office: logistics, IT, HR, maintenance,  etc.) and marketing departments.   Among the main initiatives promoted  during the year, highlights included the  following:    conversion of 44 stores from   Extra Eletro to Ponto Frio;   inauguration of a Ponto Frio concept  store and conversion of a standard  store to a concept store;   updating Ponto Frios marketing to the  Casas Bahia positioning model;   rebalancing the Ponto Frio product mix;   integrating the sales force for both  brands;   opening a Casas Bahia store in Sergipe  and inaugurating a DC in Camaari  (BA), to serve the Northeast region.    43  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  In 2011, the focus will be on the  continuity of capturing synergies and  cementing the brand positioning for Ponto  Frio (stores in shopping centers oriented  towards the upper and upper-middle  classes) and Casas Bahia (stores on the  street focused on the lower-middle class   on down), in their respective market niches. E-commerce In line with the strategic positioning of  expanding the share of sales of electronics  and appliances via e-commerce, GPA  consolidated its e-commerce operations   by creating a new company called   Nova Pontocom.   Besides maintaining operations focused   exclusively on virtual sales, the main differentials  at the new company are: a better portfolio   of brands (Extra.com.br, PontoFrio.com.br  and CasasBahia.com.br), leading group of the  market in the rearguard; people and business  model; technological platform; marketing  synergies, commercial conditions and gains  with the bricks-and-mortar; and exploration  of multiple channels.   The beginning of the year was marked by  the unification of the operations of Extra.com.br   and PontoFrio.com.br, which three months  later (in April), were completely integrated.   In November, upon the finalization of the  corporate agreement between GPA and Casas  Bahia, the challenge was to integrate, in record  time, the operations of CasasBahia.com.br,  which in December were fully integrated  into the new company.   In practice, this means that the three  operations use a single technological,  logistics and personnel platform, which  assures synergistic gains, cost reductions,  better commercial conditions, an  outstanding assortment, and permits  operations focused on meeting the  demands and characteristics specific   to e-commerce.   One of the main highlights of Nova  Pontocom in its first months of operation  is that the company was able to absorb the  new operations in record time, maintaining  sales growth, gains in profitability and  EBITDA margin (which reached the same  level as the bricks-and-mortar), closing   2010 with significant numbers:   215 million visits, not including  CasasBahia.com.br    3.5 million requests approved   (1.1 million in 2009)    Growth of 70%, with gains in market  share, even as the market grew 40%   Annualized revenue (on a comparable  basis) of R$2.7 billion, which represents  7% of the Groups gross sales.  44  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Specialized businesses Drugstores To cement its positioning as one of  the largest operators of drugstores in  Brazilian retail food, GPA promoted a  series of changes in the format during  the year.  The results of a study on the  operation showed the necessity of  expanding the average size of the stores,  to include perfume items in the product  mix.  Thus, 17 stores were inaugurated  and another 17 units were remodeled,  and each now has a larger sales area   and a new mix of perfumes.   Gas Stations With its fuel station operations, GPA  reinforced its market positioning with  81 units with important competitive  advantages: a trustworthy brand, better  bargaining with distributors, the best  regional prices, transfer of the low-price  image to the store, increased client flow  and security.   The highlight for the period was  the expanded supply of products and  services offered in this format, which  until last year was only focused on  selling fuel.  Currently, the chain offers  clients complementary first need  products, like lubricants, additives,  flavorings, ice and coal.   GPA Malls & Properties With a little more than one year  of operations, GPA Malls & Properties  continued its strategy of facilitating  the Groups growth through real estate  development.   To ensure greater profitability,   it kept its focus on the sweat-the-assets  concept, launching three real estate  developments (So Paulo, Guarulhos and  Santo Andr), which will be presented to  the market in 2011.   Also under the administration of  GPA Malls & Properties, the number of  contracts for commercial spaces installed  in the Groups stores increased 3.3%  compared to 2009.  45  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  >  econoMic-financial  perforMance (Md&a)  Gross sales In 2010, Grupo Po de Acars gross  sales totaled R$36,144.4 million, an  increase of 37.9% over 2009 – achieving  the guidance of revenue in excess of R$33  billion.  Even excluding Nova Casas Bahia  operations, gross sales reached R$33,172.1  million, an increase of 26.5% over 2009.   Net sales reached R$32,091.7 million in  the year, an increase of 38.0% over 2009.   Excluding Nova Casas Bahia, net sales  totaled R$29,644.0 million, an increase   of 27.5% over 2009.   On a same-store basis, gross sales  increased 12.1% in relation to 2009 and  6.4% in real terms (i.e., deflated by the  IPCA price index).  This performance  exceeded the guidance for real sales  growth of 4-5% that was announced at  the beginning of the year.  Nominal same- store net sales increased 13.2% compared  to the prior year. Indirect Purchase Center (CCI) Since 2007, the Group has had  an Indirect Purchase Center, which  administers the processes of buying and  contracting services and products that  are not for sale (office materials, cleaning  and security services, telephone, health  plans, etc.).   Besides being realized more rationally,  without duplication of tasks and with  greater productivity, the centralization  permits synergistic gains, cost reductions  and better conditions with the suppliers,  due to the Groups bargaining power.   Responsible for total businesses with  a value above R$1 billion, the Indirect  Purchase Center is being structured to  operate as an independent business  offering services to clients other than  GPAs internal departments. Gross Sales (R$ millions) 16,460 2006 17,643 2007 20,857 2008 26,219 2009 36,144 2010  46  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Net sales revenue Net sales revenue increased 38.0%, from  R$23,250.3 million in 2009 to R$32,091.7  million in 2010.   Among the factors that contributed  to this increase, highlights include: the  opening of 47 stores and conversion of  93 CompreBem and Sendas stores; the  acquisition in July 2009 of Ponto Frio, whose  revenue was fully consolidated in 2010;  and the association in December 2010 with  Casas Bahia, whose revenue for the last two  months was consolidated in the year. Net Sales (R$ millions) 13,880 2006 14,903 2007 18,033 2008 23,250 2009 32,092 2010 Gross Profit (R$ millions) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 7,850 5,756 4,754 4,178 3,917 24.5% 24.8% 26.4% 28.0% 28.2% GROSS PROFIT GROSS MARGIN Gross profit  Gross profit increased 36.4% to  R$7,850.2 million in 2010, with gross  margin of 24.5%.  This performance  was attained principally due to  better negotiations with suppliers;  improved commercial and operational  management; and application of the  DemandTec pricing management tool.   One of the highlights is that this gross  margin was achieved despite the increased  share in the product mix of electronics,  which have lower margins than food.   47  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Operating expenses  The Groups total operating expenses  increased 36.0%, from R$4,252.4 million  in 2009 to R$5,782.1 million in 2010, due  to the increase in personnel expense and  payroll charges; the increase in IT expenses  to support expansion; and 47 new stores  inaugurated during the year.   As a percentage of net sales, expenses  decreased 30 basis points as compared to  the prior year, to 18.0% in 2010.   EBITDA (R$ millions) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2,068 1,504 1,323 992 886 6.4% 6.5% 7.3% 6.7% 6.4% EBITDA EBITDA MARGIN EBITDA  In 2010, EBITDA was R$2,068.1 million,  with EBITDA margin of 6.4%.  EBITDA  without Nova Casas Bahia was R$1,972.0  million, above the 2010 guidance  presented at the beginning of the year to  exceed EBITDA of R$1.8 billion. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization  decreased 3.4%, from R$455.5 million in  2009 to R$440.1 million in 2010, mainly  due to application of the International  Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),   which increased the estimated useful   life of property and equipment from   30 years to 40 years. In 2010, with the adoption of the IFRS  for some fixed assets, the respective useful  lives were extended.  Thus, consolidated  depreciation totaled R$440.1 million, a  decrease of 2.2% compared to 2009.   48  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Financial revenues/expenses The net financial expense increased  227.7%, from R$251.2 million in 2009  to R$823.0 million in 2010, due to the  following factors: increased debt to  finance the growth of the business;  increased discounting of receivables due to  the growth of the business; and indexing  other liabilities and assets to CDI. Furthermore, in 2010, the Group had  Globexs non-recurring expense of R$68.0  million due to the change in criteria  for recognizing the cost of discounting  receivables, which is now recognized in  the month of the discount. Net debt in particular increased in  the last quarter of the year, mainly due  to extraordinary investments, like R$313  million in acquisitions, including R$290  million to capitalize Globex; R$186  million in investments to expand Assa;  and close to R$348 million of interest   on existing and unamortized debt.  Operating result The operating result increased  55.2%, from R$1,049.0 million in 2009  to R$1,627.9 million in 2010, largely due  to a 38.0% increase in net sales revenue,  and control of expenses to a lower level  than revenues. Income tax The income tax expense increased from  R$28.6 million in 2009 to R$86.6 million  in 2010, primarily due to the impact  of deferred taxes on the adjustments  needed in adopting the accounting  pronouncements of the Brazilian  Accounting Pronouncements Committee  (Comit de Pronunciamentos Contbeis),   or CPCs. Net income  For the reasons described above, GPAs  net income increased 12.1%, from R$644.7  million in 2009 to R$722.4 million in 2010.

These resources  were distributed as follows:    Personnel: 36.4% (R$2,603 million) –  for compensation for labor, with the  generation of jobs and investments  in training.   Taxes: 27.8% (R$1,985 million) – for  payments to the government, through  taxes, fees and contributions;   Financers: 26.1% (R$1,870 million)  – to compensate banks through  the payment of interest on loans;  the government by updating tax  installments and contingencies; and  lessors, through the payment of rent;   Shareholders: 9.7% (R$692 million)  – in retained amounts, which were  incorporated into shareholders equity.  50  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Cash Flow Consolidated Cash Flow (R$ thousand) December 31 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 2010 (including  Globex) 2009 (including  Globex) Net Income for the Period 691,735  651,399  Adjustment to reconcile net income Depreciation and Amortization 440,139  455,465  Equity Income Results (34,499) 7,985  Deferred Income Tax and Social Contribution 34,058  (31,233) Current Income Tax and Social Contribution 52,058  - Adjustment to present value (83,950) - Financial charges provisioned 277,050  398,040  Provision for Contingencies, net 298,406  81,327  Provision for Compensation in Shares 27,920  26,577  Provision for Write-off and Losses 55,505  - Gain from advantageous purchase (453,569) - Provisions for losses and the write-off of fixed and intangible assets - (7,878) Write-off of permanent assets 73,517  23,288  Others (66,189) - 1,312,181  1,604,969  37.2% 27.7% 22.0% 13.1% Value Added Composition 2009 PERSONNEL TAXES, FEES AND CONTRIBUTIONS FINANCERS COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS (CONTROLLING AND NON-CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS) 36.4% 27.8% 26.1% 9.7% 2010  51  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  December 31 (Increase) Decrease in Assets 2010 (including  Globex) 2009 (including  Globex) Accounts Receivable 874,367  (166,916) Recoverable Taxes (189,816) 116,392  Inventories (694,827) (849,380) Marketable securities 60,748  - Judicial Deposits (105,105) (99,419) Other Assets 83,674  (93,273) 29,041  (1,092,596) (Increase) Decrease in Liabilities Suppliers 245,297  1,052,761  Payroll and Related Charges (146,763) 283,486  Other liabilities  (1,018,501) (5,776) (919,967) 1,330,470  Net Cash Flow Generated (Used) in Operating Activities 421,255 1,842,844 Cash Flow (continued) Net Cash from Investing activities Restricted cash 58,798  - Cash, net of Acquisitions - 79,331  Acquisition of Companies - (963,128) Property and Equipment and Intangible (1,439,342) (746,694) Capital transfer to subsidiary - (9,318) Sales of Property and Equipment 39,243  4,330  Net Cash Flow Generated (Used) in Investing Activities (1,341,301) (1,635,479) Cash Flow from Financing Activities Loans and financing Additions 3,833,326  736,805  Amortization (1,204,381) (393,129) Payment of Interest (182,813) (209,301) Capital Increase 35,120  487,144  Cash from capital increase in subsidiaries 64,957  - Payment of Dividends (151,412) (109,157) Net Cash Flow Generated (Used) in Financing Activities 2,394,797 512,362 Cash, Banks and Marketable Securities at beginning of the period 2,343,243  1,623,516  Cash, Banks and Marketable Securities at end of the period 3,817,994  2,343,243  Changes in cash and cash equivalent 1,474,751  719,727   52  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  >  capital Market The relationship of Grupo Po de Acar  with its shareholders and investors is  guided by the transparency and fairness  in the disclosure of information and by  commitment to the capital market.   The Group has had shares listed on  the BM&FBovespa since 1995, when it  went public.  In 1997, with the objective of  approaching international shareholders,  GPAs shares also began to be traded on the  New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker  CBD, through an American Depositary  Receipt (ADR) program.   The Company has two classes of shares:    Common: confers on the holder  the essential shareholder rights,  especially participation in the  Companys results and the right  to vote in Shareholders Meetings.   Each common share corresponds to  one vote in the deliberations of the  Shareholders Meeting.     Preferred: confers on the holder  priority in the distribution of fixed   or minimum dividends; priority in   the reimbursement of the capital,  with or without a premium; and   the possibility of electing members  to the Fiscal Council.

GRI 4.16 In 2010, to cement this positioning,  sustainability policies and guidelines  oriented towards the main strategic  constituencies (employees, clients and  suppliers) were established.  Another  significant action was the inclusion of  sustainability as one of the business  strategic pillars, reinforcing the Groups  efforts in this area. GRI 4.14, 4.15 Besides the strategic guidelines  established in 2010, initiatives were  maintained throughout the year, in which  the Group participated in favor of the  society, including representations at the  Programa Conexes Sustentveis de Carne,  Soja e Madeira and in the Climate Forum  sponsored by the Ethos Institute; in the  Programa de Qualificao de fornecedores  para o varejo, of the Associao Brasileira  do varejo Txtil (ABVTEX); and in the United  Nations Global Compact and its Pact for  the Eradication of Slave Labor.

This is the vision of  the human resources department, which  in 2010, was reformulated and renamed  People & Management.  Besides reporting  to management regarding the entire  Companys performance indicators, the  departments efforts remained focused   on four main guidelines:    Ensuring that the right people are in  the right place, to meet the challenges  of growing and diversifying the Group.     Being a company admired for the  practice of the corporate diversity  and social inclusion and for the  encouragement of social inclusion.   Ensuring a performance-driven  management culture, providing  methodologies and processes.     Inculcating pride in belonging,  respecting the cultures and  particularities of the businesses.   With this new positioning, GPA  seeks to ensure the sustained growth  of each individual, with a participatory  management focused on encouraging the  personal and professional development of  its 76,637 employees*, whose dedication  and teamwork contributed to the  achievements of 2010. GRI hR4 *  This number only refers to employees of Grupo   Po de Acar, and thus does not include Assa,   Casas Bahia and Ponto frio.  59  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Pride in belonging GRI lA1 Diversity is one of the outstanding  characteristics of the internal constituency  of Grupo Po de Acar.  And this aspect  has proven advantageous to the business:  with a team composed of people of  different ages, races and cultures,  the Company can count on diverse  perspectives, which frequently gives rise   to new solutions and opportunities. With respect to gender diversity, at the  end of 2010, there were 37,217 female  employees (or 49% of the total), balanced  by 39,420 men (51%), revealing a balanced  team regarding gender. The distribution by age group also  deserves mention: in the same period, 58%  were up to 29 years old; 38% between 30- 49; and 4% older than 50, which reflected  increases of 4%, 8% and 12%, respectively,  in the number of employees in each age  band, compared to 2009. The Group also has 183 interns, of whom  146 had more than 90 days since admission,  and 37 with less; 919 young apprentices  with more than 90 days since admission –  38 at Distribution Centers, 848 at stores and  33 at the Companys headquarters; and 204  young apprentices with less than 90 days  since admission – 2 at Distribution Centers,  200 at stores and 2 at headquarters.  60  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Table of Employees, by Age Group* GRI LA1 Age 2008 2009 2010 Up to 29  41,915 43,066 44,721 30-49 24,002 26,468 28,920 Above 50 2,546 2,588 2,996 * Counting interns and young apprentices.

The theme of Diversity is treated  as an attitude of valuing people - men  and women of different races/ethnicities,  cultures, sexual orientation, generations,  lifestyles, socio-economic levels and  physical characteristics - who contribute  their best to developing the Group.  In  2010, actions to improve the following five  programs with this focus were developed:   Young Apprentice: Promotes the  inclusion of young people once they  have been professionally trained, in  partnership with the servio Nacional  de Aprendizagem Comercial (Senac).   The program accounts for 5% of the  employees whose functions at the  Company require professional training.   In 2010, the project was restructured,  and in 2011 will be relaunched with a  career plan for the participants.     First Employment: Contributed to  including youth aged 16 and up in  the labor market, providing their  first inscription for Work and Social  Security.  The initiative seeks to prepare  youth who have difficulty finding a  first opportunity in the market, to  build a career at the Company.   People of the Future: Through  professional inclusion and  development strategies that minimize  their social vulnerability, it contributes  to the reintegration of youth under  the tutelage of the fundao Casa. Inclusion of people with special needs   GPA for All: Promotes the inclusion of  people with special needs throughout  the Group, which involves their  becoming full participants in social,  economic and political life, assuring  respect for their rights and citizenship. Age diversity   Third Age: The program offers  professionals aged 55 and up an  opportunity to work, and values   the enormous contribution of this  group throughout the business.   During the year, the theme was  addressed internally through the normal  channels of communication, reinforcing  existing programs, and as a new initiative,  there was a gesture to applaud women.   For 2011, an Internal Diversity Campaign  will be launched to sensitize and raise  employee awareness of the matter, to  awaken admiration and achieve one of the  strategic guidelines of the department for  People & Management.  62  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Compensation and benefits GRI 4.11; EC3;  lA3, lA4, lA5 Both the salary policy and the benefits  offered to employees are important  matters for GPA, which helps in each  individuals development.  Among the  benefits offered by the Group, both to full- time and temporary employees, highlights  include: life insurance (with coverage   for incapacitation/disability), health plan  and dental care; a multicheque card   (for discounts at the Groups stores);  funeral aid; food subsidies (vouchers   or cafeteria); and baby clothes.   GPA also offers a private retirement plan  to employees whose salaries are above the  floor established by the Instituto Nacional  do seguro social (INSS): the employee  invests proportionally in accordance  with the wage band and the Company  contributes the compatible percentage.  63  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Average Salary by Position and Gender (R$) GRI LA14  2008 2009 2010 Function Women Men Women Men Women Men General managers 7,637 7,113 8,687 8,010 12,104 13,104 Departmental managers and coordinators  2,428 2,107 2,543 2,351 7,781 7,018 Supervisors   1,339 1,254 1,258 1,286 1,508 1,649 Specialists 3,034 3,591 3,798 3,994 3,657 3,950 Operational technicians  620 648 703 750 740 798 Ratio between the Companys Lowest Wage and the Local Minimum Wage GRI EC5 Lowest wage practiced   by the Company Minimum wage   (in local currency   at December 31) Proportion between the  lowest wage practiced   by the Company and   the minimum wage 2008 R$ 368.55 R$ 415.00 0.89 2009 R$ 337.60 R$ 465.00 0.73 2010 R$ 510.00* R$ 510.00 1 * salary for a 220-hour work month.  for an 80-hour work month, the salary is R$280.73.

In 2010, a new  development in the process of managing  people was the articulation, in the analysis  of employee turnover, of the distribution  by gender, age band and work unit.  With  this improvement in data output, it will be  possible to better understand the factors  that impact the churn rate for different  groups of employees. In 2010, the churn rate for temporary  employees was also calculated by gender  – 0.59% for males and 0.65% for females;  age group – 0.02% for above 50; 0.32% for  30-49; and 0.9% for up to 29; and units  – 1.03% for stores, 0.14% at Distribution  Centers and 0.08% at Corporate.  64  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Employee Turnover in 2010 GRI LA2 Permanent or indefinite term contract 2008 2009 2010 Gender Male 20.12% 16.08% 18.94% Female 16.67% 13.73% 17.07% Age group Up to 29 years old 27.45% 20.97% 26.43% 30-49 8.65% 8.37% 9.00% More than 50 years old 0.68% 0.47% 0.58% Units Stores 30.95% 25.43% 30.96% Distribution Centers 3.52% 2.02% 2.30% Corporate 2.31% 2.53% 2.71% Training GRI lA10 To ensure employees professional  preparation for performing their functions,  besides stimulating the quest for  continuing learning, Grupo Po de Acar  promotes continuing training for all  categories of employees.   In 2010, the average training load was  22 hours for directors, general managers  and departmental managers and  coordinators; 28 for supervisors; and 10   for specialists and operational technicians. During the year, sustainability was a  central theme at the national meeting of  Po de Acar managers. The event included  discussions of a variety of initiatives that  can be implemented at stores, such as:  zeroing the carbon footprint, using only  recyclable materials, and presenting as  giveaways organic products and returnable  bags, among other initiatives. As a result of this meeting, over/almost  126 Po de Acar managers participated   in a cycle of workshops on sustainability   in partnership with the Instituto Akatu   (a non-governmental organization that works   to raise awareness and mobilize society  towards conscientious consumption); each  employee participated in an 8-hour session.

The work is developed in the  Casa educational centers located in  the Groups stores and elsewhere,  which have classrooms, computer  labs and social areas.  Over the  programs decade in existence, there  have been more than 650 concerts  played for audiences totaling more  than 300,000 people.  In 2010, the  orchestra performed in its second  international tour, to Argentina and   72  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  the United States.  During the year, 600  participants were involved in the music  program and 175 in the orchestra.   Advanced Center for Food Technology  Education and Cooperative  Management: in partnership with  the Government of the State of  Rio de Janeiro, the secretariats of  Education and Agriculture, Fishing and  Supply, and the Central Cooperative  for Milk Products, GPA invests in a  new educational model oriented  toward promoting knowledge  and professional opportunity  for youth who have recently  completed Elementary School.  It  is a complex with three units: the  Escola Comendador Valentim dos  Santos Diniz, which offers complete  Secondary Education, linking the  disciplines of the normal grade  curriculum with technical-professional  material; the Food Associated Unit;  and the Applied Food Research Unit.   The structure, with capacity for  600 students, has the objective of  educating technicians in Milk and  Milk Products, Baking, Cold Cuts and  Vegetable Handling, preparing them  to work in industries, cooperatives  and in retail.  In 2010, the program  involved 240 youth, their families  and the surrounding communities.   Among the goals for 2011, highlights  include the opening of another 120  spots, including 60 spots for the milk  and milk products course and 60 spots   73  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  for the baking course, and the roll out  of the mandatory internship in Rio  de Janeiro stores for third (final)-year  students in four classes. Social campaigns   Campaigns to collect books, warm  clothes and toys: every year, GPA lets  its stores be used as collection sites  for donations that are sent to close to  500 institutions in the surrounding  communities.  In 2010, Po de Acar,  Extra and CompreBem stores collected  561,000 books, 323,000 pieces of  warm clothing and 77,000 toys.  In  2010, Assa participated for the first  time in collecting warm clothes.    Emergency campaigns: the Group also  participates and involves its clients  in initiatives in favor of communities  affected by natural disasters.  In 2010,  there were three actions to help those  affected by the earthquake in Haiti,  the floods in So Luiz do Paraitinga  and the rains in Angra dos Reis, with  robust results:  Haiti: R$2 million (involving all  constituencies); R$873,173.42  (regarding part of the revenue  from TAEQ and Qualit products);  R$673.00 (employee deposits   in an account); 27 tons of  donations (water and canned  food donated by clients).  So Luiz do Paraitinga: 20 tons  of water, non-perishable food,  cleaning products and clothes,   at 30 participating stores in   Vale do Paraba, and 500 baskets  of basics donated by GPA.  Angra dos Reis: 336 tons of   water, non-perishable food,  cleaning products and clothes,   at 93 participating stores in   Rio de Janeiro, and 1,000 baskets  of basics donated by GPA.    Polio Vaccination Campaign (first and  second dose): in 2010, 4,500 children  from 0-5 years old were vaccinated   at stores of the Group, which are  utilized as a community asset in  support of public policies.  74  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report    Cause Marketing: with this initiative,  GPA tries to mobilize clients to buy its  own products and those of partner  suppliers, sending part of the income  to social institutions.   The continuing campaigns in 2010 were:  the Associao de Assistncia  Criana  Defi ciente – AACDs Corrente do Bem; the  CdO Food Collection Campaign; Panetone  fabricao Prpria; Campanha mundo   75  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  dos sonhos Extra in favor of the fundao  Abrinq; Campanha Automotiva Extra –   in favor of the Instituto Ayrton senna and  the Instituto Ingo hoffmann; and the  Campanha Nota fiscal Paulista, in benefit   of the hospital do Cncer de Barretos.   Well Fed Program  Since 2006, Grupo Po de Acar has  offered its customers the Well Fed  Program, whose main objective is to  supply information about healthy  nutrition from the better use of daily  foods (handling, hygiene, recipes,   and food pyramid, among others).    The great advantage of the program   is that it does not propose a change   to the client upon purchase, but rather  a change in consumption habits.   In four years, the Program has  benefited 15,000 people. Food donations   Partnership against waste:   the program promotes donations  of products that are good for  consumption, but not for sale,   for aesthetic reasons.  Currently  benefits 700 institutions. Relationship actions   Outreach bazaar, disease prevention  and sponsorship of institutional  efforts: actions with the objective   of improving relations between  stores, the community and local  institutions, generating resources  for participating institutions, and  strengthening awareness of the  brands social commitment. > society   Respect for the society is also one  of the Groups areas of focus, which  values socioenvironmental responsibility,  sustainable development and transparency  in all its forms of business. Human Rights GRI hR6, hR7 Having signed the Global Compact  in 2001, it participates in private sector  engagement in the fundamental values in  the areas of human rights, labor relations,  environment and combating corruption, as  consolidated in 10 principles.  All contracts  between the Group and its employees,  suppliers or service providers bar human  rights abuses. In 2010, none of Grupo Po de Acars  operations were identified as having a  significant risk of forced, child, or slave labor. Public policy work GRI so5 Based on its strategic business vision,  GPA actively participates, with the support  of its Legal Department, in the preparation,  coordination and monitoring of legislative  bills, decrees, ordinances and terms of  technical cooperation, commitment  and behavior change, among others.   The objective of this positioning is to  identify and understand possible public  demands, establishing dialog and ethical  and proactive efforts in conjunction with  government initiatives.  76  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  In this context, the Group may act  directly or through associations that  represent the sector, such as the Associao  Brasileira de supermercados (Abras), the  Associao Comercial de so Paulo (ACSP),  the Associao Paulista de supermercados  (Apas), the Instituto para Desenvolvimento  do varejo (IDV) and the Associao  Brasileira das Indstrias de Equipamentos  para Panifi cao, Biscoitos  e massas Alimentcias (Abiepan). Communications and marketing  GRI PR6, PR7 PA Publicidade, the Groups  communications agency, stands out for its  specialized work in the retail segment and  for an important competitive advantage:  deep knowledge of consumers and the  brand.  All its work is based on surveys  and market studies worldwide, which  assures clear mapping of the target  public and knowledge of its lifestyles  and consumption patterns.  From 2008- 2010, besides developing materials and  publicity, the agency was responsible for  conceptualizing the packaging and labeling  for over 1,700 products, among which,  Grupo Po de Acars Annual Report.   With respect to legislation, the  Group fully complies with all the laws  and standards applicable to means of  communication. Promotional activities  are always realized in compliance with  the two Brazilian regulators – the Caixa  Econmica federal (CEF) and the secretaria  de Acompanhamento Econmico (Seae) –  pursuant to Law 5,768 of December 20,  1971 and Law 10,683 of Mary 28, 2003,  which regulate commercial promotions  involving the free distribution of prizes. Pursuant to Law 9,610 of February 19,  1998, the Group reported all its events  involving music to the Escritrio Central  de Arrecadao e Distribuio de Direitos  Autorais (Ecad), and paid the applicable  royalties, and all its production, purchase or  rental of photos respecting the rights of the  author, work and image.  Contracts with  minors are always signed by the parents.    77  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  The Company is also attentive to the  standards that govern electronic production  for radio, cinema and television, and is  constantly updating in step with the legal  requirements, both in terms of adhering  to applicable law, and communicating  campaigns and products.  All that is  conveyed by PA Publicidade obeys the  Cdigo Brasileiro de Autorregulamentao  Publicitria - Conar (Brazilian Self- Regulating Advertising Code) and the  Normas de Padro da Atividade Publicitria  (Rules Governing Advertising Standards).  Due to this careful positioning, in 2010,  Grupo Po de Acar was not cited in any  suits regarding its publicity campaigns, and  there were only a few errors due to failures  in the review process. Anticorruption practices   GRI so2, so3, so4 To reinforce the fight against all forms  of corruption in its chain of value, GPA  maintains ongoing initiatives and actions  like monthly internal whistle-blowing  violations by type and banner, always  withholding the name of the employee.   The effort stimulates conscientiousness  by example.  This is one of the practices  provided for in the Groups Code of  Ethics, which has a series of guidelines  and standards regarding the Companys  relationship with its diverse constituencies.   All employees are oriented on the standards  of conduct provided in the document and  the procedures for complaints.  Moreover,  any form of discrimination is treated  seriously and respectfully by the Company,  which in 2010, registered 68 cases through  the Complaint Channel. > clients Besides respecting its clients, GPA tries  to better understand their demands and  needs by applying methodologies and tools  to know them better, creating personalized  strategies for building loyalty.  Satisfaction survey GRI PR5 Among the projects realized in 2010,  highlights include the regional knowledge  survey and the analysis of loss of receipts.   The first sought to probe the knowledge of  each Brazilian state, through partnerships  with universities, academics and specialists.   The second diagnosed the factors led to the  loss of receipts, facilitating more assertive  action in this area. There were more than 16,000  quantitative interviews with consumers,  more than 700,000 clients approached  at points of sale, close to 100 in-depth  qualitative interviews and 77 focus groups.   In all, close to 715,000 consumer opinions  were gathered.   Besides the usual opinion research  tools, surveys with end consumers were  conducted via internet, and there was work  with the academic community to identify  latent opportunities that could benefit  consumers and society overall.    78  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Programa Mais The Programa mais is the locus of client  loyalty building under the Po de Acar  banner.  In 2010, 170,000 new clients  were added to a registered client base  now numbering close to 670,000 people,  an increase of 13% over 2009.  Thus, the  banners share of sales reached 49.1%  and the number of clients who make all  their purchases at Po de Acar reached  150,000.  During the year, important  initiatives were promoted, such as:   More publicity on the importance of  reusable bags, offering extra points  to Mais clients: over the course of  the year, the number of users of  environmentally friendly bags jumped  by 40,000, to 97,000;   A birthday campaign, with the  distribution of a tsuru (Japanese  origami) to clients in the month of  their birthday.  These tsurus were  produced by homeless people working  with the NGo mes do Brasil, and the  proceeds were used to build housing. For 2011, the expectation is to increase  the quantity of campaigns in partnership  with industry, in order to offer even more  benefi ts to clients.  The sustainable aspects  of the campaigns also will be buttressed in  accordance with the positioning of the Po  de Acar banner. Casa do Cliente (Client House) GRI PR4,  PR9 The Casa do Cliente initiative stands out  for the Groups commitment to and respect  for its clients.  It is an interactive channel  for contact with the public, oriented  toward continually improving products and  services.  In 2010, there were 46,488 client  contacts through the several channels.   Of this total, 36% were questioned about  satisfaction with the service.  Regarding  legal and regulatory compliance in the  supply and use of products and services,  the cases opened in 2010 are still being  analyzed by the administrative bodies.   Nonetheless, until the conclusion of the  administrative process, there are no fi nes  or signifi cant amounts at stake. 1% 89% 10% Contact through the Available Channels TOLL-FREE/E-MAIL/CHAT/TWITTER PROCON PRESS  79  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Client consultants Present in approximately 75 Po de  Acar stores, the client consultants are  dedicated to excellence in attending to  client demands, questions and suggestions. Demand for sustainable products  Attentive to the needs of the consumer  seeking a healthier and more sustainable  lifestyle, GPA has structured itself to meet  the growing demand for healthy, organic  and sustainable products, without ceasing  to offer options to consumers who are still  in the learning process.   As a retailer, the Group respects  different preferences, trying to offer the  most appropriate and varied assortment  possible.  Although demand for sustainable  products is still relatively low, this market  has grown markedly in recent years,  especially for organic products.  Currently,  Grupo Po de Acar sells 6 times more of  these products than it did in 2003, or an  annual increase of roughly 30%.  80  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  > suppliers  GRI hR1, hR2 GPA ensures the commitment to ethics  and human rights in its relationships with  suppliers, which are audited.  Their chain  of production may not include any child  or slave labor, as set forth in law.  The  diligence is ongoing, and in 2010, 16 of   the Groups 294 suppliers were audited.   In this same year, 48% of all suppliers  signed contracts containing requirements  to respect human rights. Responsibility for the product:  sustainable chain GRI EC6, EC9 Grupo Po de Acar views the supply  chain strategically.  Through policies,  channels of relationships and practices, the  Company strives to advance in structuring  and consolidating a more sustainable  chain of value, from the local producer to  the largest companies of the most diverse  sectors, in search of financial, social and  environmental balance.   To strengthen regional markets, the  Group invests in programs with local  producers, lending a hand in ways ranging  from structuring the business to making  sales space available in its stores.  Toward  this end, it requires that the merchandise  offered follow the fair market precepts,  even without formal certification,  guaranteeing respect for the environment  and the sustainable development of the  locales of origin. Project Pirarucu The Pirarucu Project – named after  the Amazonian species fished by river  communities – is realized in partnership  with the Ibama (Instituto Brasileiro do  meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais  Renovveis).  Using a technique to  count the fish in reserves it controls,  it is possible to calculate the volume  of fish that can be extracted without  compromising the ecosystem.  In this  way, the project reduces environmental  impacts and promotes the generation and  distribution of income.  Moreover, selling  the fish in the Groups stores publicizes  the pirarucu in several Brazilian cities.   The entire negotiation between the local  producers and GPA was conducted with  an open spreadsheet, i.e., sharing the  analysis of expenses and revenues. Bovine tracing GRI PR1 Since 2006, Grupo Po de Acar has  maintained a pioneering program for  producing quality meat under the Taeq  brand.  The initiative, which is oriented  toward food security and reducing public  health risks, permits the identification of  the origin of the product and its entire  production process, ensuring that it is in  accordance with sustainable practices.  81  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Another highlight of the meats is that  the entire chain of production is oriented  toward economic, social and environmental  sustainability.  GPA, in partnership with the  Ethos Institute, within the TEAR program,  developed on ranches in 2006 and 2007  a sustainable management concept  that encompasses indicators of ethical  values, transparency in the management  and governance of the business, respect  for the environment and a responsible  relationship with the public where the  business is located. The Group makes tracking information  available over the Internet, and the tracing  can be done from an application for  smart phones with a 2D reader. In 2010,  1,700,000 kilograms of Taeq meat was sold. tracking taeq Meat control of  livestock   Handling and  transportation individual aniMal  registration  witH tHe Ministry  of agriculture identification   of Meat cuts sHipMent   to stores detailing   of product   for consuMers  82  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Quality from the source program   GRI PR3 To guarantee more reliable quality of  the fruits, legumes and greens sold in its  stores, GPA developed the Quality from  the Source program. The initiative, in place  since 2008, is supported by important  groups like the Associao Nacional de  Defesa vegetal (Andef), which contributes  by offering basic training directly to  suppliers in the field. Since it is a program for developing   the chain of production, the Group invests  both in controls and in corrective actions.   In 2010, 90% of the volume of fruits,  legumes and greens sold in its stores had   a tracking code.  During the programs   two years, there have been 5,800 analyses,  with investments of R$4 million.  The program is also aligned technically  with the Programa de Anlise de Resduos  de Agrotxicos (Para), of the Agncia  Nacional de vigilncia sanitria (Anvisa),  which continuously assesses the levels  of agrotoxins that reach the consumers  table.  The analyses are realized in  the lab by the Instituto Nacional de  metrologia, Normalizao e Qualidade  Industrial (Inmetro), through rigorous  periodic inspections and monitoring.   Approximately 250 products are submitted  to analysis – going beyond the Anvisa  requirement – and a single product  analysis involves 243 surveys.  The Group pays attention to its  socioenvironmental praxis with suppliers,  controlling or helping in the control of a  variety of matters, including: the use of  agrotoxins and CO2 emissions; returns  of packaging for agrotoxins, avoiding  environmental contamination and  preserving the health of the worker and   of the rural community; economic  waste from the rejection of lots in the  Distribution Centers and stores; and  utilizing any form of child labor.   GPA is also preoccupied with developing  local communities, and it offers continuing  education to workers, education for youth,  adult literacy, and promotes vaccination  campaigns and first aid training.  Faces of Brazil GRI EC6; so1 Now eight years old, the Group-wide   initiative seeks to enhance the appreciation  of local cultures, with product displays  (foods, decorative objects and artisanal  pieces) developed by communities  and organized throughout Brazil.  The  program makes it possible to sell  merchandise from small producers who  embrace sustainability, encouraging  ethical commerce and solidarity, income  generation, respect for the environment,  and social inclusion. In all, there are more than 177 products  from close to 58 suppliers, most of which  are NGOs throughout the country, sold at  56 stores in Braslia, So Paulo (capital and  the interior), Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba.    83  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  For 2011, the expectation is to register  a broader range of typical and regional  products; develop the Program to Train  Suppliers; transfer 5-10% of the suppliers  participating in the project to the group  of traditional suppliers; register suppliers  Program to Qualify Suppliers for Retail  Grupo Po de Acar is one of the  participants in the Program to Qualify  Suppliers for Retail, of the Associao  Brasileira do varejo Txtil (ABVTEX). The  initiative aims to accredit and monitor  best practices in social responsibility  and labor relations for textile suppliers  (clothing and for the home) and their  subcontractors in Brazil, that are included  in the supply chain for the companies  participating in the program. from states that have not been accessed;  conduct a study for the use of e-commerce,  and for future years, develop a concept  store focused on valuing local production  and redeeming the origins.   Toward this end, independent audits  will be conducted to monitor practices,  commitments and aspects of management  linked to the following themes: child,  forced, or analogous-to-slave labor;  undocumented alien labor; liberty of  association; discrimination, abuse and  harassment; occupational health and  safety; monitoring and documentation;  compensation; work hours; benefits;  monitoring of the chain of production;  and the environment.  The initiative also  promotes professional training, supporting  suppliers and their subcontractors to  conform to the program.    84  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  GPA, together with the other signatory  companies, expects all of its suppliers to  have adapted to the program by 2012 (in  the case of So Paulo) or 2013 (Brazil-wide).  Product quality GRI PR1, PR2; hR2 The preoccupation and constant  concern with the quality of the products  sold in its stores are part of the value of  respect for the client fostered by GPA, which  values transparency in all its processes.  To  ensure health and safety at all phases of  the life cycle of its products, the Company  maintains the following initiatives:   Audits of Quality: starting with  initiatives like the Good Manufacturing  Practices program, the Group tries to  identify the standards developed by   its suppliers, to maintain the quality   of the products from the source to  final consumption.   Analyses of Dangers and Critical  Control Points: detailed studies permit  the preparation of procedures with  the objective of avoiding potential  risks and critical hazards during the  processes, from receipt through display  of the products.   British Retail Consortium: the Group  has adopted the international  certification standard of supplier  audits used by the large British retail  chains, which seeks also consider  the potential environmental impact,  the utilization of slave and/or child  labor, and the comfort and well  being of the animal (for evaluating  slaughterhouses).   With respect to product displays in the  store, their quality is monitored through  audits that assess each product in the  phases of receipt, storage, handling and  display.  Matters such as the applicable  legal standards, unit structures, and the  cold chain are also considered. TOP LOG In 2010, 144 suppliers participated in the Top Log Program, and were evaluated with  respect to the level of service, client friendliness and integration.  They were also asked  16 questions on areas of sustainability like reductions in emissions of pollutants, route  optimization and reverse logistics – focused on discarding packaging.  85  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  our environMental   perforMance  86  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Green Stores GRI EN6 After the 2008 launch of its first green  store, in Indaiatuba (SP), GPA received in  the following year the certification for  Leadership in Energy and Environmental  Design (Leed)1. Since then, the construction  of a large part of the stores inaugurated  has included sustainability concepts, like  responsible resource management of  energy and water, sensors of presence  in administrative areas, and skylights to  enhance the natural light in the stores.  At the end of 2010, in the green concept,  the Group had three stores without  certification and two certified stores.   The highlight of the year was the  construction of a Green Distribution  Center, in Braslia, whose conception  included aspects like the efficient use   of energy (with natural lighting); reuse   of rainwater; employee uniforms made   of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)   from recycled bottles; and ecological  parking that facilitates rainwater runoff,  since it is not covered with cement. 1  leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (leed): certification that evaluates buildings that purport to be  sustainable, based on requirements like energy efficiency and water consumption, reduced socioenvironmental  impact in the process of construction, and responsible application and use of materials. our environMental   perforMance RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IS PART OF THE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF GRUPO  PO DE ACAR, WHICH FOLLOWS ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS REGULATING  THE SECTOR AND CONSTANTLY SEEKS TO IMPROVE ITS PROCESSES.

GRI EN30  87  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Recycling centers GRI EN26, PR1 The Company promotes initiatives  oriented towards raising final consumer  awareness of the importance of  sustainability in their day-to-day, and  how to put it in practice.  The Recycling  Centers installed in Po de Acar, Extra  and CompreBem stores are examples  of the successful business partnership  in favor of social and environmental  benefits, which helps raise the civic  awareness of each client.   Po de Acar Unilever Recycling  Centers: developed in partnership  with Unilever, the initiative provides  voluntary drop-off points for  recyclable wastes (paper, plastic,  metal, glass and used cooking oil) in  Po de Acar parking lots, so that  they can be correctly disposed of.      recycling  industry consuMers education  for  responsible  consuMption recycling  stations cooperatives recycling stations  88  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Present at 110 stores, in 2010 they  collected more than 8.3 thousand  tons of recyclable materials. Since the  initiative was launched at 12 sites in  2001, the posts have gathered close   to 41,000 tons of material. Besides,  with the collect material, such as PET  bottles and oil cans, flowers mandalas,  angels and christmas trees were made  and used to decorate 12 stores in the  chain at 2010 christmastime. GRI EN27   Extra H2OH! Recycling Centers:  present at 110 Extra stores, in 2010  the stations collected more than 1,300  tons of recyclable materials.  Since  2008, more than 2,200 tons of material  has been gathered.  Developed in  partnership with Pepsico, through its  brand H2OH!, the program began in  2007 with just five collection sites; in  2010, another 33 were inaugurated.   All collected material is donated  to recycling cooperatives that have  partnered with the program.   CompreBem Recycling Centers:  present at 7 CompreBem stores, in  2010 the posts collected more than  156 tons of recyclable materials.   Since 2008, when the program was  implemented, the stations have  collected almost 500 tons of material.     CompreBem Oil Collection: in 2010, oil  collectors installed at 18 CompreBem  stores collected more than 17,400  liters of oil.  Since its beginnings in  2008, over 41,800 liters have been  collected.  All collected oil is donated  to recycling cooperatives, which resell  to companies that produce biofuels.  89  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Green Box Program GRI EN26 In the Green Box Program, GPA places  a receptacle by the cash registers at  Po de Acar and Extra stores for pre- consumption disposal of packaging:  besides collecting material, the initiative  promotes raising the consciousness of  consumers with respect to the correct  disposal of wastes from purchases. At Po de Acar stores, the program  began in 2008 with 38 receptacles; in 2010,  there are now 67.  Since the beginning  of the program, close to 1.17 million  packages have been collected, including  more than 732,000 in 2010 alone. At Extra,  the initiative commenced in 2009 with 10  receptacles – currently there are 65, which  gathered more than 161,000 packages   in 2010.  All the collected material is  donated to recycling cooperatives that  partner with the Group. green box recycling  industry consuMers green box cooperatives  90  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Campaign for the correct disposal   of medications/Correct Disposal   of Medications In a pioneering initiative in 2010,  Grupo Po de Acar and Eurofarma  Laboratrios launched the Correct Disposal  of Medications project.  The initiative seeks  to alert the consumer to the importance of  appropriate disposal of expired or out-of- use medications, as well as packaging and  sharp articles like needles and ampoules.   The project – which is not restricted to  collecting Eurofarma medications – has  been rolled out at drugstores inside two   Po de Acar and three Extra stores in  the city of So Paulo.  The expectation  as of 2011 is to extend it to the Groups  drugstores throughout the city of So Paulo. To ensure the safety of clients and  employees, items are collected in  appropriately marked receptacles.  The  drugstore teams were trained to help clients  when they are disposing items, to answer  questions and encourage proper disposal. A partner in the project, the  Departamento de limpeza urbana  (Limpurb), through its concessionaires  Loga and Ecourbis, is responsible for  the collection, transport, treatment and  final disposal of the waste stored at the  participating establishments.    732,000 GREEN BOX EXTRA 161,000 GREEN BOX PO DE ACAR Collection of Packages in 2010 (in units)  GRI EN27  91  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Cell phone, batteries and its accessories  recycling campaign | Al Recycle The Al Recycle campaign was also  launched in 2010 in partnership with  Nokia do Brasil, to recycle cell phones,  batteries and accessories.  There are 41  collection sites installed in the State of  So Paulo and the cities of Salvador and  Fortaleza, in Po de Acar supermarkets  and Extra hypermarkets.   To encourage public participation, there  was a month-long Exchange with Change  campaign, which offered a bonus on  exchanging an old cell phone – sending it  for recycling – in return for a new one. To ensure consumer understanding  and engagement, the two companies also  developed an informational campaign  about the importance and impact of  recycling, showing how consumers could  contribute, and avoiding improper disposal  of the phones.  This demonstrated the  importance of caring for the environment,  highlighted by the conservation of the  groundwater, soils and rivers that are  highly compromised by contamination  with wastes like polyvinyl chloride (PVC)  and bromine. In 2011, the Company expects to  expand the program to more stores, to  have a total of 300 collection sites in Brazil,  by the end of the year.  92  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Batteries Recycling Program  Besides the Recycling Centers, there are  also available collectors for small batteries  in all Po de Acar, Extra Hypermarket,  Extra Supermarket, Extra Fcil,  Compre  Bem, Sendas and Assa stores.   The material collected is sent to   a recycling partner (company). Conscientious plastic bag use GRI EN26 In line with consumer demand and  the legislation on the conscientious use of  plastic bags, Grupo Po de Acar has its  own initiatives oriented toward the theme,  developed by its several brands.   Po de Acar began to offer clients  points on the mais loyalty card for declining  to use plastic bags.  At Assa, plastic bags  are sold for R$0.12 and the income goes to  charitable institutions. The Groups mobilization stimulated  efforts by the government and the  productive sector for the conscientious  consumption of packaging, in line with  Brazils commitments in the Action Plan for  Sustainable Production and Consumption  linked to the United Nations Marrakech  Process, in which the country has  participated since 2007.   In Jundia (SP), the Company participated  in a cooperation agreement among  the citys retailers, which abolished the  distribution of plastic bags in commercial  establishments in the municipality as of  August 2010.  Besides communicating  and orienting consumers regarding the  importance of this initiative, bags with the  campaign layout made of biodegradable  material and TNT were sold for R$0.19.    93  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Pursuant to the implementing  regulation of Law 5.502/09, in the State of  Rio de Janeiro, commercial establishments  had to concede, as of July 15, 2010, a  discount of R$0.03 to clients that do not use  plastic bags. GPA also took on this initiative  at its stores, with a communication and  orientation campaign for clients. Returnable bags GRI EN26 Besides encouraging reduced plastic  bag use, all the Companys banners  also provide client incentives to utilize  returnable bags to carry purchases.    A variety of models and layouts are  offered, at amounts adaptable to the  public of each store. One highlight of the Groups initiative  is the partnership signed by the banners  with social entities, through which  they donate part of the revenue from  bag sales.  Extra donates some of the  money raised through bag sales to Hope  House in So Paulo.  At CompreBem, the  resources are sent to the Associao de  Assistncia  Criana Deficiente – AACD.   At Po de Acar, the project is developed  in partnership with the fundao sos  mata Atlntica, which invests the money  in projects focused on environmental  conservation.  In 2010, new models of   bags made entirely of PET were  launched in three colors (yellow, green  and blue) with patterns that relate to  the biodiversity of the mata Atlntica:  butterflies, birds and monkeys 656,998 835,927 668,335 131,291 Total Sales of Returnable Bags among  the Groups Banners PO DE ACAR EXTRA COMPREBEM OTHERS  94  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  THE AbRE PRIzE The Abre Prize for brazilian Packaging brings together all the links in the chain of industrial  production in brazil, with the support of the World Packaging Organization (WPO) and the  brazilian Design Program of the Ministrio da Indstria, Desenvolvimento e Comrcio Exterior. 5th PRIzE FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIbILITy AND SUSTAINAbLE RETAIL This prize, organized by the Fundao Getlio Vargas, is oriented toward small,  medium and large companies in the retail sector that develop socioenvironmental  initiatives.  The finalists receive certificates and their projects are published   in the Banco de Prticas de Responsabilidade Social e Sustentabilidade no Varejo. TAEQ Green Cycle  Launched in 2009, the program  promotes the utilization of recycled  paper in the production of cardboard  packaging for Taeq products, applying  the concept of reverse logistics in  managing the chain of production of  the cardboard.  In partnership with the  companies in the Taeq production cycle  and segregated collection cooperatives, a  collection tracking system was developed  to facilitate production of an exclusive  recycled cardboard. It all starts with the collection of the  raw materials at the Recycling Centers  and at the Green Cash Registers of Grupo  Po de Acar.  This material is then  segregated by the recycling cooperative  and sold to the recycling company that  manufactures the cardboard and in  turn sells it to the printer that produces  Taeq packaging.  With this program, the  Group now monitors the entire chain  of production of the packaging, which  includes: collecting recyclable material,  segregating it, producing recyclable  cardboard, producing the packaging,  printing the shells, and supplier use in the  final stage of manufacture.   Financially and environmentally, the  project stands out for obtaining a final  product without increased costs, while  ensuring the movement of approximately  30 tons of post-consumption paper  packaging per month.  In the social  context, the highlight lies in generating  income through recycling.   As proof of its success, the initiative  won two awards in 2010, from the  Associao Brasileira de Embalagem (Abre),  in the Sustainability category, and from  the fundao Getlio vargas (FGV-EAESP),  in the 5 Prmio de Responsabilidade social  e sustentabilidade no varejo, in the large  company category.  95  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Materials GRI EN1 The mapping and analysis of  environmental impacts are ever in view at  Grupo Po de Acar, with the constant  improvement in data collection and the  presentation of results, and the consequent  fine tuning in establishing goals. One of the great highlights is the  management realized by the exclusive  brands Taeq and Qualit, which involves  meticulous analysis of each material  used (especially in packaging), prioritizing  recyclables wherever possible. taeq green cycle recycling  stations green box cooperatives consuMers paper  recycling printing  industry producers stores  96  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Materials utilized by TAEQ and Qualit Material Percentage Type 2009 2010 Taeq Paper 44.0% Virgin 46.0% 45.0% Recycled 1.0% 1.0% Corrugated Paperboard 30.0% 30.0% Paper Carton Certified by the Forest   Stewardship Council (FSC) 9.0% 9.0% Without FSC certification 14.0% 14.0% Recycled 1.0% 1.0% Plastic 51.8% 1 – Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 3.0% 3.0% 2 – High Density Polyethylene 3.0% 3.0% 3 – Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) 33.0% 33.0% 4 – Low Density Polyethylene 2.0% 3.0% 5 – Polypropylene (PP) 24.0% 24.0% 6 – Polystyrene (PS) 28.0% 28.0% 7 – Others 6.0% 6.0% Metal 3.7% Steel 30.0% 30.0% Aluminum 70.0% 70.0% Glass 0.5% 100.0% 100.0% QUALIT Paper 38.0% Virgin 65.0% 65.0% Recycled 4.0% 4.0% Corrugated Paperboard 28.0% 28.0% Paper Carton Certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 1.0% 1.0% Without FSC certification 3.0% 3.0% Recycled 0.0% 0.0% Plastic 58.3% 1 – Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 4.0% 4.0% 2 – High Density Polyethylene 2.0% 3.0% 3 – Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) 32.0% 31.0% 4 – Low Density Polyethylene 5.0% 6.0% 5 – Polypropylene (PP) 25.0% 25.0% 6 – Polystyrene (PS) 31.0% 30.0% 7 – Others 1.0% 1.0% Metal 2.0% Steel 93.0% 93.0% Aluminum 7.0% 7.0% Glass 1.3% 100.0% 100.0%  97  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Energy GRI EN3, EN4, EN5, EN6 Energy consumption is an indicator  regularly monitored by the Group, which  analyzes the data by source (renewable and  non-renewable).  In 2010, the stores, DCs  and headquarters consumed 115,761,715  kWh of natural gas, 129,348,731 kWh of  hydroelectric energy and 133,118,110 kWh  from biomass – these latter two energy  sources being renewable. Over the course of the year, the Company  developed a series of initiatives oriented  towards reducing energy consumption  at its stores, Distribution Centers and  administrative headquarters, highlighted by:   Changing engine rooms, reworking  refrigeration units and replacing  lighting systems for store sales space.   Results: savings of 17,093,088 kWh.     Operating a generator at peak hours  at the Distribution Centers in So  Paulo and Recife. Results: a monthly  decrease of approximately R$100,000  on the electricity bills of the DCs.   Installing translucent tiles on the Non- Food Distribution Center.  Results:  monthly savings of approximately  10% of the total electricity bill.     Installing translucent tiles on the  Distribution Center in Fortaleza.   Results: monthly savings of  approximately 5% of the total  electricity bill.   Including six stores in the free market  for 100% renewable energy (biomass).   Results: reducing carbon dioxide  emissions by 40,000 tons per year – the  equivalent of reforesting 264,000 trees. The Groups goal for 2011 and  thereafter is to install solar heaters for  bathrooms and LED lighting at the DCs  and stores, and to install a system for  cogenerating natural gas.

Water GRI EN8, EN10, EN21 Water consumption at stores and  Distribution Centers is another important  indicator for GPA. The main sources for  consumption in 2010 were municipal  supply networks, as described below: In this year, the stores also consumed  262,157 liters of water from subterranean  sources. The system for monitoring daily  consumption at the stores was maintained,  which facilitated the prevention and  efficient detection and containment of  leaks, when necessary. Moreover, 70% of  the water from defrosting the Distribution  Center in Osasco (SP) was treated and  reutilized, which signified consumption   of 30,000 liters of recycled water. Water disposal is also one of the  Companys preoccupations, and each year  it tries to perfect the forms of disposal.  99  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Waste management  GRI EN26 Ahead of Brazils new National Solid  Waste Policy, Grupo Po de Acar had two  Waste Management initiatives to try to  minimize the impact of its operations on  the environment. Waste management – Avangard  Innovative  The first of them was a partnership  with Avangard Innovative (an international  company specializing in recycling service  solutions), to optimize the exploitation  of recyclable wastes and mitigate the  generation of byproducts in its operations. The initiative gave rise to a pilot project  at 6 Distribution Centers in So Paulo  and an Extra store, lasting seven months.   The initiatives objective is to map risks,  evaluate operational impacts and measure  the real financial benefit of the initiative.  The project was divided into two  steps: the first began in September  2010, focusing on recyclable and non- recyclable wastes from the Distribution  Centers and the hypermarket.  The second  step, predicted to start in 2011, involves  analyzing the recyclable, non-recyclable  and organic parts of the waste generated  in another 5  Po de Acar stores, besides  the DCs and store already contemplated  by the Pilot. The project is based on reverse  logistics in order to send the least amount  of waste to the landfills, diminishing its  environmental impact. Waste management – GMV The other initiative is a partnership  with GMV.  In all, 31 stores have a system  to manage organic and recyclable waste,  which are duly segregated and treated.    For this process to happen, all employees  who work in the stores receive special   training on recycling and waste management.   All sectors of the store have specific  collectors to efficiently segregate the  wastes into different kinds of organics  and recyclables.  The result in 2011 is an  evolution of the work at 23 of the Groups  stores in 2010.   As a result of this effort, just 7% of the  total waste produced at the stores is sent  to landfills. The remaining 93% is reused   in an environmentally appropriate way.  100  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Segregated collection  To alert its employees to the importance  of their participation in efforts that  contribute to environmental conservation,  the Group re-launched, in June 2010,  the segregated collection program at its  administrative headquarters in So Paulo.   To ensure everyones involvement,  there were several efforts, like training  the janitorial team on the collection,  Segregated Collection* Period 2009 2010 Tons Tons January 2.9 3.4 February 2.5 2.4 March 3.7 2.9 April 2.7 2.8 May 3.2 3.1 June 3.1 8.0 July 2.8 5.3 August 2.6 4.6 September 2.6 6.4 October 2.4 6.4 November 2.6 6.9 December 21.4 7.4 Total 52.9 60.0 Average/month 4.4 5.0 * Data for material collected at the Company's administrative  headquarters, in so Paulo.

Since the re-launch, the program has  contributed to increasing collection of  paper, plastic, glass and metal, as shown  in the table.  101  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  Emissions GRI EN16, EN19 GPA maintains a series of initiatives  oriented towards mitigating its  emissions, like reducing the periods  between preventive maintenance of the  refrigeration installations from 60 to 30  days; increasing hours spent on preventive  maintenance tasks; and improving its  refrigeration installations, reducing the  utilization of coolant gas – in all, the  method now applied in green stores   and that will expand to the others.

In 2010, the Group participated in the  Carbon Efficient Index (ICO2), launched  by the BM&FBovespa in partnership with  the BNDES, which measures the return  on a hypothetical portfolio consisting  of shares of companies in the IBrX-50  (composed of the 50 most traded shares on  the Exchange) that joined in the initiative.

Toward this  end, Grupo Po de Acar restructured its  logistics network, processes and systems   to ensure greater productivity of the fleet. What makes this project stand out is  the management of the logistics fleet,  which permits trucks to return carrying  products from some supplier, rather  than returning empty after delivering  products.  It is a win-win process, since all  parties benefit: GPA wins through revenue  generation, greater fleet productivity,  synergy with suppliers and contributions  to sustainability; the suppliers win  through cost reductions, exclusivity in  delivery, priority in the receipt of cargo  and management of the reverse logistics;  and the transporters have an extra gain  from the extra freight and optimization of  vehicles, which formerly returned empty  from the drop points. The project also benefits the  environment, since one of the main  results is the reduced CO2 emissions and  kilometers travelled.  The graphic below  permits analysis of these savings since  2006, when the project was launched,  through 2010.  103  2010 Annual and Sustainability Report  recognition IN 2010, GRUPO PO DE ACAR RECEIVED IMPORTANT PRIZES THAT REFLECT THE MARKET  RECOGNITION OF ITS EFFORTS AND THE GROUPS COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY.
