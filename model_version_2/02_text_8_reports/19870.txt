The electronic document is available at Baosteel website  (http://www.baosteel.com).   The year 2011 marks the beginning of the 12th Five- year Plan period as well as the start of Baosteels new- round plan. In the context of profound changes in econom- ic situations at home and abroad, the world steel industry  has entered the era of meager profit where enterprises  gain low profit at high cost. In face of volatile economic cir- cumstances and increasingly intense market competition,  all staff of Baosteel presses ahead with joint efforts and  support of all stakeholders, achieving the goal to maintain  the Corporations leading position in the industry, with the  annual total revenue amounting to RMB316.2 billion and  the profit totaling RMB18.2 billion. Baosteel has been listed  among the Fortune Global 500 for eight consecutive years,  ranked 212th in 2010. Recognized and was as one of the  worlds most admired companies.Moreover Baosteel won  the second Chinese Industry Award and the sixth China  Charity Award.  With a years painstaking efforts, we have made the  aforesaid achievements, and have gained a deeper un- derstanding of fulfilling our social responsibility towards  the future. In the new era of meager profit, Baosteel puts  forward the corporate vision to become the leader of  steel technology, the driver of green industry, the corpo- rate model for common development of employees and  enterprises, which embodies our thoughts and reflections  on our value and responsibility and encourages us to fulfill  our responsibilities in day-to-day operation. In 2011, with  regard to strategic deployment, Baosteel continued to  implement the national industrial development program,  steadily pushed forward strategic adjustment and gained  initial success in this regard; in order to maintain its edge  in technologies, Baosteel established a national key labora- tory on auto-use steel development and application, set  up the Baosteel-Australia Joint R&D Center, and success- fully put high-induction oriented silicon steel into use in  major national projects. As for production and operation,  Baosteel improved the asset performance and was commit- ted to building an operation mechanism catering to cus- tomers. In respect of environment management, Baosteel  Address By chairman Green Declaration and Product Environment Declaration  has been issued, aiming to promote energy conservation  and emission reduction. As for human resources develop- ment, we adhered to the people-centered principle to help  employees realize their ambition in the development of  the Corporation, and formulated the medium- and long- term team building plans. In terms of management reform,  we have practiced the tenure system for operators of the  Corporation on a trial basis, in order to fully stimulate the  motive and vitality.  Towards 2012, the era of meager profit for the iron  and steel industry is likely to carry on and the global eco- nomic downturn will continue to exert noticeable influence  upon Chinas export-oriented iron & steel industry, as well  as its downstream industries such as shipbuilding, home  appliances manufacturing and machinery. As the economic  growth pattern of the world changes, developed countries  are reaching down while emerging economies are striving  to catch up, and the manufacturing industry of China will  face pressure coming from both sides. Meanwhile, with a  slowdown of the demand growth, homogenous competi- tion among iron and steel enterprises will be increasingly  intense. Despite all the above, well keep to our belief that  the ultimate value of an enterprise lies in its contributions  to peoples well-being and the fulfillment of its social re- sponsibility. By firmly seizing the opportunity of industrial  transformation and upgrading of national economy in the  12th Five-year Plan period and the opportunity of restruc- turing of the iron and steel industry, Baosteel will give full  play to its advantages accumulated over the past 30-plus  years in technology, management, service and brand build- ing, unswervingly implement the strategy of quality prod- uct plus scale economy, pursue scientific development and  seek to become the best and the most competitive, so as  to better undertake our social responsibility. Those bound  to go far never rush, but keep a rapid speed. On the long  path of creating value and undertaking responsibility, our  pursuit knows no ends and our steps are as firm as ever.  Chairman / 03 02 Address by Leaders   and magnetic material to further utilize wastes, bringing both  social and economic benefits. With its technological strength,  Baosteel Engineering Technology Group actively tapped into  the energy conservation and environment protection field. Its  low-carbon intelligent industrial furnace technology and in- novative green operation reduces the energy consumption per  ton steel by more than 10%. On July 18, 2011, at the release  ceremony of 2010 Baosteel CSR Report, Baosteel Building  System Integration Co. Ltd. was officially established, marking  Baosteels entry into the civilian housing steel structure mar- ket and another attempt in the green industry. The systematic  environment management is a sacred mission challenging our  sense of responsibility and creativity. In the future, well carry  forward the mission by centering on green production, green  products and green industry.  As for our employees, I once said that to fulfill its social  responsibility, Baosteel must first and foremost take good care  of its over 100,000 employees which account for one 10,000th  of Chinas total population of more than 1 billion. We should  be responsible by creating favorable working environment  and providing conditions and opportunities for their career  development. Employees are of great importance to a com- pany, because they represent the most creative production  factor. Baosteel owes its leading position in the world iron and  steel industry to its employees contributions. Based on such  a concept, the vision of common development of employees  and enterprises has been materialized and practiced. In 2011,  we formulated a medium- and long-term talent develop- ment strategy, and was committed to building a mechanism  featuring sufficient incentive, fair distribution and sustainable  development, improving the performance-oriented, coordi- nation-encouraging, fair and just assessment and regulation  mechanism, constantly pushing forward the key talent projects  like the Golden Apple Program and the Green Apple Program,  building an assessment-driven mechanism involving survey  of employees devotion to their work and report on their  career development as final tests, and constantly enhancing  employees quality and optimizing the staff structure. Attach- ing importance to communication between the Corporation  and the employees and the satisfaction of employees mate- rial and spiritual needs, Baosteel has taken substantial steps  in implementing work in the employees vital interests such  as Baosteel Housing Subsidy Plan for Young Employees. All  these measures have created a favorable atmosphere for inte- grating the interests of the employees and the enterprise and  highlighted Baosteels humanistic consideration in fulfilling its  social responsibility.  Philosopher Immanuel Kant once said two things awe  me most, the starry sky above me and the moral law within  me. As for an enterprise, it is our highest moral law to sin- cerely fulfill our social responsibility. Baosteel is devoted to de- veloping a commercial environment that help create shared  value, working closely with all stakeholders, and growing into  a company of endearment with the most complete sincer- ity. Address By president When writing up a message for the CSR report for the  third time, I find that I have more to share rather than less.  In 2009, I expressed my understanding of Baosteels social  responsibility, i.e., value creation, integrity in operation and  environment improvement are the three pillars, while the staff,  community and supply chain are the top priorities. In 2010, I  shared my idea on the sustainable development of the iron  and steel industry, and put forward that Baosteel should take  an environment-friendly way. In this years message, I would  like to discuss with you Baosteels future, in other words, what  will become of Baoteel?  In the new-round development plan, Baosteel provides  clear-cut answers to this question. We are to become the  leader of steel technology, the driver of green industry, the  corporate model for common development of employees and  enterprises. But we still have a long way to go to materialize  this vision. As is known to all, the iron and steel industry today  is faced with grave challenges. Baosteel presses ahead towards  its dream in spite of all the difficulties. In this process I think  environment-friendly operation is our responsibility and will be  our new competitive edge, while employees are the strength  we should rely on most.  Environment management is a significant part of Bao- steels new-round strategy, covering all sectors of procure- ment, production, marketing, research and development. It  serves as a guide in enhancing Baosteels competitiveness and  improving our routine work as well. In 2011, the idea of envi- ronment management has been gradually translated into ac- tion plans in all parts of our operation. In energy conservation  and emission reduction, we have done better than planned in  terms of such indicators as the overall energy consumption per  ton steel and overall energy consumption per RMB10,000 out- put value, and the energy conservation rate is 30% higher than  the target. SO2 and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) emission  were respectively 20% and 31% lower than planned. In support  of environment management, a life cycle assessment system  has been preliminarily formed for key products, enabling us  to conduct quantitative assessment upon LCA environmental  performance. Moreover, we have issued Baosteel Green Dec- laration, pledging to work with our partners up and down the  supply chain to pursue sustainable development. This declara- tion is not only a solemn promise of Baosteel to pursue envi- ronment-friendly development, but also a manifesto of Bao- steels sincerity and friendliness. In research and development  of green products, we are to create another miracle. Baosteel  is the first to have realized industrial production of QP steel,  the third generation of high strength steel, and have a stable  capacity for 24 types of ultra high strength steel in nine cat- egories. With the high strength steel by Baosteel applied in the  automobile industry, 21.86 million tons of CO2 can be reduced  each year, which means Baosteels contribution to emission  reduction are as great as a Shennongjia prime forest. In addi- tion, Baosteel subsidiaries also tapped into various new areas  of the green industry.

In this respect, Baosteel is committed to:  Become a corporate model for common  development of staff and the Corporation The strategic plan for the period from 2010 to 2015 states that by 2012, Baosteel is set to realize a revenue of RMB310 billion through business  expansion. Meanwhile, in response to external changes, the Corporation has worked out the strategy of three transformations, i.e. to transform from an  iron and steel enterprise to a material enterprise, from a manufacturer to a service provider and from a domestic company to a global one. It is made  clear that the ratio between the primary operation in iron & steel and other operation should be 7:3, manufacturing and service 2:1, and business home  and abroad 8:2.

Meanwhile, it prepared reports to promote  social responsibility management. It analyzed problems found in the process of report preparation, summarized experience and worked out solutions, so as to  effectively improve the fulfillment of the Corporations social responsibility by integrating positive development of the social responsibility system.   Organization Structure Responsibility Promotion Process of CSR Report Preparation Accepting the leadership of various promotion groups in the longitudinal direction and being subject  to the business block coordination in the lateral direction.  Fostering the Culture of Responsibility  In August 2011, Bayi Iron & Steel organized a special training ses- sion on Baosteels corporate social responsibility (CSR), for company  leaders and mid-level management staff. During the training session, Bao- steels social responsibility concept and day-to-day operation of its man- agement departments, as well as the whole system were introduced, and  Baosteels efforts to fulfill its social responsibilities in previous years were  presented to the management staff attending the session.  In December, 2011, Baosteels CSR report preparation group held a  training course where Yin Gefei, Deputy Director of WTO Guide, was invit- ed to give instructions on ISO26000 and key points in preparing a quality  CSR report. Experts from Baosteel also shared their experience in prepar- ing the report and benchmarking with advanced companies in the world.  CSR Research In 2011, to get to know risks for the sustainable development of the  environment and communities in Shanghai, answering the requirement of  residents for environmental protection and improve its relationship with  communities, Baosteel launched the Research on Risks for the Sustainable  Development of a City-based Iron and Steel Enterprise and Countermea- sures.  The project group has sent questionnaires to over 240 residents  in 10km around the production base in Shanghai to know their feelings  about the surround environment as well as their complaints and sugges- tions, analyzed major elements influencing their feelings about the envi- ronment and the relationship between the enterprise and communities,  worked out major methods to improve such feelings and relationship.  This research project helped Baosteel to identify stake holders re- quirement in environment and community, so as to improve its capability  of sustainable development.

Special regulation of project con- struction Efforts were made to effectively imple- ment the rectification measures for the promi- nent problems identified in 2010; moreover, self- examination and self-correction was organized  for another 77 projects worth RMB21.9 billion,  thus promoting the standardization, efficiency,  safety and cleanness.  2.  Special regulation of little coffers Special inspection was made upon the  implementation of rectification measures in this  regard to reinforce standardized management  of presents and cash gifts, improve related rules  and internal control procedures upon bank ac- count management and monetary fund manage- ment. Two little coffers were dealt with in a  strict way and the related personnel and leaders  were punished according to discipline regula- tions.  3.  Special Inspection With a focus on implementing the 3+1  decision-making rule among six other regula- tions, an inspection tour was made to 28 units, in  which 15 common problems plus 3 typical cases  were identified and eight inspection reminders  were issued. In this way, control and supervision  Seek to Establish a Corruption  Prevention and Punishment Frame- work Compatible with Baosteels  Modern Corporate System Through more than four years of explora- tion and practice, an initial framework of corrup- tion prevention and punishment has basically  taken form, encompassing the five major aspects  of anti-corruption education, system improve- ment, supervision, punishment and source con- trol. A closed-loop management mode for anti- corruption has been built with the responsibility  system at the core, the accountability system as  the basis, the discipline inspection and supervi- sion system as the organizational guarantee for  self-construction, systematically promoted, man- aged as a project, and earnestly implemented in  the PDCA pattern.  Reinforce Anti-Corruption Educa- tion A three-level education network involv- ing leaders, managers & authorized personnel,  and ordinary staff has been set up. Aside from  improving the anti-corruption case bank, warn- ing education, demonstration education, risk  informative education of job integrity have been  conducted and made into an institutional ar- rangement. New leaders, reserve talents, as well  as newly-recruited graduates have all received  level-specific anti-corruption education. Disci- pline inspection and supervision organizations  at various levels have effectively promoted risk  informative education of job integrity so that all  operation managers and authorized personnel  can perform their duty according to the regula- tions give proper authorizations and use their  power appropriately. They have also conducted  compliance education among employees, and  made the sensitive posts less so, further improv- ing the pertinence and effectiveness of anti- corruption education.  Strengthen Power Supervision and  Risk Prevention 1. Promote Clean-Handed Conduct of  Leaders Regulations including Opinions on Imple- menting Anti-Corruption Education among  Leaders, Baosteels Regulations on Party Conduct  Construction and Anti-Corruption Responsibil- ity System, and Baosteels Eight Bans for Anti- Corruption have been formulated and revised.  The supporting rules on 3+1 major decisions,  internal control, control upon authorization, and  responsibility investigation have been improved.  2. Enhance Openness and Transpar- ency of Power Operation Given the grim market which only allows  us meager profit, we actively respond to the  sharp competition and the transformation of the  iron & steel industry. With open and transpar- ent power operation at the core and all-round  risk prevention as the focus, we watch over the  leaders decision-making and authorized person- nels allocation of resources. IT-based means are  adopted to push ahead with Five Sunshine Proj- ects in key areas and links, i.e., talent selection  and use, remuneration management, public fund  use (job-related consumption), procurement  and sales, and project operation in a transpar- ent and open manner. It is essential to reinforce  process optimization and control, incorporate  the requirements of clean-handed conduct into  enforcement management and the entire execu- tive process, and constantly enhance the Party  conduct construction and the scientificity of anti- corruption campaign. Such endeavor constitutes  an important part of Baosteels core competitive- ness.  With the Opinions on Implementation  Rules for Reporting Important Clues for Serious  Violations of Laws and Disciplines formulated,  the Corporation intensified case source manage- ment and improved its important case report  system. Through works in this regard, 5 super- vision proposals were issued, 21 defects were  rectified, 11 persons were approached for ad- monishment talks, and 21 leaders were involved  in accountability investigation. Five case study  lectures were held. As thus, the radical rectifica- tion function was further reinforced. 2. Implement the Ban System Efforts continued to implement the Opin- ions on Implementation of Publicizing the List of  Bribery Units and Related Ex-Employees. The 8th  banned list consisted of 11 units and 396 people,  making a total of 179 units and 1,472 people  prohibited from doing business with Baosteel. Reinforce Construction of the Dis- cipline Inspection & Supervision  System The Corporation provided job specifi- cations and team competence model for the  discipline inspection and supervision force,  expanded the career development path for rel- evant personnel, promoted the communication  and exchanges among leaders of the discipline  inspection and supervision teams and staff ex- change between different units. 23 outstanding  young and mid-aged employees with excellent  professional skills, management experience, and  policy understanding were selected for the staff  exchange, and 20 of them were transferred or  promoted to management positions or Party  Committees. A talent cultivation mode for the  discipline inspection and supervision system has  been established, comprising the five segments  political awareness, intensive training, experience  exploration, learning in action and practical train- ing. In 2011, the Corporation sent 80-plus people  to attend systematic training programs held  by the CPC Central Commission for Discipline  Inspection, the Discipline Inspection Commis- sion of the State-owned Assets Supervision and  Administration Commission of the State Council  and Shanghai Discipline Inspection Commission;  conducted exchanges with central enterprises  like Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Company  and China Eastern Airlines, held workshops for  secretaries of grassroots discipline inspection  commissions and heads of supervision depart- ments. The Discipline Inspection and Supervi- sion Department of the Corporation organized  professional training aimed at arousing passion,  boosting profession and enhancing value, in a  bid to constantly enhance the teams capability  to fulfill their responsibilities.  / 27 26 Honest Business  Direct Economic Performance  In 2011, despite of the slowdown of demand growth, the rising costs and overcapacity in the iron  and steel industry on the whole, Baosteel remained in the leading position in the market of iron and  steel, its major market, presented sound overall performance and good development prospect in various  industries in a well-defined industrial structure, and was becoming the powerhouse for further develop- ment of the whole group and a strong balancing force amid fluctuations of the iron and steel industry.

Its engineering technol- ogy section accelerated the industrialization of R&D results for  special equipment and technology, and the LF complete equip- ment technology, high-temperature smoke waste heat recycling  equipment, and NDT equipment successfully achieved industrial  application; its intensive metal processing focused on develop- ment of products and technology including high-performance  steel thread cutting and reducing the thickness of DI materi- als for can making; breakthrough was made in R&D of high- performance steel thread cutting, new progress was achieved  in reducing the weight of two-piece can and the 0.115mm cut  thread was developed; DI material for steel can was completely  shifted from 0.225mm to 0.220mm; emerging industrial projects  such as the demonstration project of using exhaust gases from  Improvement of Assets Operation Efficiency Improvement of assets operation efficiency was a key strategic measure of Baosteel for crises and  optimization of resource allocation in recent years, and was a systematic and long-term task. Baosteel  in an all-round manner pushed forward management of assets operation efficiency, stressed the output  efficiency of investment in its business and began to emphasis resource optimization and efficient return  in addition to profit growth. By improving the assets operation efficiency, Baosteel had reduced the tie- up of assets and presented a smart balance sheet. In response to progress of management of assets operation efficiency, Baosteel introduced the  operating result evaluation indicator system centering economic value added, which satisfies the de- mands for both shareholders benefit and utilization efficiency of the entire assets, and identifies the  target for assets operation efficiency tasks.  Baosteel actively sought for methods and philosophy for improvement of assets operation ef- ficiency, carefully summarized good practices and promotes them within the group, and was develop- ing supporting incentive mechanism to bring the Corporation and all employees with unprecedented  opportunities and challenges. Each unit based on their own characteristics proposed various methods  and ideas for improvement of assets operation efficiency and carried out effective works with initial  results. Guided by such ideas, each unit not only made innovation in terms of environmental operation,  development of both industrial business and financial business and investment decision, but also won  achievements in traditional sectors including inventory management, process streamline and plan con- trol by combining IT and the ideas of economic value added. At the end of 2011, Baosteel Daily for three  consecutive days presented full-page reports on 17 best practices of nine companies. The paper also  presented public appraisal of best practices which came out with five winners.

Based on achievements made in 2010, Baosteel in 2011 continued to optimize its energy manage- ment, improve its general operation level of energy management system, and in an all-round manner  pushed forward certification of energy management system. In this year, Stainless Steel Division, Special  Steel Division, Meishan Iron & Steel and Baotong Iron & Steel passed energy management system cer- tification; Ningbo Steel officially started energy management system certification work; Bayi Iron & Steel  also started the certification work following establishment of its energy management system promotion  leading group and management office.  Environmental Management System  Baosteel believes that the standards of en- vironmental management system are the foun- dation for environmental management. Baosteel  Co., Ltd. was the first in Chinas steel industry to  start the ISO14001 environmental management  system certification and the first to pass the cer- tification. At present, all steel production units  under Baosteel Co., Ltd. have all been certified to  be in conformance to ISO14001. Bayi Iron & Steel passed the ISO14001  certification for environmental management sys- tem in 2005.  Ningbo Steel, a new steel enterprise, was  in the process of the ISO14001 certification for  environmental management system. Baosteel promoted the standards of en- vironmental management system to strengthen  fundamental management of industrial enter- prises involving environmental management. At  present, most of the industrial enterprises with  diverse industries have passed the ISO14001 cer- tification for environmental management system.  In 2008, Baosteel issued management  documents requiring its iron & steel production  units to organize cleaner production review, and  in 2011 issued the Three-year Action Plan for  Cleaner Production and Performance Improve- ment in 2011-2013, and invited experts from  Shanghai to give lectures to competent leader- ship, managerial team of energy and environ- mental protection and production backbones of  each unit.  In 2011, among all enterprises in Shang- hai, Baosteel Co., Ltd. (HQ) and Baosteel-NSC/ Arcelor Automotive Steel Sheets Co., Ltd for the  first time applied for and passed the cleaner pro- duction review; the Stainless Steel Division and  Special Steel Division also passed the cleaner  production re-examination. Meanwhile, Baosteel  Chemical, Shanghai Baoyi Can Co., Ltd, Shanghai  Baosteel Chemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai Baosteel  Packing Material Co, Ltd., and Shanghai Baotian  New Building Material Co., Ltd. with diverse  industries also passed the cleaner production  review. Enterprises out of Shanghai including  Bayi Iron & Steel, Suzhou Metallurgical Heavy,  Shaoguan Iron & Steel Group, Hebei Can Making  Co., Ltd. and those settled in Shanghai includ- ing Shanghai Kede Company, Jiangnan Rolls  Company, the Technology and Machine Building  Division all launched cleaner production review  works.  In 2011, Baosteel developed 160 cleaner  production plans for material conservation,  energy conservation, technique optimization  and emission reduction through promotion of  cleaner production review, which was expected  to bring benefits of RMB946,000,000 and re- markably reduced energy consumption in 37 of  the 68 iron and steel production processes com- pared to 2010.  Environment Accounting Research  Project Baosteel pays close attention to environ- mental issues and has been labeled scientific  management, superior steel and environmental  protection. Facing more and more harsh envi- ronmental requirements, Baosteel chooses to  actively meet challenges. It proposes the strat- egy of environment operation, raising environ- ment operation to a strategic level. To support  the strategy goals of environment operation,  Baosteel launched the project of Environment  Accounting Theory and Practice.  The project involved SASAC and Ministry  of Finance, with National Accounting Institute  in charge of research works and Baosteel as the  responsible party. One and half years later, it  came up with the Report of Baosteel on Environ- ment Accounting Theory and Practice (consisting  of analysis and result application), which met  domestic and international accounting theories  and highlighted the operational practices of  Baosteel. The research for the first time the role  of environment management in both financial  accounting and management accounting, pro- vided favorable advices on macro policy and  implementation, and would serve as guidance  for environment accounting practices of domes- tic enterprises.  SASAC, Ministry of Finance and Shang- hai National Accounting Institute highly com- mended the research. Experts believed that the  environment management idea of Baosteel met  the development trends of the mainstream soci- ety, conformed to Chinese macro situation and  the energy conservation and emission reduction  tendency; and that it serves to guide enterprises  to implement strategies, establish scientific view  on business performance, find out and improve  environment management deficiencies, make up  management insufficiencies, build up competi- tiveness, and achieve sustainable development.  Experts also expressed that this was an issue  extensively concern by the society and with great  significance at state level.  Education and Training In 2011, Baosteel enhanced training on  energy management and energy management  system, application of energy conservation  and emission reduction technology, cleaner  production and environment management and  situation of and police for energy conservation  and emission reduction during the 12th Five- year Plan. There were 24 training courses, 27  classes and 1,058 trainees. The Corporation also  organized innovation forum, innovation saloon  and special workshops on green steel produc- tion and sustainable development of enterprises,  covering subjects such as low-carbon develop- ment of steel industry, development of green  industry and green energy, and key technolo- gies and countermeasures for energy conserva- tion and emission reduction in steel industry. In  this year, Baosteel developed five online course- ware, namely environment management and  energy conservation and emission reduction of  Baosteel, energy management system, foun- dation and assessment of energy management,  energy conservation technology application and  case study, and energy audit and case study,  laying a solid foundation for online training  within Baosteel.

It adopts internation- ally advanced energy conservation and emis- sion reduction technology to control pollutant  discharge from the source, improve energy and  resource utilization rate, constantly make prog- ress and build Baosteel a clean factory of inter- national standard.  Baosteel adopted a series of important  energy conservation and emission reduction  measures, such as dry coke quenching technol- ogy, coal moisture technology in coke oven,  recovery of sensible heat of sinter, sintering gas  waste heat recovery, power generation by waste  pressure of furnace, Blast furnace oxygen-en- riched coal spray technology, converter coal gas  cleaning and recovery technology, gas-steam  recycle power generation technology, and so on.  In the field of air pollution control, Bao- steel adopted high-efficient bag-type dust col- lector and electric dust collector, as well as effec- tive unorganized dust control measure to reduce  dust emission. It also controlled SO2 emission by  controlling the sulfur content in crude fuel and  installing stack gas desulfurization devices in sin- tering machines and power plants.  Baosteel also reduced consumption of  new water and emission of waste water through  dry coke quenching, converter coal gas dry  method dedusting and furnace coal gas dry  method dedusting technologies, and supply at  water quality, reuse of reclaimed water, rainwa- ter and sewage separation, reuse of moat water,  standard sewage discharge and so on.  Baosteel constantly enhanced the process  of solid by-products returning to production  through technical innovation and management  optimization, thus expanded the channels for  comprehensive social utilization, raised the  added value, and increased the utilization rate of  solid by-products.  Baosteel also developed green and low- carbon technology with independent IPR in fields  of thin strip continuous casting, sintering gas  recycling and emission reduction, and steel slag  cylinder processing.  Baosteels industrial enterprises with di- verse industries were not left behind in energy  conservation and emission reduction though  they had less energy demands. They eliminated  backward and adopted advanced technologies  or implemented innovation of energy conserva- tion technology to constantly improve energy  efficiency and reduce pollutant discharge.  The heat treatment factory of Baoling  Heavy under Baosteel Engineering & Technol- ogy Group Co., Ltd. installed special atmosphere  ovens and mid-frequency hardening equipment  to replace the six salt bath furnaces, and energy- saving med-frequency furnaces to replace the  power frequency melting furnace; its new office  building used energy-saving central air condi- tioning system; Jiangnan Rolls Company under  Baosteel Engineering & Technology used air- source heat pump (mainly used in the off-peak  at night) + solar collector (mainly used at day- time) to heat bathwater, which saved 60,000KWh  of electricity a year.  The logistic company of Baosteel Devel- opment installed solar water heaters on the roof  of the office building (see the picture) to replace  the procured steam water heating system, which  achieved energy conservation and cost-efficien- cy.  Anhui Wanbao Mining Co., Ltd. under  Baosteel Resources believed mining was also en- vironmental recovery and reconstruction. Strictly  in compliance with the National Program for  Eco-environmental Protection, it attached great  importance to eco-environmental protection and  implemented environmental recovery while min- ing to reduce or eliminate negative impact on  the eco-environment.  Shanghai Baoyi Can Co., Ltd under Bao- steel Metals carried out energy conservation  and emission reduction projects such as air  compressor waste heat utilization, cleaning dry- ing furnace frequency conversion, innovation  of ventilation system of production line and  green illumination, which could save 800 tons of  standard coal per year; Hebei Can Making Co.,  Ltd. also under Baosteel Metals used brine after  RO treatment in landscaping, which could save  18,000 tons of fresh water per year and stopped  direct discharge of brine.  Construction of Key Energy-saving  and Environment-friendly Projects Projects are the foundation of energy  conservation and emission reduction. In 2011,  Baosteel launched 130 key Environment-friendly  projects (incl. comprehensive use of resources)  and 73 key energy-saving projects, of which 71  Environment-friendly projects and 47 energy- saving projects were completed. This year also  saw signing of 23 contractual energy manage- ment projects with a total contract value of  RMB510 million.  The No. 1 Steel Plant directly under Bao- steel Co., Ltd. innovated its OG system, which  improved steam recycle up to 70kg/t and re- duced the dust content in exhaust gas to less  than 35mg/Nm3; the 1550 continuous annealing  unit were innovated for energy conservation;  Ningbo Baoxin completed energy conservation  innovation of its 1# rolling mill; the power plant  launched denitration innovation of 1/2# units  and completed that of No. 1 unit; Meishan Steel  and Baotong Iron & Steel were equipped with  desulfurization system for their sintering process.  To make full use of by-product coal  gas, Bayi Iron & Steel completed 4# 220t coal  power-blended boiler and 40MW by-product  coal gas backpressure power generator unit,  and C furnace TRT equipment; the coal yard in  the old plant was moved out, four closed coal  powder bunkers and two closed refined iron  powder bunkers were built to reduce dust pol- lution; launched construction projects of power  generation by waste heat of sintering machine  and intensive treatment and comprehensive  use of industrial sewage, sintering machine gas  desulfurization and coke oven ground dedusting  station in the old plant.  Ningbo Steel completed the 135MW  waste heat power plant and low-pressure steam  power generator unit which produced power by  surplus coal gas and produced steam for energy  conservation and emission reduction; completed  the closed raw material silo; and was pushing  forward the sintering machine gas desulfuriza- tion project and Ningbo Steel-Ningbo Baoxin  Energy Corridor project. Baoshan Branch of Baosteel Chemical  finished its Phase 1, 2, 3 of phenol waste water  postposition denitrification project to ensure  compliance with the new sewage discharge  standard for nitrogen content. Meishan Steel  optimized its onsite environmental protection  facilities to eliminate source of off-flavor and  protect health of the staff. To support project  environmental protection examination, it carried  out exhaust gas treatment in seven areas includ- ing the benzene products loading/unloading  area, oil depot grease groove and naphthol area,  innovated exhaust gas treatment facilities and  newly added six sets of environmental protection  facilities, which remarkably improved onsite en- vironment quality. Its exhaust gas discharge data  met the standards according to examination by  external qualification auditors.  Baosteel Development continuously im- proved comprehensive use of steel by-product  resources. In 2011, it expanded industrialization  projects including new building material, mag- netic material, waste oil regeneration; achieved  extensive use of steel slag products such as  refined powder, permeable brick, admixture and  shot blast material; constantly pushed forward  Iron and steel production process Main energy-saving technology/measure Main environmental  protection measures Environmental factors Pollutants Measures Raw material Coking Sintering Iron  making Steel making Hot rolling Cold rolling Power plant  Utility General energy-saving  technology such as frequency  conversion General energy-saving  technology such as energy  center, oxygen/nitrogen/argon  liquification, northern energy  corridor, frequency conversion General energy-saving  technology such as low heat  value coal gas combustion,  CCPP, frequent conversion General energy-saving  technology such as  stair-utilization of water, waste  heat recovery, Frequency  conversion General energy-saving technology  such as hot delivery/loading, steel  feed thermal insulation,  pulse-combustion, regenerative  combustion, high-effective thermal  insulation material, heating furnace  flue evaporation cooling, frequency  conversion General energy-saving technology  such as converter coal gas  recovery, steam making by  converter coal gas waste heat,  converter coal gas dry method  dedusting, regenerative ladle  baking, frequency conversion General energy-saving  technology such as thick bed  sintering, sintering waste heat  recovery, sintering gas waste  heat recovery, auto-control,  auto-ignition, frequency  conversion  General energy-saving  technology such as PCI, TRT,  oxygen-enriched blow, blast  heater oxygen-enriched  combustion, blast heater waste  heat recovery, furnace coal gas  dry method dedusting,  frequency conversion General energy-saving  technology such as CDQ,  CMC, auto-control coking  and frequency conversion Fume dust, SO2, NOx,  benzopyrene,  phenol-cyanogen waste water Atmospheric and  water environment Dedusting system, treatment  facilities for phenol-cyanogen  waste water from coking Atmospheric  environment Fume dust, SO2, NOx Sewage, COD Fume dust, SO2, NOx Fume dust, SO2, NOx, noise Fume dust, SO2, NOx, noise Fume dust Dedusting system Atmospheric and  water environment Atmospheric and  sound environment Atmospheric  environment Atmospheric environment Dedusting system, gas  desulfurization equipment,  low nitrogen combustion Dedusting system, waste  gas purification system,  sewage treatment system,  VOCs waste gas heat  combustion facility Dedusting system, low nitrogen  combustion, noise screen Water environment Water supply by quality levels,  water concatenation, water  reuse, rainwater and sewage  separation, standard sewage  discharge Fume dust, SO2, NOx Atmospheric environment Atmospheric environment Dedusting system, gas  desulfurization equipment Dedusting system, clean fuel Dedusting by water  spray, coagulator  spray, and dust screen Dust / 41 40 Environment Management  Baosteel CSR Report Energy Efficiency Renovation of Baosteel  Chemicals Benzene Hydrogenation  Facilities  Baosteel Chemicals Litol Benzene Hydrogenation  Equipment suffered high temperature and pressure, risk in  operation and high energy consumption. To ensure safe  production and energy conservation, it made innovation  in the Phase 1 Litol for energy conservation and emission  reduction by application of advanced low-pressure  hydrogenation technology, demonstrating its social  responsibility and meeting the business demands.  The innovated equipment brought good performances  in energy conservation and environmental protection.  According to statistics in 2009, Litol the energy consumption  per ton of chemical (excluding consumption by general  support) was 302.6kg standard coal, and after innovation  the figure dropped to 204.5kg, saving approximately 100kg  standard coal. The amount of waste water also dropped.  Statistics showed that about 2.13 tons of waste water was  produced per year during Litol operation, and it dropped to  1.18 tons after innovation, decreasing nearly 50%. Pollutant  generation per ton of product was also obviously cut down:  COD and nitrogenous substances generation per ton of  product dropped by 68.64% and 37.52% compared with  those generated by Litol.  The innovation in 2011 passed the engineering  examination of Shanghai Municipality, and was awarded  Shenan Cup of Engineering Construction of Shanghai for its  safety.  case B a o s t e e l  C h e m i c a l  P i o n e e r s  T e s t  Technology of Organics in Coking Waste  Water  After 20 minutes pre-treatment, the technology allows  accurate rating of about 200 volatile and semi volatile  organics in coking waste water without using any organic  solvent. Baosteel Chemical is the first Chinese coking  enterprise that pioneers the solid phase micro-extraction— GC-MS test of organics in coking waste water. Compared  with traditional technology, it allows accurate, rapid, simple  and Environment-friendly test of various organics in coking  waste water.  By present, popular test methods in China suffer  restrictions. For instance: headspace gas chromatography  is simple and rapid but lacked in accuracy, and could only  be used for testing volatile organic constituents; purge and  trap is a deplete extraction, which is accurate but requires  complicated and expensive instruments, and is inapplicable  to onsite test; liquid-liquid extraction is the most simple way,  but is complicated in operation, takes long time, is hard in  automation and have to use a large amount of toxic organic  solvents; SPE, which is simple and requires few organic  solvents, is known of multiple processes, easy to cause loose  of constituents, and is limited to test of organics with low  volatility.  Compared to popular pre-treatment methods such as  liquid-liquid extraction, GC-MS requires only 20 minutes.  The rapid, simple and Environment-friendly technology is  able to test volatile and semi volatile organics, thus could  be extensively applied to coking enterprises. Without using  a single organic solvent in the entire process, it is indeed a  green technology.  case Nice environment in the plant area of Baosteel Co., Ltd.

It was honored 2011 Influential  Enterprise of Resource Comprehensive Utiliza- tion by China Association of Resource Compre- hensive Utilization. Baosteel Co., Ltd. continuously pushed  forward its energy conservation plan. Based on  the successful plans for energy-efficient power  plant and high-efficient kiln and furnace in  the previous year, it developed and launched  four energy conservation plans, namely high- efficient electric machine, air compression  energy conservation, waste heat recovery and  utilization and recycled water system energy  conservation, as well as 40 projects, which are  expected to save 90,000 tons of standard coal.  Meishan Steel under Baosteel Co., Ltd. an- alyzed potential points in fields of electric sys- tem, coal gas system, oxygen, nitrogen and  argon system, air compression and others to  identify objectives and measures for harmonious  development of the society and the enterprise. It  developed the 12th Five-year Plan for Innovation  of Energy and Environmental Protection Tech- nologies which identified 175 energy conserva- tion and emission reduction projects to support  the improvement of energy and environmental  protection systems during 12th Five-year Plan.  Environmental Landscaping Baosteel Co., Ltd. made efforts to improve  landscaping fruits in compliance with the 12th  Five-year Plan. The HQ developed the 2011- 2015 Plan for Green Land Improvement in the  Plants of Baosteel Co., Ltd. HQ. In 2011, the total  innovative green lands reached 111,300 square  meters, including 32,500 square meters of newly  added green lands. The Stainless Steel Division,  in spite of increasing land demand for produc- tion, made rational arrangement in the plant and  achieved a landscaped rate of nearly 30%, or an  area of 900,000 square meters. The Special Steel  Division since 2007 had implemented the annual  landscaping project to make a nice-looking plant  area, and had recorded newly added green lands  of 160,000 square meters, or a landscaped rate  over 30%.  In recent years, Bayi Iron & Steel had  invested over RMB10 million each year in land- scaping of neighboring barren hills, the plant  area and living areas. In 2011, it invested dozens  of millions yuan in a series of landscaping proj- ects such as phase 1 landscaping of a 30-hectare  area, dump landscaping and tailing dam land- scaping, and registered 54,000 participants in  volunteer tree planting, 62,000 square meters of  newly added green lands, and 442,600 planted  trees. Thanks to the efforts, the plant area and  living area saw a green coverage of 45.3% and  50.01% respectively.  In 2011, Ningbo Steel accelerated the  landscaping project in support of its new proj- ects. Landscaping tasks were enhanced in the  plant area, achieving 20,000 square meters of  new green lands and a green coverage of 23%.  / 43 42 Environment Management  Baosteel CSR Report Green Products Product Life Cycle Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a quanti- tative assessment of environment burden and  impact during the product lifecycle. It is an en- vironment management and accounting tool of  Baosteels environment management strategy,  and more importantly, a systematic idea and way  to support the strategy. Baosteels key research  project LCA-based research on the production  process and environmental friendliness of Bao- steels products is launched on this basis. The  projects included four R&D programs and 15  sub-programs involving 18 internal units of Bao- steel.  In 2011, Baosteel achieved breakthrough  in LCA research and the fruits were applied to  the environmental declaration of its products.  It also developed the rules for environmental  declaration, namely Iron & Steel Product Classi- fication Rules (PCR), and for the first time issued  environment declaration for its hot rolling, cold  rolling, hot galvanizing, electro-galvanizing, and  electrotinning products covering information of  production, transport and safe service, product  lifecycle, recycling and final disposal. The dec- larations were certified by the third party and  approved to use the green leaf label. The decla- rations provided domestic counterparts and the  public with verifiable and quantitative environ- ment performance data of iron and steel prod- ucts, and demonstrated the leading technology  and social responsibility of Baosteel.  Non-oriented silicon steel sheet is one of  the major materials for air-conditioner compres- sors, accounting 20% of the total cost. High- grade non-oriented silicon steel sheet could  obviously improve the efficiency and quality of  compressor. Silicon steel products with better  performance might slightly increase the environ- ment burden during the production process;  nevertheless, they would remarkably reduce that  during the service period. LCA provides a sys- tematic and scientific way to assess the energy  conservation and emission reduction result of  steel products with better performance.  In 2011, Baosteel cooperated with down- stream air-conditioner compressor makers in the  non-oriented silicon steel sheet air-conditioner  compressors whole process LCA. The findings  showed that a kilogram of silicon steel B35A300  increased carbon emission by 0.09% in produc- tion, but reduced that by 3.8% while applied to  air-conditioner compressors. Provide that the  annual production volume of B35A300 compres- sor was 1 million, the annual CO2 emission would  be reduced by 857,000 tons.  Environment-friendly Products Iron and Steel Products Environment-friendly products refer to the  products that can save the resources, lower the  consumption and reduce the pollutants emis- sion, and have a small negative influence on the  quality of environment and health of people.  Judging from the manufacturing process, the  environment-friendly products made of steel  & iron have the characteristics of low compre- hensive energy consumption and low carbon  emission; judging from the application, these  products have the characteristics of light weight,  easy processing, easy maintenance, non-toxicity  and innoxiousness, prolonged service life and  improved efficiency, etc. Note: (  )marks new products of 2011 Preventing global warming Reducing workload of environmental risk  management Creating a society of circular economy Saving energy and reducing CO2 emission Reducing workload of environmental protection  and hazardous chemical control Extend service life with recycling Automobile     Reduced weight and increased safety  High-strength sheets, wires and bars     Simplifying customers processing   technology  Laser welded plates  Hot-formed parts  Hydro-formed parts     Environment-friendly materials Lead-free hot-galvanized steel sheets Lead-free easy-cutting steel Chromium-free  galvanized sheet for automobiles     Reducing noise and vibration Composite damping plate     Prolonging service life and reducing wastes Hot galvanized high-strength steel (DP) Electro-galvanized high strength steel (TRIP, DP) Stainless steel for automobile exhaust systems High-strength weathering steel Food &  beverages     Reducing weight of beverage cans Reducing thickness of DI materials Home appliances     Simplifying customers processing technology  Pre-painted steel sheets for home appliances Electrical steel with self-bonding coating Hot-galvanized steel sheet with self lubricating  film     Improving motor efficiency High-efficiency non-oriented electrical steel     Materials containing no environmentally  hazardous substances Lead-free hot-galvanized steel sheet Chromium-free hot galvanized sheet for home  appliances Chromium-free galvanized sheet for home  appliances Chromium-free hot Al-Zn-coated sheet for  home appliances Chromium-free pretreated pre-painted sheet  for home appliances     Prolonging service life and reducing wastes Hot-dip Al-Zn coated series products Hot galvanized series products Electro-galvanized series products Pre-painted series products Antibacterial stainless steel Ferrite stainless steel for home electrical  appliances industry(  ) Power and energy     Improving the efficiency of power generation High-temperature high-pressure boiler pipe Stainless steel for hydropower service(  )     Improving the efficiency of energy transport High-strength high-ductility pipeline steel High- induction oriented electrical steel     Reducing energy consumption Stainless steel for solar energy generation  service(  )     Improving the efficiency of power generation High-pressure boiler pipe  High-strength steel pipe Tubes for nuclear power generation service Stainless steel for nuclear power generation  service(  )     Prolonging service life Steel for chemical storage tanks Steel for petroleum storage tanks High-sulfur-resistance tubing and casing Construction  and civil  engineering     Improving the efficiency of construction High-strength high-ductility thick plate Thick steel plate for high-heat-input welding     Prolonging service life High-strength enameled steel High-strength structural steel for buildings High-tensile-strength wires Self-cleaning pre-painted steel sheet High-ductility high-strength structural steel pipe High-strength fire-resistant weathering steel High-durability pre-painted steel sheet High-strength ferrite stainless steel for building    faade  Others     Simplifying customers processing technology Non-quenched and tempered steel     Prolonging service life High-strength vulnerable stainless steel for    railway freight car Environmental benefits Downstream industries Silicon steel sheet production Service process of compressor B50AY-2 B35A300 22,644 25,000 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 0 39 21,786 17 Silicon steel sheet production (kg) Service process of compressor (kg) Total (kg) B50AY-2  39 22,605 22,644 B35A300 17 21,769 21,786 Silicon steel product used in one compressor: / 45 44 Environment Management  Baosteel CSR Report Baosteel products are commonly seen in our daily life covering home appli- ances, automobile, beverage cans, coins and tableware.

By virtue of its  modern monitoring and information technology,  its energy center technology manages to con- duct all-round monitoring and management on  actual energy performance, energy plan, energy  balance and consumption analysis through gath- ering, processing, analysis and overall scheduling  of onsite energy data. In recent years, the tech- nology was introduced  and applied to Chinese  steel industry and made great achievements in  energy saving and emission reduction. In view  of the tougher situation of energy saving and  emission reduction in China, building materi- als, chemical and heavy equipment industries  of are actively seeking for energy conservation  and emission reduction in an information-based  way. Baosight Software has grasped the market  opportunity and explored business of trans- sector energy management system. In 2011, the  energy management system of China First Heavy  Industries was put into operation. Undertaken  by Baosight Software, this was a model project  of energy conservation and emission reduction  in Chinese heavy equipment industry, as well as  the first energy management project by Baosight  Software in this sector.  Baosteel Energy: Contractual Energy  Management Shanghai Baosteel Energy Technology Co.,  Ltd. (Baosteel Energy), a new company engaging  in business of energy saving and emission reduc- tion, centered on its business principle of re- source integration, mode design, system devel- opment set in early 2011, reviewed its business  lines and identified four business areas namely  energy management consultant, waste heat  and energy recovery and utilization, energy- efficient blast blower and pump and energy- efficient building.  In January 2011, Baosteel Energy regis- tered with NDRC as a national energy-saving  service, and became a member of EMCA. In this  year, the Company provided Baosteel and ex- ternal users with professional solutions and ser- vices in recovery and utilization of waste heat &  Green Production Performance In 2011, Baosteel continued to implement the energy conservation  and emission reduction spirit of the central government and the Group,  spared no efforts to push forward various tasks and successfully fulfilled  the annual plan. In this year, comprehensive energy consumption per  ton steel dropped by 5kg standard coal compared with that of the an- nual plan, energy consumption per RMB10,000 output value dropped by  4.5%, the amount of save energy exceeded 30% on a year-on-year basis,  and emission of SO2 and COD lowered by 19.6% and 31% respectively.  energy, energy-efficient blast blower and pump  and energy-efficient building. It implemented 23  contractual energy management projects with  a total expected investment of RMB300 million,  which is equivalent to saving 106,000 tons of  standard coal and reducing carbon emission by  275,600 tons.  Meanwhile, in view of the brand new busi- ness mode of contractual energy management,  Baosteel Energy organized both internal and  external resources for the research of business  mode of contractual energy management, which  was of great significance to unifying understand- ing of contractual energy management, standard  operation, improving operation efficiency, and  promoting the in-depth development of energy  saving and emission reduction task.  In 2011, the pilot implementation plan for  remanufacturing of the Industrial Technology  Service Company under BSEG was approved by  the Ministry of Industry and Information Tech- nology, marking the Companys new progress  into industrialized remanufacturing in roller and  copper plate sector after it had become one of  the first pilot enterprise of remanufacturing in  electrical and mechanical industry.  Steel-structured Building In July 2005, Baosteel officially partici- pated in the Living Steel project of the Interna- tional Iron and Steel Institute. (which is world  steel Association now) For years, the team of  Baosteel has established and kept improving the  complete technology system of steel-structured  housing through the rotation development  of scientific research and engineers. In 2009 it  undertook the all-steel-structured housing pro- gram (75,000 square meters) of Happy Home  in Dujiangyan; in 2010 it undertook the reloca- tion housing project (72,000 square meters) in  Tiexi District of Shenyang; technical level of its  independently developed steel shear wall and  panel joint was reviewed and approved by the  Ministry of Housing and Urban-rural Develop- ment and local Administration of Housing and  Urban-rural Development, and were applied to  the steel-structured demonstration communities  respectively in Dujiangyan and Wuhan, and won  nine national patents (seven approved).  Steel-structured buildings are pre-fabri- cated, and could shorten the construction period  by 1/3-1/2 compared with traditional buildings.  Since the panel walls are not load bearing space  of the buildings is divided flexibly. Thus, under  equal conditions; it could increase the useful  floor area by 3-8% compared with concrete  structures. Construction of steel structure lowers  CO2 emission by 20-40% compared with tradi- tional structures. The main structure could be  100% recycled, and save resources to avoid envi- ronmental pollution by mass construction wastes On July 18, 2011, Baosteel established  Baosteel Building System Integration Co., Ltd.  was established based on integration of in- ternal steel structure civil architectural design,  R&D, engineering and procurement resources.

National Iron & Steel Natural Science Foundation of  China On August 28, 2000, Baosteel and the National Natural Science  Foundation of China (NSFC) signed an agreement to establish the Iron &  Steel Research Foundation in Beijing. The Foundation gives priority to new  metallurgical technology in urgent need in the steel industry of China, and  to the basic research projects of scientific significance and value of appli- cation with respect to technology, materials, energy, environment, equip- ment, and information. The Foundation encourages innovation, interdisci- plinary research and industry-university-institute collaboration, and gives  top priority to young scientific talents. The Iron & Steel Research Foundation provided funds for more than  50 universities, colleges and research institutes in China, including Tsing- hua University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. More than 300 doctors,  over 500 postgraduates and 25 post-docs from the projects funded by the  Foundation are now working in iron and steel industry and related sectors.  Some project achievements have won the National S&T Progress Awards. The Iron & Steel Research Foundation has focused on the basic  research in iron and steel industry, product development and integrated  product upgrading, as well as the prospective and applied basic research  concerning environmental issues, and laid a solid foundation for and pro- moted the sound sustainable development of the iron and steel industry in  China. The progressive research on silicon steel is approaching the world  level, and does not fully depend upon the imported technology and tech- niques any more. There have been nearly 30 projects on the scientific stud- ies of inclusions and crack control. In the late 20th century in China, only  Baosteel was capable of mass production of X70 pipeline steel that poses  strict requirements for steel smelting and hot-rolling techniques. With the  help of the research projects, nowadays, more than 10 companies in China  can manufacture X80 pipeline steel that is even better than X70 products.  Baosteel is one of the few in the world that can produce the best X120  pipeline steel. The Foundation has also funded basic and applied research  projects such as recovery and utilization of sensible heat in slag, and re- source utilization in low-grade composite mineral deposits. Some achieve- ments have been widely applied in the iron and steel industry, while others  are also put into application in other sectors or industries. By 2011, the Iron & Steel Research Foundation had contributed a  total of RMB86 million (with Baosteel and the NSFC each providing 50% of  the total) to 215 projects. The Foundation has set up an important platform  for basic research in the iron and steel industry in China, and linked the ba- sic and applied research in the industry.

I have a  brother one year younger than I. My dad  and mom have been living a frugal life to  bring my brother and me and send us to  school. I was enrolled in Xinjiang University in 2006 and my brother in Shenyang Jianzhu Univer- sity one year later. I felt truly helpless in the summer vacation of 2010 when I was pondering myself with the  question of how I can help my dad and mom with the heavy burdens on their shoulders. Ive been studying hard since the first day of my college life. I won scholarships every year,  and found part-time jobs in my spare time to earn my living and lessen the family burdens. However, a blow may come at any time. In August 2010 when I was to begin my fourth year  in college, my dad got acute pleurisy and had an operation, and was unfortunately diagnosed  with diabetes later. My family could no longer make ends meet with my mom's salary of less than  RMB2,000 a month and my brother and I had to face the economic constraints in our life and  study. The biggest problem was our tuition fees for the new academic year. Mom and dad made  a harsh decision that my brother should suspend his study for one year and resume it when I  graduate. How I wish I could graduate one year earlier and spare my brother from a suspension! In  desperation, I got the news that Id won Baosteel Outstanding Student Award as one of the two  winners from minority groups in my university. The RMB5,000 of the scholarship solved my prob- lem at once, and it was like the charcoal in snow for our family. For me, Baosteel Scholarship is not only a financial aid, but also a power to push me forward.  Ive made my mind to do better in future. I am now a postgraduate in Xinjiang University. case case Baosteel CSR Report / 67 66 Social Performance  Seek Mutual Prosperity in Good Faith Baosteel Raw Material Procurement Center, upholding the value concept of faith and honesty,  has established a scientific evaluation system, continuously strengthened the partnership with suppliers  by means of standardizing the admission criteria.

In addition, Baosteel Resources and  Baosight Software have also built their own overseas sales networks. / 75 74 Supply Chain Performance  From 100 Tons to an Exclusive Supplier  In March 2011, the massive earthquake in Japan brought the production of crude  naphthalene to a halt. Kao of Thailand, who had been depending solely on the naphthalene  supply from Japan, was suddenly faced with an emergency. Through various contacts, Kao  in Shanghai, on behalf of Kao in Thailand, placed an urgent order for 100 tons of naphtha- lene with Baosteel Chemical.  Although sympathetic with Thailand Kaos situation, Baosteel Chemical found itself  under enormous pressure in the face of such an urgent order, for it had never exported  any naphthalene at that time. To address such an emergency, Tang Zheng, the sales person  made timely adjustment to the naphthalene sales plan of that month and in the meantime  proactively cooperated with Shanghai Kao for the customs clearance of the export. To ex- port liquid naphthalene, the container filling must be completed on the production site, but  the Baoshan Branch of Baosteel Chemical had never conducted such an operation before.  Through in-depth study on relevant regulations, constant improvement of on-site filling  facilities and repeated confirmation of the height, width and cleanness of the containers to  ensure loading safety and product quality, Baosteel Chemical finally managed to deliver the  100 tons of naphthalene to Thailand Kao in time, and ensured its normal production.  Impressed by Baosteel Chemicals helpfulness, excellent marketing services and strict  quality control, Shanghai Kao made Baosteel Chemical its exclusive supplier of raw naph- thalene around the world in 2011.  Operation model of Production, Sales and Research Baosteel promotes the integrated development of production, sales  and research with an aim to achieve better product development and  more timely response to the users demands. Through collaboration of the  production, R&D, technology and financial departments, we address prob- lems related to product R&D, quality improvement, market expansion, and  customer services to ultimately enhance the competitiveness of Baosteel  products.  In 2011, Baosteel continued to implement SBU promotion based on  integrated management of production, sales and research. The eight pro- motion groups set their goals for the promotion of production, sales and  research according to the needs of product development, and put them  into practice in an orderly manner with quarterly action plans. Listen to the Users Customer Satisfaction Survey Baosteel has always attached great importance to customers opin- ions which are consider a key point in constantly improving our products  and services, and regarded customer satisfaction as the starting point and  the ultimate goal of all our work. Baosteel has persisted in customer satis- faction and perception surveys to get an in-depth understanding of cus- tomers opinions and identify the scope for improvement of our products  and services. To make best use of customer feedback, Baosteel has incor- porated timely response rate and satisfaction rate into the KPI indicators  for the purpose of follow-up management, so as to ensure proper handling  of customers complaints. In 2011, 86.4% customer complaints were dealt  with in a timely manner, with a satisfaction rate of 85.3%.  Year Q1 Q2 Q3  Q4 2009  92.4  92.3  92.4 92.8 2010  90.1  90.7 89.0 90.6 2011  90.5  90.1  89.9 90.8 Note: In 2010, the satisfaction survey was extended to domestic customers of carbon steel, stainless  steel and special steel. E-Commerce E-commerce of Baosteel aims at providing users with convenient  and efficient and value-added services and pleasant experiences. In 2011,  Baosteel integrated its trade and processing e-commerce applications and  adopted unified looks for the interfaces of Baosteel marketing e-commerce  platform to provide users with consistent e-business experience. Targeted  at domestic strategic users, Baosteel continued to optimize its service solu- tions for automobile, home appliances, shipbuilding and energy industries  and corporations, and the key customer channel for domestic strategic us- ers has covered 50% of domestic strategic users, with increasing share of  online sales. The information subscription and delivery services launched in  2011 enabled all users home and abroad to have easy access to contracts,  logistics and inventory information. The applications of electronic docu- ments continued to expand. After introducing electronic contracts, elec- tronic bills of lading and electronic warranties, Baosteel cooperated with  the Classification Society to realize online warranty signing for ship plate  products to reduce the issuance and delivery cycle. In addition, a series of  innovations like social resources agency were also achieved in spot sales. Account Representative System In 2004, Baosteel launched the technical service account repre- sentative system to complement its marketing platform, make full use of  geographic advantages, promptly satisfy customers demand and provide  considerate technical service to strategic customers. This move also pro- vided the latest customer information for the production departments, so  as to improve service quality, manage account representatives in a unified  manner and ensure the independence of their work. In 2009, Baosteel placed great emphasis on account representa- tives capabilities to deal with day-to-day objections of customers, guide  their selection of products and transfer of user needs, carry out in-depth  and demand-oriented technical services and provide users with integrated  technology solutions.  In response to the characteristics such as large scale, multiple bases and diversi- fied demands of downstream customers, especially the automobile customers, Baosteel  established a large customer service team and appointed Director of Large Customers  to develop solution packages for these customers and their subordinate auto companies  and provide them with overall marketing and other services. In 2011, Baosteel market- ing system combined the customer-centered decision-making process with the existing  product-centred decision-making process, completed the preliminary design of the large  customer system, and initially determined the organizational structure, the job setting,  job responsibilities and powers, incentives, evaluation, and customer service process of  the director of large customers and his team, as well as the integration of account man- ager mode into the large customer team system. It initially sorted out the relationship of  responsibilities, powers and interests between existing units of the sales system and the  account director team and provided an innovative organizational model and processes  to further improve customer services. Service Hotline To provide better service and boost more efficient interactions with customers,  Baosteel set up a call center, which, adhering to the service concept of no call missed  and no limit to services, provides customers with 7x24 one-stop services such as busi- ness consultation and complaint resolution. Since its launch in 2011, the call center sys- tem has received a total of 15,073 complaints and consultations from customers. User Visit  Visiting users is an important way to get in-depth un- derstanding of customer needs, and also the starting point  of good services and maintain stable cooperative relations.  From 2011, Baosteel Co., Ltd. conducted systematic planning  and management on users above the direct supply level, and  developed the 2011 annual plan for user visits which covered  all such users and the related implementation departments  including the sales system, business divisions and regional/ exclusive sales agencies throughout the world. Baosteel,  taking the plan as the basis for user visiting activities of the  entire sales system and marketing channels, established a  liaison system for related enforcement departments to timely  track and evaluate the implementation of the plan and make  prompt feedback on the problems, needs and resolutions  that user visits has revealed.  In 2011, more than 6,141 visits were paid to users  above the direct supply level, accounting for 90.39% of all  planned visits. case Localized Operation of Baosteel Europe GMBH Baosteel Europe GMBH operates in 124 countries across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and  the CIS, covering a total area of 74,160,000 square kilometers and a total population of 2.289  billion. Targeted at both developed and rich European countries whose per capita GDP exceed  USD25,000 and the underdeveloped and poverty-stricken Africa with a per capita GDP of only  USD1,694. Baosteel Europe has always aimed to provide localized services and create value for  various customers.  Sales branches close to customers Given the vast area and the diverse market conditions covered, Baosteel Europe Gmbh,  have, in addition to the Headquarters in Hamburg, Germany, established subsidiaries in Italy,  Spain and the U.A.E. as well as a representative office in Poland according to the market develop- ment level and users demand for localized services quick response. In 2011, Baosteel Europe  conducted market investigations successively in Nigeria of West Africa, South Africa, and Kenya  of east Africa with a view to finding a proper location for a new office and further improving its  network layout.  Localized delivery to customers As the steel industry has entered an era of meager profit, the traditional back-to-back  trading approach will not only fail to meet users needs, but also make it difficult for the company  to survive. In 2011, in addition to the door-to-door delivery of 60,000 tons of high-grade car pan- els, Baosteel Europe GMBH also delivered 7,815 tons of sheared steel to Fiat (Italy) through the  NSM shearing center jointly established with local capital, further enhanced the localized capacity  of Baosteel in Europe. In 2011, the proportion of door-to-door delivery in Spain and Portugal in- creased from one third to nearly 90%. At the end of 2011, Baosteel Europe GMBH purchased 160  tons of stainless steel as an inventory in Germany to explore localized sales model for stainless  steel and deepen the long-term cooperation with local customers.  case Hand in Hand with Electrolux Baosteel America Inc. has always given full play to the advantages of regional offices, impressed users with  quality services, aroused their feelings through communications and inspired them with sincerity and enthusiasm.  After years of exploration and accumulation, it has gradually forged stable strategic partnership with Electrolux Brazil  based on mutual trust. In face of various differences in languages, cultures, laws, trade practices and market environment, Baosteel  America Inc. made full use of its regional advantages to gain in-depth understanding of the local market of Brazil,  and visited target customers to promote Baosteel products and strengthen communications with the procurement  and technical personnel. At the end of 2007, years of efforts finally paid off as Baosteel America Inc. became the first  overseas supplier of Electrolux Brazil. To strengthen communications and contact, marketing staff of Baosteel America Inc. established a regular  exchange mechanism with the customer and kept providing quality services to deepen business relations. In recent  years, Baosteel has gradually optimized its operations, technical services, logistics and execution of contracts. The  business personnel has kept regular exchanges with the counterparts of Electrolux Brazil and responded to their con- cerns and problems in a timely manner. Baosteel adopted a long-term payment method according to the practice of  local suppliers. In terms of technical services, Baosteel overseas companies has established direct contact with users  through quality managers to address their technical difficulties as soon as possible. In terms of logistics, Baosteel has  shifted its delivery approach from monthly bulk delivery to installment delivery so as to ease the storage pressure  of the users and meet their requirements for timely material planning. Meanwhile, to ensure timely and effective  communication, the sales and technical service teams of Baosteel headquarters paid regular visits to the customer,  providing first-class marketing services and winning full trust. For years, Baosteel has insisted on the principle of service first, provided localized and customized services in  relation to commerce, technology, logistics and documentation, given full play to the value creation effect, strength- ened its competitiveness and enhanced customer loyalty. At the same time, the cooperation between Baosteel and  Electrolux Brazil has continuously deepened and expanded from one plant to three plants, from single product  variety to several and from one component to multiple components. Recently, Baosteel has extended its business  partnership from Electrolux Brazil to Electrolux Chile. In this way, Baosteel has further practiced the service principle  of customer orientation, the marketing principle of developing global users and the strategic concept of going  global and achieved a win-win situation with the customer. case Chinas First Visual Auto-use Steel Demand Pulling Sys- tem: ——A new marketing model based on VSS demand pulling system The first domestic auto-use steel demand pulling system has made its debut recently.  This system, jointly developed by Shanghai Baosteel International Economic & Trading  Co., Ltd. (Baosteel International) and Shanghai General Motors Co., Ltd. (Shanghai GM), a  strategic customer of Baosteel, has ushered in a new model of deepening supply chain  cooperation between iron and steel companies and automobile enterprises in our country.  Both the automobile enterprises and Baosteel have their own independent supply  chains, but independence of the chains hindered real-time information sharing. Informa- tion transfer between the two systems can only be done through manual input, which  has a number of disadvantages such as high error rate, low efficiency and delay. The delay  and the asymmetry of information between the two systems forced Baosteel to increase  its inventory to avoid inadequate stock, causing high cost for stock management to both  Baosteel itself and the user. In response, the project team formed by Baosteel International,  Shanghai Bao-Mit, Yantai Bao-Mit, the car plate sales department of Baosteel Co., Ltd.,  Bsteel and Baosight worked together with Shanghai GM to build the information-based  supply chain system. Through joint efforts, the visual auto-use steel demand pulling system  was developed. The system has realized seamless connection of the whole supply chain  from Baosteel to the automobile enterprises, enabling them to share visualized, real-time  information in the procurement and supply links. With this system, automobile enterprises  can inquire about and monitor its own material demand conditions and the production  and stock conditions of Baosteel in real time so as to know each link well. Meanwhile, Bao- steel can obtain the users production information of each car model or each component  more directly from the system prompt to generate the accurate material demand informa- tion of the user and arrange its own production plan. In this way, the material supply plan  can be generated automatically based on car production scheduling, enabling Baosteel  and its users to form an integrated whole.  The greatest feature of the VSS system is that it allows users to feel at ease. Its innova- tions are mainly reflected in: a) visualization: Direct-view and dimensioned management  of the entire supply chain makes the whole process simple, efficient and accurate; b) early  warning: this feature can significantly reduce the risk in the supply chain and avoid the lo- gistics cost arising from emergency pull. The VSS system is our joint achievement, and also  a starting point to direct both of us towards more comprehensive development. ——Zhang Qifeng, Senior Manager of the Procurement Department,  Shanghai GM case Baosteel CSR Report / 77 76 Supply Chain Performance   You are a reliable partner. BLHI took over the challenge of completing the delivery two months in advance and overcame it better than expected. Your  ability is incredible. You are a trusted partner, Thomas Moline, general manager of the manufacturing department of I2S LLC, USA,  wrote in his letter of thanks. In January 2011, after undertaking the entire arch project of the U.S. Olympic Steel, I2S LLC entrusted the processing task of  two arches and twp base anchors with a total weight of 125 tons   to Changzhou Baoling Heavy & Industry Machinery Co., Ltd.  (BLHI), a joint venture of Baosteel.  The contract delivery date was July 25, 2011. However, as the project was to be put into opera- tion ahead of time, Olympic Steel required I2S to complete the overall arch device processing two months earlier. Thus, I2S had no  alternative but propose emergency consultation with BLHI. In face of the customers fervent expectations, BLHI decided to do its utmost to meet the requirements. The production units  were pressing on with this project.
