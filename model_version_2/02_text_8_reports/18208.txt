We are a Financial Conglomerate whose ultimate purpose is the  sustained social welfare of all the nations inhabitants.  We aim to become a leading Corporation in providing integrated  financial products and services for the economic and social  development of persons, large companies, institutions, micro-,  small- and medium-scale businesses, and social organizations of the  country.  In its everyday business ventures Banco popular includes values that  represent the joint aspirations of our conduct as a banking institution  toward its clientele.   Mission Vision Our Values    Leadership  Excellence  Customer service  Integrity  Innovation  7 The Road to Sustainability  Sustainability report 2011  Banco popular was founded on July 11, 1969, pursuant to law 4351, during the administration of former president  Jos Joaqun trejos Fernndez, who pinpointed the need of having a banking institution aimed at satisfying the  financial needs of the working class.  the bill was ratified by the legislative Assembly and it assigned priority to certain sectors of the social economy by  promoting savings and credit offerings. Banco popular is a non-state public law institution with corporate identity  and its own patrimony, under full administrative and operating autonomy. this financial institution has a trait that  makes it unique in the Costa rican financial market: it is the bank whose shareholders are the countrys working  class. Legal Status of Banco Popular  8 exercising accountability on the  part of those of us who are assigned  temporary posts in public institutions  is a sound practice that has started  spreading in the Costa rican  mentality. this new style of relating  to people generates transparency  and provides more and better  information to the general public,  especially the users of services. In our  case, this obligation is of great moral  importance, since our customers are,  generally speaking, the owners of the  Bank; in other words, the countrys  working population. president of  the Board  of Directors  Message   9 The Road to Sustainability  Sustainability report 2011  development of the great mass of  the Costa rican population who has  placed their trust in us. In fact, during the year 2011, Banco  popular stood at first place within  the Costa rican financial system as  far as net profits are concerned. With  a total of 77.1 million dollars, this  accomplishment represented an  increase of over 50% as compared  to the year 2010. the profit obtained  by this institution are unsurpassed in  the course of its history and exceed  by over 24 million dollars the profit  achieved by the financial institution  that stood in second place. Anyone who may review Banco  populars financial reports will find  indisputable strengths: the sustained  growth of the credit portfolio, the  excellent profit indicators and a most  solid capital adequacy. All these  achievements are not necessarily  aimed at making a profit, but rather  at satisfying the fundamental needs  of those who approach us seeking  to resolve immediate problems or  making their dreams a reality. the 2012 objectives are aimed  at providing sustainability to the  successes achieved and promoting  growth in the placement of credit  close to 22%, in the areas of personal  loans, development and housing, as  well as consolidating our position in  the social financial sector. It should be recalled that we are  subject to an ongoing monitoring  by qualified organizations, aimed  at verifying the stability of our  institution. In addition to the control  that the General Superintendence  of Financial entities (SuGeF, by  its Spanish acronym) exerts on  our activities by law, we have  incorporated the Sustainability  report, prepared under the  methodology of the Global reporting  Initiative (GrI), in order to disclose  to the public our most significant  achievements and progress in a more  open and secure manner. It also  reports on the sound financial health  of the Bank and the rating obtained,  after being subjected to a careful  evaluation on the part of the risk  rating agency Fitch ratings. As evidenced in this report, the  good tidings that we bring are many.  We are undertaking a thorough  management of the savings portfolio  of the working class and we have  consolidated the Banks patrimony,  thanks to our profits. this ensures  our strength and, above all, allows  us to increase our credit offerings  and contribute in a more efficient  manner to the social and human  In order to attain these goals,  we propose achieving a greater  efficiency, maximizing the use of  technology and generating new  revenue through other channels  different to intermediation, always  with the purpose of achieving  the main objectives that provide  a raison dtre to Banco Popular:  contribute to the wellbeing and  happiness of those who forge  national development day in and  day out. Working toward these goals not  only generates an important source  of gratification for those who  temporarily conduct the destiny  of this Institution, but at the same  time nourishes the Banks own  management. It makes it wealthy  from the human perspective, more  worthy of trust, more accessible to  the people.  10 a very promising outcome for the  women benefiting from this, as well  as for the Banks own finances, due to  the low default rate observed in this  case. upon reaching our 42nd anniversary,  we have become a sound institution  within the Costa rican banking  scenario, both due to our institutional  and financial strengths, as well as  to the merit of having translated  our mission into concrete actions.  We have in fact contributed in a  sustained manner to the peoples  wellbeing, lending a hand to those  who knock on our door in search of  solidarity; hence we are contributing  to national development but with  a social purpose. this has led me to  state once and again: God forbid that  Banco popular would fail to exist. Mr. Francisco Antonio Pacheco president of the Board of Directors throughout its existence—especially  in the last few years—Banco popular  has strengthened its common  vision and its joint action with the  social sectors which presently are  the spearheads in the economic  growth of the country, and in the  democratization process of national  wealth. We are referring to the  following sectors: traditional and  self-managed cooperatives, unions,  professional, community and artisan,  independent, education, professional  and solidarity unions. the vision of the Board of Directors  and Management has allowed us  to broach complementary fields  beyond the financial field, such as the  development of credit lines, projects  and actions of an ecological nature,  with very satisfactory results. We  have also attained full gender equity  and equality in the Banks executive  positions and have included this  outlook in our credit programs, with   11 The Road to Sustainability  Sustainability report 2011  the year 2011 was characterized  by the substantial instability of the  international financial systems, and by  a low—if not negative—economic  growth rate worldwide. While it is  true that the u.S. financial system  has been showing signs of recovery,  in europe the banks were seriously  threatened by the well-known euro  crisis generated by the tax problems  in some of the member countries. Corporate  General  Manager  Message  12 Costa ricas Central Bank summarized  the situation by pointing out that:  In 2011, the international economic  environment was characterized by an  economic slowdown with an inflation  slightly higher than the previous  year, uncertainty and volatility in the  financial markets, and the existence  of tax restrictions in the majority of  developed nations. (BCCr, 2011  Annual report, p. 4). Costa rica experienced a relatively  more stable situation, despite the  uncertain international scenario  described above, and the fact that it  is an open economy makes it highly  vulnerable to world events. Banco popular was able to carry out  its operations within this local and  international economic context of  the year 2011, with results that were  not only very positive, but record  breaking, having achieved the  maximum net profits among all the  national Financial System entities:  77.1 million dollars, an increment of  50.9% as compared to the previous  year. this is an increase founded on  solid bases, as evidenced by the  fact that the risk rating agency Fitch  ratings after dispensing a rigorous  evaluation of the institutions financial  status, granted it a high rating due to  its performance (AA to the long-term  issues, and F1+ to the short-term  issues with a stable perspective). In its analysis of Banco popular, the  rating agency recognized five key  elements that merited this high  rating: a strong capital position, its  social interest function, its high level  of support as a public institution, the  sound financial performance, and a  stable funding structure. these results  undoubtedly evidence the adequate  management of the institution as  far as risk management and internal  control are concerned, as well as the  strict compliance of the regulatory  management indicators. the fact that Banco popular has  obtained excellent indicators during  these times of great volatility in the  international financial markets, is an  accomplishment that confirms the  capital soundness of the institution  and the trust that the working class  has placed in the Bank. Since its creation back in 1969,  Banco popular has had a very clear  vision of its nature and true social  objective: taking care of the financial  needs of the Costa rican families and  companies with high-quality tools  that are both efficient and effective,  that provide guidance in order to  have access to banking services and  that, in turn, represent productive  projects for his or her welfare, that of  their families, and the country.  All the foregoing is valid, but one  must not forget the importance of  supporting the sectors in the greatest  need. this is why it is a source of  pride for Bp that the Fitch ratings  agency expressly recognized in its  report the following point: every  year the institution earmarks up to 15%  of its profits to special development  funds. These funds have been created  with the purpose of satisfying the  financing needs of indigenous peoples,  women, youth, disabled persons, and  low-cost housing. In addition, an extra  5% is earmarked for strengthening  the resources of the Special Fund for  the Micro-, Small- and, Medium-Scale  Businesses (Fitch ratings: rating  Basis report, p. 3). these results serve as guidelines  that set our course and tell us how  to improve on a daily basis in order  to adapt to the changing conditions  of the domestic and international  economies, without losing sight of  our vision and mission, inherent to  the Banks articles of association.  these results also allow us to   13 The Road to Sustainability  Sustainability report 2011  contribute to the generation of  a more just and solidarity-based  economy, that is inclusive of  vulnerable groups and those sectors  of the population that —without  Banco popular— would otherwise  be excluded from the traditional  financial system. Banco popular is fully aware of  the importance of taking into  consideration the environmental  criteria in its operations, which  contribute to an improved quality of  life. to this end, in the year 2011 we  supported projects that were in line  with ecological standards, by funding  companies that were focused on  sustainable production and granting  credits for eco-efficiency, thus aiding  administrative associations of rural  water systems to improve their  economic, social and environmental  sustainability, among others. that  year, these projects received over  970,000 dollars in loans. Furthermore,  the Bank has taken steps internally  of reinforcing its actions to minimize  the impact of greenhouse effect gas  emissions, and promoting among  its personnel systematic recycling  campaigns and awareness programs  concerning the adequate disposal of  waste, to name a few of the this years  accomplishments. the World Bank, the International  Monetary Fund, and many other  economic organizations all predict  difficult times for the economies and  the financial systems worldwide.  Costa rica shall not be exempt from  the difficulties foreseen; however,  the Costa rican workforce may rest  assured that they can continue  counting on a solid, innovative  Bank that focuses on the future by  protecting their interests today. Mr.  Gerardo Porras   Corporate General Manager I am deeply appreciative of the  contributions and excellence of  the valuable human talent in our  organization, which has been  key to the success in each of the  programs that we have developed;  I am also grateful for the trust  awarded by our male and female  employees throughout the country  who, according to the Articles of  Incorporation, are the actual owners  of the institution.

Chapter IV A trustworthy Report  34 Banco popular considers the Sustainability  report as a tool that facilitates a strategic  analysis of the social, environmental  and economic performance of this  financial entity, in order to comply with its  responsibility toward current and future  generations.  A Trustworthy   Report  35 Strategy Economic,  Environmental,  and Social  Performance  Indicators Financial  Services Organizations  Profile Second Sustainability  Report this second consecutive annual  endeavor reports the results achieved  between January 1 and December  31, 2011 in Costa rican territory.  It  was prepared following the level  C parameters of the Guide for the  Preparation of Sustainability Reports,  version 3.1 of the Global reporting  Initiative (GrI). the information and data submitted  in this document are the result of a  multi-disciplinary work by a team that  headed, compiled, and studied the  documentation based on materiality  principles, participation of groups of  interest, sustainability and exhaustive  nature regarding the contents  submitted, which include aspects  such as organizational strategy, the  Institutions profile, and general  performance indicators, as well as  indicators specific to the financial  sector. Departing from the comparability  criterion, this report revisits the  contents broached in the 2010 GrI  report; nonetheless, the number of  performance indicators has been  increased with a view to promoting  the progressive development of  the evaluation tool in coming years.  thus, the 2011 Sustainability report  does not present significant changes  in scope, coverage or evaluation  methods. Although this current effort  does not include external verification  by groups of interest, the purpose of  implementing it in future editions is  not ruled out. this report includes indicators that  are pertinent to the Bank, without  including the Corporations, which  also are a part of the Banco populars  Conglomerate.

Environmental Sustainability Policy   It sets forth the frame of action that incorporates  environmental management within the global  strategy and the operating and business  management. 2. Business Perspective   It is aimed at the creation of environmentally- responsible financial products.  3. Institutional Environmental Management  System (SIGAI, by its Spanish acronym)   the operational instrument that aims to ensure  that the institutional management is consistent  with the environmental policy. It has a four courses  of action. 	 	 Water	management 	 	 Energy	management 	 	 Paper	and	office	supplies	management 	 	 Use	of	fossil	fuels 4. Knowledge on Sustainability Management   promotes an environmental awareness through  capacity building actions among staff members,  which fosters the institutional coordination in  order to implement good environmental practices.  5. Eco-efficient Operating Implementation   executes actions for the progressive reduction of  environmental costs generated during the Banks  normal business. The interesting  thing about an  environmental  management  system that  engages people is  that it makes them  responsible for  their own carbon footprint  and commits them to  undertaking specific actions. 	100%	of	the	staff—or	3,233	 persons from the 100 agencies  throughout	the	country— participated in awareness  campaigns and eco-efficient  environmental training. 	300	members	of	the	green	 brigade and staff members  from strategic areas have  participated in campaigns to  raise environmental awareness. Juan Martnez Aguirre, environmental brigade  40 Head of the Sustainability and  Environmental Program Person coordinating the Brigade Members Members of the Environmental Brigade:  300 employees from the entire organization  watching over the implementation of the  Environmental Management System  Internal Capacity-Building: The road to knowledge on sustainability management Solid Waste Management In the year 2011 areas were designated at the different  Bank agencies for the placement of 30 recycling bins to  collect paper, cardboard, plastic and aluminum. As an  additional effort, recycling campaigns were launched.  After five days, over 23,000 Kg of waste matter were  collected for recycling. these campaigns not only  involved Bank personnel directly, but also engaged  the communities surrounding the Institutions Central  offices. the reception of waste products was held on  8th Avenue in San Jos at the Collection Center for the  responsible Management of residues, constituting the  first recycling center in the Costa rican banking industry. Green Purchases After having implemented amendments in the  procurement regulations, the Bank was able to promote  green purchases. Consequently, during the year 2011, 15%  of the articles that make up the catalog for the purchase  of office supplies for the Bank had a reduced carbon  footprint for the environment. Energy Consumption the Bank changed 100% of the light bulbs in all its  business centers for more energy-efficient alternatives. In  fact, preventive maintenance plans for electric networks  were implemented and energy-efficient devices were  added. these efforts are evidenced by the 5% reduction in  the annual energy consumption  41 The Road to Sustainability  Sustainability report 2011  Water Management Improving the efficiency in water  consumption on the part of the  customers and personnel of  Banco  popular was a priority for the year  2011. With this in mind, a series of  investments were promoted: 	 The	replacement	of	100%	of	the	 faucets in the Bank headquarters. In  addition, a plan was drawn for the  gradual installation of 273 water- saving faucets at the different  business centers. 	 100%	of	the	toilets	were	replaced	 with modern gravity-operated  units. In total, over 25 eco- efficient toilets were installed,  which represent, according to the  suppliers certified data, annual  savings of 150,000 liters of water  per toilet. Fossil Fuels: Committed toward  the reduction and compensation  of the carbon footprint on  transportation A 535,000 dollar investment was  made in order to replace 100% of the  vehicles in operation for over five years.  the old units were replaced with 15  vehicles endowed with more efficient  combustion systems. In addition, the  Bank acquired a hybrid vehicle that  guarantees a reduction of almost 50%  in Co2 emissions, implying substantial  savings in fuel consumption. The Reduction of CO2 Emissions  by Encouraging the Use of Public  Transportation  Aiming to encourage the use of  public transportation as a mechanism  for reducing carbon dioxide (Co2)  emissions, the Bank provided  its support to the Costa rican  railroad Institute (InCoFer, by its  Spanish acronym) by sponsoring its  campaign urban train. this means of  transportation was used by 2,109,886  persons in the year 2011, alleviating the  congestion of the main thoroughfares  of the Greater Metropolitan Area (GAM,  by its Spanish acronym). The support given to the Urban Train has helped  reduce gas emissions in the countrys capital. Eco-efficient faucets at Banco Popular.  42 Sustainability from the Operations  Core Banco popular considers that  sustainability must be tackled from  the core of the entire operations.  thus, products and services that  are in line with sustainability have  been added to the financial offering.  Among the actions undertaken  we may underscore the marked  improvement in digital transaction  services, which diminishes the  quantity of paper and ink used, and  promotes a preference for eco- efficient services among customers.

This is  an excellent measure  because in addition to  its many employees,  many other people  also use water in their building. I hope  this measure can be implemented in  other institutions.  Nidia Ortiz Viales, retired educator  Additional Contributions toward  Environmental Management Casa Alemana Project the Casa Alemana project was promoted  by the Costa rican-German Chamber of  Commerce and Industry. the Bank was a  sponsor and lecturer in this effort whose  purpose was to present before the population,  entrepreneurs and government agencies,  a model of an eco-efficient house with the  potential to be implemented in the country.

I think it is great that they  recycle paper, something  so commonly used in this  institution, but even more  remarkable is the fact  that its now a collection center for recyclable  waste products, helping out while educating  its customers to be more friendly with our  environment.
