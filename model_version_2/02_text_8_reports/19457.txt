Annual report 2011 AF Group Highlights  2011 Record profit In 2011 the AF Group delivered its highest net profit ever.  The profit before tax was NOK 404 million, which corre- sponds to a profit  margin of 5.5 per cent. It is especially  the business areas Civil Engineering and Building, where  the level of activity has been particularly high, that have  contributed to the good results. The business areas   Environment and  Property can look back on a successful  year. Overall, the future looks good for the Company at  the start of 2012. Record-high order backlog At the end of 2011 the order backlog was a record-high  NOK 9,826 million, compared with NOK 6,193 million at  the end of 2010, an increase of 59 per cent. The high   order backlog provides the foundation for a high level   of activity and good growth in 2012, and it will entail the  need to recruit up to 600 engineers in the coming years. Expansion in the east and west In the autumn of 2011 the AF Group acquired the majority  shareholding in the companies Strm Gundersen and   Rogaland Entreprenr. These companies are located in  Drammen and Stavanger, respectively. AF has thus   expanded its geographical market for building and civil  engineering services in high-growth regions. Expansion in the north and south In 2011 AF entered into an agreement with Store Norske  Spitsbergen Grubekompani relating to transport, civil   engineering and maintenance services on Svalbard. In   this connection AF established the company AF Arctic,  and around 70 employees are employed in the project   at Svea on Svalbard. In addition, AF has established   building activities in Kristiansand, AF Bygg Sr, in 2011. 500 new employees in 2011  AF aims to be a leading industrial group in its field.   The company is dependent on retaining and motivating   its  employees, as well as attracting new employees.   As a  result of business acquisitions and recruitment,   more than 500 new employees joined the AF team in  2011. AF is continuously seeking to be one of the work- places preferred by engineering students, and an   employee  survey conducted in the autumn of 2011   shows that job satisfaction and pride in working for   AF have never been higher.

Highlights in  the history of  the AF Group AF Group 1986: Establishment and   civil engineering AF was established by a group of colleagues  from a joint venture who decided to leave two  major Norwegian contracting companies. Two  construction contracts created the foundation  for the company, the Dokkflyvatn Dam and  the lodalen Train Formation Yard. The founders  sought to create a company that encouraged  entrepreneurial endeavour and provided incen- tives to pursue new opportunities for profitable  growth. A combination of profitability and HSE  results well above the norm in the industry pro- vided the contractors in AF a platform for  further growth and  development of the company. Group turnover: NOK 118 million 1997: Focus on Building and   stock exchange listing AF merges with the Oslo-based contracting  company Ragnar Evensen AS. The merger   helped AF to almost double its turnover. AF  was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in the  autumn of 1997 in connection with the merger.  In addition, the acquisition of Brdr. Holstad  AS in 2000 and Brdr. Glomsrd Entreprenr  AS in 2005 has ensured AF a good position in  the building market in stfold. In 2001 AF   entered the Swedish building market through  the acquisition of a majority shareholding in  JK Bygg Gteborg, now AF Bygg Gteborg. AF  has  gradually increased its ownership interest  and has owned all the shares in the company  from 1 January 2007. Group turnover: NOK 1,174 million AF has exhibited its power and expertise in solving complex challenges  through a number of contracts. The Companys entrepreneurial spirit  is evident in its ability to think differently and to find better, more   future-oriented ways of creating value. Therefore AF stands for   Addressing the Future. AF is involved in everything from the demo- lition of oil platforms to major building and civil engineering projects.  In addition, AF has created one of Scandinavias largest centres of   expertise in the area of energy efficiency. A broad range of services  and many centres of expertise provide career opportunities across  the Group. Competent employees are given responsibilities at an  early stage, and there are many opportunities for personal develop- ment through AF's many projects. Thanks to ambitious and result-  oriented employees, the AF Group has experienced strong growth  during the past decade.  Civil Engineering AF has the experience and expertise required to carry out all types   of civil engineering projects ranging from small and simple to large  and demanding. AF carries out projects related to transport, ports,  oil/energy/offshore and foundation work. Our clients are primarily  public sector agencies and large energy and industrial companies.  Building AF is one of the largest players in the area of residential, commercial  and public buildings. AF's experience spans the entire value chain  from development and planning to building. AF is also a leader in  renovation. AF delivers services to clients ranging from small compa- nies with a single assignment to large private and public clients with  a longstanding relationship. AF cooperates closely with clients to  find efficient solutions that satisfy future environmental and energy  requirements. The Building business area is established in Norway  and Sweden.  5 2000: Profitable foundation and  demolition activities AF gained access to the foundation and demo- lition industry through the acquisition of com- panies such as plplintar AB and Graveservice  AS. This laid the foundation for what today is a  very profitable demolition business both on  land and in the North Sea. Over NOK 500 million  was invested in 2009 to create what is currently  one of Europe's most modern reception facilities  for decommissioned offshore installations at  Vats near Haugesund. Group turnover: NOK 1,426 million  2006: Demand for energy  conservation In 2006 AF established the business unit AF  Energi & Miljteknikk. Through the acquisition  of the companies Holst & Br AS and Energi &  Miljteknikk AS, AF secured expertise in a  market showing substantial growth.   Subsequently our investment in the Energy  business area was strengthened further with  expertise in the  offshore and maritime sectors  through the  acquisition of Mollier AS in 2007  and Aeron in 2008. Group turnover: NOK 5,358 million 2011: AF strengthens its   Building business area AF took over the majority shareholding in the  Strm Gundersen Group and Rogaland Entre- prenr. Strm Gundersen is a leading and   significant building and civil engineering   contractor. The business is located in Eastern  Norway, and the head office is in Drammen.  The largest  operative companies in the Strm  Gundersen Group are Strm Gundersen AS,  Haga & Berg Entreprenr AS, Thorendahl AS,  Consolvo and protector. Group turnover: NOK 7,356 million Property AF develops residential and non-residential buildings  for its own account. Most of the projects are located  geographically where AF has its own contracting  services. AF cooperates closely with other players in  the industry, and the development projects are often  organised as joint development companies. In this  way we benefit from each other's expertise, while   reducing project-specific risk. Environment AF is Scandinavia's leading contractor for the demo- lition of buildings, industrial plants and petroleum  installations. AF offers total solutions that satisfy the  client's environmental challenges. AF has a state-   of-the art reception facility at Vats near Haugesund  for dismantling and recycling petroleum installations.  The Environment business area is established in   Norway, Sweden, poland and the uK. Energy With extensive industrial knowledge and advanced  expertise in energy optimisation, AF delivers energy- efficient technical solutions. The solutions maintain  comfort and working conditions while reducing   energy consumption – in the building, industry,  maritime and offshore sectors. In order for the   market to choose correct solutions, it is not enough  that they are energy-efficient, they must also benefit  the clients bottom line and the environment! Thanks to   ambitious and   result-oriented   employees, the AF  Group has experien- ced strong growth   in the past decade.  6 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 Vision  Clearing up the past, building for the future.

This will expand the scope of our business activities and   opportunities for the development of our employees. Profitability Objective AFs goal is to have an operating margin and a return on capital   employed that is better than comparable companies. AF's target   is to have a return on capital employed greater than 20 per cent. Results in 2011 AF achieved an operating margin of 5.3 per cent in 2011.   The companys return on capital employed was 35.5 per cent. Financial strength Objective AFs financial strength target is to achieve a minimum equity ratio   of 20 per cent and to have sufficient liquidity to cover the companys  current needs at any given time. Results in 2011 AFs equity ratio was 29.0 per cent at the end of 2011, and the   company had unutilised credit and loan facilities of NOK 900 million  as at 31 December 2011.  9 Dividend Objective AFs dividend policy is to provide shareholders with a competitive   dividend yield. The Company assumes that future dividends will be stable and   ideally rise in line with the earnings performance. The AF Group's   intention over time is to distribute a minimum of 50 per cent of   the profit for the year as a dividend. Results in 2011 In 2011, AF paid a dividend of NOK 2.00 per share for the 2010   financial year. In addition, it distributed an extraordinary dividend   of NOK 2.50 per share. The Board is proposing a dividend of NOK 4.50 per share for 2011. Health, safety and   the  environment Objective AFs objective is to perform all our operations without injuries, with  an lTI rate of zero and sickness absence rate of less than 3.0 per cent. AFs partners are subject to the same requirements as AF itself, and  AF includes them in its lTI rate target. Results in 2011 AF achieved an lTI rate of 1.5 and a sickness absence rate of 3.6 per  cent. This is on par with the best safety results in the   contractor industry. AF seeks growth opportunities to leverage its core   competencies and create value to stakeholders.  10 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 From the CEO Sustainable and profitable growth  The year 2011 was a favourable year for the AF Group with  strong performance in a number of important areas. AF has  gained market shares in several sectors and continues to  operate with healthy margins. We are especially pleased  with our performance in the area of HSE. The Company has  also  carried out the largest acquisition in the history of   the AF Group. We are delivering very strong results for large  parts of our business, and the improved  competitiveness is resulting in higher   market shares. At the end of 2011 we had a  record-high order backlog, which provides   a good, stable platform for further growth. In 2011 we have transformed operations   in several units that have been through a   difficult period. By focusing on our core   operating activities, we have restructured  these business units to enhance their   competitiveness. Several acquisitions were made in 2011 that  will be important to the further development  of the AF Group. The acquisition of the   majority shareholding in the Strm   Gundersen Group in Drammen is the largest  transaction in the history of the AF Group.  This acquisition gives us a strong market   position in one of Norway's most exciting  markets, in addition to increased expertise  in renovation. The acquisition of the companies Rogaland  Entreprenr and Btservice Offshore Verft  (now AF Rogaland Entreprenr and AF   Offshore Mandal) was smaller in scope, but  these companies and their employees also  represent valuable additions to the AF Group  in markets and business areas that we believe  have great potential in the future. profitable growth has been a core value of  the AF Group right from the beginning. In  2011 we have shown that this is still key to  us through our operations and acquisitions.  Our platform at the start of 2012 gives us   renewed strength to continue this develop- ment. Sustainable development As a major player in the Norwegian market,  we have a responsibility to ensure that our  profitable growth is sustainable. We place  great emphasis on ensuring that the crea- tion of value takes place in a manner that  safeguards the interests and opportunities  of the current and future generations. At   the AF Group this influences our execution  of projects. profitable growth should con- tribute to ensuring high value creation for  our owners and provide opportunities for  our employees. When we emphasise that  this creation of value must take place in a  sustainable manner, we have chosen to   add some key factors that we consider critical  for our type of business, such as ethics and  HSE (Health, Safety and the Environment). The AF Group aims to be a company that is  reliable. Throughout our history we have  placed emphasis on the development of a  value-based culture. This still has high priority. Our HSE goals of a sickness absence rate of  under 3 per cent and no lost time injuries  (lTI rate=0) will require long-term work on  preventative measures, as well as efficient  monitoring routines and systems. We would  like everyone to come home from work just  as healthy as when they left for work. Environmental work is facing ever stricter   requirements, especially with regard to recy- cling and efficient energy use. These are re- quirements we welcome. Our operations will  affect the external environment, and in 2011  we have implemented much more thorough  measurement and follow-up of how we can  limit our impact on the environment. All our  units are measured with respect to their  ability to sort and recycle waste that is   generated by their operations. In addition,  AF actively seeks to limit CO2 emissions   from our operations.        11  Pl Egil Rnn, CEO, AF Group. Develop and attract the   right expertise Our good performance in 2011 is a result of  the efforts and expertise of our employees.  profitable growth is a core value, because  this creates a vitality in our organisation and  gives our employees an opportunity to de- velop. Our most recent employee satisfaction  survey shows that our employees are satisfied  with the Company and are proud to work for  the AF Group. Job satisfaction is our founda- tion for creating good teams. It is important  to feel proud that our team is strong and  growing. Nevertheless, the most important  match is always the next one to be played.  This also applies to the AF Group. We are pleased that more and more people  are finding that the AF Group is an attractive  employer. Our future challenges will be the  lack of qualified manpower in general, and  engineers in particular. To ensure our contin- ued progress, it is absolutely decisive that  we are competitive in this market as well.  Competent, motivated and committed   employees are our most important tool for  achieving profitable growth.     2012 and the road ahead At the start of 2012 we have a record-high  order backlog, which provides a good   foundation for further development of the  AF Group. We are facing many complex and  demanding challenges. Our ability to handle  risk will still be one of the key factors in the  development of the AF Group. The Civil Engineering market is driven   primarily by major public infrastructure   projects. AF expects that the level of invest- ment will continue to be high in the future,  and Civil Engineering is well positioned for  further growth. The property and Building markets are per- forming well. Economic growth has fuelled  increased housing project starts. The market  for maintenance and building renovation   is expected to remain at a high level in   Norway. In Sweden, however, how the   development of the economy will affect the  demand for building and civil engineering  services is more uncertain.  In the Environment business area AF's land- based demolition activities are closely related  to the demand for new housing, non-residential  buildings and industrial projects. The future  market for AFs offshore-related environ- mental services is considered to be large  and interesting. The level of activity for new  demolition projects is increasing. Several  studies have been initiated and there is an  increasing supply of projects. In the Energy business area, the public sector  has increased its focus on the lifetime costs  of buildings and the energy efficiency of   existing buildings. It is expected that the   energy efficiency market has a potential for  growth. The market in the maritime sector   is marked by a weak international new build  market for ships. The demand for AF's offshore  energy services (HVAC) follows the increase  in oil prices and increase in the level of   petroleum activities on the Norwegian   continental shelf. The market and AF's market position are  perceived overall as being strong at the   start of 2012. The foundation for sustainable  profitable growth is therefore good. At the  AF Group we will maintain our focus on   operations at the same time as we will   challenge standard practices and seek new  opportunities. This is what entrepreneurship  is all about.  12 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 AF Group Living well with risk All projects involve risk. Risk management has therefore  been essential for the AF Group during the past five years.  Improved risk management has contributed to profitability  in the individual projects and the Group overall. AF's business areas manage projects with large   volumes and small margins. To ensure the profita- bility of all projects, it is therefore important to   actively deal with all types of risk related to the   projects. The AF Group has therefore developed  risk management systems that are well adapted   to the business. Effective analysis AF's focus on risk management is firmly anchored  in the entire organisation from the individual   project to the Corporate Management Team. A  standardised analysis tool gives managers at all   levels a better basis for making decisions, whether  it concerns project management or other process- es in the business units and at the corporate level.  Over time this has provided greater insight into  and ownership of the projects by the management  at all levels. The analysis tool used in risk management is adapt- ed especially for the needs of the AF Group and is  used actively in all of the Group's business areas.   In addition, an internal specialist function has been  established that facilitates and manages the neces- sary processes.   Standardised processes for risk management have  contributed to a uniform management of risk in all  phases. In practice, this means that a significant risk  factor that is identified in a project will be dealt  with in the project itself, by the business unit and  by the Corporate Management Team. This means  that risk factors that are identified will be handled  and the correct measures can be implemented at  the right level. Risk assessment is carried out during the tender  phase, then during quarterly reviews of the pro- jects and project portfolio in the business unit.   A complete risk assessment is carried out for all  projects over NOK 25 million. projects over NOK  100 million are presented to the Corporate   Management Team. A simplified risk analysis   model was developed in 2010 for projects under  NOK 25 million. Predictability and opportunities Because risk is surveyed systematically, the results  are also more predictable, both for the individual  projects and the Group as a whole. Good risk   assessment also provides the AF Group with better  prerequisites for choosing the right tenders and        13  Risk pyramid: AF's focus on risk management is firmly anchored in the entire organisation from  the individual project to the Corporate Management Team. Overall risk  management Risk management of project portfolio Risk management in projects Tender Contract Project Selection pricing these tenders correctly. Many of the   projects in the AF Group are turnkey contracts in  which the price is locked in when it is awarded.   Surveying risk during the tender phase means   that we can implement measures and price the   risk that is actually present in the project. Risk is not only a negative term in the AF Group.  Risk analysis is also used to find new opportunities  and new solutions to the benefit of our customers  and AF. After five years the system has provided  good insight into what types of projects provide  the greatest potential for good earnings and where  the risk of losses is greatest. Better risk management  has resulted in a significant reduction in the number  of loss-making projects and an improvement in the  margins for the projects. AF's average EBIT margin  for the period from 2002 to 2006 was 2.6 per cent.  During the five years (2007-2011) AF has practised  systematic risk management, the average EBIT   margin has increased to 5.5 per cent. Correct pricing  of risk is key in the competition for new projects  and has contributed to an increased order backlog  that is priced according to risk.  14 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 Health, Safety and the Environment (HSE) Sick absence 1 % 2 % 3 % 4 % 5 % 6 % 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Health All employees of AF should have a working environment  that promotes good health and job satisfaction. AF is working  actively to achieve this goal. Our employees' health is  monitored through our internal corporate health service  and systematic surveys. Our goal is to eliminate all work- related illnesses. Sickness absence goal Sickness absence is an important indicator of job satisfaction  and good management. AF's goal is a sickness absence  rate of under 3 per cent. This represents a normal situation  without any work-related illnesses. Results AF had a sickness absence rate of 3.6 per cent in 2011,  which is a decline of 0.1 per cent from 2010. For the   Norwegian portion of the business, the sickness absence  rate was 3.4 per cent, which is a decline of 0.3 percentage  points from 2010. AF's sickness absence rate is low   compared with comparable businesses. Environment Environmental work has high priority throughout the entire Group. AF would  like to avoid environmental damage and minimise undesirable effects on the  environment.  Environmental work is integrated with other HSE work at AF. Each business  area will follow the principles in ISO 14001, the internationally recognised  standard for environmental management. This means, for example, that the  environmental impact of each individual project must be surveyed and   monitored. External environment goals for our own operations In order to improve our environmental work further for our own operations,  AF actively uses the source separation rate and carbon footprint measurement  parameters. The measurement and monitoring of these parameters is the   driving force behind environmental work at AF. Means The source separation rate indicates how much of the waste from own opera- tions is sorted. The purpose of sorting is to facilitate recycling. Our carbon footprint is the measurement of AF's impact on the climate related  to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in tonnes of CO2 equivalents.   A CO2 equivalent is a unit for comparison of the effect of various greenhouse  gases on the climate. Results Carbon footprint for 2011: 34,344 tonnes of CO2 equivalents, which corresponds  to 4.7 tonnes per NOK million of turnover. See the Energy and Climate Accounts  on page 18. Source separation rate for the Group: Building (7,501 tonnes)  78 %  Rehabilitation (2,704 tonnes)  78 %  Demolition (236,018 tonnes)  97 %    Health, Safety and the Environment (HSE) AF has reduced both the sickness absence rate and number  of lost time injuries through a focused HSE effort.  15 LTI rate 2007 2008 2009  2010 2011     0 1 2 3 4 5 AF's goal is to make use   of experience from the  past for the management  of risk in the future. Safety AF is uncompromising with respect to anything that affects the safety of its  own employees and the employees of its partners. It should be safe for every- one to work on an AF project. parts of AF's operations entail risk. It is therefore important that all the risk   factors are surveyed, that undesired incidents are reported and any injuries are  investigated. All of AF's employees receive thorough training in safety work. Everyone's safety is equally important at the workplace. Any subcontractor   injuries are therefore included in AF's injury statistics in line with its own   employees. Safety goal The overall goal is to avoid all lost time injuries (lTI rate = 0). Means All injuries have a cause and therefore can be avoided. This fundamental   understanding must be incorporated into all the planning and implementation  of AF's projects. AF's goal is to make use of experience from the past for the   management of risk in the future. All tasks with an injury potential are ana- lysed through risk assessments, and risk-reducing measures are established. Results The injury frequency rate has shown a favourable trend over the years. The lTI  rate for the Norwegian operations of around 20 in the early 90s is 1.5 today.  16 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 Navigering Sustainable entrepreneurship Sustainable entrepreneurship  The AF Group will create value through profitable   and sustainable business operations. profitable growth shall contribute to ensuring  a high level of value creation for our owners  and employees. The manner in which the  operations create this value helps us to  adapt for the future. For the AF Group this  means that we integrate social and environ- mental considerations into our strategies  and day-to-day operations.  Focusing on  profitability, safety and clear ethical guide- lines have been the premises for the AF  Group's vision and mission. The same ap- plies to our long-term perspective and role  as a challenger. The core values below are the foundation   for our operations:  Reliability   Freedom to practise entrepreneurship   and discipline in relation to goals and   requirements  Thoroughness and hard work  Persistence in achieving profitable growth   Management through presence and   involvement The AF Group manages its operations in   accordance with a set of basic principles.  These principles are laid down in two docu- ments: "purpose, Goals and Values" and the  "Code of Conduct". These documents describe  the relationship between employees, custom- ers and suppliers. The purpose of this is to  maintain a culture in which orderly conduct  is recognised, valued and lived up to by all  the employees. AF expects that all employees  are able to identify and comply with the  guidelines in "purpose, Goals and Values"  and the "Code of Conduct". These premises  are also the foundation for acquisitions and  the integration of new businesses. Sustainable  entrepreneurship in the AF Group concerns  environmental factors, finance and business  ethics, as well as social aspects, such as  health, safety, diversity and equal opportu- nities. Sustainable entrepreneurship also  presupposes that the operations have the  required preparedness for undesired inci- dents, as well as systems for continuously  learning from its mistakes.  Environmental affairs All activities at AF are based on a funda- mental understanding and acceptance  that the impact on the external environ- ment must be minimised. AF is engaged in operations that may   affect the external environment by means   of noise, dust, vibrations, emissions, dis- charges and other environmental impacts.  Our operations may also entail encroach- ments on and changes to the landscape   and nature. Corporate policy and the associated   management systems for the external   environment should prevent or reduce any  undesirable environmental impact. It is a re- quirement that the business units identify  the environmental aspects of their opera- tions and that they establish and maintain  environmental goals in relation to these as- pects. This management system complies  with the principles in the environmental  standard ISO 14001. large parts of our oper- ations are certified in accordance with this  standard. The source separation rate and carbon foot- print have been chosen as the AF Group's  common measurement parameters for the  external environment. These parameters  shall function as a driving force for AF's   environmental work and are relevant to   all the units. Waste AF's operations produce various types of  waste and in varying quantities. This is man- aged by engineering and planning the pro- jects so that the minimum amount of waste  is generated and that the waste can be sort- ed to the greatest possible extent. The pur- pose of sorting is to facilitate recycling. This  entails the recycling of materials and energy  or reuse. In 2011 AF established a common reporting  system for the source separation rate for the  entire Group, in the area of construction,  renovation and demolition. The results for  2011 are illustrated in the table below.   Source separation  2011 Construction 78 % Rehabilitation 75 % Demolition 97 % Total 246,223 tonnes  17 For the AF Group,  sustainable entrepre- neurship is how we  create value. AF has operations that recycle asphalt and concrete  from the building and civil engineering industry in  Norway. The table below shows the amount of as- phalt and concrete that was recycled into quality  materials in 2011. Climate AF consumes a significant amount of energy in the  form of diesel oil for construction machinery and  electricity for the projects. In addition, the Group's  travel activities contribute indirectly to emissions. In 2010 AF established consolidated climate accounts  for the entire Group. The goal of the climate accounts  is to find AF's carbon footprint expressed in tonnes  of CO2 equivalents. Carbon footprints are measured  in relation to the turnover: tonnes CO2/operating  revenue in NOK million. The climate accounts identi- fy where the consumption of energy is the greatest  and how it develops over time. The climate accounts  have been prepared in accordance with the interna- tional standard for measuring greenhouse gases,  the Greenhouse Gas protocol Initiative (GHG   protocol). Diesel oil consumption by construction machinery  contributes the most to greenhouse gas emissions  at AF. The quantity of construction machinery will  increase in step with the turnover. We focus there- fore on the replacement of old equipment and pur- chasing modern construction machinery with lower  emissions. Dust, noise and vibrations AF's operations impact the local environment by  means of dust, noise and vibrations from several  projects. These impacts must at least not exceed the  limits stipulated by the authorities and the client. AF establishes a number of measures and barriers in  addition to these limits, often in collaboration with  the municipalities where the projects are located   or as part of the client's environmental monitoring  programme. Spraying with water from mobile water  tanks or by means of snow canons is a common  measure to prevent significant spreading of dust.  Other measures include asphalting and sweeping. It can be difficult to prevent noise nuisance in large  building and civil engineering projects, but it can be  reduced through planning and the location of work  stations, shielding the surroundings, and planning  the times when noisy work will be performed. In   addition, choosing low-noise equipment, such as  fans for ventilation during tunnel building is an   important measure. With regard to tremors and vibrations, rock blasting  and heavy construction work, such as sheet piling  and piling, are the most important sources of noise.  Tremors as a result of blasting should be avoided by  the use of smaller charges, good protection and   notification of those who are affected.

To reduce the negative impact from sheet  piling and piling the equipment and times  for performing this work should be adapted  accordingly. Chemicals AF uses many chemicals that can cause  harm if used incorrectly or if the incorrect  type of chemical is used. AF must ensure that no person or the external  environment is harmed due to chemical use.  Chemicals should be handled and stored in  a proper manner, so that health damage,  fires, explosions or other accidents are  avoided. The existence of chemicals should  be surveyed, and, the risk associated with  chemicals should be assessed. Information  about the chemicals can be found on the     products' material safety data sheets, which  are stored in the projects' substance indexes,  as well as the AF Group's central substance  index in BASS. Hazardous chemicals must  not be used if they can be replaced by  chemicals or processes that are less hazard- ous to employees or the environment. Discharges and emissions The AF Group's operations can result in   discharges and emissions to water, soil and  air. In general, a distinction is made between  ordinary discharges and emissions and acci- dental discharges and emissions. All emissions  and discharges from operations must at  least not exceed the approved permits.   This is ensured in the building or construc- tion phase through good planning and the  correct placement of temporary roads,      disposal sites and rigging areas. In addition,  temporary and permanent erosion methods  are established to prevent direct run-off  from excavation slopes etc., such as sediment  reservoirs, treatment plants, oil separators  and various types of filtration methods. Accidental discharges, such as oil product spills  in connection with a hose rupturing or while  filling construction machinery are handled  by means of special routines. Oil and fuels  are stored so that the stored volume can be  collected in the event of leaks. In addition,  there are oil-absorbing materials in all the  machines, so that any spills can be collected. To check that the routines and implemented  measures function, special external expertise  and verificators are used when necessary.  19 Business ethics The AF Group has a large number of customers and suppliers and  would like to exhibit good business ethical standards at all levels  in the organisation. AF's competitiveness and place in society   begins and ends with the fact that the company is reliable. Customers  AF's customers range from large private or public enterprises to a  large number of smaller players. Contracts are awarded by means   of tendering or through direct negotiation. There is a great deal of  competition for the contracts. All the customers should have the same rights and be treated fairly.  products and services shall be marketed and sold on the basis of the  products' properties and the advantages of AF as supplier. AF should  not make derogatory remarks about its competitors and should  comply with the current competition laws and regulations. There is  zero tolerance for price cooperation and corruption. Suppliers The purchase of goods and services accounts for 65 per cent of AF's  turnover, and the share of international purchasing is increasing. AF  is responsible for the entire contract pyramid and will only do business  with suppliers that satisfy statutory requirements, requirements in  tariff agreements, and internal requirements within the AF Group. AF has, for example, clear guidelines for conduct related to competi- tion, suppliers and conflicts of interest. In 2009, AF acceded to the  united Nations Global Compact, which is based on ten fundamental  principles for safeguarding human rights, working conditions, the  environment and anti-corruption measures.   The AF Group has an authority matrix that has been approved by the  Company's Board of Directors. The authority matrix ensures that the  Company's guidelines for contract execution and purchasing are   followed. The main rule in the Company's authority matrix states  that all agreements and payments must be signed by at least two  persons. Personal integrity  All the employees represent the AF Group in every business context. Employees must in no way have a dependent relationship with the  Company's customers, shareholders, suppliers or other associates  that can entail a conflict between the AF Group and personal inter- ests. Employees must not carry out any transactions with a relative  or close friend on behalf of the Company. Sensitive information AF should have a proper and open relationship with respect to   information. All privileged information in the AF Group must be  treated accordingly. Information from the AF Group should be uniform and correct.   There are guidelines related to who can make comments to the   media. In addition, price-sensitive information must be  handled in  accordance with the policy of inside information.  Employees who  are in possession of inside information cannot buy or sell shares   in the AF Group before this information has been made public.   price-sensitive information is made public through stock  exchange  announcements to the Oslo Stock Exchange and the  Company's  website.  The source separation rate and carbon footprint have been chosen as the AF Group's common measurement parameters for the external environment. The purpose of sorting is to  facilitate recycling. Fluorescent tubes from decommissioned platforms are sorted at the Environmental Base at Vats for recycling.  20 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011  The AF Group aims to create a working environment based on entrepreneurship with a great deal of freedom and opportunity to exert an influence. Working environment The AF Group aims to have a working   environment that promotes health and  prevents employee illness. AF would like   to create an inspiring workplace with a  high level of job satisfaction and energy.  The working environment should be based  on entrepreneurship with a great deal of  freedom and opportunity to exert an   influence. Safety AF carries out activities that are traditionally  associated with risk and can result in injuries.  AF is responsible for everyone who works on  our projects, regardless of whether they are  our own employees or subcontractors of the  AF Group.  AF's goal is that no one should be injured   as a result of their work. The safety of our  employees, partners and third parties  should never be compromised with a view  to earnings or progress. This attitude is   reflected in AF's systems and organisation,  and by everyone taking personal responsi- bility for their own safety and the safety of  others. All subcontractors are required to follow  AF's guidelines. AF conducts safety training  for everyone, regardless of their native lan- guage or employer. AF also includes subcon- tractors in the calculation basis for the safety  figures that are reported.  AF has a system to follow up and learn from  all undesired incidents. Incidents of a certain  severity must also be investigated, and the  manager of the business unit and executive  vice president must be involved.  Health At AF we see work as being a source of good  health, but employees can also be affected  negatively by various health strains as a   result of their work. The measurement and follow-up of sickness  absence is an important indicator for both  health and satisfaction. Specific arrangements  are made to ensure that the working envi- ronment promotes health and prevents  work-related illnesses. This work has been  strengthened through the establishment of  an internal corporate health service in 2008.  The corporate health service has been key in  our preventative work, and in the follow-up  of the employees, individually and by  groups. In 2011 several measures have been contin- ued and implemented in order to improve  our preventative work, for example, a fixed  routine entailing a sickness absence com- mittee in each business unit and the estab- lishment of new aids for the risk assessment  of health-related complaints. Diversity and equality The percentage of foreign employees and  subcontractors is increasing. like other players  in the building and construction industry,   AF has few female employees. The AF Group aims to have a working envi- ronment without discrimination, harassment  or bullying due to race, skin colour,  religion,  nationality, gender, sexual orientation, age  or disability. AF works deliberately to create an inclusive  workplace that promotes a greater percent- age of female employees and an environment  with multiple nationalities. Relationship between managers and   employees AF has a well-functioning employee repre- sentative structure and safety organisation,  which enables employees to influence deci- sions that concern the working environ- ment. There is a separate Works Council and  Working Environment Committee, and the  Company has representatives from salaried  employees and employees paid by the hour  on the Board of Directors. AF trains and develops employees through  development programmes that are in   accordance with our goals and values.   Development interviews for all the employ- ees should be conducted and documented  at least once a year. In addition, employee  satisfaction is measured regularly.  21  Strm Gundersen has contributed to developing Drammen from an industrial city into a modern city of knowledge through its projects. AF's competitiveness  and place in society  begins and ends  with the fact that the  company is reliable. Reputation Employees have contributed to building up the  AF Group's reputation as a company that is reliable.  Our reputation is affected by the conduct of each  individual every day. All the projects should   ensure that our reputation is maintained in their  day-to-day work. The objective of our operations is to create value  for our customers, owners, employees, suppliers  and society at large. AF's attractiveness is reflected  through how this value is created and managed.  AFs competitiveness and place in society begins  and ends with the fact that we are reliable. AF  therefore requests that all employees think and   act in accordance with AF's core values. Managers in the AF Group have an overall respon- sibility to manage in a way that creates a culture  where orderly conduct is recognised, valued and  lived up to by all the employees. Whatever has  been built up over many years can, however, be  torn down by individual incidents and affected by  the handling of incidents related to the environment,  business ethics and social responsibility. AF is  therefore uncompromising with regard to comply- ing with the "Code of Conduct" and core values. Emergency planning AF has an overarching contingency plan for the   entire Group. The plan provides guidelines for how  the contingency plan and the emergency prepar- edness organisation in the projects should be built  up. A key element here is the requirement that the  projects identify and define all the hazards and   accident situations that can lead to damage, injury  or the loss of property. The objective is to be able  to handle and reduce the harmful effects of poten- tial emergency situations. The Group has an emergency management team  that is available 24 hours a day in event of accidents  or potential accidents. Depending on the situation,  the need to establish a crisis team within the Group  will be assessed. Learn from our mistakes undesired incidents can occur despite our focus on  planning and preventative measures. It is therefore  important to learn from these incidents. AF registers  and handles all HSE incidents, quality discrepancies  or incidents, which may be negative for the AF Group's  reputation. The incident's severity and loss poten- tial are always assessed upon registration. What  part of the organisation should be involved, how  the incident should be investigated and how the  experience should be transferred is based on the  degree of severity (red, yellow or green). In a serious incident, such as a work-related accident  resulting in lost time, the head of the business unit  involved and the responsible executive vice presi- dent should be involved. An investigation report  with corrective or preventative measures must be  prepared to avoid the recurrence of similar acci- dents.  Navigering AF GRUPPEN People in the AF Group 22 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 People at AF The AF Group is showing strong growth.   This provides many opportunities for the  Company's ambitious and competent   employees.  23  The most profitable investment AF makes is to develop the knowledge and expertise of its employees. Employee  satisfaction survey 1 2 3 4 5 6 2008 2009  2011 Business sector average Overall, I am satisfed with  AF as an employer Employees who are proud, satisfied and dedicated  are a good foundation upon which AF can achieve  its goal of becoming a leading industrial group.   A  recent survey shows that AF's employees have   a high level of job satisfaction. On a scale from 1   to 6, our employees gave an average score of 5   when describing their level of job satisfaction in  the  Company. This is significantly higher than the   average for the industry. AF works in a targeted manner to develop the  Company's standing as an attractive employer.   AF has a human resource policy that challenges  the employees to take responsibility and take   on exciting challenges. This gives employees an   opportunity for a fast-paced career and personal  development. AF recruits for the future The Company's growth gives AF an almost inex- haustible need for competent managers. A total   of 600 engineers will be recruited over the next  three years. In 2011 AF conducted the largest   recruitment campaign in the Company's history,  "Join us and build on Mars." Talented engineers  were challenged to think in a different and future- oriented manner, and to contribute to the devel- opment of environmentally friendly and future- oriented solutions for the planet Mars. AF also  works in a focused manner with a number of   colleges and universities in order to attract new  employees.   AF develops its employees The most profitable investment AF makes is   to  develop the knowledge and expertise of its   employees. All the employees at AF have an   opportunity to develop both their technical and  management skills. "learning by doing" is a tool  that is used to a great extent in employee   development. All of the Group's courses and training pro- grammes are combined under the AF Academy.  AF focuses a great deal on developing its own  managers. In 2011 over 1,100 employees partici- pated in courses at the AF Academy. In addition,  employees can apply to participate in courses   and further education at renowned educational  institutions such as INSEAD, the Norwegian   School of Economics (NHH) and the Norwegian  Business School (BI). The most profitable   investment AF makes  is to develop the know- ledge and expertise   of its employees.   24 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011  A broad range of services means that AF can offer many centres of expertise and career opportunities across the Group. Corporate culture and   management AF has attached importance to building a value- based corporate culture. Managers at AF are to  achieve results by setting a good example and  building a culture in which orderly conduct is   recognised, valued and lived up to by our   employees. AF has, therefore, been very clear  about what qualities it values in our employees:   Observance of AFs code of conduct and   core  values  Being business-oriented  Analytical abilities  Ability to be decisive and take action  Being leaders and motivators Ownership of own workplace AF's goal is that all employees should have an   opportunity to become shareholders in the   Company and benefit from the increase in value  arising from joint value creation and development.  In the last option programme, which was termi- nated in February 2011, AFs employees purchased  shares totalling NOK 75 million. In September  2011, the Company launched a new three-year  option  programme, which more than 1,000   employees have already taken advantage of.   In addition,  employees have an opportunity to  purchase shares in the Company at a discounted  price each year. AF employees own about 17 per  cent of the Company's shares. AF's goal is that all  employees should  have an opportunity  to become share-  holders in the company  and benefit from the  increase in value   arising from joint   value creation and   development.  25  With nature as the classroom: AF arranges an annual management develop- ment course at Gl, with nature and the peer Gynt play as a grand backdrop. Corporate democracy A well-functioning employee representative structure and  safety organisation at all levels of the organisation ensures  the employees' right to participate in decisions that affect  their work situation. pl Egil Rnn  CEO Arild Moe  Executive Vice president paul-Terje Gundersen  Executive Vice president Brd Frydenlund  Vice president Human Resources Henrik Nilsson  Head employee representative Arne Sveen  Head employee representative Tore Solvang  Employee representative Oddvar Skevik  Employee representative Working Environment Commitee  26 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 NOK Million 2011 2010 2009 Revenue 2,356 2,158 1,768 EBITDA 173 227 114 Operating profit (EBIT) 131 194 82 Earnings before taxes (EBT) 134 198 105 EBITDA % 7.3 % 10.5 % 6.5 % EBIT % 5.6 % 9.0 % 4.6 % EBT % 5.7 % 9.2 % 5.9 % Capital employed  500 446 221 Return on capital employed 30.3 % 60.8 % 63.3 % Order backlog 3,290 1,899 2,175 Key figures The T-connection is   a subsea tunnel with   difficult ground conditions.

Rune Sandven, Project Manager,   Public Roads Administration The Civil Engineering business area comprises all  of AFs civil engineering activities in Norway and  Sweden. The Civil Engineering business area consists of:  AF Anlegg  AF Offshore & Civil Construction  Plplintar  27 Civil Engineering 2011 Number of employees AF Group 2,394 763 32 % Turnover (EBT NOK million) AF Group 404 134 33 % Earnings before taxes NOK million AF Group 7,356 2,356 32 % EBT % AF Group 5.5 % 5.7 % % 1 2 3 4 5 6  CIVIl ENGINEERING 2011 High level of activity and good results The Civil Engineering business area comprises all of AFs civil  engineering activities in Norway and Sweden. In Norway,   AF is engaged in civil engineering operations throughout the  country. In Sweden, AF has operations in the Stockholm area  through the wholly-owned subsidiary plplintar.  29 The Civil Engineering business area carries out large complex civil  engineering projects and niche projects in the following areas:   transport, port facilities, oil/energy/offshore and foundation work. AF Anlegg carries out traditional civil engineering projects through- out Norway. The unit is one of Norway's leading tunnel contractors  and focuses on large complex projects. AF Offshore & Civil Construction  carries out building and civil engineering projects aimed at the oil  and gas industry, as well as projects in the area of power plants and  sea and port facilities throughout Norway. The onshore facilities   represent the core market in the oil and gas industry. Its main activities  have been associated with onshore facilities, such as Krst, Kollsnes,  Mongstad, Snhvit and Ormen lange. In addition, we deliver mechan- ical projects offshore. plplintar carries out foundation work projects for industrial, residential  and public buildings in Stockholm and Mlardalen. 2011 in brief In 2011 Civil Engineering reported a turnover of NOK 2,356 million  (2,158 million). The profit before tax was NOK 134 million (198 million).  The profit margin was 5.7 per cent in 2011, compared with 9.2 per  cent in 2010. The decrease in profit is attributed to weaker results in  the port portfolio. Civil Engineering delivered better results overall  than the long-term goal. AF Anlegg saw a high level of activity and reported very good profits  in 2011. Healthy profits were created by good project management.  In 2011 AF Anlegg entered into contracts for several infrastructure  projects, of which Ringway West phase II in Bergen was the largest  (NOK 821 million). The AF Group also entered into a large operations  management contract with Store Norske Spitsbergen Grubekompani,  which is valued at an estimated NOK 600 million over five years.   AF Offshore & Civil Construction has faced challenges in the port  portfolio, but can report positive results again in Q4. AF was awarded  two contracts to build foundations for the construction of transmis- sion lines in 2011. It is expected that several large contracts for the  construction of transmission lines will be put out to tender over the  coming years. AF Offshore & Civil Construction is well positioned for  further growth in this segment. plplintar has had a stable and good performance throughout the  year, but it experienced some decline in the level of activity towards  the end of 2011. Our competitiveness in the pile market has been  strengthened through the establishment of a concrete pile factory   in 2011. Market outlook The Civil Engineering market is driven primarily by major public infra- structure projects. The level of investment is high and further growth  is anticipated. The strongest growth is expected in roads and power  facilities. The Norwegian civil engineering market is expected to grow  overall by 12 per cent in 2012. There is a great deal of competition in  the infrastructure market, but AF Anlegg is well positioned to take its  share of any growth. Investments in new onshore installations for the oil and gas industry  are still somewhat further in the future. Further positioning within  the maintenance and modification market in the oil and gas industry  and the development of renewable energy do nevertheless provide  some potential for growth. The Swedish market for foundation work has been challenging   towards the end of 2011. The development in 2012 will depend on  the macroeconomic developments in Sweden and the rest of Europe. The Civil Engineering business area had an order backlog of NOK  3,290 million (1,899 million) as at 31 December.  30 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011   AF entered into an agreement with Store Norske Spitsbergen Grubekompani for transport, civil engineering and maintenance services at Svea on Svalbard. Strategy AF will seek growth by expanding its geographic market area and identifying opportunities for new   activities close to their existing operations. Our focus is aimed at clients with large complex projects   that require a great deal from AF's organisation in the areas of project management, technical imple- mentation, operations management, risk management and HSE.   AF will seek to expand its range of services related to maintenance and modifications in the oil and   gas sector. AF strengthened its presence in this segment in 2011 through the acquisition of parts of   the  operations of Btservice Offshore/Verft. Further growth in the maintenance and modification    market has high priority. Growth may be achieved through organic growth or acquisitions. In addition,  AF  continues to work on positioning itself in renewable energy projects, particularly in wind power,   both offshore and onshore.   Civil Engineering is continuously seeking to strengthen the organisation through new recruitment,  training programmes and career planning. The units should actively recruit qualified graduates from   colleges and employees with experience in operations and project management.

BuIlDING 2011 Strong growth and improved margins The Building business area performs traditional building   activities with a solid local base. Building has a strong   market position in central Eastern Norway and, with the   new establishments and acquisitions in 2011, there are   also building activities in Southern and Western Norway.   In Sweden the activities are focused on the Gothenburg   – Halmstad area.  35  AF has shown through the Kilden Theatre and Concert Hall that the company has the resources and expertise required for the successful completion of large building projects.   Our efforts in Southern Norway are being intensified now. AF has broad experience across the entire value chain from develop- ment to completed buildings. The core markets are commercial build- ings, residential projects and public buildings. Our customers cover a  broad spectrum from small companies with a simple assignment to  large private and public clients with a longstanding client relationship.  AF can increase the opportunities available to clients for the design of  new buildings through technical solutions and the choice of materials.  The Kilden Theatre and Concert Hall is a good example of how AF can  solve complex challenges for clients. AF is also one of Norways largest  building renovation contractors. Building will actively search for new and better production techniques,  new methods and building processes that provide a greater degree of  industrialisation. Future growth will be realised by being in the forefront  of new trends and concepts, and increasing the share of international  purchasing. Continuously seeking to improve quality will improve the  margins and the clients' perception of AF will be strengthened further. In Q4 2011 AF acquired the majority shareholding in Strm Gundersen  and Rogaland Entreprenr. Strm Gundersen includes the subsidiaries Strm Gundersen AS, Haga  & Berg Entreprenr AS, Thorendahl AS and Consolvo AS. In addition,  there are several smaller companies.   Strm Gundersen is Buskerud's leading contractor for building and  heavy concrete structures.   Haga & Berg Entreprenr operates in the areas of renovation,   remodelling, service and maintenance of commercial buildings in   the Oslo  region.   Thorendal is one of Oslo's largest companies in the area of facade   renovation of residential and commercial buildings.   Consolvo carries out concrete renovation by means of mechanical   repair and cathodic protection. AF Rogaland Entreprenr is engaged in building activities in Rogaland.  The company specialises in turnkey contracts for commercial and   residential buildings. Strm Gundersen and AF Rogaland Entreprenr are included in the  consolidated figures from the takeover dates, 3 and 15 November,   respectively. AF Bygg Gteborg is AFs largest business unit in Sweden. In addition  to traditional building activities, the business unit is engaged in devel- oping and building property projects for its own account. The business  unit also carries out building activities in Halmstad through its subsidiary  AF Bygg Syd. 2011 in brief Building reported revenues of NOK 3,757 million (2,267 million) in 2011,  an increase of 66 per cent compared with 2010. This growth is a result  of strong organic growth, combined with the acquisition of Strm  Gundersen and AF Rogaland Entreprenr. The profit before tax was  NOK 144 million (51 million). The profit margin increased from 2.3 per  cent in 2010 to 3.8 per cent in 2011. The improvement in the profit  margin was a result of the fact that the Swedish operations delivered  positive results, in addition to the very good profit margins in the  Strm Gundersen Group. The margin for Building is still lower than   the long-term goal for the Building business area. The Norwegian Building business area has been marked by strong  growth in 2011 with many projects in the start-up phase. All of the  units are delivering positive results, even though the margins vary. The  restructuring of the operations in Sweden has started to show positive  results in 2011. The efforts to improve profitability will continue in 2012. Market outlook The demand for building services in the Norwegian market has been  good throughout 2011, and this is expected to continue in 2012. The  strongest segment in the market is residential construction and com- mercial buildings are somewhat more hesitant. The market in stfold  has improved in 2011, as a result of the development of a new hospital  in stfold. The market in Gothenburg is still marked by stiff competition  for contracts, and there is more uncertainty related to the development  of the market in 2012 than in the Norwegian part of the operations.   At the end of the year the Building business area had an order backlog  of NOK 4,965 million (3,067 million).  36 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011  Drammen Library. The Strm Gundersen Group complements AF geographically and provides specialist expertise in the renovation of buildings and the civil engineering market. Strategy Building aims to achieve turnover and earnings growth. This growth will be realised by being a leading  player in our existing home market, and establishing operations in new geographical areas in Norway  and Sweden. New business will be established through organic growth or acquisitions.  Building has grown a great deal in 2011. The focus in 2012 will be on further development of the opera- tions to achieve higher margins. This will be achieved by building up management capacity based on  AF's corporate culture, and by recruiting new talent. Building will focus on reducing costs associated  with quality discrepancies.   In 2011 AF established building operations in Southern Norway based on the position created through  the construction of the Kilden Cultural Centre in Kristiansand. These operations have delivered positive  results in the start-up year. AF has ambitions for further growth in Southern Norway. In 2011 Building has also established operations in Buskerud and Rogaland through the acquisition of  Strm Gundersen and AF Rogaland Entreprenr. With Strm Gundersen AF will continue to build on the  local management so that the operations will continue to deliver strong results. Building sees a great  potential for growth in Rogaland in the form of organic growth through AF Rogaland Entreprenr. AF has ambitions  for further growth in  Southern Norway.

AF will gain better control over the value chain by increased   collaboration between the property and contracting operations.   This collaboration will reduce the level of uncertainty in the execution  phase and contribute to more efficient development processes.   This will result in increased profitability overall for AF. AF collaborates closely with other players in the industry. Development  projects are often organised by setting up joint development com- panies with partners, which reduces the project-specific risk and   allows the partners to benefit from each others expertise. 2011 in brief property reported a healthy profit before tax of NOK 31 million   (35 million) for 2011. The turnover of NOK 70 million (134 million) is  lower than in 2010. The reduction in turnover is attributed to the fact  that AF carried out a greater share of its projects through associated  companies. projects where AF has ownership interests sold a total of  199 apartments in 2011, compared with 196 apartments in 2010.  AFs share of the apartments sold totalled 84 (91). Development of 6 new housing projects/building phases started in  2011. The projects sold a total of 147 apartments in 2011. AFs share  of the apartments sold is 52. AFs share of the unsold apartments in  these projects is 29. Since the development projects are organised  as associated companies in the AF Group, these projects are not   included in the order backlog. As at 31 December 2011 AF's share of unsold completed apartments  totalled 17 (39). property delivered two projects in 2011, Grefsenkoll- veien 16 and Rolvsrud park Q. These projects accounted for a total of  97 apartments. All the apartments were sold on delivery.  Rolvsrud park, which consists of 550 apartments, a nursing home  and a day care centre, has been a successful project for AF. The project  will be completed when the last construction phase is delivered in  2012. In collaboration with the Municipality of lrenskog, AF has been  involved in developing this centrally located area in lrenskog. AF  wishes to continue this success and has therefore entered into an  agreement with the Municipality of lrenskog for the development  of a site on Nordliveien, opposite Rolvsrud park. As a step in strengthening the property portfolio, the property business  area has entered into an agreement to purchase 100 % of Bjrnsons  Hage AS. This agreement encompasses the purchase of six residential  properties in the centre of lillestrm. AF has also  entered into an  agreement to own one third of Rolfsbukta utvikling KS, which has  purchased the former headquarters of  Fjellanger Widere at Fornebu. Market outlook  The brisk housing sales in 2011 are expected to continue in 2012.  The economy is growing at a healthy pace, and the interest rate level  is expected to remain low. AF Eiendom is well positioned to increase  its turnover in the housing segment. The commercial property market  is more hesitant, and it will still take some time before AF Eiendom  will be able to realise new commercial projects.  42 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011  AF develops residential and non-residential buildings for its own account. Most of the projects are located geographically where AF has its own contracting services. Strategy property's strategy is to develop properties in the same geographic markets where AF has building   operations. The project development risk is reduced by entering into option agreements for land, and  by having partners that also have ownership interests in the projects. As a general rule, at least 50 per  cent of the units in a residential project should be sold before construction begins. AF has had the most success in property development in the residential segment in the Oslo area.   property will follow the contracting operations and is therefore working to expand its geographic range   to include Buskerud, the Agder counties and Rogaland. In addition, AF is seeking to gain a stronger   position in property development in stfold. Going forward, property will seek to strengthen its  position   in commercial property. property expects therefore to increase its investments and portfolio of sites. Going forward,   Property will seek to  strengthen its position  in commercial   property.

The  business area includes AFs environmental services in the  area of onshore and offshore demolition and recycling.  Onshore demolition is carried out in Norway, Sweden and  poland. Offshore demolition and recycling focuses on the  North Sea market.  47  The AF Group's Environment business area has been awarded the contract to demolish the 45 year old multi-level interchange Bispelokket in the centre of Oslo. Environment will offer solutions that meet the environmental chal- lenges faced by the Group's customers through state-of-the-art exper- tise. Strict environmental regulations and demanding demolition work  means that attention to environmental protection and safety must per- meate our work at all times. The Environmental Base at Vats accepts and  processes materials from demolition activities in the North Sea, and it is  Europe's most modern reception facility for recycling decommissioned  oil installations. 2011 in brief In 2011 Environment reported a turnover of NOK 777 million (767 million)  and a profit before tax of NOK 80 million (90 million). The decrease in  the profit before tax must be seen in light of the fact that the sale of 60  per cent of Miljbase Vats AS resulted in a capital gain of NOK 42 million  in 2010. Good operations for both onshore and offshore demolition and  environmental clean-up are the reason for the very good results in 2011.  Environment delivered better results overall than the long-term goal.   Offshore activities AF Decom Offshore saw considerable activity in the Norwegian sector  in 2011. The company performed extensive and complex work offshore.  Through its work, the company has again demonstrated its ability to  perform demanding operations in an efficient and safe manner, pro- tecting both personnel and the environment. In 2011 the Environmental Base at Vats received approximately 23,900  tonnes (26,200 tonnes) of decommissioned offshore installations from  the North Sea for demolition and recycling. The work to ensure an   environmentally sound end to the installations' life cycle is well under  way. Work to streamline the operations of the Environmental Base at  Vats has contributed a great deal to the good results in 2011. Continu- ous improvement of the demolition and recycling processes will ensure  that the facility represents an important competitive edge for AF in the  coming years. In 2011 AF was awarded the contract H7 platform Removal project   (NOK 420 million). The fact that this contract was awarded shows that  AF's strict requirements for safety and the environment during the   performance of the work are appreciated by its customers. The contract  also includes an option for the removal of B11, which is a similar platform.  The market for the removal of offshore installations has been marked by  volatility in the supply of projects. Being awarded the H7 project was an  important milestone for maintaining good capacity utilisation at the   Environmental Base at Vats. In 2011 the AF Group entered into an agree- ment with DeepOcean to bring ashore and recycle a loading buoy at  Statfjord C for Statoil (NOK 49 million). Land-based demolition The onshore demolition activities in Norway delivered a high turnover  and a very good profit for 2011. Systematic work through focusing on  project management and strengthening the capacity of the central  management is showing results now. In Sweden the level of activity for  the land-based activities has increased significantly over 2010, and they  are also reporting good results.  preparation for the demolition and dismantling of the wreck of the   Russian cruiser, the Murmansk, has continued throughout 2011. The  work to seal the damage that occurred during the storm in November  2010 appears to be taking longer than originally anticipated. The   removal of the Murmansk is expected in the autumn of 2012. Market outlook A higher level of activity and continued good earnings are expected for  the onshore activities in 2012. A good level of activity is expected for all  the regions. The land-based activities are characterised by short time  horizons from a project being ordered to completion. The duration of  the order backlog is normally 3–6 months in the future. In a situation  with new uncertainty related to the Norwegian and international econ- omy, this could quickly affect the turnover and earnings in this part of  the operations.  48 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011  AF Decom Offshore is expanding its range of services at the Environmental Base at Vats. The deep water dock and the facilities at the base make it well-suited to receive rigs for   maintenance. Largest contracts signed in 2011 Strategy Environment's mission is to offer solutions that meet the environmental challenges the Group's customers  face through state-of-the-art expertise. In addition to developing the onshore demolition activities in   Norway further, the company is seeking to obtain an adequate volume for the demolition operations in  Sweden and poland. Growth in the Swedish demolition operations is expected to continue through   increasing our geographic focus area. Growth will be achieved through organic growth and acquisitions. There is strong demand in the area of services and maintenance services for rigs. AF is also seeking to   position itself for such assignments through the deep water dock at the Environmental Base at Vats. AF will continue to work on the establishment of an environmental base at Dales Voe on Shetland to strengthen  our competitiveness on the British side of the North Sea. In Norway, work to streamline production at the  Environmental Base at Vats will continue. AF will continue to  work on the establish- ment of an environ- mental base at Dales  Voe on Shetland to  strengthen our   competitiveness on  the British side of   the North Sea.

There is a total of around 500  installations on the Norwegian continental shelf, and the cost of removal  and demolition is estimated to be NOK 160 billion. In a report from  2002, DNV estimated that more than 30 installations were to be removed  and demolished from 2010 to 2020. On the British continental shelf, the  removal and demolition market is expected to total approximately NOK  250 billion for the period up until 2040.  Recent years have shown that  the decommissioning is proceeding slower than expected, and that  there is great uncertainty about when it will be implemented. There is a  good level of activity in Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) studies,  and tendering activity is expected to increase on the British sector in 2012. At the end of the year, the Environment business area had an order  backlog of NOK 1,081 million (892 million).

ENERGY 2011 High level of activity offshore, challenging  for maritime and land-based activity Global demand for energy is rising and opening up new  business opportunities for the AF Group. Energy will drive  the development of smarter, more energy-efficient technical  solutions for the building, industry, offshore and maritime  sectors. photo: yvind Markussen / Oslo lufthavn AS  53  Mollier provides maintenance and modification services for HVAC systems on offshore installations. Energy's mission is to help customers lower their operating costs  and achieve the best possible solutions for efficient energy use. AF Energi & Miljteknikk works with the building and industry market  segments in Norway. AF can guarantee customers lower energy   consumption through the delivery of technical systems and solutions.  The collaboration with Avinor is a good example of this. AF has shown  through the contract with Avinor how we can create profitability for  both the client and the environment through good project  planning  and execution. The product range of AF Energi & Miljteknikk includes a thorough  energy analysis that results in a system design and the implementa- tion of measures to conserve the consumption of energy. In addition,  energy and energy monitoring services are provided. AF also designs,  installs and monitors local heating plants for commercial buildings  and industry. AF supplies offshore and maritime ventilation, heating and cooling  systems (HVAC) through Energy. Aeron supplies HVAC systems for  new build offshore service vessels to shipyards around the world.  Maintenance and modification services for HVAC systems on offshore  installations are supplied through Mollier. The solutions that are   delivered will safeguard stable and efficient production for our clients. 2011 in brief Energy had a lower level of activity in 2011 and a turnover of NOK  462 million (564 million). This reduction is attributed primarily to the  reduced turnover in AF Energi & Miljteknikk and Aeron. Energy   delivered a profit before tax of NOK 1 million (-21 million) in 2011.  The results are poor, but the improvement measures implemented  are expected to gradually have a positive effect on the results. In   the last quarter Energy had a profit margin of 5.8 per cent.   The level of activity in AF Energi & Miljteknikk has been significant- ly lower in 2011 due to concentrating its operations on its core ex- pertise. A stronger strategic focus is expected to give better results  for the operations in the future. Aeron saw a decline in turnover and earnings in 2011. Thanks to long- term work on international purchasing, Aeron is competitive in the  market. In 2011 the company won several contracts in Asia, and   exports comprise an increasing share of the turnover. The unrest in  the European economy has made it difficult to maintain the same  level of activity as in 2010. Mollier has had an increasing level of activity and good profitability  in 2011. The good results are attributed to consistently good quality  in all deliveries. An increased focus on projects for new build vessels  and modifications means that the company has the potential for   further growth. Market outlook The market for offshore HVAC has been good throughout all of 2011.  The investment level in the North Sea is expected to increase in  2012, and this will provide a continued good market for Mollier.   Aeron is exposed to the market for new build offshore service vessels.  The market has been challenging in the aftermath of the financial  crisis. After a slight improvement in the market in the first half of  2011, the market weakened again towards the end of the year. The increased focus on energy-efficient buildings is expected to   contribute to an improvement in AF Energi & Miljteknikk's market.  Support programmes are still necessary in order for businesses and  private individuals to see adequate profitability from implementing  the projects. The Energy business area had an order backlog of NOK 434 million  (299 million) as at 31 December.  54 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011  Aeron supplies HVAC systems for new build offshore service vessels to shipyards around the world.

This requires increased manage- ment capacity and good access to expertise. Through targeted identification and follow-up of talent  within our organisation, we will retain and develop future managers.   professionalisation of customer and sales work is an important prerequisite for growth. Energy will   market its combined range of services under the slogan "Blue Environmental Effect". A blue environ- mental effect means that solutions must be profitable for both the customer who invests and the   environment.   In order to build competitiveness Energy will continue to develop its expertise and systems for purchas- ing from low-cost countries. Along with the industrialisation/standardisation of the project execution,  this will contribute to a competitive cost level.

Energy projects during the year Avinor AF signed an energy conservation contract  with Avinor in 2011. The contract encom- passes three international and nine regional  airports, and AF will make use of its substantial  expertise in energy consumption through  this contract, so that Avinor will achieve a  significant and long-term reduction in energy  and energy costs for its buildings and facilities.  So far the energy consumption has been   reduced by 22 per cent, which corresponds  to approximately 12 million kWh per year.

The AF Group follows  the Norwegian Code of practice for Corporate  Governance of 21 October 2010 and the   subsequent amendments and amplifications  stated in the document of 20 October 2011.  The following description explains how the  15 points are followed up within the AF  Group. 1. Statement of corporate  governance Corporate governance is a broad subject that  deals with the relationship between society,  the owners, the Board and the management  of the AF Group. The AF Group wishes to focus on managing  the creation of value in a sustainable manner  that safeguards the needs of the present gen- eration without compromising the ability of  future generations to meet their own needs.  This involves safeguarding the ethical, envi- ronmental and social aspects of project   implementation within Building, Civil Engi- neering, property, Environment and Energy.  Sustainable entrepreneurship also involves  controlling business risk, maintaining envi- ronmental order in one's own operations and   being an attractive workplace. The AF Group  has focused on finding future-oriented ways  of creating value since it was established. The  Environment and Energy business areas are  good examples of how we create competi- tiveness and develop our operations in   accordance with the resource and environ- mental requirements dictated by our society. The Company must have high standards for  corporate governance. A transparent and  sound governance structure is necessary if  the Company is to achieve its financial goals  and meet its social obligations. The company  emphasises the importance of ensuring that  all of its commercial activities are performed  in accordance with the recommended  standards and regulations. This  concerns,   for example, the integrity of the Group and  its employees, proper market  behaviour,  consideration for the external  environment,  a good working environment and a safe  workplace for employees. Good corporate governance is a prerequisite  for a sound and sustainable company, and it  is built on transparency and equal treatment  of our shareholders. The Company's manage- ment system and control routines help us   ensure that we conduct our business in a   prudent and profitable manner for the bene- fit of our employees, shareholders, partners,   customers and society in general. A healthy  corporate culture is a key driver in instilling  confidence in the Company, providing access  to capital and ensuring sound value creation  over time. There must be a clear division of  work between the Board and the manage- ment. While the AF Group does not have a  corporate assembly, it has three employees  on the Board. The AF Group manages its operations in   accordance with a set of basic principles.  These principles are laid down in two docu- ments: "purpose, Goals and Values" and the  "Code of Conduct". These documents de- scribe the relationship between employees,  customers and suppliers. The purpose of this  is to maintain a culture in which orderly   conduct is recognised, valued and lived up to  by all employees. AF expects that all employ- ees are able to identify and comply with the  guidelines in "purpose, Goals and Values"   and the "Code of Conduct". These premises  are also the foundation for acquisitions and  integration. At the heart of AF Groups vision and mission  statement is a focus on profitability, safety  and clear ethical guidelines. This includes   a long term perspective and the Groups   corporate role as a challenger. Sustainable entrepreneurship in the AF   Group concerns environmental factors, busi- ness  ethics and social aspects, such as health,  safety, diversity and equal opportunities. It  also encompasses the intention to always  learn from our mistakes, and to have the   required level of preparedness for unexpect- ed incidents. The AF Group's environmental  and social responsibilities are described in  greater detail on page 18 and on our website  at www.afgruppen.com. By steering the AF Group towards challeng- ing tasks and goals, our operations will, over  time, maintain and improve their position in  the market and continue to create value  growth for our owners, employees, custom- ers, suppliers and society at large. The AF  Group has a fundamental understanding   and acceptance that injuries have a cause  and can, therefore, be avoided. The AF Group  has a strong focus on health, the environ- ment and safety. This is described in further  detail on page 14 of the annual report. Deviation from the Code of Practice: None. 2. Activities  The AF Group (AF) consists of the parent  company AF Gruppen ASA and its subsidiaries. The purpose of the AF Group's operations   is to create value for customers, owners,   employees, suppliers and society within the  framework of the legislation in effect at any  given time. The Articles of Association are on  the Group's website. According to the Articles  of Association, the Companys objects include  all types of business operations, including  participation in other undertakings. The Board of Directors' report contains an   account of the Group's goals and strategies,  and the market is updated through investor  presentations in connection with the quarter- ly reports. In the annual strategy processes, the Board  reviews whether the goals and guidelines   ensuing from the strategies are clear,   adequate, operationally effective and easy   to understand for employees. All significant   policies are available to employees via the   AF Group's intranet. The Companys objective is to achieve a   competitive return on the capital employed  over time to maximise value creation for the  Group and its owners:   We aim to create continuous value growth,  which will make us attractive to shareholders  and investors, and expand the scope of our  business activities.   We aim to have an operating margin and   return on the capital employed that are      58 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 higher than the average for listed companies  that are comparable to us.   AF seeks opportunities to leverage its core  competencies and grow its business by  structuring and managing its operations   to deliver value to stakeholders. The Companys goals are described in more  detail in the booklet purpose, Goals and   Values. In addition, all employees and officers  at AF must follow the Companys code of   conduct. Both booklets have been distributed  to employees and Board members and can  be downloaded from the Companys website. Deviation from the Code of Practice: None. 3. Share capital and dividends As at 31 December 2011 AF Gruppen ASA  had equity of NOK 212 million after provisions  for the proposed, but not yet adopted dividend.  The Board makes an ongoing assessment of  the capital situation in light of the Company's  objectives, strategy and desired risk profile. Dividend The AF Group's goal is to manage the  Group's resources so that shareholders   receive a  return in the form of dividends and  share price appreciation that is competitive  relative to comparable investments. The  Company  assumes that future dividends   will be stable and, preferably, rise. In 2011, a dividend of NOK 4.50 per share   was paid. Overall, NOK 346 million of the  Group's profits were distributed as dividends  in 2011. The dividend for distribution in 2012  is expected to amount to NOK 4.50 per share. Authority to acquire treasury shares The General Meeting has authorised the  Board to acquire treasury shares. A more   detailed description of this is provided in the  minutes of the Annual General Meeting of AF  Gruppen ASA on 13 May 2011. When buying  and selling treasury shares, the Company  should seek to achieve the most favourable  price possible. The Board is free with respect  to the methods used to acquire and dispose  of treasury shares, though always with the  provision that the general principle of equal  treatment of shareholders must be observed.  Shares sold to employees and elected repre-  sentatives may be sold at a discount of up   to 20 per cent below the prevailing market  price. This authority is valid from 13 May 2011  until the 2012 Annual General Meeting,  hence not beyond 30 June 2012. Capital increase In connection with the Company's share   programme for employees, two new issues   of 5,676,750 shares were carried out in 2011.  The share capital was thereby increased by  NOK 283,838. At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 31  January 2011, the Board was authorised to   increase share capital by up to NOK 300,000,  divided into 6,000,000 shares, each with a  nominal value of NOK 0.05. This authority  may only be used to issue shares in connec- tion with the Companys option programme  and share programme for employees in the  Group, by one or more new issues. The Board  may decide to deviate from the shareholders  pre-emptive right to subscribe for shares   under section 10-4 of the public limited  Companies Act. This authority is valid until the 2012 Annual  General Meeting, hence not beyond 30 June  2012. Option programme for employees In 2008, the General Meeting adopted an   option programme covering all the employ- ees in the AF Group. The maximum number  of options that could be allotted was  12,500,000. In accordance with the authority  granted to the Board, the Board adopted a  capital increase of 5,163,750 shares on 14  February 2011 in connection with the re- demption of options. At the Annual General  Meeting held on 13 May 2011 a new option  programme was adopted. The maximum  number of options that can be allotted in   accordance with the new programme is  6,000,000. Each option entitles the holder to  purchase one share in AF Gruppen ASA. The  allotment of options started in the third quar- ter of 2011 and will end in the second quarter  of 2013. An option may only be exercised if  the holder is still employed by the Company  on 31 March 2014. The Board was authorised by the General  Meeting to draw up detailed guidelines for the  programme within the established framework. Deviation from the Code of Practice: None. 4. Equal treatment of share- holders and transactions   with related parties Equal treatment of shareholders AF Gruppen ASA has one class of shares and  all the shares have equal voting rights. In their  work the Board and management emphasise  that all shareholders are to be treated equally  and have the same opportunities for influence. Capital increase In the event of a capital increase, existing  shareholders are to be given priority, unless  special circumstances dictate that this can be  waived. Such deviation would then be justified  and made public in stock exchange announce- ments in connection with the capital increase. Treasury share transactions Transactions shall be carried out at market  price in cases where the Board asks the   General Meeting to authorise the purchase   of treasury shares. Any deviations from the  equality principle must be approved by the  General Meeting. The Company's transactions in its own   shares, with the exception of sales to employ- ees, take place at the market price. There are  no shareholder agreements between the   Companys shareholders. Transactions with related parties To safeguard its reputation, the AF Group  supports openness and caution in relation to  investments where there are circumstances  that can be perceived as an unfortunate close  involvement, or close relationship, between  the Company and a board member, senior   executive or party related to them. This is  stated in the AF Group's Code of Conduct  (see section 1). It is incumbent upon the   individual board member to assess on an   ongoing basis whether there are circumstances  that objectively speaking are likely to weaken  public confidence in the board member's   impartiality or may give rise to conflicts of   interest. Transactions with related parties are conduct- ed at arm's length. The Board has guidelines  to ensure that senior executives inform the  Board if they have a material interest, directly  Shareholder information  59 or indirectly, in any agreement entered into  by the Company. Two of the board members  represent companies that are major custom- ers of the AF Group. Transactions with them  are carried out at the market price. Deviation from the Code of Practice: None. 5. Negotiability The shares are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange  and are freely negotiable. The Articles of   Association contain no restrictions on   negotiability.  Deviation from the Code of Practice: None. 6. General Meeting The shareholders exercise the highest   authority in the AF Group through the   General Meeting. The Board shall ensure   that the  General Meeting is an effective   forum for shareholders and the Board. The  Board, AF Group's Corporate Management  Team,  Nomination Committee and auditor  shall be present at the General Meetings. The 2012 Annual General Meeting will be  held on 11 May. Notice will be sent in the mail  at least 21 days in advance to all the share- holders to the address registered in the share- holder register of the Norwegian Central   Securities Depository. Documents regarding  matters to be considered at the General  Meeting must either be sent as enclosures   to the notice or made available to the share- holders on the Companys website at the  same time the notice is sent. Shareholders  may still demand to receive the documents  by mail. The Company may not demand any  form of compensation for sending documents  to shareholders. Shareholders must notify  their attendance to the Company no later  than two days prior to the General Meeting  to be entitled to attend. Minutes of General Meetings, powers of   attorney granted to the Board by the General  Meeting and the current Articles of Associa- tion will be published on the AF Groups web- site. The website also contains information   on procedures for appointing a proxy for the  General Meeting, the right of shareholders to  put forward a motion at the General Meeting,  proxy forms, etc. The election of new members to the Board  and Nomination Committee will be arranged  so that the General Meeting can vote on each  candidate. The General Meeting is chaired by  the Chairman of the Board. Deviation from the Code of Practice: None. 7. Nomination Committee The General Meeting elects a Nomination  Committee consisting of three members,  each elected for a term of one year, see the  Company's Articles of Association. No   employees or board members are members  of the Nomination Committee. The duties of the Nomination Committee are  as follows:   Nominate candidates for shareholder-  elected board members and alternates.   Propose the remuneration of board   members to the General Meeting.   Comment on and, if necessary, make   proposals to the General Meeting regarding  the Boards size, composition and work  methods.   Prepare an annual report for the General  Meeting. Members of the Nomination Committee as   at 29 March: Arne Baumann (Chairman) Tor ivind Fjeld Jan Fredrik Thronsen Deviation from the Code of Practice: None. 8. Corporate Assembly and  Board of Directors – composi- tion and independence The parent company, AF Gruppen ASA, is a  holding company without employees and is  not subject to the provisions of the limited  liabilities Company Act regarding corporate  assemblies. The employees and the Groups largest oper- ating company, AF Gruppen Norge AS, have  entered into an agreement stating that AF     Gruppen Norge AS is not required to have a  Corporate Assembly.  In accordance with the group organisation  approved by the Industrial Democracy   Committee in 2007, AF Gruppen ASA and AF  Gruppen Norge AS have the same Board of  Directors. The AF Group's Board has a diverse composi- tion and wide range of competencies suited  to the Company's needs. Information regard- ing the board members age, education and  professional experience is published on the  Companys website. Apart from representa- tives of the employees, none of the board  members are employed or have performed  work for the AF Group. The Board's work is   in accordance with the AF Group's rules of  procedure for the Board and the applicable  policies and procedures. The Board held nine  meetings in 2011. AF Gruppen ASA has eight board members,  three of whom are elected by the employees.  Of the board members elected by the share- holders, there are three men and two wom- en. The Chairman of the Board is elected by  the Annual General Meeting. Board members  are elected for one year at a time. The Board's independence:   None of the shareholder-elected board  members are involved in the day-to-day  management of the Company.   Chairman Tore Thorstensen is CEO of KB  Gruppen Kongsvinger AS, which is the   Company's largest shareholder. KB Gruppen  Kongsvinger is also a major supplier to the  Group.    Board Member Carl Henrik Eriksen repre- sents one of the principal shareholders,  OBOS Forretningsbygg AS, which is a large  customer of the Company.   Board Member Peter Groth also represents  one of the principal shareholders, Aspelin  Ramm Gruppen AS, which is also a large  customer of the Group. Two of the five board members elected by  the shareholders are independent of the  Companys principal shareholders and business  associates. Three of five board members  elected by the shareholders represent   companies that are major customers and/or  suppliers of the AF Group.  60 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 The Board has assessed its independence and  believes that it is in accordance with the ap- plicable standards. Information about the  shareholdings of board members can be  found in note 23.  Deviation from the Code of Practice: None. 9. Work of the Board of   Directors Duties of the Board The Board has overall responsibility for the  management of the Group and implementa- tion of the Companys strategy. This means  that the Board is responsible for establishing  control systems and ensuring that the Group  is managed in accordance with the estab- lished core values, business ethics policies  and the owners' expectations for socially   responsible operations. The Board shall safe- guard shareholders' interests while also being  responsible for the Company's other interests. The Board's main duties are to help the Group  become competitive and ensure that it devel- ops and creates value. The Board shall be   involved in developing the Group's strategy,  performing necessary control functions and  ensuring that the Group is satisfactorily man- aged and organised. The Board sets goals for  the financial structure and adopts the Com- pany's plans and budgets. Major issues of a  strategic or financial nature are considered   by the Board. The CEO is hired and granted  authority by the Board. The Board determines  the CEO's salary and work instructions. Each year the Board evaluates its performance  and competence, and the need for the use of  board committees is assessed on an ongoing  basis. At least once a year the Board carries  out a review of the Company's main risk areas  and internal control within the Company. Rules of procedure for the Board and in- structions for the day-to-day management The Board has adopted rules of procedure  that stipulate rules for its work and procedures.  These rules are reviewed annually or as re- quired. The rules deal with the Board's duties,  the CEO's duties and obligations in relation to  the Board, the Board's procedures, minutes,  follow-up of board meetings, conflicts of   interest, confidentiality and formalities requir- ing new Board members to familiarise them- selves with and accept the rules of procedure  for the Board.

Risk management and   internal control Risk management Risk management is good management in  practice. Systematic risk management has  strengthened the AF Groups competitiveness  and increased profitability. Extensive work  has been carried out since 2006 to introduce  uniform systems for risk management and  create a culture whereby everyone has a   conscious awareness of risk. A special unit   has been established in the Group to help   the business units and projects identify and   systematise risk. Risk analyses are carried out  in all tendering processes, in projects in pro- gress and for the evaluation of uncertainty in  all project-based activities. An overview of  Shareholder information  61 the risk elements as early as the tendering  phase increases our ability to reduce overall  risk and price the tender properly. The risk  analysis in the tendering phase forms the   basis for further analysis, follow-up and con- trol of risk throughout the project's life cycle. All project risks are discussed in connection  with quarterly reports. Each business unit   undertakes an overall risk review of the entire  project portfolio in each business unit. A broad- ly composed group analyses the projects and  arrives at a prioritised list of uncertainties.   The group consists of representatives from  the Corporate Management Team, projects,  management of the business unit and a facili- tator from the AF Group's own risk unit. The  quarterly risk review concludes with a summary  by the Corporate Management Team. The risk  is quantified, summarised and registered for  each business unit throughout the year. The purpose of risk management is to manage  the risks associated with successful business  operations and enhance the quality of finan- cial reporting in order to avoid loss-making  projects and wrong decisions with serious  consequences. Numerous risk analyses have  been conducted, and we have implemented  measures to reduce negative risks and take  advantage of positive risks. proper risk man- agement has been important for achieving  our goal of value creation and growth. More  on risk management can be found under a  separate section on page 12. The Board is responsible for ensuring that the  Company has sound internal control and that  the systems for risk management are main- tained. The Board receives quarterly reports  on the Company's financial position and the  management's assessment of the situation  with regard to risk and its management.   Effective risk management and sound inter- nal control help protect the shareholders'   investments and the Company's assets. The Board reviews the Companys most   important risk areas and internal controls at  least once a year. The review also covers the  Companys core values, ethical guidelines and  any relevant risks that can influence achieve- ment of the Companys business goals.

Internal control Internal control is a process initiated and   conducted by a company's board, manage- ment and employees. It is designed to pro- vide reasonable assurance of goal achieve- ment in:  Targeted, cost-effective operations  Reliable external financial reporting   Compliance with laws, rules and regulations  Control signals from management The Company's financial internal control is  based on an organisational distinction be- tween execution, control and assurance.   The Company has extensive written job   descriptions at all levels of the organisation. project economists who assist project man- agement with the financial monitoring of  projects have been hired for all major projects.  The heads of the business units, together  with the financial managers, are responsible  for ongoing financial reporting to the Group.  A controller function has been established at  the group level and the main task of this  function is to control and verify reporting  from the business units. Deviations are   reported directly to the Corporate Manage- ment Team.

Directors fees Directors' fees, as recommended by the   Nomination Committee and adopted by the  General Meeting, are not performance-based  or linked to the share price performance of  AF Gruppen ASA. The Board must approve  any remuneration other than directors' fees,  Audit Committee fees and Compensation  Committee fees paid by the Company to  members of the Board. Note 6 to the   consolidated financial statements shows   the  remuneration of board members and  senior executives in the Group. Deviation from the Code of Practice: None.   12. Remuneration of senior  executives The Compensation Committee determines,   in cooperation with the Board, guidelines for  senior executive remuneration. Guidelines for  the remuneration of senior executives are  presented to the General Meeting. The CEOs salary is set annually at a board  meeting. The Board of Directors establishes  guidelines for the remuneration of senior   executives in consultation with the CEO.   Remuneration of senior executives and the  Board can be found in note 5 to the annual  accounts. The salaries of senior executives are market- based and made up of a fixed salary and a  bonus based on the EVA (Economic Value  Added) model. EVA is a method of calculating  and analysing value creation in the Group  and financial units below the group level.   Bonuses based on the EVA model are linked  to the profit performance of the Company or  the financial unit over time. Bonuses are paid  to eligible managers on a straight-line basis in  proportion to the financial units value creation  over, and above, an individually set threshold  in excess of the weighted average cost of   capital (WACC). Eligible managers may invest  some of their net bonus after tax in the Com- panys shares. The shares are sold at a 20 per  cent discount on the market price at the turn  of the year. The lock-in period for the shares is  one year. The AF Group has a share scheme for employ- ees whereby all employees are given an op- portunity to buy shares at a discount of 20  per cent on the current market price. The Company introduced an option programme  for all the employees in 2008. This option   programme is described in more detail under  Option programme for employees in   section 3. Deviation from the Code of Practice: The Board  of Directors and Compensation Committee  have decided that there should be no cap on  performance-based remuneration for employ- ees. The Group's fundamental idea is that   employees at all levels can participate in the  creation of value without limitations, in the  same way as the owners.  62 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 13. Information and   communication The AF Groups objective is for all investors  and other stakeholders to have access to the  same financial information on the Company  at any given time. The information provided  by the AF Group should ensure that the  shares are priced as correctly as possible.  Information that may affect the price of the  shares will be disclosed through stock ex- change announcements to the Oslo Stock   Exchange and via the Companys website.  The AF Group assigns high priority to contact  with the share market, and it desires an open  dialogue with the players. Reporting The AF Group holds public presentations for  its quarterly and annual results. These presen- tations are transmitted directly via the Internet  and are available on the Oslo Stock Exchanges  website and the AF Groups own website. In  addition, the Company maintains ongoing  contact with investors and analysts. Information about the Company is published  in Norwegian and English. The Company has  drawn up a readiness plan to provide the   media with relevant information in case of  unusual events or interest by the media. The Company follows the Oslo Stock Exchange's  recommendations for reporting IR information. Deviation from the Code of Practice: None.     14. Company takeover The Board has prepared written guidelines  for how it will act in the event of a possible  takeover bid by another company. The guide- lines entail that the Norwegian Code of practice  for Corporate Governance will be followed if  such a situation should arise. The Board has prepared written guidelines  for how the Board will act in the event of a  possible takeover bid for the Companys  shares. The Board will not seek to prevent  bids for the Companys business or shares  without a special reason for doing so. The  Board would not exercise its authority to issue  shares or take other measures to prevent the  execution of a bid, without the approval of  the General Meeting after the bid was   announced. If a bid is made for the Companys shares,   the Board of Directors will issue a statement  containing an assessment of the bid and a  recommendation to shareholders as to whether  they should accept or reject the bid. As part  of this process, the Board will obtain a   valuation from an independent expert. Deviation from the Code of Practice: None. 15. Auditor Ernst & Young AS is the auditor of the AF  Group. The auditor gives the Board an account of his  work and assesses the Companys financial     reporting and internal controls in connection  with the annual accounts. At this meeting,  the Board is informed about the services,   in addition to the auditing that has been   provided during the year. The auditor attends the AF Groups General  Meeting and confirms in writing to the Board  annually whether the stipulated independence  requirements for auditors have been met. The  Board has established guidelines for when  the management can use the auditor for   services other than auditing. The required   independence of the auditor indicates that  the Company should minimise its use of the  elected external auditor for services other  than the statutory financial audit. However,  the auditor is used nevertheless for assign- ments that are related to the audit, including  technical tax return assistance, annual ac- counts, interpretation of accounting and tax  rules and the verification of financial informa- tion in various contexts. See note 6 Other   operating expenses for further information  about the size of the auditor fees. The General Meeting adopts the auditor fees. To ensure the auditors independence and  competitive auditor fees, the Board has   decided that auditing should be put out to  tender on a regular basis. The Audit Committee  believes that it is natural to request such   tenders every 5-7 years.

The return including dividends was 21  per cent. Over the last five years, shareholders have earned  a return of 173 per cent, adjusted for dividends. The Oslo  Stock Exchanges benchmark index fell 13 per cent during  the same period. The AF Group was listed on 8 September 1997. The shares are listed  on the Oslo Stock Exchanges OB Match list and traded under the  ticker AFG. There is only one class of shares, and all the shares carry  voting rights. Share capital and shareholder composition At the beginning of 2011, the share capital was NOK 3,555,897,   divided into 71,117,940 shares, each with a nominal value of NOK  0.05. During the year the Company has carried out three new issues  of shares totalling 9,696,550 shares. Two of the new issues were   offered to the employees in connection with the share and option  programme and one new issue was carried out in connection with  the acquisition of SG Gruppen Kongsvinger AS. As a result of this,   the share capital increased by NOK 484,828. At the end of 2011, the  share capital was NOK 4,040,725, divided into 80,814,490 shares,  each with a nominal value of NOK 0.05. The AF Group had 1,254 (914) shareholders at the end of the year.  The shareholder structure is still characterised by stable, long-term  owners, and as at 31 December the 10 largest shareholders owned  73 (81) per cent of the Company's shares. At year end, employees   of AF owned approximately 17 (17) per cent of the shares in the   Company, and the Company owned 64,585 treasury shares, which   is equivalent to 0.08 per cent of the outstanding shares. At the end  of the year, 98.6 per cent of the shares were owned by Norwegian  shareholders.  64 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 The shareholder structure changed somewhat in 2011. The AF  Group's previously largest shareholder, KB Gruppen Kongsvinger   AS, spun off the Company in 2011. As a result of this, Constructio   AS, MF Invest AS and VITO Kongsvinger AS are now on the list of  the ten largest shareholders. In addition, the AF Group's acquisition of SG Gruppen Kongsvinger  AS was partially financed by the issuance of 4,019,800 new shares   offered to the sellers, which resulted in several new names on the  shareholder list. As at 31 December 2011 OBOS Forretningsbygg AS  is the AF Group's largest shareholder with 26.2 per cent of the  Company's shares. The buyback of shares will be considered on an ongoing basis in light  of the Companys alternative investment options, financial situation,  and need for treasury shares in connection with the sale of shares to  the employees, option programme, bonus programme and acquisitions.  The AF Group has been granted authority by the General Meeting to  buy up to 10 per cent of the shares outstanding in the Company.

This return will be a combination of dividends and share price   appreciation. The AF share price rose by 10 per cent in 2011, and the closing price  as at 31 December 2011 was NOK 44 (40). This amounts to a total  market capitalisation value of NOK 3,560 million for the Company.   In June a dividend of NOK 4.50 per share was paid, NOK 2.00 per  share of which was an ordinary dividend and NOK 2.50 per share of  which was an extraordinary dividend. The return, including dividends,  was 21 per cent for 2011. Over the last five-year period, AF shares  have earned shareholders a return of 173 per cent, including dividends.  During the same period an unweighted average of the share prices  for  competing contractors rose by 1 per cent. The liquidity of the share is characterised by the fact that several  large, long-term shareholders own a substantial portion of the   Companys shares. In 2011, a total of 2,094,569 (2,968,717) shares  were traded on the stock exchange. The share was traded on 242 of  253 possible trading days, and the average turnover for each trading  day was 8,279 shares. The AF Group has a market-making agreement  with the brokerage firm Fondsfinans ASA. The purpose of the agree- ment is to promote the liquidity of the Companys shares and   decrease the spread between the bid and asking prices when the  Companys shares are traded. Share programme for employees The AF Group would like all employees to participate in joint value  creation by becoming a shareholder in the Company. In addition,  the share programme should contribute to making the AF Group an  attractive workplace for its employees and attract new employees. AF has, therefore, a share programme for employees, whereby the  employees are given an opportunity to buy shares at a discount of  20 per cent on the current market price. In 2011, 326 employees subscribed for a total of 800,000 shares.   The purchase price after a 20 per cent discount was NOK 36.00. In  connection with the sale, the Board used its authority and issued  513,000 new shares. The remaining shares were transferred from the Company's treasury  shares. The Company has decided to continue the share programme for   employees in 2012. The maximum number of shares that may be  purchased in the share programme is 1,000,000, and the share   programme will be executed in 2012 according to plan. The Board  will therefore submit a proposal to the General Meeting for authori- sation to issue a sufficient number of shares, enabling the share   programme to be implemented. Option programme for employees The AF Group has an option programme for all the employees in the  Group. The purpose of the programme is to encourage long-term  commitment and greater involvement in the Companys activities.  The option programme for employees that ran from 2008 to 2010  was terminated in February 2011. A total of 5,163,750 options were  exercised by 787 employees, and the corresponding number of  shares was issued.  66 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 Shareholder information Market value  AF Group NOK million 31.12.07 31.12.08 31.12.09 31.21.10 31.12.11 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 Share price performance and trading volume in 2011 Jan. 11   Feb. 11   Mar. 11   Apr. 11   May 11   Jun. 11   Jul. 11   Aug. 11   Sep. 11   Oct. 11   Nov. 11   Dec. 11 AF-share price Total number of shares traded 35 40 45 50 55 Share price Shares traded 0 25,000 50,000 75,000 100,000 Earnings per share 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 2007 2008 2009 2010  2011 Dividend per share 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 Dividend per share Extraordinary dividend per share 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 * proposed dividend Total return 2007 2008 2009 2010  2011 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 AF Group Oslo Stock Exchange (OSEBX) % The AF Group has an option programme for all the employees in the  Group.

A total of 5,163,750 options were exercised  by 787 employees, and the corresponding number of shares was issued. At the General Meeting in May 2011 the AF Group adopted a new op- tion programme for employees in the Group. The maximum number  of options that can be granted is 6,000,000, and the programme   entails an annual allotment for the years 2011-13 and exercising the  options in 2014. The purchase price for the shares is based on the average  market price during the last week before the subscription period. The option premium is NOK 1.00 per option. Staff must be employed  by the AF Group, or one of its subsidiaries, as at 31 March 2014 in order  to exercise the options. In the autumn of 2011, the AF Group issued 2,092,763 new options  and 1,089 employees subscribed for options in the Group.  67 Dividend Over time the AF Group should provide a competitive return on the  Companys shares for its shareholders. provided that the underlying  development of the AF Group is satisfactory, the Company assumes  that dividends will be stable and, preferably, rise in the future. The  Board will evaluate the Company's liquidity and possible strategic  transactions when a dividend is proposed. The AF Group's intention  over time is to distribute a minimum of 50 per cent of the profit for  the year as a dividend. For the 2011 financial year, the Board proposes to pay a dividend of  NOK 4.50 (4.50) per share. NOK 2.30 of this amount represents an   extraordinary dividend. The dividend will be paid to shareholders  who are registered on 11 May 2012. Investor relations The AF Groups objective is for all investors and other stakeholders   to have access to the same financial information on the Company   at any given time. The information provided by the AF Group should ensure that the  valuation of the share is as correct as possible. Information that may  affect the price of the shares will be disclosed through stock exchange  announcements to the Oslo Stock Exchange and on the Companys  website. The AF Group assigns high priority to contact with the share  market, and it desires an open dialogue with the players. The AF Group holds public presentations for its quarterly and annual  results. The presentations are transmitted directly via the Internet  and are available on the Oslo Stock Exchanges website and AFs own  website. In addition, the Company maintains ongoing contact with  investors and analysts. The Companys website provides a list of the  analysts that follow the AF share.

AF Gruppen ASA, the  Groups parent company, is listed on the  Oslo Stock Exchange. The head office of the  AF Group is located in Oslo. The AF Group was established in 1985. Ever  since the company was established, AF has  relied on its knowledge, expertise and ability  to perform complex tasks. A strong entrepre- neurial spirit coupled with the capacity and  willingness to think differently and with fore- sight have characterised the Groups history.  We help our  customers succeed by delivering  projects and services in accordance with their  needs. Our conduct should be characterised  by  professionalism and high ethical standards. Vision AF's vision is: Clearing up the past, building  for the future. Mission AF's mission is to be an industrial group that  delivers value by forming the future through  contracting, energy and environmental   services. The Company has an uncompro- mising attitude towards safety and ethics. Description of the business Civil Engineering AF has the experience and expertise required  to carry out all types of civil engineering pro- jects ranging from small and simple to large  and demanding. AF carries out projects related  to transport, ports, oil/energy/offshore and  foundation work. Our clients are primarily  public sector agencies and large energy and  industrial companies. Building AF is one of the largest players in the area of  residential, commercial and public buildings.  AF's experience spans the entire value chain  from development and planning to building.  AF is also a leader in renovation. AF delivers  services to clients ranging from small com- panies with a single assignment to large   private and public clients with a longstand- ing relationship. AF cooperates closely with  clients to find efficient solutions that satisfy  future environmental and energy require- ments. The Building business area is  established in Norway and Sweden. Property AF develops residential and non-residential  buildings for its own account. Most of the  projects are located geographically where  AF has its own contracting services. AF coop- erates closely with other players in the in- dustry, and the development projects are   often organised as joint development com- panies. In this way we benefit from each   other's expertise, while reducing the project- specific risk. Environment AF is Scandinavia's leading contractor for the  demolition of buildings, industrial plants  and petroleum installations. AF offers solu- tions that meet the clients' environmental  challenges. AF has a state-of-the art recep- tion facility at Vats near Haugesund for the  environmental clean-up of petroleum instal- lations. The Environment business is estab- lished in Norway, Sweden, poland and the uK. Energy With extensive industrial knowledge and ad- vanced expertise in energy optimisation, AF  delivers energy-efficient technical solutions.  These solutions maintain comfort and work- ing conditions with reduced consumption of  energy in buildings, industry, marine appli- cations and offshore. In order for the market  to choose correct solutions it is not enough  that they are energy-efficient, they must also  benefit the clients bottom line and the   environment. Presentation of the annual   accounts Introduction The financial statements for the AF Group  have been prepared in accordance with the  International Financial Reporting Standards  (IFRS). The financial statements for the parent  company, AF Gruppen ASA, have been pre- sented in accordance with the simplified  IFRS provisions laid down in section 3.9, fifth  paragraph of the special regulations pursuant  to the Norwegian Accounting Act. The Board  of Directors is of the opinion that the consol- idated financial statements provide an accu- rate and fair picture of the Groups financial  results for 2011 and its financial position as  at 31 December 2011. We confirm pursuant  to section 3-3a of the Norwegian Accounting  Act that the financial statements for the parent  company and the consolidated operations  have been prepared on the basis of a going  concern assumption. The Board's Corporate  Governance Statement is an integral part of  the Board of Directors' report. This is described  on page 55 of the annual report. 2011 in brief The year 2011 was a favourable year for the  AF Group with strong performance in a  number of important areas. AF has gained  market shares in several sectors and contin- ues to operate with healthy margins. In the  area of HSE the lTI rate is among the lowest  in the industry. The Company has also carried  out the largest acquisition in the  history of  the AF Group. AF is showing strong profits for large portions  of its operations. In 2011 we have succeeded  with turnaround operations in several units  that have been through a difficult period. AF has carried out several acquisitions in  2011. The acquisition of the majority share- holding in Strm Gundersen in Drammen is  the largest transaction in the history of the  AF Group. This acquisition gives AF a strong  market position in the building market in  Buskerud and the renovation market in Oslo.  With the acquisition of Rogaland  Entreprenr  AS the AF Group has established building   operations in Stavanger and has strength- ened its presence in Rogaland. AF has also  acquired a portion of the operations of Bt- service Offshore/Verft in Mandal. These ac- quisitions represent valuable additions to the  AF Group in markets and business areas that  we believe have great potential in the future.  69 NOK million 2011 2010 2009 Revenues and other income 2,356 2,158 1,768 Earnings before financial  items and tax (EBIT) 131 194 82 Earnings before tax (EBT) 134 198 105 Operating profit margin  (EBIT %) 5.6 % 9.0 % 4.6 % pre-tax margin (EBT %) 5.7 % 9.2 % 5.9 % Order backlog 3,290 1,899 2,175 At the end of 2011 the order book stood at  NOK 9,126 million (6,193 million), an increase  of 59 per cent.

Business areas 2011 Civil Engineering The Civil Engineering business area compris- es AFs civil engineering activities in Norway  and Sweden. The Civil Engineering operations comprise  three business units:  AF Anlegg   AF Offshore & Civil Construction  Plplintar Results In 2011 Civil Engineering reported a turno- ver of NOK 2,356 million (2,158 million). The  profit before tax was NOK 134 million (198  million). The operating margin was 5.6 per  cent (9.0 per cent) in 2011. The decrease in  profit is due to weaker results in the port  portfolio. Overall the operating margin is  better than the long-term target for Civil   Engineering. The total order backlog for   Civil Engineering at the end of 2011 was  NOK 3,290 million (1,899 million). AF Anlegg saw a high level of activity and   reported good results in 2011. The favoura- ble results were created by sound project  management AF Offshore & Civil Construction has faced  challenges in the port portfolio, and the   results for 2011 are significantly lower than  in 2011 as a result of impairment losses.   Towards the end of the year AF Offshore &  Civil Construction started to show positive  results again. plplintar has had a stable and  good performance throughout the year, but  it experienced some decline in the level of  activity towards the end of 2011. Our com- petitiveness in the pile market has been  strengthened through the establishment   of a concrete pile factory in 2011. Acquisition of companies and   establishment of new operations  In February 2011 AF acquired a portion of  the operations of Btservice Offshore/Verft  AS. AF took over all the employees, property,  plant and equipment, and the operations  were transferred to the newly established AF  Offshore Mandal unit. The acquisition  strengthens the AF Group's focus on the off- shore maintenance and modification market. New contracts In March AF Anlegg signed a contract with  the public Roads Administration for the   development of Ringveg West in Bergen.

The value of the contract is  NOK 100 million, excluding VAT. Market outlook The order backlog is high, and the market  outlook is good. The Civil Engineering mar- ket is driven primarily by major public infra- structure projects. The investment level for  Civil Engineering is expected to remain at a  high level in the future and grow by 12 per  cent in 2012 and 5 per cent in 2013. Growth  in the market is expected primarily to come  from roads and power installations. Civil En- gineering has strengthened the organisation  in 2011 and is well positioned for profitable  growth in 2012.     Building The Building business area is divided into  seven business units:  AF Bygg Oslo  AF Byggfornyelse  AF Bygg stfold  AF Bygg Sr  AF Bygg Gteborg, Sweden  AF Rogaland Entreprenr  Strm Gundersen Acquisition of companies and   establishment of new operations AF Bygg Sr was established with an office  in Kristiansand in March 2011. AF has already  carried out several projects in Southern   Norway. AF has shown through the Kilden  Theatre and Concert Hall that the company  has the resources and expertise required for  the successful completion of major building  projects in the region. AF Bygg Sr is well  underway and has been awarded its first  contract by the public Roads Administration  and Statnett.   On 3 November 2011 AF acquired the majority  shareholding in the Strm Gundersen  Group. The Strm Gundersen Group comple- ments AF geographically with its building  activities in Buskerud and offers specialist  expertise in the renovation of buildings and  the civil engineering market. The acquisition  of the majority shareholding in the Strm  Gundersen Group is the largest addition this  year. This is a company that has performed  well over time.    71 Revenue NOK Million 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 Earnings before tax NOK million 2007 2008 2009 2010  2011 100 200 300 400 500 Order book NOK million 2007 2008 2009 2010  2011 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 The Strm Gundersen group includes the  subsidiaries Strm Gundersen AS, Haga &  Berg Entreprenr AS, Thorendahl AS and  Consolvo AS. In addition, there are several  smaller companies.   Strm Gundersen is Buskerud's leading  contractor for building and heavy concrete  structures.   Haga & Berg Entreprenr operate in the   areas of renovation, remodelling, service  and maintenance of commercial buildings  in the Oslo region.     Thorendal is one of Oslo's largest companies  in the area of facade renovation of residential  and commercial buildings.     Consolvo carries out concrete renovation  by means of mechanical repair and cathodic  protection. On 15 November 2011 AF acquired the   majority shareholding in Rogaland Entreprenr  AS. AF established building activities in   Stavanger and strengthened its presence in  Rogaland through this acquisition. Rogaland  Entreprenr is well established in the region  and has specialised in turnkey contracts for  commercial and residential buildings. The  company will continue under the name AF  Rogaland Entreprenr AS. In 2011 the Strm Gundersen Group and   Rogaland Entreprenr had a combined turn- over of approximately NOK 1,500 million.  These acquisitions are expected to result   in strong growth in turnover in Building in  2012. Results Building reported revenues of NOK 3,757  million (2,267 million) in 2011, an increase   of 66 per cent compared with 2010. This  growth is a result of strong organic growth  combined with the acquisition of Strm  Gundersen and AF Rogaland Entreprenr.  profit before tax was NOK 144 million (51  million). The Building order book stood at  NOK 4,965 million (3,067) at the end of the  year. The operating margin increased to 3.9 per  cent (2.0 per cent) in 2011. The improvement  in the operating margin was a result of the  fact that the Swedish operations delivered  positive results, in addition to the very good  operating margins in the Strm Gundersen  Group. Overall the operating margin is  somewhat lower than the long-term target  for Building. The Norwegian Building business area has  been marked by strong growth in 2011 with  many projects in the start-up phase. All the  units are delivering positive results even  though the margins vary. The restructuring  of the operations in Sweden started to show  positive results in 2011. The efforts to improve  profitability will continue in 2012.

The order backlog is high and the  acquisition of Rogaland Entreprenr and  Strm Gundersen will contribute to a higher  turnover in 2012. Normalisation of the eco- nomic situation has resulted in a higher  number of housing and commercial project  starts. Statistics Norway expects GDp growth  of 2.5 per cent in 2012 and 2.7 per cent for  mainland Norway. Economic growth has fuelled increased  housing project starts. Following a 5 per  cent decline in the value of commenced  non-residential buildings, growth of 8 per  cent is expected in 2012. AFs building   activities are closely related to the demand  for new housing, non-residential buildings  and industrial projects.     73 Net interest bearing receivables (debt) NOK million 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 -400 -200 0 200 400 600 Cash fow from operating activities NOK million 2007 2008 2009 2010  2011 200 400 600 800 1,000 Return on capital employed NOK million 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 10 20 30 40 NOK million 2011 2010 2009 Revenues and other   income 69 134 51 Earnings before financial  items and tax (EBIT) 37 42 -10 Earnings before tax (EBT) 31 35 -15 Return on average  capital  employed 13.1 % 14.6 % -3.6 % Number of   housing units 1) under construction 152 49 - Sold during the year 84 91 35 Completed unsold   units in inventory 17 45 75 Completed unsold   units leased out 8 24 43 Land and   development rights 1) Housing units 639 436 644 Industrial area m2 22,000 22,000 22,000 The market for maintenance and building  renovation is expected to remain at a stable  high level in the future. The age of many  public buildings and the ambitious public  energy goals for buildings represent a sub- stantial renovation potential. The Swedish  economy is expected to grow by 0.5 per  cent in 2012 and 2.4 per cent in 2013. The  development of the market in Sweden is  considered uncertain. Property   1) AF's share of housing, sites and develop- ment rights. AF Eiendom acquires sites that are devel- oped for commercial or residential projects.  The projects are geographically located  where AF has its own contracting services.  The majority of the property development  projects are located in Oslo and in central  Eastern Norway. AF Eiendom cooperates  closely with other players in the industry,  and the building projects are often organ- ised as joint development companies. Results property delivered a profit before tax of NOK  31 million (35 million) in 2011. The turnover  of NOK 69 million (134 million) is lower than  in 2010. The reduction in turnover is attrib- uted to the fact that AF carried out a greater  share of its projects through associated  companies. Return on average capital   employed was 13.4 per cent (14.6 per cent).  The rate of return is somewhat lower than  the long-term goal for property. property sold 84 (91) residential units in  2011. At the end of the year the number   of residential units being built was 152 (49),  three times the number compared with  2010. Development of six new housing   projects/building phases started in 2011. At the end of the year the number of com- pleted unsold apartments was 17 (45). Of  the 17 completed unsold residential units,   8 (24) were temporarily let as at 31 December  2011. The number of unsold apartments has  been significantly reduced in 2010 and 2011. property has sites and development rights  under development that represent a total of  639 (436) residential units and 22,200 m2  (22,200 m2) of commercial premises. Building  delivered two projects in 2011, Grefsen- kollveien 16 and Rolvsrud park Q. All the apartments were sold on delivery.  After 11 years the property project Rolvsrud  park in lrenskog outside Oslo has been  completed. The project started in 2000 and  the last apartment was sold at the end of  2011. The project will be completed when  the last construction phase is delivered in  2012. The project encompasses 550 apart- ments, serviced accommodation, nursing  home, day care centre and infrastructure. Site acquisitions In November AF Eiendom signed an agree- ment to buy shares in Bjrnsons Hage AS.  The company owns a total of 6 residential  properties in the centre of lillestrm. In the  transaction the properties were valued at  NOK 54 million and the development plans  provide for up to 7,000 m2 of housing. In No- vember AF Eiendom also acquired a   one-third interest in Rolfsbukta utvikling KS,  which has purchased the old headquarters  of Fjellanger Widere at Fornebu. The prop- erty was purchased for NOK 84 million and  the development plans provide for up to  5,500 m2 of housing.  74 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 Board of Directors' report NOK million 2011 2010 2009 Revenues and other income 777 767 743 Earnings before financial  items and tax (EBIT) 79 107 46 Earnings before tax (EBT) 80 90 43 Operating profit margin  (EBIT %) 10.2 % 14.0 % 6.2 % pre-tax margin (EBT %) 10.4 % 11.7 % 5.8 % Order backlog 1,081 892 1,070 Market outlook It is expected that the good housing sales  will continue in 2012. The last forecast for  permits for housing starts in Norway shows  an increase of 30 per cent in 2011 and 11 per  cent in 2012. There is good growth in the  economy and interest rates are expected to  remain at a low level. AF Eiendom is well   positioned for growth in the residential   segment. Environment The Environment business area is established  in Norway, Sweden, poland and the uK.  land-based demolition is carried out in   Norway, Sweden and poland, while offshore  demolition and recycling are aimed at the  North Sea market. At the Environmental  Base at Vats AF Decom Offshore has the  most modern reception facility for the   environmental clean-up and recycling of   petroleum installations. The business area consists of two business  units:  AF Decom Offshore  AF Decom In addition, Environment also has activities  in Norway in the subsidiaries AF Decom Off- shore uK, AF Decom Sweden, AF Decom   poland, palmer Gotheim Skiferbrudd, and  the associated companies Miljbase Vats  and Vici Ventus Technology. Results Revenues for 2011 amounted to NOK 777  million (767 million) and earnings before tax  amounted to NOK 81 million (90 million).  The operating margin for 2011 was 10.2 per  cent (14.0 per cent). The decrease in profit  before tax is attributed to the fact that the  sale of 60 per cent of Miljbase Vats AS   resulted in a profit of NOK 42 million in 2010.  Good operations for both onshore and off- shore demolition and environmental clean- up is the reason for the good results in 2011.  Overall the operating margin is better than  the long-term goal for Environment. At the  end of the year the order book stood at   NOK 1,081 million (892 million). The onshore demolition activities in Norway  reported high turnover and a very good  profit for 2011. Systematic work through   focusing on project management and  strengthening the capacity of central man- agement are now showing results. In Sweden  the level of activity for land-based activities  increased considerably over 2010, and these  operations are also showing good results.  preparations for the demolition and disman- tling of the wreck of the Russian cruiser, the  Murmansk, has continued throughout  2011. The work to seal the damage that oc- curred during the storm in November 2010  appears to be taking longer than originally  anticipated. The removal of the "Murmansk"  is expected in the autumn of 2012. AF Decom Offshore saw considerable activi- ty in the Norwegian sector in 2011. In 2011  the Environmental Base at Vats received  23,900 tonnes (26,200 tonnes) of decommis- sioned offshore installations from the North  Sea for demolition and recycling. The work  to ensure an environmentally sound end to  the installations' life cycle is well under way.  Work to streamline the operations of the   Environmental Base at Vats has contributed  greatly to the good results in 2011. Continu- ous improvement in the demolition and re- cycling processes will ensure that the facility  has an important competitive edge for AF  Decom Offshore in the coming years. AF has an environmental management system  that ensures that all environmental aspects  related to the activities at the Environmental  Base at Vats are identified and controlled for  the purpose of not impacting the local envi- ronment in a negative manner. AF renewed  its discharge permits for the Environmental  Base at Vats in 2011. It is the Climate and   pollution Agency (Klif) that is responsible for  exercising authority and the follow-up of  businesses that recycle decommissioned   petroleum installations in Norway. On as- signment from AF the Norwegian Institute  for Water Research (NIVA) is conducting a  monitoring programme to control the   discharges. The measurements that were  carried out in 2011 showed that the discharge  level is significantly below the requirements  from the authorities. New contracts In September AF Decom Offshore signed a  contract with Statoil on behalf of Gassco for  the "H7 platform Removal project". The con- tract encompasses the planning, removal  and recycling of the entire installation. The  value of this contract is NOK 420 million,   excluding optional work. The contract also  includes an option for the removal of B11,   a similar platform. The contract is subject to  approval by the holding company Gassled  for the final execution of the removal project. In September 2011 AF Decom Offshore  signed a contract with DeepOcean to bring  ashore and recycle a loading buoy at Statfjord  C for Statoil. The contract encompasses plan- ning, offshore preparation work and recycling  on land. The Environmental Base at Vats will  be used as the reception facility for this  work. This contract is valued at NOK 49 million.  The work began in September 2011 and will  be completed in the autumn of 2012. Market outlook AFs land-based activities are closely related  to the demand for new housing, non-residential  buildings and industrial projects, and the  level of activity in the market is still expected  to be high going forward.

Energy The Energy business area comprises the AF  Groups services related to energy for land- based activities, offshore installations and  the maritime industry. The business area  consists of three business units:  AF Energi & Miljteknikk AS  Mollier AS  Aeron AS Results Energy had a lower level of activity in 2011  with a turnover of NOK 462 million (564 mil- lion). This reduction is primarily due to the  reduced turnover in AF Energi & Miljteknikk  and Aeron. profit before tax was NOK 1 million  (-21 million). Operating margin for 2011 was  1.1 per cent (-2.6 per cent). Overall the    operating margin is lower than the long- term goal for Energy. At the end of the year  the order book stood at NOK 434 million  (299 million). In 2010 AF Energi & Miljteknikk wound up  all of its activities related to purely technical  contracting and will concentrate in the future  on its core activities of energy conservation  and energy-related services. This has resulted  in improved earnings in 2011, but a signifi- cantly lower level of activity. A stronger   strategic focus is expected to give better   results for the operations in the future. Aeron is performing well, but the unit had   a declining turnover and profits in 2011.   Aeron supplies HVAC (Heating, Ventilation,  Air-conditioning and Cooling) systems to  the shipping industry and is exposed to the  weak international newbuilding market for  ships. In 2011 the company won several   contracts in Asia, and exports comprise an  increasing share of the turnover. Mollier has had an increased level of activity  and good profitability in 2011. The good re- sults are a result of consistently good quality  in all deliveries. Mollier has entered into   several new contracts in both Norway and  abroad in 2011. New contracts In February 2011 AF Energi & Miljteknikk   entered into an energy conservation con- tract with Avinor. AF Energi & Miljteknikk  will ensure profitable energy consumption  at Avinors airports. The goal is to reduce   energy consumption by 20 per cent at   Avinor's airports. Initially the agreement   covers nine of Avinors twelve airports.   Energy production will also be assessed at  the international and regional airports. In December 2011 Mollier signed a joint   venture agreement with the SMOE shipyard  in Singapore for the delivery of HVAC systems  to the accommodation platform 2/4 l on  Ekofisk. The contract with SMOE encompass- es the complete delivery and installation of  refrigeration and freezing plants, and refrig- eration and freezer rooms for provisions.   Engineering has commenced and the physi- cal deliveries will take place in 2012 and  2013. The contract and options are valued   at NOK 30 million. Market outlook In the Energy business area, mandatory   energy labelling of houses was introduced  from 1 July 2010. In addition, the public   sector has increased its focus on the lifetime  costs of buildings and the energy efficiency  of existing buildings. For 2012, an improved  market is expected as a result of higher   energy prices and a gradual increase in   76 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 Board of Directors' report  investments in energy conservation. In the  long term, the market is expected to offer  great growth potential. Information on the   environment Personnel and organisation At the end of 2011, there were 2,396 (1,933)  employees in the Group, 1,125 (971) of  which were salaried and 1,171 (961) were  paid by the hour. The recruitment and supply  of new employees was satisfactory in 2011.  The parent company, AF Gruppen ASA,   had no employees at the end of 2011. Of the Companys employees, 8.6 per cent  (8.5 per cent) are women and 91.4 per cent  (91.5 per cent) are men. Given the nature of  the work and working conditions, the con- tractor industry has traditionally been domi- nated by men. For the recruitment of newly  qualified engineers and economists, there is  a more even balance between women and  men than the distribution in the Group as a  whole. The percentage of women among  salaried staff was 16.2 per cent (15.4 per  cent) at the end of 2011.   In the autumn of 2011 AF conducted an em- ployee satisfaction survey (ESS) to measure  the satisfaction of its employees. Around 80  per cent of the employees answered the   survey. On a scale from 1 to 6 (where 6 is the  best) our employees gave an average score  of 5 when describing their satisfaction with  the company. This is significantly higher  than the industry average, and an improve- ment from a similar survey in 2009. ESS is   an important tool for the Group to identify   areas and measures for improving the work- ing environment. AF focuses a great deal on developing its own  managers. In 2011 over 1,100 employees  participated in courses at the AF Academy.  In addition, employees can apply to  participate  in courses and further education at renowned  educational institutions such as INSEAD, the  Norwegian School of Economics (NHH) and  the Norwegian Business School (BI). In 2011 the Group Council, which is made up  of employee representatives, senior safety  representatives and management represent- atives, continued work on improving coop- eration between all parts of the organisation. The AF Group seeks to be a workplace where  there is no discrimination on grounds of   ethnicity, gender, belief or sexual orientation.  This applies, for example, to matters relating  to pay, promotion, recruitment and general  career development. The AF Group has writ- ten objectives and rules to promote a good  working environment with equality and  without discrimination or harassment. The  goals and rules are laid down in the Compa- ny's Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct  is the AF Group's rule book. All employees in  the AF Group must sign off that they have  received the Code of Conduct and that they  undertake to comply with it. In line with the  Discrimination Act, the object of the Code of  Conduct is to promote equality, ensure  equal opportunities and rights, and prevent  discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity,  nationality, heritage, skin colour, language,  religion or beliefs. In 2010 the AF Group moved into new quar- ters. All common facilities in the new main  office are designed so that they can be used  by all the employees, including those with  disabilities. Individual adaptation of the  workplace is otherwise done to the extent  possible based on the nature of the work. Health, safety and the environment The lTI rate for all operations in 2011 was 1.5  (1.7). Our lTI rate is among the lowest in the  industry. In 2011 there was a total of 10 (8)  lost time injuries, 9 (5) of which were with  subcontractors. lost time injuries included  seven fractures or broken bones, one ampu- tation of a finger, two torn tendons/ligaments.  AF's operations in Sweden and poland had  no lost time injuries. The AF Group assumes that all activities  should be planned and carried out based on  a fundamental understanding and accept- ance that all personal injuries and damage  to equipment and the external environment  can be avoided. The company employs analysis tools in its  preventive work to identify risk associated  with future activities and define and initiate  risk-reducing measures.  The reporting,  investigation and analysis of  hazardous  conditions, near misses and acci- dents are  regarded as tools for improve- ment. The investigation and analysis focus  on identifying the underlying causes so that  the organisation and management can be  improved. The Corporate Management Team  is involved in the investigation of all acci- dents that result in a lost time injury, while  the management of the business unit con- cerned is involved in all investigations of in- cidents that have the potential to cause seri- ous injury. The safety of each project is  measured primarily through the registration  of injuries. The registration of injuries pro- vides the basis for calculating the lTI (loss  time injury) rate. The lTI rate is defined as  the number of lost time injuries per million  man-hours, and it includes our own employ- ees and subcontractors. The overall goal is to  avoid all lost time injuries (lTI rate = 0). Sickness absence for the entire Group was  3.6 per cent (3.7 per cent). Sickness absence  in the Norwegian operations was 3.4 per  cent (3.7 per cent) in 2011. AF's operations in  Sweden had a sickness absence rate of 4.6  per cent (3.3 per cent), and in poland the  sickness absence rate was 0.9 per cent (3.0  per cent). For sickness absence, the Companys  target is to avoid work-related illnesses. The  goal is a sickness absence rate under 3.0 per  cent. This goal represents a normal sickness  rate, without work-related illnesses. AF has  great ambitions to eliminate work-related   illnesses. To achieve this, AF is surveying  which work-related illnesses affect the sick- ness absence rate. The survey shows that  measures to combat musculoskeletal disor- ders will help to reduce sickness absence  further. As part of the company's HSE   improvement efforts, sickness absence   committees have been established in all   the business units. AF has a well-functioning  internal corporate health service, and the  Groups working environment can be   described as good.  77 The Group uses control systems that satisfy  the requirements in the Norwegian Working  Environment Act, the Regulations relating to  Systematic Health, Safety and Environment  Work in Enterprises (Internal Control Regula- tions) and the Regulations relating to Safety,  Health and Working Environment on Con- struction Sites (Construction Client Regulations). External environment The Group is engaged in operations that  may affect the external environment in the  form of noise, dust, vibrations, emissions,  discharges and other means of pollution.   Its activities may also entail encroachments  on and changes to the landscape and nature.  The Group carries out its activities in such a  way that the impact on resources and the  environment is reduced to a level well within  what is required by the authorities and clients. The Group's management systems and work  methods are designed to safeguard the en- vironment. The goal is to prevent, avert and  reduce any undesirable impact on the envi- ronment. Each AF business unit must follow  the principles of ISO 14001, the international  standard for environmental management.  This will be done by identifying and moni- toring the main environmental impacts   represented by the various business units.   In 2011, 17 (18) incidents with an undesira- ble impact on the external environment  were reported. Most of the events concerned  minor oil and diesel spills from machinery, as  well as flying gravel when blasting and the  discharge of fallow water to the sea. AF sys- tematically investigates all undesired incidents  and is facilitating methods and control rou- tines to prevent any recurrence and damage  to the external environment. To enhance environmental awareness and  measure the impact of our operations on   the external environment, two new meas- urement parameters were introduced in  2010. Carbon footprint and source separa- tion rate. Measuring our carbon footprint  will map and measure the emission of  greenhouse gases in tonnes of CO2 equiva- lents. The purpose of the measurements is to  motivate environmentally friendly resource  consumption. The Group's carbon footprint  for 2011 was measured at 34,344 tonnes  (22,730 tonnes) of CO2 equivalents. This is  equivalent to 4.7 tonnes (3.9 tonnes) per  NOK million of revenue. Measuring the  source separation rate was introduced to   improve the handling of waste from our   operations. The source separation rate indi- cates how much of the waste is sorted and  can be recycled. The source separation rate  was 78 per cent (80 per cent) for building,   75 per cent (78 per cent) for renovation and  97 per cent (95 per cent) for demolition in  2011. The authorities' required source sepa- ration rate for building and civil engineering  is 60 per cent. In 2011, 246,223 tonnes of  waste were sorted, and 463,586 tonnes of  asphalt and concrete were recycled. Measuring and monitoring our carbon foot- print and source separation rate targets will  help illustrate AF's environmental profile.  The AF Group's business involvement in the  demolition, recycling and development of  environmentally friendly energy solutions  also has a positive impact on the external  environment. Risk management and   financial risk The AF Group is exposed to various types   of risks of a market-related, operational and  financial nature. A substantial portion of the  Groups balance sheet consists of assets and  liabilities associated with ongoing projects.  Some of the items are subject to estimate  uncertainty, and for these items the Corporate  Management Team and project managers  have exercised judgement and made assump- tions based on uniform principles and guide- lines. These assumptions are considered   realistic. Situations or changes in market conditions  may arise during a project period in many  cases, and they may entail changes to the  estimates and thus affect the companys   assets, liabilities, equity, and earnings. The  Group has systems and meticulous routines  for risk analysis and the management of risk.  Risk analysis is carried out continuously from  tender assessment until the completed   project. The risk management systems are  embedded throughout the organisation,  from the projects, via the management   of the business units, to the Corporate   Management Team and the Board of Direc- tors of AF Gruppen ASA. The purpose of risk  management is to limit undesirable financial  and production-related consequences  through corrective action. At the same time,  there is a focus on exploiting positive oppor- tunities identified through the risk analysis  of the projects. Through its activities, the AF Group is exposed  to various types of financial risk. Financial  risk is divided into market risk, credit risk and   liquidity risk. The AF Group's reporting   currency is NOK. The Group has 91 per cent   (90 per cent) of its revenues and expenses in  NOK, 9 per cent (9 per cent) in SEK and 0 per  cent (1 per cent) in other currencies. The  Group's currency risk is therefore limited and  primarily related to changes in the exchange  rate between NOK and SEK. In connection  with contracts and the operations in the uK,  the AF Group is also exposed to fluctuations  in the GBp, EuR and uSD exchange rates.   The Group hedges against foreign exchange   exposure by using forward contracts for   currency. Forward contracts for scrap steel  are used to limit the price risk for scrap steel  from demolition activities in the North Sea.  The Group continuously seeks to limit price  risk. This is accomplished by standard claus- es for price and pay adjustments in the   contracts and hedging purchase prices in  the local currency by entering into frame- work agreements for the procurement of  goods and services. The Group has established guidelines to  safeguard against credit risk in cash and  cash equivalents, loans and receivables.   Historically, the Group has had negligible  credit losses. Based on the Group's strong financial position  at 31 December 2010 the liquidity risk is low.  The AF Group has a three-year, NOK 900 mil-  78 AF GROup ANNuAl REpORT 2011 The Board of Directors Oslo, 29, March 2012 Eli Arnstad Carl Henrik Eriksen Chairman Tore Thorstensen Mari Broman Board of Directors' report lion (900 million) credit facility and loan limit  with Handelsbanken, which expires in June  2012. As at 31 December this facility was   unutilised. A new credit limit is under nego- tiation, and it is expected that a new agree- ment will be entered into by the end of May  2012. In addition, AF had net interest-bearing  receivables of NOK 450 million (580 million)  at the turn of the year. The Group's liquidity  is monitored through the follow-up of the  cash flows in the projects. Discrepancies   between the expected and actual cash flows  are reviewed monthly in conjunction with a  risk review of the projects. In addition, daily  liquidity is monitored through the Groups  central treasury function. Option programmes and sale  of shares to employees In 2011 AF Gruppen ASA purchased treasury  shares for potential use as consideration for  the acquisition of companies and sales to  employees. AF Gruppen ASA purchased  64,285 (692,055) shares during the year.   In 2011, 449,700 (492,100) shares were   sold to employees. At the end of the year,   AF Gruppen ASA held 64,585 (450,000)   treasury shares. The option programme for employees,  which was adopted in 2008 was terminated  in February 2011. In this connection  5,163,750 new shares were issued to   employees in a private offering. An option  programme for all employees of AF Gruppen  ASA and subsidiaries was adopted at the   Annual General Meeting held on 13 May  2011, and it entails entitlement to subscrib- ing for a total of 6,000,000 options during  the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, with redemp- tion in 2014. In 2011 a total of 2,092,763 op- tions were allotted in the new programme.  The AF Group would like all employees to  participate in joint value creation by becom- ing a shareholder in the Company. In   addition, the share programme should   contribute to making the AF Group an   attractive workplace for its employees and  attract new employees. AF has, therefore, a  share programme for employees, whereby  the employees are given an opportunity to  buy shares at a discount of 20 per cent on  the current market price. In 2011, 326   employees subscribed for a total of 800,000  shares. The purchase price after a 20 per  cent discount was NOK 36.00. In connection  with the sale of the shares, the Board exercised  its authority and issued 513,000 shares. Market outlook The results of AF Gruppen ASA and the AF  Group for 2011 were in accordance with the  Boards expectations. The positive trend is  expected to continue in 2012. At the end of  the year, the Group had a solid order back- log of NOK 9,826 million (6,193 million) and  the earnings on new and ongoing projects  are considered good. The AF Group operates  in an industry where there is normally un- certainty related to the assessment of future  conditions. Civil Engineering market is good. The Civil  Engineering market is driven primarily by  major public infrastructure projects. The   investment level for Civil Engineering is   expected to grow by 12 per cent in 2012    79 Peter Groth Arne Sveen Tor Olsen Henrik Nilsson and 5 per cent in 2013. AF Anlegg is well   positioned for future growth. The market for the property and Building  business areas is good in Norway, but some- what weaker in Sweden. Statistics Norway  expects GDp growth of 2.5 per cent in 2012  for mainland Norway and that the interest  rate level will remain low. The last forecast  for housing start permits in Norway shows  an increase of 11 per cent in 2012. This will  have a positive impact on the property and  Building business areas. The market for  maintenance and renovation was lifted by  the Governments stimulus package, and   the market is expected to remain stable at   a high level going forward. In Sweden the  market is somewhat uncertain. Moderate  growth in the Swedish economy is expected  for 2012. The market for land-based demolition   services is good. Environment's land-based  demolition operations take place prior to  new building and civil engineering projects  and are closely associated with the demand  for new homes, non-residential buildings  and industrial projects. The market for AFs  offshore-related environmental services is  considered to be large. The level of activity  for new demolition projects is increasing.  Several FEED (Front End Engineering Design)  studies have been initiated, and there is an  increasing supply of projects.   In the Energy business area, mandatory   energy labelling of houses was introduced  from 1 July 2010. In addition, the public   sector has increased its focus on the lifetime  costs of buildings and the energy efficiency  of existing buildings. An improved market is  expected in 2012 as a result of higher energy  prices and a gradual increase in investments  in energy conservation. The market in the  maritime sector is marked by a weak interna- tional newbuilding market for ships. The   demand for AF's offshore energy services  follows the increase in oil prices and the   increased level of petroleum activities on   the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The high order backlog, combined with a  good market and the acquisitions of the  Strm Gundersen Group and Rogaland   Entreprenr form the foundation for strong  turnover growth in 2012. By guiding the   organisation towards challenging tasks and  goals, the AF Group will continue to create  value growth for its owners, employees,   customers, suppliers and society at large.  The AF Group has a high level of expertise  and a solid corporate culture based on pro- fessionalism and high ethical standards. This,  combined with the Company's strong finan- cial position, entails that AF is well-equipped  to take advantage of the opportunities that  the market will provide in 2012. The Board would like to thank the employees  for their significant contribution to the good  results in 2011. The Board believes that 2012  will also bring higher revenues and good  earnings.

In addition,  the application of the Companys accounting poli- cies requires that the management exercise judge- ment. Areas with a high degree of discretionary   assessments or a high level of complexity, or areas  where assumptions and estimates are essential to  the accounts, are described in note 2. the consolidated accounts have been prepared on  the basis of uniform accounting principles for equiv- alent transactions and events under otherwise  equivalent circumstances. 1.1.2 recently published accounting standards and  interpretations (a) new and amended standards implemented by  the Group In 2011 the Group implemented the following new  standards and amendments, and the introduction of  the standards or the interpretation of the standards  has been assessed to have the described impact on  the consolidated accounts or the presentation of the  consolidated financial statements of the AF Group. the following new standards and amended account- ing standards were implemented for the first time in  2011:  IAS 24 (revised) related party Disclosures. the  IASB has prepared a definition of related parties. the amendment has not had any impact on the AF  Groups financial standing or results.    IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments – Disclosures. It is no longer a requirement to specify the maxi- mum credit exposure in the notes for instruments  where the amount recognised on the balance sheet  represents the maximum credit exposure. thus it is  only the exposures where the recognised amount  does not represent the maximum credit exposure  that are required to be specified in the notes. the requirement to disclose the carrying amount for  financial assets for which the terms have been rene- gotiated, which would have otherwise been past  due or in default, or would have been subject to an  impairment loss, if such renegotiation had not taken  place has been eliminated now. A clarification has been issued with respect to disclo- sures on collateral held as security by the company  and similar risk-reducing schemes. It is the financial  effect of the collateral held and other risk-reducing  schemes in relation to the maximum credit exposure  that is to be disclosed (a shortfall in one scheme   cannot be offset against a surplus in another scheme  and presented on a net basis). the requirement to disclose collateral held as security  that the company has taken possession of has  changed so that disclosures shall only be provided  now for collateral held as security that the company  has taken possession and still owns at the date of  the balance sheet. the requirement to disclose collateral held as security  by the company and other credit enhancements for  financial instruments that are past due, but not writ- ten down, and for instruments that are written down  on an individual basis has been eliminated. the  same applies to the requirement to provide an   estimate of the fair value of the security provided   by these instruments. these amendments have an effect on the scope of  the note information, but do not otherwise have any  impact on the AF Groups financial standing or results.  IAS 1 – presentation of Financial Statements. A clarification has been issued that an analysis of  other income and costs (oCI) shall be presented for  each component of the equity, either in the state- ment of comprehensive income or in notes to the   financial statements. (b) Standards and amendments to and interpreta- tions of existing standards that have been adopted,  but do not have an impact on the consolidated   financial statements of the AF Group:  IAS 27 – Consolidated and Separate Financial  Statements. A clarification has been issued that the amendments  in IAS 21, IAS 28, and IAS 31 as a result of the amend- ments in IAS 27 shall be applied prospectively for   accounting periods that start on or after 1 July 2009,  or earlier if IAS 27 is adopted earlier.  IFRS 3 – Business Combinations. A clarification has been issued that the changes in  IFrS 7, IAS 32 and IAS 39 that eliminate the excep- tion for contingent consideration do not apply to  contingent consideration in connection with business  combinations when the acquisition date is earlier  than the implementation of the revised version of  IFrS 3 (2008). In addition, a limitation of the scope of measurement  alternatives for components of non-controlling own- ership interests has been introduced. the alternative  options apply only to the components of the non- controlling ownership interests that refer to the   existing ownership interests. other components   of the non-controlling ownership interest shall be  measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Amendments have also been made to IFrS3 in order  to clarify the rules for the accounting of share-based  payment schemes in the acquired company that  ceases to exist as a result of the acquisition, which  the acquiring company voluntarily replaces with a  new scheme. Such schemes shall be accounted for  in their entirety as pay compensation for the period  after the acquisition. (c) Standards and amendments to and interpreta- tions of existing standards that have not entered  into force and for which the Group has not chosen  early implementation. the Group has not chosen early implementation of  any new or amended IFrSs or IFrIC interpretations. d) the IASB has adopted revisions to a number of  standards through the annual improvement project. Adopted IFrS standards and IFrIC interpretations  that will enter into force at a future date  Revision of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments   - Disclosures the amendment concerns note requirements in  connection with the transfer of financial assets that  the company is still involved in, which aims to give  the users a better picture of the exposure of the   entity transferring the financial assets. these amend- ments enter into force for the financial year starting  on or after 1 January 2012. the Group plans to adopt  the amended standard from 1 January 2012. these  amendments are expected to have an effect on the  scope of the note information, but do not otherwise  have any impact on the AF Groups financial standing  or results.  IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFrS 9 will replace the current IAS 39. the project has  been divided into several phases. the first phase,  which is related to the classification and measure- ment rules, has been completed by the IASB. In this  first phase it emerges from IFrS 9 that financial assets   88 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group cont. note 1 that include ordinary loan terms are to be recognised  at amortised cost, unless it has been decided to rec- ognise them at fair value, while other financial assets  are to be recognised at fair value. the classification  and measurement rules for financial obligations in  IAS 39 have been carried over, with the exception of  financial obligations that are measured at fair value  with any change in value through profit or loss (fair  value option), where the change in value associated  with the entitys own credit risk is isolated and recog- nised under other income and expenses. IFrS 9   enters into force for the financial year that starts on  or after 1 January 2013, but the eu has not approved  the standard. early implementation is permitted if  the eu approves the standard. the Group plans to  adopt the IFrS 9 from 1 January 2015. the amend- ments are not expected to have any impact on the  AF Groups financial standing or results.  IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFrS 10 replaces the portions of IAS 27 Consolidated  and Separate Financial Statements that concern the  consolidated financial statements and SIC-12 Con- solidation – Special purpose entities. IFrS 10 is based  on a simple control model that is to be used for all  units. the content of the control concept has  amended somewhat from IAS 27. the existence of  control is decisive for whether companies shall be  consolidated in accordance with IFrS 10. Control   exists when the investor has power over the invest- ment object; is exposed to or entitled to a variable  return from the investment object; and the ability to  use power to control the activities in the investment  object that significantly affect the return. IFrS 10   enters into force for the financial year that starts on  or after 1 January 2013, but the eu has not approved  the standard. early implementation is permitted if  the eu approves the standard. the Group plans to  adopt the IFrS 10 from 1 January 2013. the amend- ments are not expected to have any impact on the  AF Groups financial standing or results. IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements this standard replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint   Ventures, as well as SIC-13 Jointly Controlled entities  – non-Monetary Contributions by Venturers. IFrS 11  applies to joint arrangements and provides guide- lines on accounting for various types of joint arrange- ments – joint operations and joint ventures. It follows  from IFrS 11 that joint ventures shall be accounted  for by means of the equity method. For jointly con- trolled operations the parties shall recognise their  share of the assets and liabilities in which they have  a joint interest. Assets and liabilities that a party  owns alone shall be recognised in their entirety.   the profit or loss from jointly controlled operations  shall be recognised by the parties proportionate   to their share of the operations. IFrS 11 enters into  force for the financial year that starts on or after 1  January 2013, but the eu has not approved the  standard. early implementation is permitted if the  eu approves the standard. the Group plans to adopt  the IFrS 11 from 1 January 2013. the amendments  are not expected to have any significant impact on  the AF Groups financial standing or results.  IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFrS 12 applies to entities that have interests in sub- sidiaries, joint ventures, associated or non-consoli- dated structured units. IFrS 12 replaces the disclo- sure requirements that followed earlier from IAS 27  Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, IAS  28 Investments in Associates and IAS 31 Interests in  Joint Ventures. In addition, a number of new disclo- sure requirements have been introduced. IFrS 12  enters into force for the financial year that starts on  or after 1 January 2013, but the eu has not approved  the standard. early implementation is permitted if  the eu approves the standard. the Group plans to  adopt the IFrS 12 from 1 January 2013. these  amendments are expected to have an effect on the  scope of the note information, but not otherwise  have an effect on the AF Groups financial standing  or results.  IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement this standard defines the principles and provides  guidelines for the measurement of the fair value of  assets and liabilities that other standards require or  allow to be measured at fair value. IFrS 13 enters  into force for the financial year that starts on or after  1 January 2013, but the eu has not approved the  standard. early implementation is permitted if the  eu approves the standard. the Group plans to adopt  the IFrS 13 from 1 January 2013. the amendments  are not expected to have any impact on the AF  Groups financial standing or results.  Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of   Financial Statements the amendment to IAS 1 was a requirement to  group income and expenses in the statement of   other comprehensive income based on their poten- tial to be reclassified to the income statement or not.  the amendments enter into force for the financial  year that starts on or after 1 July 2012, but the eu  has not approved the amendments. early implemen- tation is permitted if the eu approves the amend- ments. the Group plans to adopt the amended  standard from 1 January 2013. the amendments are  not expected to have any impact on the presenta- tion of the AF Groups financial standing or results.  Amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits After the amendments in 2011, IAS 19 does not   permit the corridor method used to account for   actuarial gains or losses. Actuarial gains or losses are  to be accounted for now in their entirety in the state- ment of other comprehensive income during the  period they arise. this amendment also entails that  the retirement benefit costs will be divided between  the profit or loss on ordinary activities and other  comprehensive income. the expected return on  plan assets shall be calculated by means of the   discount rate that is calculated for the gross pension  obligation. the pension benefits earned during the  period and the interest expenses are presented   under the profit or loss on ordinary activities, while  remeasurements such as actuarial gains or losses   are presented under other comprehensive income  in the comprehensive income. In addition, the dis- closure requirements related to the benefit-based  pension agreements have been amended. the  amendments enter into force for the financial year  that starts on or after 1 January 2013, but the eu has  not approved the amendments. early implementation  is permitted if the eu approves the amendments.  the Group plans to adopt the amended standard  from 1 January 2013. the amendments are not   expected to have any significant impact on the AF  Groups financial standing or results. Amendments to IAS 27 (Revised) Separate   Financial Statements As a result of the introduction of IFrS 10, IFrS 11 and  IFrS 12 amendments were made to IAS 27 to coordi- nate the standard with the new accounting stand- ards. IFrS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements re- placed the parts of IAS 27 that refer to consolidated  financial statements. IAS 27 only deals with individu- al company accounts now and will therefore not be  relevant to consolidated financial statements after  entry into force. the amendments enter into force  for the financial year that starts on or after 1 January  2013, but the eu has not approved the amendments.  early implementation is permitted if the eu approves  the amendments. the Group plans to adopt the  amended standard from 1 January 2013. the  amendments are not expected to have any impact  on the AF Groups financial standing or results.  Amendments to IAS 28 (Revised) Investments   in Associates and Joint Ventures the scope of IAS 28 has been expanded to include  investments in joint ventures. the standard describes  the principles for the accounting of investments in  associates and joint ventures, and it specifies how  the equity method is to be used. the amendments  enter into force for the financial year that starts on or  after 1 January 2013, but the eu has not approved  the amendments. early implementation is permitted  if the eu approves the amendments. the Group plans  to adopt the amended standard from 1 January  2013. the amendments are not expected to have  any significant impact on the AF Groups financial  standing or results. 1.2 Principles of consolidation 1.2.1 Subsidiaries 1.2.1.a) General the consolidated financial statements include AF  Gruppen ASA and companies in which AF Gruppen  ASA has a controlling influence. A controlling influ- ence is normally achieved if the Group owns more  than 50 % of the shares in the company and is able  to exercise actual control over the company.   Companies that are bought or sold during the year  are included in the consolidated financial statements  from the date on which control is achieved or ceases. 1.2.1.b) Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for in accord- ance with the purchase method of accounting. the  consideration provided is measured at the fair value  of the assets transferred, liabilities assumed and   equity instruments issued. If components of the   consideration are contingent, the fair value of these  is also included on the acquisition date. expenses   related to business combinations are recognised in   89 the income statement as they are incurred. Assets  and liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet at  fair value on the acquisition date. If the sum of the  consideration exceeds the fair value of the identified  net assets in the acquired company on the acquisi- tion date, the difference will be recognised on the  balance sheet as goodwill. If the sum is lower than  the companys net assets, the difference will be   recognised immediately in the income statement. the recognition of any non-controlling ownership  interests will be measured based on the net value of  identifiable assets and liabilities in the acquiring  company or the fair value (i.e. including a goodwill  component). provision is made for deferred tax on the difference  between fair value and book value for all assets and  liabilities, with the exception of goodwill, as well as  assets in transactions that are not business combina- tions. When a property company is acquired, a con- crete assessment is made to establish whether the  acquisition concerns the business itself or assets (e.g.  land). For the purchase of assets the entire purchase  price is allocated to acquired assets on the acquisi- tion date. 1.2.1.c) Step-by-step acquisitions For step-by-step acquisitions, the earlier equity inter- est in the acquired company shall be remeasured at  fair value on the acquisition date. Any gains or losses  are recognised in the income statement. the gain is  calculated as the difference between the fair value   of the earlier equity interest on the acquisition date  and the carrying amount, adjusted for the cumula- tive amount recognised in consolidated equity  through the Groups presentation of other compre- hensive income in earlier periods. 1.2.1.d) loss of control When the Group no longer has control, any remain- ing equity interest is measured at fair value with the  recognition of gains/losses through profit or loss. In  subsequent accounting the fair value at the time of  the loss of control constitutes the acquisition cost,  either as an investment in an associate, joint venture  or financial asset. Amounts previously recorded in  statement of other comprehensive income related  to this company are treated as if the Group had   disposed of the underlying assets or liabilities. this  could mean that amounts previously recognised in  the statement of other comprehensive income are  reclassified to the income statement. Gains or losses on the disposal of an entity include  the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the   entity sold. 1.2.1.e) Business combinations completed before   1 January 2010 the following differences in relation to the afore- mentioned policies applied to business combina- tions completed before 1 January 2010: Business  combinations were accounted for using the pur- chase method. Directly attributable transaction  costs were viewed as part of the consideration.   non-controlling interests (previously referred to as  the minority) were measured as a proportionate  share of the acquired entitys identifiable net assets.  Step-by-step acquisitions were accounted for as   separate transactions and additional acquisitions   of interests did not affect the previously recognised  goodwill. 1.2.2 non-controlling interests non-controlling interests are recognised on the   balance sheet based on the non-controlling owners  share of the net identifiable assets and liabilities or  fair value, i.e. including a goodwill component. non- controlling interests are recognised in the Groups  equity. the recognition of non-controlling interests  is considered for each acquisition. the Group treats transactions with non-controlling  interests in subsidiaries as equity transactions. For  purchases from non-controlling interests, the differ- ence between any consideration paid and the  shares proportionate share of the carrying amount  of the net assets in the subsidiary is recorded in the  equity of the parent companys owners. Gains or  losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are  also recorded in equity. non-controlling interests include the non-controlling  owners share of the carrying amount of subsidiaries,  including the share of identified excess values on the  acquisition date. losses in a consolidated subsidiary that can be attribut- ed to non-controlling interests may exceed the non- controlling owners share of equity in the consolidat- ed subsidiary. 1.2.3 Joint ventures Joint ventures are enterprises in which the Group   exercises joint control through a contractual agree- ment between the parties. Joint ventures are recog- nised using the gross method from the date on  which joint control is achieved and until joint control  ceases. the gross method means that the Groups  share of the joint ventures income statement, balance  sheet and cash flow items are included line by line. Joint ventures are common in construction and civil  engineering projects where two or more parties   decide to carry out a joint project/contract and all  operational, financial and strategic decisions must  be taken unanimously by the parties. the Group is  involved in several joint ventures with other con- tracting firms for particular contracts. 1.2.4 Associates Associates are business units in which the Group   enjoys a significant influence (normally with a stake  between 20 % and 50 %), but does not exercise   financial or operational control. Investments in associates are accounted for at the  acquisition cost at the time of purchase and subse- quently by the equity method. the carrying  amounts include any excess value and goodwill  identified on the acquisition date, less subsequent  depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses. the Groups share of the profit or loss in associates is  recognised in the income statement and added to  the carrying amount of the investments. this applies  from the date significant influence is achieved until  such influence ceases. When the Groups share of  losses exceeds the investment in an associate, the  Groups book value is reduced to zero and further  losses are not recognised unless the Group is obli- gated to cover the loss. 1.2.5 elimination of transactions by consolidation Intercompany transactions and accounts, including  internal profit and unrealised gains and losses, are  eliminated. unrealised gains linked to transactions  with associates and joint ventures are eliminated in  proportion to the Groups stake in the company/   enterprise. unrealised losses are also eliminated,   but only if there are no indications of impairment   of assets sold internally. 1.3 Segment reporting the operating segments are reported in the same  manner as the internal reporting to the Companys  highest decision-maker. the Companys highest   decision-maker, who is responsible for the allocation  of resources to and the assessment of earnings in  the operating segments, is defined as the corporate  management. 1.4 Use of estimates in preparation of the    financial statements the management has used estimates and assump- tions that have affected assets, liabilities, revenues,  expenses, and information on potential liabilities.  these estimates apply in particular to the recogni- tion of income and valuations linked to long-term  manufacturing projects, valuation of goodwill and  valuations related to acquisitions, as well as retire- ment benefit obligations. Future events may entail  changes to the estimates. estimates and the under- lying assumptions are assessed continuously.  Changes in accounting estimates are reported in   the period in which they occur. If they also relate to  future periods, the effect is spread over present and  future periods. See also note 2. 1.5 Classification receivables and payables that are related to the   construction and civil engineering business areas  are classified as current assets and current liabilities.  this means that balances with customers and ad- vance invoicing are presented on the balance sheet  as current assets and current liabilities. For all civil  engineering contracts, where amounts invoiced on  account exceed contract revenue less contract loss- es, the surplus is recognised on the balance sheet as  trade payables and non-interest-bearing liabilities.  prepayments are deducted from invoiced revenue  over the term of the project in line with the progress.  projects for own account and land for development  are recognised as current assets.  90 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group cont. note 1 other receivables and payables that are due in more  than a year are classified as non-current assets and  non-current liabilities. 1.6 Foreign currency translation 1.6.1 Functional and presentation currencies the financial statements for the individual units in  the Group are measured in the currency primarily  used where the unit operates (functional currency).  the consolidated financial statements are presented  in norwegian kroner (noK), which is both the parent  Companys functional currency and the Groups pres- entation currency. 1.6.2 transactions and balance sheet items transactions in foreign currencies are translated to  the functional currency at the transaction exchange  rate. realised foreign exchange gains or losses from  the settlement or translation of monetary items in a  foreign currency are recognised at the rate prevailing  on the balance sheet date. If the foreign currency   position is regarded as cash flow hedging or the  hedging of a net investment in a foreign enterprise,  then the gain or loss will be recognised under other  comprehensive income. Foreign exchange gains and losses related to trade  receivables, trade payables and other balance sheet  items related to operations, are presented under net  gains and losses in the income statement and speci- fied otherwise in the notes. Foreign exchange gains or losses related to loans,  cash and cash equivalents are presented under net  financial items in the income statement and speci- fied otherwise in the notes. the foreign exchange effect on non-monetary items  (both assets and liabilities) is included as part of the  assessment of fair value. Foreign exchange differenc- es relating to non-monetary items, such as shares at  fair value through profit and loss, are recognised as  part of a combined gain or loss. Foreign exchange  differences relating to shares classified as available  for sale are included in the change in value that is   recognised under other comprehensive income. 1.6.3 Group companies the income statement and balance sheet for group  companies (none with hyperinflation) with a functional  currency other than the presentation currency are  translated as follows: a) the balance sheet is translated at the rate prevailing  on the balance sheet date. b) the income statement is translated at the average  exchange rate (if the average exchange rate does not  give a reasonable overall estimate of the use of the  transaction exchange rate, then the transaction   exchange rate shall be used). c) translation differences are recognised under other  comprehensive income and specified in the equity as  a separate item. upon the sale of all or any portion of a foreign enter- prise, the associated translation difference will be re- classified from other comprehensive income to part  of the gain or loss from the sale through profit and  loss. Goodwill and excess value from the acquisition of a  foreign unit will be treated as assets and liabilities in  the acquired unit and translated at the rate prevailing  on the balance sheet date. 1.7 Principles of revenue recognition 1.7.1 revenue in general Income is recognised when it is probable that trans- actions will generate future economic benefits for  the Company and the size of the income can be relia- bly estimated. Sales revenue is presented less value- added tax and discounts. 1.7.2 project revenue revenue from the sale of services and long-term  manufacturing projects is recognised in the income  statement in line with the projects degree of com- pletion when the result of the transaction can be   estimated reliably. progress is measured on the basis  of an assessment of the work carried out. When the  result of the transaction cannot be estimated reliably,  only revenue equivalent to incurred project costs will  be recognised. In the period when it is identified that  a project will lead to a negative result, the estimated  loss on the contract will be recognised in full in the  income statement. 1.7.3 projects for third-party accounts the AF Groups business consists mainly of construc- tion and civil engineering activities that are carried  out for public and private clients and based on con- tracts of varying duration. the characteristic feature  of such contracts is that they are client financed.   the treatment of construction and civil engineering  contracts in the financial statements conforms to   IAS 11. Demolition work is defined under IAS 11 and  dealt with by using the same accounting policies as  for projects for third-party accounts. revenue related to projects is recognised in the in- come statement as the project progresses. each   project is recognised in the income statement based  on the projects degree of completion and the esti- mated contribution margin at the end of the project  (percentage-of-completion method). the degree of  completion is mainly calculated on the basis of in- curred costs on the balance sheet date as a percent- age of estimated total costs or based on a concrete  assessment of the physical degree of completion. In the early stages of a project, a smaller than the pro- portionate share of the expected profit is normally  recognised as income, while in the final stages of a  project, a larger share is recognised, since the expect- ed profit can be assessed then with a greater degree  of certainty. When the outcome of the project cannot  be estimated reliably, only revenue equivalent to the  incurred project costs will be recognised. In the period  in which it is identified that a project will produce a  negative result, the estimated loss on the contract  will be fully recognised as an expense, irrespective   of the degree of completion. the recognition of revenue from disputed claims,  claims for additional work, change orders, incentive  bonuses, etc., starts when it is probable that the   customers will approve the claim. provisions are  made for identified and expected warranty work. Contribution margin earned on projects in progress  involves a number of assessments. these assess- ments are made based on the managements best  estimate. the extent and complexity of the assess- ments mean that the actual contribution margins   at the end of projects may deviate from the assess- ments made at year end. Customers are billed monthly in relation to the pro- portion of the contract price and for additional work  carried out and approved in the period. Deviating  payment plans may occur, but these arrangements  do not affect the accrual of revenue and expenses. 1.7.4 projects for own account Some production is carried out for the Groups own  account, and these projects are self- financed. projects  for own account largely involve the development  and construction of residential housing for sale.   A residential housing project may consist of many  units, and the majority of the units are sold before a  project starts. In accordance with IFrIC 15 projects for own account  in the AF Group are recognised in accordance with  IAS 18. under IAS 18 all the revenue (including the   related costs) will be recognised on one specific date,  normally on completion/delivery. 1.7.5 Sale of plant and equipment Gains/losses from sales of plant and equipment are  recognised in the income statement once delivery  has taken place and most of the risk and return has  been transferred. 1.7.6 other revenue revenues from sales of goods are recognised in the  income statement once delivery has taken place and  most of the risk and return has been transferred. 1.7.7 Financial income Interest income is recognised based on the effective  interest rate method as it is earned. Dividends are  recognised as revenue when the shareholders right  to receive a dividend has been established by the  General Meeting. 1.8 Payable and deferred tax the tax expense consists of current tax payable and  deferred tax. tax is recognised in the income state- ment except when it is related to items that have  been recognised under other comprehensive income  or directly through equity. If this is the case, then the  tax is also recognised under other comprehensive   income or directly through equity.  91 the current tax payable for the period is calculated  in accordance with the tax laws and regulations that  have, or have essentially, been adopted by the tax  authorities on the balance sheet date. It is the legis- lation in the countries where the Groups subsidiaries  or associates operate and generate taxable income  that determine how the taxable income is calculat- ed. the management assesses the points of view   asserted in the tax returns wherever the tax laws are  subject to interpretation. provisions are allocated for  the expected tax charges, as considered necessary,  based on the managements evaluations. Deferred tax is calculated by means of the liability  method on all temporary differences between the  tax values and consolidated accounting values of   assets and liabilities. If deferred tax arises upon the  initial recognition of liabilities or assets in a transac- tion that is not part of a business combination and  does not affect either the reported or taxable profit  on the transaction date, it will not be recognised on  the balance sheet. Deferred tax is determined by means of the tax rates  and tax laws that have been adopted or essentially  adopted on the balance sheet date, which are   assumed to apply when the deferred tax asset is   realised or when the deferred tax is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance  sheet if it is probable that future taxable income will  be generated so that the tax-reducing temporary  differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated based on temporary differ- ences from investments in subsidiaries and associ- ates except when the Group controls the timing for  the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is  probable that they will not be reversed in the fore- seeable future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax are to be offset  if there is a legally enforceable right to offset assets  in respect of the current tax payable against liabili- ties in respect of the current tax payable, and the   deferred tax assets and deferred tax refer to income  tax that is imposed by the same tax authority on the  same taxable enterprise or different taxable enter- prises with the intent to settle liabilities and assets   in respect of the current tax payable on a net basis. 1.9 Property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment are measured at cost  minus accumulated depreciation and impairment  losses. When assets are sold or retired, the book   value is deducted and any loss or gain recognised   in the income statement. Acquisition cost includes all expenses that are direct- ly attributable to the purchase or manufacture of the  asset. In the case of plant and equipment manufac- tured in house, a proportion of other attributable  costs and loan expenses are also included in the   acquisition cost. expenses that have incurred after  the asset has been put to use, such as ongoing main- tenance, are recognised in the income statement,  while other expenses that are expected to generate   future economic benefits are recognised on the   balance sheet. the residual value recognised on   the balance sheet relating to replaced parts is   recognised in the income statement. every significant component of property, plant and  equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful  life. production-related machinery is mainly depreci- ated using the reducing balance method, while   other property, plant and equipment are depreciat- ed on a straight-line basis. plants and equipment that are leased are depreciat- ed over the term of the lease or useful life, whichever  is shorter, unless it is reasonably certain that the  Group will acquire the asset when the lease expires. the depreciation period and deprecation method  are evaluated annually and the retirement value is  estimated at year end. Changes are recognised as   a change of estimate. 1.10 Intangible assets 1.10.1 Goodwill Goodwill is recognised on the balance sheet at his- torical cost less write-downs. Goodwill is not amor- tised, but is tested at least once a year for impair- ment. Any impairment of goodwill is not reversed,  even if the basis for the impairment no longer exists. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or  groups of cash-generating units that are expected   to benefit from the acquisition from which the  goodwill arose. 1.10.2 patents and licences Amounts paid for patents and licences are recog- nised on the balance sheet and depreciated on a  straight-line basis over their expected useful life.  their expected useful life for patents and licences  varies from 5 to 10 years. 1.10.3 Software expenses related to the purchase of new software  are recognised on the balance sheet as intangible  assets, provided these expenses are not part of the  acquisition cost of hardware. Software is normally  depreciated on a straight-line basis over 3 years.   expenses incurred as a result of maintaining the   future benefit of software are recognised as an ex- pense unless the changes to the software increase  the future economic benefit of the software. 1.10.4 Contractual customer relationships Contractual customer relationships that are acquired  separately are recognised on the balance sheet at  fair value (cost) on the acquisition date. Contractual  customer relationships that are acquired in business  combinations are recognised on the balance sheet  at fair value on the acquisition date. the contractual  customer relationships have a limited useful life and  are recognised at the acquisition cost less the accu- mulated depreciation. Depreciation is carried out on  a straight-line basis over the expected life of the   customer relationship. 1.10.5 Quarrying rights Quarrying rights are recognised on the balance  sheet at fair value (cost) on the acquisition date.  Quarrying rights acquired in business combinations  are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value on  the acquisition date. Quarrying rights have a limited  useful life and are recognised at the acquisition cost  less the accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is  carried out on a straight-line basis over the expected  life of the quarrying rights. 1.11 Impairment of non-financial assets Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and  goodwill are not depreciated, but tested for impair- ment annually. property, plant and equipment and  intangible assets that are depreciated are assessed  for impairment in value when there are indicators  that the future earnings cannot justify the book   value of the asset. the difference between the book value and recover- able amount is recognised in the income statement  as an impairment loss. the recoverable amount is  the higher of the fair value less selling costs or the  utility value. When impairment is assessed, the   intangible assets are grouped together at the lowest  level it is possible to identify independent cash flows  (cash-generating units). the possibility of reversing previous impairment  losses on property, plant and equipment and intan- gible assets that are depreciated is evaluated on  each reporting date. the reversal of impairment loss- es is calculated in the same manner as impairment  losses. 1.12 Leases to determine whether an agreement is a lease,   or contains a lease element, the substance of the  agreement is assessed on the earlier of the date of  the agreement or the date when the parties commit  themselves to the main terms of the agreement. If  performance of the agreement requires the use of a  specific asset or group of assets, or if the agreement  provides more indirect entitlement to use a specific  asset or group of assets, the agreement is treated as  a lease agreement. lease arrangements in which the Group acquires  most of the risk and return and are associated with  ownership of the assets are financial leases. other  leases are treated as operating leases. 1.12.1 Financial leases the AF Group presents financial leases in the financial  statements as assets and liabilities. At the beginning  of the term of the lease, financial leases are included  at an amount equivalent to fair value or the present  value of the minimum payment, whichever is lower.  the implicit interest cost is used to calculate the   present value of the lease. Direct costs involved in   arranging the lease are added to the cost of the asset. leased plant and equipment are depreciated   according to the same principles as the Groups   92 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group cont. note 1  other plant and equipment. the annual payment  consists of an interest portion, which is recognised in  the income statement as an interest expense, and a  repayment portion, which reduces the liability.   Sale-leaseback gains are recognised immediately if   a sales transaction is carried out at fair value. In   addition, gains/losses resulting from overpricing   or underpricing compensated by future lease pay- ments are amortised over the term of the lease. 1.12.2 operating leases lease payments are classified as operating expenses  and recognised in the income statement over the  term of the contract. Sale-leaseback gains are recognised immediately if   a sales transaction is carried out at fair value. In addi- tion, gains/losses resulting from overpricing or under- pricing compensated by future lease payments are  amortised over the term of the lease. 1.13 Financial instruments 1.13.1 Financial assets the Group has financial assets that are classified in  the following categories: a) At fair value through profit or loss  b) loans and receivables c) Financial assets available for sale the classifications are based on the purpose of the  asset. the classifications take place at acquisition and  are reviewed on each reporting date. a) At fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are  derivatives and other financial assets that are held for  trading. Financial assets are classified in this category  if they have been acquired mainly to profit from  short-term price fluctuations. the Group has financial  assets at fair value through profit or loss in the form  of forward exchange and commodity contracts.   Forward exchange contracts are entered into to  hedge future cash flows related to contracts entered  into in foreign currencies and commodity futures  contracts are entered into to hedge the price of   recycled scrap steel to be sold. this hedging does   not meet the conditions for hedge accounting and   is therefore recognised at fair value with changes in  value through profit or loss. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss  that are not forward contracts are reported at fair   value on the acquisition date and the transaction  costs are recognised in the income statement. the   assets are measured on a current basis at fair value  with changes in value through profit or loss. All   financial assets in this category are presented as   current assets and measured at fair value based   on observable market data. Forward exchange and commodity contracts are   recognised on the contract date and measured in  subsequent periods at fair value based on observa- ble  market data. Financial assets that mature within  12 months are presented as current financial deriva- tives, and assets that mature in more than 12 months  are classified as non-current financial derivatives. See also section 13.2 a) for a description of forward  exchange and commodity contracts. b) loans and receivables loans and receivables are non-derivative financial   assets with fixed or determinable payments that are  not traded in an active market. loans and receivables  that are included in the Groups ordinary operating  cycle, including trade receivables, or are expected to  be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet  date are classified as current assets. other loans and  receivables are classified as non-current assets. loans and receivables are recognised initially on the  balance sheet at fair value plus transaction costs.  loans and receivables are measured on a current   basis at amortised cost using the effective interest  rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the  income statement when loans and receivables are  recognised, written down or amortised. loans and receivables are written down when there  are objective indications that the Group will not   receive settlement in accordance with the original  terms. objective indications of impairment are evalu- ated specifically for each customer and will typically  consist of serious financial problems experienced by  the other party and late or non-payment. the amount  of the write-down is recognised in the income state- ment. If the cause of the write-down no longer   applies in a subsequent period and this can be linked  to an event that occurred after the impairment was  recognised, the earlier write-down is reversed. the   reversal must not result in the book value of the   financial asset exceeding what amortised cost would  have been if the impairment had not been recognised  when the write-down is reversed. c) Financial assets available for sale Financial assets available for sale are non-derivative  financial assets that are placed in this category by  choice or do not fall under any other category. they  are classified as non-current assets, provided the in- vestment does not mature or the management does  not intend to sell the investment within 12 months  from the balance sheet date. Financial assets available for sale are recognised   initially at fair value. Financial assets available for sale  are assessed subsequently at fair value and changes  in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive  income, until the asset is sold or assessed to have   suffered impairment losses, whereupon accumulated  gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive  income are included in the income statement for the  period. 1.13.2 Financial liabilities a) At fair value through profit or loss the Group has financial liabilities at fair value  through profit or loss in the form of forward exchange  and commodity contracts. Forward exchange con- tracts are entered into to hedge future cash flows   related to contracts entered into in foreign currencies  and commodity futures contracts are entered into to  hedge the price of recycled scrap steel to be sold.  this hedging does not meet the conditions for hedge  accounting and is therefore recognised at fair value  with changes in value through profit or loss. transaction costs are recognised immediately. the  contracts are recognised on the contract date and  measured in subsequent periods at fair value based  on observable market data. Financial assets/liabilities  that mature within 12 months are presented as   current financial derivatives, and assets/liabilities that  mature in more than 12 months are classified as   non-current financial derivatives. See also section 13.1 a) for a description of forward  exchange and commodity contracts. b) other financial liabilities Financial liabilities that are not recognised at fair   value through profit or loss are measured at fair value  on initial recognition, less transaction costs. there- after financial liabilities are recognised at amortised  cost using the effective interest rate method. Any   issuing costs, discounts or premiums are taken into  account in the calculation of amortised cost. Financial liabilities that are expected to be settled in  the Groups ordinary operating cycle or due for settle- ment within 12 months of the balance sheet date are  classified as current liabilities. other financial liabilities are classified as non-current  liabilities. 1.14 Inventories Inventories are recognised at cost or net selling price,  whichever is the lower. Inventories mainly consist of  spare parts, equipment, and materials for use in pro- duction. Cost is determined using the FIFo method  and includes expenses incurred in acquiring the  goods and the cost of bringing them to their present  location and condition. 1.15 Projects for own account In accordance with IFrIC 15 projects for own account  in the AF Group are recognised in accordance with  IAS 18 under IAS 18 all the revenue (including the   related costs) will be recognised on one specific date,  normally on completion/delivery. 1.16 Projects for third-party accounts projects for third-party accounts are presented in the  financial statements using the percentage of comple- tion method in accordance with IAS 11 Construction  Contracts. this means that income earned but not   invoiced is presented as a trade receivable. payments  on account and advances received from a customer  in connection with a construction contract reduce  the receivable. If payments on account, advances,   93 and any expected losses exceed the earned contract  income, the surplus is recognised as an advance from  the customer under current liabilities. provision for  expected losses on remaining contractual produc- tion is classified as a current liability after the recog- nised revenue earned, but not invoiced has been  written down. trade receivables are not offset against  advances on different contracts or if other circum- stances suggest that it would not be permitted. 1.17 Trade and other current receivables trade receivables arise from the sale of goods or   services within the ordinary operating cycle. If settle- ment is expected during the ordinary operating   cycle, then the receivables are classified as current  assets. If this is not the case, then the receivables are  classified as non-current assets. trade receivables are  measured at fair value for the initial recognition on  the balance sheet. For subsequent measurement,  the trade receivables are recognised at amortised  cost using the effective interest method. Current   receivables that mature in less than three months  are not normally discounted. Changes in the value of trade receivables related to  estimated changes are recognised as an adjustment  of the operating revenue. Changes in the value of  trade receivables related to estimate changes are  recognised as an adjustment of the operating revenue. 1.18 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include bank deposits  and other short-term fixed income securities. Bank  overdrafts are included in loans under current liabili- ties on the balance sheet. 1.19 Equity 1.19.1 treasury shares When treasury shares are bought back, the purchase  price, including directly attributable costs, are recog- nised as a deduction from equity. treasury shares are  presented as a reduction in equity. the cumulative  gain or loss on sales of treasury shares is presented  on a net basis in equity. net accumulated losses on  sales of treasury shares are recognised under other  retained earnings, while net accumulated gains are  recognised under other paid-in equity. 1.19.2 translation differences translation differences arise in connection with   exchange differences in the consolidation of foreign  units. on disposal of a foreign unit, the accumulated trans- lation difference relating to the unit is reversed and  recognised in the income statement in the same   period in which the gain or loss on disposal is recog- nised in the income statement. 1.19.3 Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability once they are  adopted by the General Meeting. this means that  proposed dividends that are not yet adopted are   included in equity. 1.20 Employee benefits 1.20.1 retirement benefits a) Defined-benefit plans the Group has defined-benefit plans for employees  of the norwegian companies born in or before 1951  who joined the Group prior to 1 January 2003. the  pension plans are funded through accumulated   reserves in insurance companies. the net liability is  calculated on the basis of the present value of future  retirement benefits that the employees have earned  on the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan  assets. the calculations are carried out by a qualified  actuary. the plans earning formula is used as the   allocation method unless a large proportion of the  pension-earning takes place towards the end of the  pension-earning period. In this case a linear alloca- tion method is used. Introducing a new benefit plan or changing a current  benefit plan will result in changes in the retirement  benefit liabilities. Any change is carried as an ex- pense on a straight line basis until the effect of the  change has been earned. the introduction of new  schemes or changes to existing schemes that have  retroactive effect so that employees earn uncondi- tional pension rights immediately, are recognised in  the income statement at once. Gains or losses relat- ing to restrictions or termination of retirement bene- fit plans are recognised in the income statement  when they take place. the accumulated impact of estimate changes and  changes in financial and actuarial assumptions   (actuarial gains or losses) of less than 10 % of the  higher of the defined-benefit retirement benefit   liabilities or plan assets at the start of the year is not  recognised. In the case of deviations in excess of   10 %, the surplus is recognised in the income state- ment and distributed on a straight line basis over  the assumed average pension-earning period   remaining. the net retirement benefit expense for  the period is included under payroll costs. In addition, AF Gruppen norge AS has participated  in the norwegian Federation of trade unions (lo)/ norwegian Confederation of norwegian enterprise  (nHo) scheme under which employees were enti- tled to early retirement pension (AFp) from the age  of 62. A decision was made in this company to dis- continue this scheme in 2010, and it was only possi- ble to retire early in accordance with the old scheme  until 31 December 2010. Contractual early retirement  (AFp) is a defined-benefit multi-company scheme.  there is a remaining provision covering the compa- nys co-payment, which is 25 %, to individuals who  retired early under the old scheme. Future liabilities  associated with this scheme are funded through   revenues from operations and are unfunded. employees in Sweden are members of two defined- benefit multi-company schemes. Due to the struc- ture of the plans, there is no basis for calculating  plan surpluses or deficits or their impact on future  premiums. the schemes have therefore been   recognised as defined-contribution plans. b) Defined-contribution plans In addition to the defined-benefit plan described  above, the Group has a defined-contribution   pension scheme for all employees in norway who  are not covered by the scheme mentioned above.  the pension premium is recognised as an expense  when it incurs, and the Group has no obligations  over and above this. 1.20.2 Share discounts Discounts on private share offerings and the sale of  treasury shares to employees are recognised as ex- penses at fair value on the allotment date. the value  of the discounts is calculated using an option pricing  model that takes the vesting period into account.  the discount is charged to payroll costs and credited  to equity. 1.20.3 Share-based remuneration options for employees are measured at fair value   on the allotment date. the calculated value is recog- nised under payroll costs and set off under other  contributed equity. the expense is distributed over  the period until the employee acquires an uncondi- tional right to the options. the estimated number of  options expected to be earned is reassessed on   every balance sheet date. Any changes are recog- nised as an expense with a corresponding adjust- ment of equity. the social security costs for options are recognised  in the income statement over the expected vesting  period. each option gives entitlement to purchase one share  at a predetermined price. the Company does not  have an agreed right to settle the value of the options  issued in cash. 1.21 provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has an  obligation (legal or self-imposed) as a consequence  of an earlier event and it is probable (more probable  than not) that an economic settlement will be made  as a consequence of the obligation and the size of  the amount can be measured reliably. If the impact  is significant, the provisions are calculated by dis- counting the estimated future cash flows by a   discount rate before tax that reflects the markets  pricing of the current value of money and, where   relevant, risks specifically linked to the liability. restructuring provisions are included when the  Group has approved a detailed and formal restruc- turing plan, and the restructuring has either started  or been announced. provisions for guarantees are recognised when the  underlying projects and services are sold. provisions  are based on historical information on guarantees   94 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group estimates and discretionary assessments are evalua- ted continuously and based on historical experience  and other factors, including expectations of future  events that are regarded as reasonable under the  current circumstances.  the Group prepares estimates and makes assump- tions concerning the future. the accounting estima- tes that are made as a result of this will rarely coinci- de in full with the final outcome. estimates and as- sumptions/prerequisites that represent a significant  risk of major changes in the book value of assets and  liabilities during the next financial year are discussed  below.      Revenue recognition during execution of projects  the AF Groups activities are mainly project-based.  revenue from projects is recognised in the income  statement in line with the projects degree of com- pletion and final outcome. the ongoing recognition  of revenue from projects entails uncertainty, since it  is based on estimates and assessments. For projects  in progress, there exists uncertainty regarding the  progress of remaining work, disputes, warranty work,  end results, etc. For completed projects, there exists  uncertainty regarding hidden defects or faults, as  well as possible disputes with the customer. the   estimates used in the accounts are based on uniform  policies and are subjected to control procedures  that are intended to ensure reliable measurement   of project results and progress. the complexity and  scope mean, however, that there is an inherent risk  that the final results of projects may deviate from  the expected results.        Goodwill and other intangible assets the Group performs annual tests to assess whether  the value of goodwill and intangible assets has been  impaired, cf. note 13. In the impairment test the  book value is measured against the recoverable  amount from the cash-generating unit to which   the asset is allocated. the recoverable amount from  cash-generating units is determined by calculation  of the utility value. these calculations require the  use of estimates.     Plant and equipment the expected economic life of the Groups plant and  equipment is very much affected by the nature and  duration of the assignments, as well as the develop- ment of technology. production-related machinery  is mainly depreciated using the reducing balance  method to the expected residual value at the end of  the period of use, while other plant and equipment  is depreciated in a straight line over its economic life  of 3-10 years.  plant and equipment are tested for impairment if  there are indications of a reduction in value. the   method corresponds to that described in the   section on goodwill and intangible assets.  Business combinations the AF Group allocates the purchase price for   acquired businesses to acquired assets and liabilities  based on the estimated fair value. In this connection,  the management makes assessments to determine  the method of valuation, estimates and assump- tions. In addition, best judgement is often used to  determine any additional consideration. For large  acquisitions, the AF Group uses independent exter- nal advisors to assist in determining the fair value. Retirement benefits the present value of the retirement benefit obliga- tions depends on a number of factors that are deter- mined on an actuarial basis using a number of as- sumptions. this includes assumptions related to the  discount rate, wage inflation, adjustment of retire- ment benefits, expected return on plan assets, and  demographic factors such as disability and mortali- ty. these assumptions are based on observable mar- ket prices and historical developments in the Group  and society as a whole. Changes in assumptions will  affect the projected retirement benefit obligations  and retirement benefit expense.      Income tax the Group is taxed on its income in several countries.  Considerable judgement is required in determining  the income tax for all countries together in the con- solidated financial statements. For many transactions,  there will be uncertainty related to the ultimate tax  liability. the operating segments are identified based on the  reporting the Corporate Management team uses  when they allocate resources and make assessments  of performance and profitability at a strategic level.       Business areas the AF Group is engaged in industrial and contrac- ting operations. the Corporate Management team  assesses the business operations on the basis of the  Civil engineering, Building, property, environment  and energy business areas.    the Civil engineering business area is a turnkey   supplier of civil engineering services in norway. In  Sweden Civil engineering performs foundation work  in the Stockholm area. Civil engineering has state-   of-the-art expertise in the market areas of oil and  energy, underground construction, infrastructure  and harbours. Note 3  Segment information Note 2  Estimate uncertainty cont. note 1 and a weighting of possible outcomes against the  probability of their occurrence. provisions for loss-making contracts are recognised  when the Groups expected revenue from a contract  is less than the unavoidable costs incurred in order  to fulfil the obligations under the contract. 1.22 loan expenses loan expenses are recognised on the balance sheet  to the extent that they are directly attributable to  manufacture of an asset that it takes a substantial  amount of time to make for use or sale. the AF  Group recognises loan expenses that accrue during  the production of projects for own account (residen- tial housing) and plant and equipment for own use  on the balance sheet. recognition on the balance  sheet ceases when the assets are finished. 1.23 Cash flow the cash flow statement has been prepared in ac- cordance with the indirect method and shows cash  flows from operating, investing and financing activi- ties, respectively, and it explains the change in cash  and cash equivalents for the period. 1.24 Contingent liabilities and assets Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the finan- cial statements. Significant contingent liabilities are  disclosed with the exception of contingent liabilities  with a low probability. A contingent asset is not rec- ognised in the financial statements, but disclosed if  it is probable that it will benefit the Group. 1.25 events after the balance sheet date new information concerning the Groups financial  position on the balance sheet date that is received  after the balance sheet date is considered in the   financial statements. events after the balance sheet  date that do not affect the Groups financial position  on the balance sheet date, but will affect its financial  position in the future, are disclosed if they are signifi- cant.  95 Amounts in noK million 2011 Income statement Civil  Engineering Building Property Environ- ment Energy Others Elim.

Building  has a solid local base with a strong market position  in oslo and central east norway, as well as Agder,  Buskerud and Kristiansand. In addition, AF has  building activity in Gothenburg, Sweden.   the property business area acquires and develops  residential and commercial property for its own   account in areas where the AF Group is engaged in  contracting operations. property development is   often carried out in cooperation with partners to  spread the risk and benefit from each others   expertise.   Activities in the environment business area include  demolition, recycling and environmental clean-up  onshore and offshore. environment is the leading  demolition contractor for buildings, plants and in- stallations. environment also has land-based demo- lition activities in Sweden and poland. the offshore  business area removes and recycles decommissioned  petroleum installations. this business area is estab- lished in norway and the uK. Work is performed   offshore or at the environmental Base at Vats in the  Municipality of Vindafjord.   the energy business area offers expertise in energy  conservation and energy-related services for build- ings, industry, offshore and the marine sector. ener- gy offers measurable result guarantees for energy       savings based on the analysis and monitoring of the  flow of energy in buildings. energy has operations  in oslo, Skien, Bergen and Stavanger. A company has  been established in China to benefit from competi- tive advantages related to purchasing and logistics.  What remains after allocation to the business areas  is presented as other and involves primarily activiti- es in the parent Company and some general services. transactions between segments in the Group are  carried out based on market terms and in accordan- ce with the arms length principle.  transactions   between the various segments are eliminated. Types of services the AF Group has primarily two types of projects/ services: projects for own account and projects for  third-party accounts. projects for own account   largely involve the development and construction  of residential housing for sale. projects for own   account are self-financed and the property business  area delivers primarily projects of this type. Activities  in the other segments are performed for public and  private clients based on contracts entered into with  varying durations. the characteristic feature of such  contracts is that they are client financed.  Geographic segments the division into geographic segment is not repor- ted on an ongoing basis to the Corporate Manage- ment team. Geographically segmented key figures  required by IFrS 8 are presented in a separate table  and supplement information to analysts and other  users of the financial statements.  Accounting policies Segment information is presented in accordance  with the AF Groups accounting policies in accor- dance with IFrS with the exception of IFrIC 15  (Agreements for the Construction of real estate).  this policy exception applies to the Building and  property segments and norway. Income from projects  for own account in these segments is recognised  based on the principles in IAS 11. the recognition of  income in these projects is the product of the physi- cal degree of completion, the percentage sold and  the expected contribution margin. this means, for  example, that a project that is 50 % complete, 50 %  of which is sold on the reporting date, will be repor- ted with a contribution margin of 25 % of the total  expected contribution margin. In the consolidated  accounts, the principles in IFrIC 15 are followed  with the recognition of income from projects for  own account in accordance with IAS 18. In accor- dance with IAS 18 all of the income (and the associ- ated costs) are recognised at a single point in time,  normally on delivery. the effect of IFrIC 15 on the  consolidated accounts is illustrated in a separate   table in the segment information. Important customers the AF Group has one customer, the norwegian   public roads Administration, which is responsible  for more than 10% of the total operating revenues.  In 2011 income of noK 1,133 million (noK 1,087  million) was recognised in connection with contracts  entered into with the norwegian public roads   Administration.   96 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group cont. note 3 Amounts in noK million 2010 Income statement Civil   Engineering Building Property Environ- ment Energy Others Elim.

An allocation of the purchase price based on the opening balance sheet   of rogaland entreprenr AS as at 15 november 2011 is presented below.   Allocation of the purchase price has been prepared using the acquisition  method as regulated in IFrS 3. the purchase price has been allocated at the  fair value of the consolidated assets and liabilities of rogaland entreprenr  AS. non-controlling interests are measured at the net value of identifiable  assets in rogaland entreprenr AS. Since the total consideration exceeds  the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities on the acquisition date,  the difference has been recognised as goodwill. this goodwill is related   primarily to the market position and local presence. Strm Gundersen on 3 november 2011, the AF Group implemented the agreement to purchase  a majority shareholding in Strm Gundersen. the acquisition gives the AF  Group a strong market position in the building market in Buskerud and the   renovation market in oslo. Strm Gundersen is part of the Building business  area. the transaction priced the Strm Gundersen companies at a combined  value of noK 997 million on a 100 % basis before correction for non-controlling  interests and pro and con settlement. the purchase price has been  adjusted  for net interest-bearing liabilities on the takeover date and deviation from  normalised working capital.  the transaction comprises AF Gruppen norge AS acquisition of 100 % of   SG Gruppen Kongsvinger AS and the purchase of further shares in Strm   Gundersen Holding AS from Vlerveien 229 AS and employee shareholders,  as well as the purchase of further shares in VSp Holding AS from employee  shareholders.   the consideration consisted partly of shares and partly of cash. the share  portion consisted of 4,019,800 shares, which were issued on 8 november  2011. In calculating the number of consideration shares, a fixed share price  of noK 48.5 per share was agreed. the actual issue price is used however for  entering the issue in the accounts and in the acquisition analysis. the price  at the time of issue, which is to say the market price on 1 november 2011,  was noK 46.8 per share.  transaction costs were recognised as expenses as they arose. these costs  amounted to noK 3 million. presented below is a provisional allocation of the purchase price based on  the opening balance sheet of Strm Gundersen as at 3 november 2011.   Allocation of the purchase price has been prepared using the acquisition  method as regulated in IFrS 3. the purchase price has been allocated to the  fair value of the assets and liabilities of Strm Gundersen.  non-controlling  interests are measured at the net value of identifiable assets in Strm   Gundersen. Since the total consideration exceeds the fair value of the   identifiable assets and liabilities on the acquisition date, the difference   has been recognised as goodwill. the goodwill/business value is related   primarily to market positions and the organisations overall expertise   related to profitable business operations. After the acquisition date AF rogaland entreprenr has had operating revenue in 2011 of noK 40 million and earnings before taxes of noK 0 million.  99 Amounts in noK million  AF Group operating revenue 8,407 earnings before taxes 494 Amounts in noK million Strm Gundersen Cash consideration 419 Share consideration 188 Total purchase price 607 property, plant and equipment 73 Intangible assets 412 other non-current assets 8 Current assets, excl. cash and cash equivalents 284 Cash and cash equivalents 93 non-controlling interests -62 long-term loans and credit facilities -99 provisions -36 Deferred tax -18 Short-term loans and credit facilities -146 trade accounts payable and other current liabilities -310 Total identified assets and liabilities 199 Goodwill 408 Business combinations in 2010       on 1 october 2010 the AF Group acquired 100% of the shares in the machinery  contractor Johan rognerud AS. the nationwide company has 70 employees  and state-of-the-art earthmoving expertise. the company was acquired as  part of the efforts to acquire a greater share of the infrastructure project   market. Johan rognerud AS will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of   the AF Group.              the acquisition of Johan rognerud AS resulted in goodwill of noK 11 million,  which is related to the expected economies of scale attributed to a coordina- tion of the operations with the AF Groups other operations. none of the  goodwill is expected to be tax deductible.   the table below shows the consideration and the fair value of the acquired  assets and liabilities related to the acquisition of Johan rognerud AS:           Btservice Offshore/Verft AS           the AF Group entered into a final agreement to purchase portions of the   business operations of Btservice offshore Verft AS in February 2011. the AF  Group will be taking over all the employees, as well as the net working capital  and property, plant and equipment at a fair value of noK 4 million. the opera- tions will continue as part of the AF Groups services to the offshore market  and become part of the Civil engineering business area. All of the employees  of Btservice offshore Verft will be transferred to the AF Group and the newly  established business AF offshore Mandal. the unit will continue to deliver  services to the offshore market in particular. the acquisition strengthens the  AF Groups focus on the offshore maintenance and modification market. the book value of intangible assets in Strm Gundersen as at the acquisition date consists exclusively of goodwill related to acquisitions made earlier.    the total goodwill related to Strm Gundersen is therefore noK 820 million.                        After the acquisition date Strm Gundersen has had operating revenue of noK 258 million and earnings before taxes of noK 32 million.  Pro forma 2011            If all of the acquisitions had been carried out by 1 January 2011, the AF Group would have had the following turnover and earnings before taxes for 2011: cont. note 4  100 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group Amounts in noK million  100 % 60 % Cash consideration for the sale 120 transaction costs -1 Net cash consideration for the sale 119 property, plant and equipment 539 323 Cash and cash equivalents 3 2 non-current interest-bearing liabilities -373 -224 Current interest-bearing liabilities -27 -16 trade payables -2 -1 Current tax payable -3 -2 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 137 82 Direct gains on the sale of business 37 latent gain on the remaining ownership interest from the sale of business, cf.

Since 1 october 2010 Johan rognerud AS has had operating revenue of noK  66 million and a profit for the year of noK 0 million in the consolidated income  statement.            on 1 April 2010 the AF Group acquired the remaining 50 % of the shares in  the property company Spalding Fastigheter KB. the company owns an indus- trial and office building in the Gothenburg area free of consideration.   Spalding has been classified as an associate earlier and consolidated in   accordance with the equity method.  on 26 october 2010 AF Milj AS acquired the remaining 50 % of the shares   in BA Gjenvinning AS. BA Gjenvinning AS has been consolidated earlier as   a joint venture in accordance with the gross method. If BA Gjenvinning had  been wholly owned for all of 2010 revenue would have been noK 10 million  higher and the profit for the year would have been noK 1 million lower. Sale of business in 2010:            on 11 november 2010 60 % of the shares in the wholly owned subsidiary Miljbase Vats AS was sold. As a result of this sale Miljbase Vats AS was reclassified  from a subsidiary to an associate in the Group.   101 Note 5  Operating and other revenue  Amounts in noK million  2011 2010 2009 Contract income   7,203  5,641 5,186 other sales revenue  11  12 17 revenue from projects for own account  54  98 110 Total operating revenue  7,268  5,751 5,314 rental income  15  14 17 other revenue  73  63 71 Total other revenue  88  77 87 Total operating and other revenue  7,356  5,828 5,401 cont. note 4 Changes in the groups structure in 2009: AF Gruppen norge AS spun off the business areas energy and environment   as separate companies owned by AF Gruppen ASA.

A total of 2,092,763 options     were subscribed for in the autumn of 2011, and the total number of outstand- ing options as at 31 December 2011 was 2,092,763. the option programme adopted in January 2008 was terminated in 2011.   the maximum number of options that could be granted was 12,500,000.   the option programme entailed annual allotment during the years 2008– 2010 and exercise of the options in 2011. A total of 5,163,750 options were   exercised on 15 February 2011. Guidelines for 2012 the Board will submit a statement to the General Meeting in accordance with  section 6-16a of the norwegian public limited Companies Act. the content of  this statement is explained below in accordance with section 7-31b, seventh  paragraph of the norwegian Accounting Act: Guidelines regarding fixed pay and other remuneration for senior executives  have been established. the Board of Directors establishes guidelines for the  remuneration of senior executives in consultation with the Ceo. the Ceos  fixed pay is set by the Board. Base pay is fixed in line with the market rates.  Base pay is adjusted annually as at 1 July based on an individual assessment.  Senior executives receive payments in kind and participate in the Groups re- tirement benefit schemes on the same terms as other employees as described  in the Groups personnel Guide.  there are no termination payment schemes. Bonuses for senior executives are based on the eVA (economic Value Added)  model. eVA is a method of calculating and analysing value creation in the  Group and in economic units below group level. Bonuses based on the eVA  model are linked to the Groups value creation during the financial year. If the  performance requirements are met, the bonus payment should represent 5-8  months pay. this is, however, not the absolute maximum limit. of the total  bonus earned, 25 % can be used to buy shares at a 20 % discount and the   remainder is paid in cash. Shares can be sold to senior executives, subject to the approval of the Board  of Directors at a 20 % discount on the prevailing market price. Shares are   offered to senior executives in the same way as to other employees. the General Meeting adopted a new option programme for the employees of  the AF Group on 13 May 2011. the maximum number of options that may be  allocated is 6,000,000, and the programme entails annual allotments for the  years 2011–13 and exercise of the options in 2014. the employees pay an op- tion premium of noK 1.00 per option, and the exercise price will be the aver- age market price before the subscription period. A total of 2,092,763 options  were subscribed for in the autumn of 2011, and the total number of outstand- ing options as at 31 December 2011 was 2,092,763. the option programme was devised by the Board, and it was to provide an   incentive for all the employees in the Group. the purpose of the programme  was to encourage long-term commitment and greater involvement in the  Groups activities. It is believed that the Groups future objectives will best   be achieved if the interests of the Group and its employees coincide.  the remuneration of senior executives in 2011 was in accordance with the  statement submitted to the General Meeting in 2011.  the AF Group has used Mertons model to value the options. the following assumptions were used in the model: 2011 2010 2009 expected dividend yield (%) 8.4 4.2 7.4 Historical volatility (%) 27.4 41.4 43.5 risk-free interest (%) 2.4 4.0 3.9 expected life of option (years) 3 1 2 Share price (noK) 45.6 31.8 27.0 payment for option (noK) 1.0 0.6 0.6 Reconciliation of options number of options as at 31 December 2010 5,251,250 options subscribed for in 2011 2,092,763 options exercised in 2011 -5,163,750 Adjustment for employees who have left -87,500 Number of options as at 31 December 2011 2,092,763  105 remuneration of the auditor is exclusive of value-added tax.

 1) projects in progress have a major impact on the calculation of deferred tax  and the current tax payable. projects in progress are valued at the direct   production cost and revenue is not recognised until completion.            2) the deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards are recognized on  the balance sheet when it is probable that the group can apply this against  future taxable income. the Group has failed to recognise deferred tax assets  on the balance sheet related to related to tax loss carryforwards in poland of  noK 6 million (noK 7 million in 2010 and noK 6 million in 2009). this tax loss  carryforward is time limited. the tax loss carryforward recognised on the   balance sheet is not time limited and totals noK 488 million (noK 151 million  in 2010 and noK 75 million in 2009).                      Deferred tax is not calculated on retained earnings in subsidiaries and associ- ates, since the companies are within the eu and earnings can be distributed  tax-free as dividends.

In this calculation the average number   of externally owned shares is adjusted to take into account the estimated   dilutive effect of the option programme. In 2011 there is no dilutive effect  since the exercise price is higher than the share price as at 31 December 2011. AF Group held 64,585 treasury shares as at 31 December 2011. treasury shares are not entitled to a dividend. Dividend per share        A dividend of noK 4.5 per share for the 2010 financial year, representing a to- tal of noK 346 million, was distributed on 23 May 2011. noK 2.0 of the divi- dend per share represented an ordinary dividend and noK 2.50 represents an  extraordinary dividend that was distributed to the companys strong financial  position.                  For the 2011 financial year, the Board proposes a dividend of noK 4.50 per  share. It is expected that the dividend will be paid to the shareholders on 24  May 2012. the dividend must be approved by the General Meeting, and there  is no provision for the liability on the balance sheet. the proposed dividend  will be paid to all shareholders registered with the norwegian Central Securities  Depository (VpS) on 11 May 2012. no dividend will be paid on the Companys  treasury shares. the total estimated dividend for the 2011 financial year is  noK 364 million.

Goodwill is mainly allocated to   business units. the allocation is shown in the summary below: Amounts in noK million 2011 2010 2009 AF Anlegg 11 11 - plplintar i Sverige AB 3 3 3 Total Civil Engineering 13 13 3 AF Bygg Gteborg AB 77 77 72 AF Bygg stfold 47 47 47 rogaland entreprenr AS 20 - - Strm Gundersen  820 - - Total Building 964 124 119 AF Decom AS 37 37 37 Total Environment 37 37 37 Aeron AS 186 186 186 AF energi & Miljteknikk AS 53 55 55 Mollier AS 31 29 29 Total Energy 271 271 271 Carrying amount as at 31 December 1,285 445 429 The principal assumptions used in the calculation of the recoverable amounts:  Norway 2011 2010 2009 Growth rate 1) 2.5 % 2.0 % 2.5 % WACC before tax 10.7 % 11.5 % 12.6 % Sweden Growth rate 1) 2.5 % 2.0 % 2.5 % WACC before tax 9.5 % 10.7 % 12.6 % Impairment tests for goodwill        the Group performs annual tests to assess whether the value of goodwill and intangible assets has been impaired. In the impairment test the book value is  measured against the recoverable amount from the cash-generating unit to which the asset is allocated. the recoverable amount from cash-generating units   is determined by calculation of the utility value. the utility value is calculated on the basis of discounting the anticipated future cash flows before tax with a   relevant discount rate (WACC) before tax that takes the term and risk into account. Different discount rates have been used for norwegian and Swedish   operations as a result of the differences in the risk-free interest rates and taxes.

In addition, it shows how recoverable  amounts change if the cash flow is reduced respectively by 10 % and 50 %.  If the index of estimated cash flows is less than 100, this indicates that the   recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount of the assets in the   impairment test, making a write-down of goodwill necessary. For example,  the table shows that a 50 % reduction in estimated cash flow will necessitate  the recognition of an impairment loss for the goodwill allocated to Strm  Gundersen, AF energi og Miljteknikk AS and Aeron AS. Sensitivity analysis for key assumptions        the calculated value of the individual cash-generating units exceeds the book  value with a relatively good margin at the end of 2011. Based on the existing  knowledge, the Companys management believes that moderate changes in  the key assumptions for the calculation of recoverable amounts will probably  not necessitate the recognition of an impairment loss.             a) Sensitivity analysis of discount rate (WACC)      the table below shows the relationship between the estimated recoverable  amount and the book value of the assets in the impairment test of the AF  Groups largest goodwill items.  the book value of the assets in the impair- ment test is expressed as an index of 100. In addition, it shows how the recov- erable amount changes if the discount rate (WACC) changes by respectively  100 and 500 basis points (i.e. 1 and 5 percentage points). All other factors are  held constant in the calculation.            If the index for the recoverable amount is less than 100, this indicates that   the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount of the assets in the   impairment test, making a write-down of goodwill necessary. For example,  the table shows that a 1 percentage point increase in the WACC will make it  necessary to recognise an impairment loss for the goodwill allocated to Aeron AS.

Insofar as they exist, management approved business plans for 2012  are also included in these calculations. Budgets and business plans are based on assumptions regarding, for example, the demand, cost of materials, cost of   labour and the overall competitive situation in the markets in which the AF Group operates. the assumptions made are based on managements experience   as well as external sources. Wage inflation of 4.7 % and a 2.0 % increase in the cost of materials are anticipated for all business units.  114 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group Company name Date  acquired            Business address City                               Country Direct  ownership Indirect  ownership Voting  share Business area AF Gruppen norge AS  05.09.85 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Civil engineering,   Building, property plplintar i Sverige AB 14.01.00 Sdertlje Sweden 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Civil engineering Johan rognerud AS 01.10.10 Jessheim norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Civil engineering AF Arctic AS 14.02.11 longyearbyen norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Civil engineering AF Bygg Gteborg AB  01.07.01 Gteborg Sweden 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building AF Bygg Syd AB 30.06.07 Halmstad Sweden 75.00 % 75.00 % 75.00 % Building SG Gruppen Kongsvinger AS 03.11.11 Kongsvinger norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building Strm Gundersen Holding AS 03.11.11 Drammen norway 84.50 % 84.50 % 84.50 % Building Strm Gundersen AS 03.11.11 Mjndalen norway 84.50 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building Haga & Berg Holding AS 03.11.11 Mjndalen norway 84.50 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building Haga & Berg entreprenr AS 03.11.11 oslo norway 50.70 % 60.00 % 60.00 % Building VSp Holding AS 03.11.11 Mjndalen norway 65.74 % 77.80 % 77.80 % Building Consolvo AS 03.11.11 tranby norway 65.74 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building Consolvo Support AS 03.11.11 tranby norway 39.44 % 60.00 % 60.00 % Building Consolvo overflate AS 03.11.11 tranby norway 33.53 % 51.00 % 51.00 % Building protector AS 03.11.11 tranby norway 65.74 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building Consolvo eiendom AS 03.11.11 tranby norway 65.74 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building protector Cpe AB 03.11.11 Gteborg Sweden 55.88 % 85.00 % 85.00 % Building protector KKS GmbH 03.11.11 remsekk Germany 65.74 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building Corroteam AS 03.11.11 Mjndalen norway 59.15 % 70.00 % 70.00 % Building MtH AS 03.11.11 Mjndalen norway 48.92 % 67.00 % 67.00 % Building thorendahl AS 03.11.11 oslo norway 48.92 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building oslo Stillasutleie AS 03.11.11 oslo norway 48.92 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building Storo Blikkenslagerverksted AS 03.11.11 oslo norway 34.25 % 70.00 % 70.00 % Building ulf W Jacobsen AS 03.11.11 oslo norway 34.25 % 100.00 % 100.00 % Building AF rogaland entreprenr AS 15.11.11 Stavanger norway 56.80 % 56.80 % 56.80 % Building Kilen Bygg AS 25.05.04 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % property Kilen Brygge AS 15.03.05 Sandefjord norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % property Kirkeveien utbyggingsselskap AS 01.07.06 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % property rolvsrud utbygging AS 31.10.08 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % property rolvsrud Bygg AS 31.10.08 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % property Kilen Boliger AS 31.08.10 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % property Kilen Hyhus AS 31.08.10 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % property palmer Gotheim Skiferbrudd AS 01.01.07 oppdal norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % environment AF Group polska Sp.z.o.o. 24.10.07 Warszawa poland 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % environment AF Decom AB 15.12.07 Gteborg Sweden 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % environment AF Milj AS 01.01.09 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % environment AF Decom AS  01.01.09 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % environment AF Decom offshore AS  01.01.09 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % environment Vici Ventus Construction AS 08.12.09 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % environment AF Decom offshore uK ltd. 24.05.10 london england 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % environment BA Gjenvinning AS 01.11.10 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % environment AF energi & Miljteknikk AS  31.05.06 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % energy AF entech AS 02.04.09 oslo norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % energy Mollier AS  12.10.07 Sandnes norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % energy Aeron AS  01.07.08 Flekkefjord norway 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % energy Aeron energy technologies ltd. 16.11.09 Shanghai China 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % energy rCo2 AS 21.12.09 langhus norway 94.80 % 94.80 % 94.80 % energy Note 15  Subsidiaries  115 Company Acquisition   date Business  address Ownership   interest Voting share Business area Kjrbokollen AS 02.09.99 Brum, norway 50 % 50 % property rebekksstranda AS 30.01.06 rde, norway 50 % 50 % property Karlstadgata utbygging AnS 29.04.05 oslo, norway 50 % 50 % property Note 16  Joint ventures  Amounts in noK million 2011 2010 2009 non-current assets - - 4 Current assets 2 3 7 non-current liabilities - - -2 Current liabilities -5 - -4 Net assets -3 3 5 revenues - 11 17 expenses -5 -13 -17 Profit before tax -5 -2 - the table below shows the Groups share (50%) of assets and liabilities, sales and profit before tax of the investments in joint ventures.

Defined-contribution plan  A defined-contribution pension scheme for all employees born in or after  1952 or employed in or after 2003 has been established for the Groups   employees in norway. the contributions constitute 4 % of pay between 1G   [G is the national Insurance base amount] and 6G and 8 % of pay between   6G and 12G, with the employees paying 2 % of their pay up to a maximum   of half of the contribution. Contributions to defined-contribution schemes   are recognised in the income statement in the year to which they apply.    Defined-benefit pension plan  the Group has a collective pension scheme for employees born in or before  1951 that is defined as a defined-benefit plan. the scheme only covers retire- ment pensions. the plan aims to pay benefits of 60 % of the pay level up to  12G [G is the national Insurance base amount] at retirement. this benefit level  is based on a 30-year qualification period. the retirement age is 67 and there  is a 15-year payment period. parts of the retirement benefit payments are  covered by the norwegian national Insurance Scheme and payments expect- ed from this scheme. the rest is funded through accumulated reserves in in- surance companies. At the end of 2011 there were 56 (74) active participants  and 97 (91) pensioners in the scheme.     In addition, AF Gruppen norge AS has participated in the norwegian Federa- tion of trade unions (lo)/norwegian Confederation of norwegian enterprise  (nHo) scheme under which employees were entitled to early retirement   pension (AFp) from the age of 62. A decision was made in this company to  discontinue this scheme in February 2010, and it was only possible to retire  early in accordance with the old scheme until 31 December 2010. there is a  remaining provision covering the companys co-payment, which is 25 %, to  individuals who retired early under the old scheme. Future liabilities associat- ed with this scheme are funded through revenues from operations and are  unfunded. In addition, there are two other companies in the Group that are  members in the scheme, and they have a total of 167 active participants   covered by the scheme. At the end of the year the Group had 44 (48) contrac- tual early retirement pensioners. the expense for the year and future liabilities  associated with this scheme have been included in the statement below.     A significant shortfall was identified when the old contractual early retirement  pension scheme was terminated. this shortfall will have to be covered by the  member companies continuing to pay premiums for the next five years. the  companys share of this shortfall has been estimated and provision has been  made for it in the accounts. See note 28 provisions.     A new contractual retirement scheme was established to replace the old  scheme. the new contractual retirement scheme is, as opposed to the old  scheme, not an early retirement scheme, but a scheme that pays a lifelong  supplement to an ordinary pension. the employees can choose to start   drawing on this retirement scheme from the age of 62, even while working,  and it offers entitlement to additional benefits if the employees work until   the age of 67. the new contractual retirement scheme is a defined benefit  multi-company pension scheme, and it is financed through premiums that  are defined as a percentage of the employees salary. At present there is no   reliable measurement and allocation of the liabilities and funds in the  scheme. In the accounts this scheme is treated as a defined contribution   pension scheme in which the premium payments are recognised as costs   on an ongoing basis, and no provisions are set aside in the accounts. the   premium will be fixed at 1.4% of the total payments between 1G and 7.1G to  the companys employees. there are no accumulated reserves in the scheme,  and it is expected that the level of premiums will rise over the coming years. All the employees in Sweden are members of two defined-benefit multi-  company schemes that are recognised as defined-contribution schemes in  the accounts (see note on accounting policies). this scheme covers 183 (189)  persons. Note 25  Retirement benefits *) exclusive of social security costs the retirement benefit expense for the year is based on financial assumptions at the start of the year, while the balance sheet status is based on financial   assumptions at the end of the year.  122 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group cont. note 25 Amounts in noK million 2011 2010 2009 Retirement benefit obligations and plan assets Funded Unfunded Total Funded Unfunded Total Funded Unfunded Total Change in gross retirement benefit obligations Gross retirement benefit obligations as at   1 January  78 8 87 83 3 86 80 2 83 present value of benefits earned during the year 3 - 3 3 - 3 3 - 3 Interest expense on retirement benefit obligations 2 - 2 5 - 5 3 - 3 Actuarial losses/(gains) -3 - -3 -8 6 -2 - 2 2 retirement benefit payments, excl. social   security costs -4 -3 -7 -3 -2 -5 -4 -1 -5 pBo discrepancy, change due to change in data - 1 1 - - - - - - Gross retirement benefit obligations as at   31 December 76 6 81 79 7 86 83 3 86 Change in gross plan assets Fair value of plan assets as at 1 January 88 - 88 93 - 93 86 - 86 expected return on plan assets 4 - 4 5 - 5 5 - 5 Actuarial (losses)/gains -6 - -6 -9 - -9 - - - premium payments  4 - 4 3 - 3 6 - 6 retirement benefit payments -4 - -4 -3 - -3 -4 - -4 Fair value of plan assets as at 31 December 86 - 86 88 - 88 93 - 93   net retirement benefit obligations -10 6 -4 -10 7 -2 -9 3 -7 Social security costs 1 1 - 1 1 - - - unrecognised actuarial gains or losses -8 -5 -13 -5 -7 -13 -5 -2 -7 Net book retirement benefit obligations   (assets) as at 31 December -18 2 -16 -15 1 -14 -14 1 -13 Actual return on plan assets  -2 - -2 -4 - -4 5 - 5 expected premium payment for next year 4 - 4 3 - 3 4 - 4 expected benefit payments for next year -4 -2 -6 -3 -2 -5 -4 -1 -5 Change in obligations net book retirement benefit obligations as at   1 January -15 2 -13 -14 1 -13 -10 2 -8 retirement benefit expense recognised in the  income statement  2 3 5 3 2 5 2 1 3 premium payments, incl. social security costs -5 - -5 -3 - -3 -6 - -6 retirement benefit payments, unfunded schemes - -4 -4 - -2 -2 - -2 -2 Net book retirement benefit obligations   (assets) as at 31 December -18 2 -16 -15 1 -14 -14 1 -13 Book retirement benefit obligations as at   31 December - 2 2 - 1 1 - 1 1 Book plan assets as at 31 December 18 1 18 15 - 15 14 - 14 Development 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Gross retirement benefit obligations as at 31 December 82 86 86 83 85 76 Fair value of plan assets as at 31 December -86 -88 -93 -86 -75 -74 net retirement benefit obligations as at 31 December, excl. social security costs -4 -2 -7 -3 9 2 Actuarial (losses)/gains on retirement benefit obligations 4 2 -2 4 -7 - Actuarial (losses)/gains on plan assets -6 -9 - -3 -5 2 othe above information was determined prospectively.                  123 cont. note 25 Assumptions for actuarial calculations 31.12.2011 31.12.10 31.12.09 Discount rate 3.30 % 3.20 % 4.40 % return on plan assets * 4.80 % 4.60 % 5.60 % pay inflation 3.50 % 3.50 % 4.00 % Adjustment of national Insurance base amount (G) 3.75 % 3.75 % 4.00 % Adjustment of retirement benefits 0.70 % 0.50 % 1.30 % turnover 10.00 % 10.00 % 10.00 % Disability ** ** ** *)  Based on historical return realised by norwegian life insurance companies.  **) K2005 adjusted for observed development.                    2011                 2010                2009 Estimated life expectancy  Men  Women Men  Women Men  Women Age 65 84.28 86.84 84.28 86.84 82.60 84.89 Age 45 82.40 85.58 82.40 85.58 77.10 82.42 Age 40 82.24 85.47 82.24 85.47 76.76 82.18 Distribution of plan assets by investment category 31.12.11 31.12.10 31.12.09 equities 17.70 % 13.6 % 7.0 % property 17.30 % 19.0 % 21.0 % non-current bonds 41.30 % 43.1 % 45.0 % Current bonds 20.50 % 22.7 % 26.0 % other 3.20 % 1.6 % 1.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Amounts in noK million   Effective interest rate 2011 2010 2009 Bank overdraft 1) 6.8 % 9 6 - Mortgage loans 5.0 % 80 16 50 Financial lease liabilities 3.5 % 19 19 35 other loans 5.7 % 21 31 10 Total interest-bearing loans and credit facilities 129 72 95 Classification on the balance sheet: Current liabilities non-current liabilities 39 23 73 total interest-bearing loans and credit facilities 90 49 22 129 72 95 Maturity structure: Liabilities maturing within 1 year liabilities maturing in between 1 and 5 years 39 23 73 liabilities maturing in more than 5 years 83 34 22 total 7 15 - Sum 129 72 95 Note 26  Interest-bearing loans   and credit facilities 1)  At the end of 2011 the Group had an unutilised bank overdraft facility linked to a corporate cash pooling system of noK 555 million (546 million).

In connection with the sale of Miljbase Vats a new long-term lease was   entered into between Miljbase Vats and AF Decom offshore AS to regulate  the lease agreement concerning the environmental base facility at Vats. the  lease was entered into on 31 August 2010, is non-terminable and runs until   1 July 2025. the rental fee is noK 47 million, excl. VAt per year. the table   above includes 100 % of the lease liabilities related to Miljbase Vats,   however, the AF Group owns 40 % of the company.   Some of the assets leased under non-terminable operating leases are sub- leased. the figures for non-terminable leases are shown net of deductions   for sublease income. non-terminable operating leases are agreed for an   average period of 5–10 years for offices and 3–5 years for machinery. lease  agreements ordinarily contain a right to extend the term of the lease. For   offices leases, the agreements normally contain a clause for renewal at   market rent once the minimum term expires.     An expense of noK 376 million (274 million) has been recognised in the  Groups consolidated income statement for operating leases for 2011,   including noK 102 million (94 million) for rented premises. operating leases  primarily consist of rented premises under non-terminable leases, machine  hire under non-terminable leases, and short-term terminable leases for   machinery and equipment.  126 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group Amounts in noK million  Note 2011 2010 2009 trade payables 1,498 455 686 public liabilities 129 92 73 prepayments from customers 20 592 237 305 Accrued holiday pay, incl. social security costs 150 134 131 Accruals and other current liabilities  182 570 520 Total trade payables and non-interest-bearing liabilities 2,551 1,488 1,715 Note 29  Trade payables and   non-interest-bearing liabilities trade payables and other current liabilities consist primarily of liabilities linked to purchases, advances on construction contracts, employee benefits, value-  added tax and other public liabilities.

Further  quantitative information is included elsewhere in the consolidated financial  statements.              the Board has the overall responsibility for establishing and supervising the  Groups risk management framework. risk management principles have been  established in order to identify and analyse the risk to which the Group is   exposed, set limits for acceptable risk and relevant controls, monitor risk, and  comply with the limits. risk management principles and systems are reviewed  regularly to reflect changes in activities and the market conditions. through  training, standards and procedures for risk management, the Group aims to  develop a disciplined and constructive environment of control, in which   every employee understands his/her roles and duties.              the Group uses financial instruments, such as bank loans and settlement  agreements, in connection with the acquisition of companies. the purpose   of these financial instruments is to raise capital for investments needed for   the Groups activities. the Group also has financial instruments such as trade  receivables, trade payables, forward commodity and exchange contracts,   etc., which are directly linked to the day-to-day operation of the business.               (1) Credit risk            Credit risk is handled at the Group level. the management has established  guidelines to ensure that the granting of credit and exposure to credit risk are  monitored continuously. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or  counterparty to a financial instrument does not manage to fulfil his contractual  obligations. Credit risk is usually a consequence of the Groups trade receivables.  there are also credit risks linked to transactions with derivatives and deposits  in banks and financial institutions.             Trade and other receivables  the Groups exposure to credit risk related to trade and other receivables is  principally affected by individual circumstances relating to a particular   customer. other circumstances, such as the demographics of the customer  base, geographical factors, etc. have little effect on the credit risk.  Note 30  Financial risk and   financial instruments  127 the amounts in the balance sheet are net of provisions for anticipated losses.  provision is made for losses when there is objective evidence that a credit risk  can be expected to result in a loss. If a credit risk is identified on the contract  date, the Company will ask for a bank guarantee as security for payment in   accordance with the contract.               the Groups largest customers are the norwegian public roads Administra- tion, Statoil, and other oil companies on the norwegian Continental Shelf.  these customers are either government agencies or they have high interna- tional credit rankings, and the management believes that the credit risk these  customer represent is minimal. In accordance with the norwegian standard  for building and construction contracts, the customer must provide security  for 10 to 17.5 % of the contract price for fulfilment of his contractual obliga- tions. the contractor is not obligated to start work on a contract before he   receives security from the customer.               the remaining credit risk of the Group is spread over a large number of   contract partners and homebuyers. Homebuyers always pay a deposit of at  least 10 % of the purchase price when entering into a purchase contract.   the Company has a vendors fixed charge on sold residential housing units.  the credit risk is spread over a large number of homebuyers and is considered  low. cont. note 30 Amounts in noK million 2011 2010 2009 Trade receivables – age distribution 1–30 days overdue 357 107 100 31–60 days overdue 53 26 37 61–90 days overdue 41 62 16 91–120 days overdue 40 3 11 More than 120 days overdue 88 114 168 Total receivables overdue, but not written down 579 312 332 receivables not yet due 914 683 602 Trade receivables on the balance sheet 1,493 995 934 Age distribution 2011 Not yet due  1–30 31–60 61–90 91–120  >120 Total trade receivables, gross 914 357 54 41 41 100 1,507 provision for losses - - -1 - -1 -12 -14 Trade receivables on the balance sheet 914 357 53 41 40 88 1,493 Maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of trade receivables on the balance sheet date according to age: A relatively large proportion of trade receivables are more than 120 days   overdue. this is linked to the complexity of the final account for the projects.  the final account lists all the work performed under the contract against the  contract prices. In addition, the actual work performed will normally include  items that are not described in the contract, and the parties have to reach an  agreement on how to calculate the price and quantity of such items. this  work normally takes several months and, in the case of complex contracts,  can take up to a year. Impairment due to unwillingness or inability to pay   is rare. Changes in the value of receivables are primarily due to changes in   project revenue estimates and are entered as an adjustment of the project  revenue.              Cash, cash equivalents and money market investments    Investments in money market funds, certificates, etc., are permitted only in  the case of liquid securities and only with counterparties with good credit- worthiness. the credit risk linked to cash and cash equivalents is limited, as  the counterparties are banks with a high credit ranking that is assessed and  published by international credit rating institutes such as Moodys and   Standard & poors. the strict creditworthiness requirements mean that   counterparties are expected to fulfil their obligations.  128 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group Amounts in noK million 2011 2010 2009 Financial assets with a variable interest rate 579 652 279 Financial liabilities with a variable interest rate -129 -72 -95 Net financial receivables 450 580 185 effect of a 100 basis point increase in rates on the profit after tax 3 4 1 effect of a 100 basis point increase in rates on the profit after tax -3 -4 -1 (2) Market risk              (2.1) Interest rate risk           the Group is exposed to interest rate risk for building activities and, especially  for, home building for own account, in which the general interest rate level  will have an impact on the saleability of completed homes and consequently  the Groups tied-up capital. the Group endeavours to minimise this risk by   requiring advance sales of housing units and deposits from homebuyers.   See the description in note 19 – projects for own account for further informa- tion. the AF Groups financing is based on variable interest rates and the  Group is, therefore, exposed to interest rate risk. the Group does not have   any fixed interest rate agreements. See the description in note 26 – Interest- bearing loans and credit facilities for further information.             the Group does not use derivatives to hedge the effective interest rate   exposure.             Sensitivity to interest rate changes        the Group is exposed to an interest rate risk with respect to assets and   liabilities with a variable interest rate. the table illustrates the effect of   a change in the interest rate by 100 basis points on the profit after tax.   the  analysis assumes that other variables remain constant. (2.2) Currency risk and scrap steel price risk       the Group operates in several countries and is exposed to currency risks in  several currencies. the Group has 91 % (90 %) of its revenues and expenses in  noK, 9 % (8 %) in SeK and 0 % (2 %) in other currencies. the Groups currency  risk is limited therefore primarily to fluctuations in the exchange rate between  noK and SeK. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transac- tions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign opera- tions. the companies in the AF Group make most of their purchases in their  respective functional currencies. In 2011 the net foreign exchange gain was  noK 0 million (6 million).              the Group is exposed to price risk from the sale of scrap steel recycled from  the demolition of steel structures in the north Sea. Scrap steel prices are  hedged by forward contracts. the Groups policy is to hedge scrap steel prices  in noK for around 75 % of the coming years expected sales of scrap steel.               the management has issued guidelines that require Group companies to  manage their currency and price risk for scrap steel. In order to manage the  currency and price risk from future commercial transactions and recognised  assets and liabilities, Group entities use forward exchange and scrap steel  contracts. cont. note 30 Amounts in noK million 2011 2010 2009 Financial assets Non-current assets Interest-bearing receivables 19 23 44 other receivables - 1 1 Current assets trade and non-interest-bearing financial receivables 1,754 1,052 1,173 Interest-bearing receivables 103 6 12 Cash and cash equivalents 458 623 223 Maximum credit exposure 2,334 1,705 1,453 the tables below show the maximum credit exposure. the maximum credit exposure corresponds to book value.  129 cont. note 30 Fair value of forward contracts entered into as at 31 December:                                                 Current assets/(current liabilities) Amounts in noK million 2011 2010 2009 Forward currency contracts 1 7 - Forward commodity contracts -7 - -                                         Current assets/(current liabilities) Amounts in noK million 2011 2010 2009 effect of a 10 % appreciation of noK in relation to all the currencies on the profit after tax -6 -4 10 effect of a 10 % weakening of noK in relation to all the currencies on the profit after tax 6 4 -10 Amounts in noK million 2011 2010 2009 Effect on profit after tax effect of a 10 % appreciation of noK in relation to all the currencies on the profit after tax -1 6 1 effect of a 10 % weakening of noK in relation to all the currencies on the profit after tax 1 -6 -1 Effect on equity effect of a 10 % appreciation of noK in relation to all the currencies on the equity -15 -14 -15 effect of a 10 % weakening of noK in relation to all the currencies on the equity 15 14 15 Sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations              Receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies      the AF Group has raised loans and has deposits in eur, GBp, uSD and SeK.  net bank deposits and receivables in foreign currencies other than the   functional currency are exposed to an exchange rate risk and result  in a foreign exchange gain or loss in the event of exchange rate fluctuations.  the table illustrates the effect of a change in the exchange rates by 10 % on  the profit after tax. the analysis assumes that other variables remain constant.  Changes related to the translation of the profit after tax     the book profit after tax for foreign companies is translated to noK based on  the average rate during the financial year and balance sheet items are trans- lated at the rate in effect on the date of the balance sheet. the table shows  how the profit after tax and equity will be affected by a fluctuation of 10 %   in all the exchange rates. the analysis assumes that other variables remain  constant. (2.3) Other price risks           the Group is exposed to a price risk related to investments on the Groups   balance sheet classified as available for sale or as assets at fair value through  profit or loss. Financial assets exposed to a price risk totalled noK 2 million   (3 million) as at 31 December 2011.               (3) Liquidity risk            liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to service its financial  obligations when they are due. the Groups strategy for handling liquidity risk  is to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents at all times in order to fulfil its  financial obligations when due without risking unacceptable losses or dam- aging its reputation. All companies in the AF Group are linked to a corporate  cash pooling system. Surplus liquidity in the consolidated account beyond  what constitutes the necessary working capital is managed by the companys  finance function. Surplus liquidity is mainly placed in money market funds.  the management monitors cash and cash equivalents on a weekly basis, and  each month the Corporate Management team reviews the liquidity of the  projects. At the end of the year the Group had an unutilised bank overdraft   facility linked to the corporate cash pooling system of noK 555 million   (546 million). Assuming that additional collateral is furnished, AF had unused  credit lines for bank loans, including overdraft facilities, of noK 900 million  (900) at the end of 2011.

For a description of the terms and conditions related to collateral, see   further details in note 35. 1) Customers and non-interest-bearing receivables, cash and cash   equivalents and trade payables, and other non-interest-bearing   liabilities  the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other non- interest-bearing receivables, and trade payables and other non-interest-bear- ing liabilities is regarded as equal to the carrying amount based on a short  time horizon for financial instruments of this type. Interest-free customer and  supplier credit is discounted to the present value if there is a significant differ- ence between the carrying amount and fair value. the assessed value of loans  and receivables is net after provisions for bad debt. long-term receivables  with variable interest rates are valued by the Group based on interest rates,  market risk, individual credit ratings and other risk factors linked to the indi- vidual financial instrument. All interest-bearing receivables have a variable in- terest rate. no significant discrepancies between the carrying amount and fair  value have been identified based on the valuations made.                   2) Interest-bearing loans and credit facilities      the fair value of interest-bearing loans and credit facilities is estimated by   using future cash flows that are based on the current market interest rates  and the remaining term. All interest-bearing liabilities have a variable interest  rate. loans are included at fair value when they are recognised on the balance  sheet for the first time. no discrepancies between the carrying amount and  fair value have been identified based on the valuations made.                  3) Financial assets available for sale, financial derivatives and financial  assets at fair value through profit or loss        Financial assets available for sale, financial derivatives and financial assets at  fair value through profit or loss have been assessed at fair value in accordance  with the valuation hierarchy, levels 1 to 3, in IFrS 7.      level 1 – Quoted prices in an active market for an asset or liability  level 2 – Valuation derived directly or indirectly from quoted prices   within level 1            level 3 – Valuation based on inputs not obtained from observable markets.

It is expected that a new agreement will be entered into no later  than May 2012. At the end of 2011 the AF Group had utilised noK 555 million  (546 million) of the limit through an unutilised bank overdraft facility linked  to a corporate cash pooling system. Assuming that additional collateral is   furnished, AF had unused credit lines for bank loans, including overdraft   facilities, of noK 900 million (900) at the end of 2011 in accordance with the  agreement with Handelsbanken. the agreement with Handelsbanken contains financial covenants. the most  important covenants dictate an equity ratio > 20 % and net interest-bearing  debt < 4* eBItDA.  All of the conditions of the loan agreement that relate to the overdraft facility  and loan limit were met at the end of 2011, 2010 and 2009. the following table illustrates changes in the financial instruments classified within the level 3 valuation hierarchy as at 31 December:  134 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts group Note 33  Related parties the Groups related parties consist of associates (note 17), joint ventures (note  16), the Companys shareholders and members of the Board of Directors and  Corporate Management team.                oBoS Forretningsbygg AS and Aspelin ramm Gruppen AS have major share- holdings in the AF Group and are also important business partners.

At the  end of 2011, the AF Group is only involved in the following lawsuits of any  significance:             Kilen Brygge AS, a company in the AF Group, filed a suit against Kilen Hotell  AS and the guarantors in 2011 for breach of contract with respect to the sale  of a hotel site. Kilen Brygge AS won the case in the District Court and was  awarded noK 11 million plus costs. the case has been appealed by Kilen  Hotell AS and the guarantors.      In 2011 the Municipality of Brum filed a suit against Kjrbokollen utbygging  AS, a joint venture owned 50% by the AF Group, claiming that a road be built  in connection with the residential development. the Municipality of Brum  won the case in Brum District Court and Kjrbokollen utbygging   AS was ordered to pay noK 9 million (AF Groups share is noK 5 million) to  the Municipality of Brum. the case has been appealed by Kjrbokollen  utbygging AS.          the following matters mentioned in the annual report for 2010 have been  concluded in 2011:      raunes Fiskefarm filed a suit against AF Gruppen norge in connection with  the expansion of the Vats Disposal Yard. on 8 october 2009 the Haugaland  District Court delivered a judgment in the case and ordered AF to pay noK  40 million in compensation. this judgment was appealed by both parties to  the Court of Appeal and a new judgment was handed down by the Gulating  Court of Appeal on 25 February 2011. In the Court of Appeal the AF Group  was ordered to pay noK 6 million in compensation. raunes Fiskefarm was  ordered to pay noK 3 million to AF in costs. raunes Fiskefarm appealed the  judgment, but the case was dismissed by the Supreme Court. the judgment  from the Gulating Court of Appeal will therefore remain in effect.      In March 2011, the AF Group and Krger AS filed a suit against the Municipal- ity of oslo in connection with the settlement for the construction of the oset  water treatment plant. the case was resolved through negotiation in 2011.

(regulations relating to the simplified application of international accounting  standards, chapter 4, laid down by the Ministry of Finance on 21 January 2008).  these regulations can be used by any entities that are required to keep accounts,  both company accounts and consolidated accounts, unless they are required  to use the full IFrS. the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with  the International Financial reporting Standards (IFrS).

Accounting principles that are only relevant for the parent Company  or deviate from the consolidated financial statements are as follows: 1.1 Shares in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are valued in accordance with the cost method in the parent  Company accounts. the investment is valued at the historical cost of the  shares unless a write-down of the shares has been necessary. they are written  down to fair value in the event of an impairment in value that is attributed   to causes that cannot be expected to be of a temporary nature and must be  regarded as necessary in accordance with the generally accepted accounting  principles. Write-downs are reversed when the basis for the write-down no  longer exists. 1.2 Dividends and group contributions entities that are required to keep accounts and prepare company accounts in  accordance with the regulations pursuant to section 3.9 of the norwegian   Accounting Act may, regardless of other provisions in these regulations,   recognise dividends and group contributions in accordance with the provisions  of the norwegian Accounting Act. this means that dividends and group con- tributions received and paid by the parent company will be recognised the  year prior to when they are received or the payment is adopted. the same   applies to any tax effect of such transactions. the Company has not had any operating revenue.  142 AF Group AnnuAl report 2011 Annual accounts AF Gruppen ASA Amounts in noK million 2011 2010 2009 Group contributions received 111 202 53 Dividends from subsidiaries - 203 - Total 111 405 53 Amounts in noK 1,000 Remuneration of the CEO  2011 2010 2009 Fixed pay 2,884 2,645 2,286 Bonus 1,749 2,066 1,503 other benefits 80 1,142 91 Total 4,713 5,853 3,879 retirement benefits 34 33 31 Benefit from purchase of options 1,911 Directors fees 1,505 1,389 1,210 Note 3  Dividend and group contribution Note 4  Lnnskostnad, ln og honorarer AF Gruppen ASA has no employees, and the Company is not required, therefore, to have a pension scheme. the Ceo is employed formally by the subsidiary   AF Gruppen norge AS.

The purpose of our business is to create value for our custom- ers, owners, employees, suppliers and society. Our attractive- ness is demonstrated by how we create and manage value. Purpose, objectives and values is intended to provide a brief  outline of who we are, what we stand for and what we want  to achieve. To achieve our objectives, all our employees must  have a clear understanding of what is expected from their  work. The objectives set out in this booklet are therefore the  basis for all the subsidiary objectives developed at every level  of the group.  The history of AF Group is one of a value-based corporate  culture. Our core values have their roots in the period before  AF Group was founded in 1986 and have changed little over  the years. These represent the bedrock of our business and we  expect all our employees to identify and comply with them. We hope that an appreciation of our purpose, objectives and  values will provide inspiration and confidence in our joint  eff orts to develop AF Group further. If we steer our organisation  towards challenging tasks and objectives, our business will,  over time, retain and improve its position on the market and  continue to generate value growth based on our core values.

This reputation  is affected every day by the conduct of every single  employee.  AF Group has enjoyed an untarnished reputation ever since  the company was founded. There have been no sanctions  by public bodies or qualifications in auditors reports and  no feedback from customers or inspectors alleging price  fixing. The company has an AA credit rating. This is all thanks  to the employees and their ethics, good conduct and  competitiveness.  AF Group is a rapidly expanding group. Growth and  profitability are dependent on a constant commitment to  uncovering any faults or defects in our services or products.  We have to deal with them in accordance with contracts,  standards and internal requirements so as to satisfy the  customer.   5 Our competitiveness and place in society begins and ends  with our reliability. We therefore ask all our employees  to follow this code of conduct, and to think and act in  accordance with our core values. Managers at AF Group have a general responsibility to exercise  leadership that creates a culture in which good conduct is  recognised, valued and conformed to by employees. The code  of of conduct must be used in organisational development  processes to establish such a culture, generate commitment  and develop competence. We have reason to be proud of the group we have created.  However, what has been built up over many years can be  demolished by a single event. We therefore need to be  uncompromising when it comes to following this code of  conduct and acting in accordance with our core values. May 2008  Corporate Management Team   6 Employee declaration The code of conduct contains  the rules that AF Group lives by  and must be understood and  followed by all employees.  If my convictions change and  come into conflict with the code  of conduct or core values, I will  accept the consequences and  leave the group.  7 	 All	employees	and	everyone	who	works	for	the	company	 and wholly owned subsidiaries 	 All	employees	of	companies	in	which	AF	Group	owns	a	 share of 50 per cent or more, or employees in companies in  which AF Group has a controlling interest 	 All	employees	in	integrated	working	partnerships	in	Norway 	 Third	parties	who	are	contracted	to	AF	Group.

Disciplinary measures can include  everything from a verbal warning to dismissal. Only the  Corporate Management Team and business unit managers  can terminate employment or dismiss someone.  Examples of actions that can lead to sanctions: 	 Breaching	the	code	of	conduct 	 Asking	other	people	to	breach	the	code 	 Failing	to	report	a	breach	of	the	code 	 Reprisals	against	another	employee	for	reporting	a	breach	 of the code 	 Failure	to	exercise	visible	leadership	to	ensure	that	the	code	 is complied with In the case of third parties, sanctions can include the exclusion  of individuals, a reduction in payment and cancellation of the  contract. Sanctions for breaching   the code of conduct  11 You must contribute to a working environment where  there is no prejudice, discrimination, verbal abuse or per- secution based on race, skin colour, religion, nationality,  gender, sexual orientation, age or disability. Handle recruitment, appointments, training, pay, promotion,  punishment and other working conditions without regard to  friendship and a persons race, skin colour, religion, nationality,  gender, sexual orientation, age or disability. Activities that do not promote a good working environment  must not occur. This includes threats, violent conduct and the  distribution, sale, possession and use of illegal drugs. No one must attend work under the influence of alcohol or  other intoxicants. We consider it inappropriate for spouses/partners to work  in the same department. Connected persons may not work  under the same manager.  Nor must connected persons have jobs with AF Group where  one checks the others work, or where the jobs are otherwise  incompatible.  You	must	strive	for	open,	honest	communication	and	not	 belittle other employees. AF Group must be both large and  small. We must battle every day to maintain the informal, lively  and simple style of our own small organisational unit, while  exploiting our shared strength as a group. Working environment  12 AF Groups reputation is your responsibility. You represent  AF Group in relation to customers, suppliers, employee  representatives, shareholders, the authorities and  colleagues in commercial and social contexts. You must  conduct yourself in a manner that inspires trust and is  compatible with the code of conduct and our core values. The morality and conscience of the company are represented  by its employees and the management in particular. Morality  and conscience are also a consequence of the maturity  produced by collective processes. When you meet other  people, you must always be aware of this. Its taken for granted that you must be loyal to AF Group  whatever the situation. Loyalty must not, however, be a barrier  to open communication and discussion internally, even when  criticism is involved. Once a decision has been taken, it must  be implemented quickly, loyally and effectively AF Group respects you as an individual, your private life and  Personal conduct  13 your dignity. However, if the company discovers that your  conduct at or outside work is having a negative impact on  your performance, the performance of other employees or  the companys interests, your conduct may become a matter  for AF Group.  If you are responsible for storing personal information  about other employees or have been given access to such  information, you must make sure that it is not passed on  unintentionally or misused. Employees, or anyone in the  process of being employed, who have a directorship or similar  position of trust or intending to take up such a position in  other companies/businesses, have a duty in such cases to  inform the company of this so that any problems connected  with loyalty and integrity can be addressed and resolved.  15 You may not receive or buy benefits-in-kind, including  services, from AF Group. 	 Buying	a	home	is	an	exception.	The	development	and	 construction of housing for sale for our own benefit is an  ongoing activity for the company. Employees with   AF Group may buy a home in such developments on the  same terms as external buyers. The following rules apply: 	 The	purchase	may	not	be	financed	by	AF	Group 	 Senior	staff	and	line	managers	who	are	involved	in	the	 development,	marketing	and	sale	of	own-account	projects	 may	only	buy	a	home	with	the	prior	consent	of	the	 Corporate	Management	Team. 	 Buying	work	clothing	and	items	advertising	AF	Group	is	an	 exception. Such items may be purchased in accordance with  the current arrangements in the company 	 Gifts	and	tokens	of	esteem	from	AF	Group	in	accordance	 with the provisions of the Personnel Guide are an exception 	 The	purchase	of	condemned	goods	is	an	exception.	Goods	that	 have been condemned are made available for purchase. The  price is fixed by the project manager 	 Goods	made	by	AF	Group	that	are	freely	available	for	 purchase on the open market are an exception. Such goods  may be sold to employees at a price that conforms to AF  Groups standard price list. Note that only goods may be  sold, not services Personal finances  16 You	may	make	private	purchases	through	AF	Groups	suppliers.	 The relevant invoicing will be no concern of AF Group. Employees may not take part in business activities that com- pete with, supply goods or services to or are directly linked  with the companys operations. Where this is a problem, the  employee has a duty to raise the matter with the Corporate  Management Team.  Competition We must comply with current legislation and regulations  regarding competition. You	must	not	have	discussions,	make	suggestions	or	enter	 into agreements with competitors - direct or indirect, formal  or informal, written or verbal - in respect of competitive factors  between AF Group and competitors when selling to third  parties.  17 Statutes, regulations, standards and specifications are  framework conditions that AF Group must comply with.  Our business units and projects must be planned and  implemented in accordance with statutory requirements  in the respective countries. We make the necessary arrangements for tradesmen and  production workers to be organised. It is a matter of principle  at AF Group to abide by all collective agreements entered into. You	must	conscientiously	comply	with	the	standards,	 procedures, instructions and work tasks given to you by  your superior if they are in accordance with your terms of  employment. Even if an action or omission leads to positive results for AF  Group, the result will not be accepted if it is achieved by  breaching or evading statutes, regulations, current internal  standards, procedures and instructions or this code of  conduct. Regulations, agreements,  internal standards and instructions  18 You must treat all customers and suppliers fairly. You must  not do business with a relation or close friend on behalf of  the company. We must market and sell products, including services, on the  basis of product features and the advantages of using AF  Group as a supplier. We must not belittle our competitors. Only do business with suppliers who meet statutory  requirements, the requirements contained in collective  agreements, the internal requirements of AF Group and this  code. The company has organisational responsibility for the  entire contract pyramid. Take care to ensure that there is no  illicit dealings. Make sure that you comply with all the statutory requirements  regarding money laundering and the reporting of cash  transactions. Learn to identify and watch out for the danger  signs of money laundering. Provide supplier support to ensure that customers quality  expectations are satisfied. Suppliers who are too small to  develop their own support systems and improvement  processes must be included in those of AF Group. Customers and suppliers  19 You, your family and your close friends may not receive  money or gifts that could be regarded as being connected  with AF Groups business affairs. As an exception, you may, however, accept gifts with no  appreciable value, such as promotional-items, if they are also  given to other people who have a similar relationship with the  customer or supplier. Insignificant gifts that are customary in  business (flowers, Christmas greetings, etc.) and are unlikely to  put your integrity in doubt are also exceptions. The receipt of  other gifts must be reported to the manager of the business  unit or the Corporate Management Team, or returned. Participation in courses, conferences, excursions, Christmas  parties, trade fairs and demonstrations organised by  customers and suppliers must be approved by the CEO of the  business unit. Foreign trips must be approved by the manager  of the business unit. Travel and accommodation must always  be paid for by the respective company or business unit in   AF Group.  Gifts and entertainment  20 We must attach importance to maintaining a good  appearance. What is more, everything, including  equipment, culture, social matters and nature, must be  combined and shaped so that the whole makes a good  aesthetic impression  Dress so that you look well groomed and in a manner that  shows respect for customers, suppliers and colleagues. In  production the required safety equipment, a t-shirt and  trousers must be worn at the very least. Work clothes must  conform to company dress codes. As well as being a workplace, AF Groups offices are places  where a variety of external persons meet AF Group.  Employees must therefore attach special importance to their  role as representatives of the company. Appearance  21 Information from AF Group is designed to enable the  outside world to paint an accurate picture of our business. Statements to the mass media must only be made by the  authority of the Communications Manager or the Corporate  Management Team.  Managers may comment on issues and processes within their  particular sphere of responsibility if they are nominated to do  so.  Under	some	contracts	only	the	client	can	issue	information	to	 the mass media. The use of noisy mass media is not permitted in the  workplaces of AF Group. Our employees may not use their mobile phone during any  meeting organised by AF Group. The chairman may grant  an exemption from this rule if someone may need to be  contacted in an emergency. The use of mobile phones in  other situations must not have a detrimental effect on safety,  good communication with colleagues and concentration. Mass media and mobile phones  22 AF Group recognises and respects your right to participate  in financial, commercial and other activities outside the  company. You	must	avoid	situations	that	might	result	in	a	conflict	 between	AF	Group	and	your	personal	interests.	You	must	not	 become dependent on AF Groups customers, shareholders,  suppliers or other connections in any way.  Examples of conflicts of interest 	 Financial	interests	in	companies	whereby	you	can	influence	 the business of AF Group 	 A	paid	sideline	that	might	affect	your	work	for	AF	Group 	 Putting	business	in	the	way	of	customers	or	suppliers	that	 are partly or wholly owned by family or close friends Conflicts of interest  23 	 Business	relations	with	former	employers,	work	colleagues	 and companies with which you have business contacts 	 Involvement	in	interest	groups,	condominium	boards	and	 political activities relating to matters of relevance to your  work at AF Group 	 Decisions	to	employ	or	promote	a	spouse,	partner,	relation	 or close friend 	 A	romantic	or	other	personal	relationship	that	might	give	 rise to a conflict of interest with the employees sphere of  responsibility at AF Group Tell your superior about any activities, financial interests,  relationships or friendships you have that might give rise to a  possible conflict of interest.   24 You have a duty of confidentiality in respect of confidential  information that you encounter during the course of your  employment. This duty of confidentially applies not just in relation to the out- side world, but also in relation to colleagues who do not need  the information in question for their work. Insider trading If you have information that might affect the price of the  companys shares, you may not buy or sell shares in AF  Group before that information becomes public knowledge. No one has, by virtue of their job, the right to use or misuse  information to obtain financial advantages for themselves  or others. The misuse of information in the purchase/sale  of shares is regulated by the Norwegian Penal Code and  constitutes grounds for dismissal. Confidentiality  25 Intellectual property rights to systems, methods and  registers are just as important for AF Group as tangible  assets. You must protect these assets. You	must	familiarise	yourself	with,	take	part	in	processes	to	do	 with and preserve the core values in our corporate culture.  Health, safety and environment Familiarise yourself thoroughly with your personal health,  safety and environment handbook, the emergency  management plan and the health, safety and environment  action plan for your project.
