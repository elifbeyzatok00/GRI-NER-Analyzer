To meet this challenge, we believe that our  long-standing experience in our markets and our value-added products and  solutions that increase efficiency make us a global partner of choice.    We remain committed to our strategy and a single set of standards and  values, namely innovation, integrity, performance and agility. This approach  applies to our people and our social and physical environment as well as  our products and solutions. Wayne Edmunds, Chief Executive  Todays world and our markets continue to change and to challenge  us – our experience is key.  The presence of emerging markets  continues to grow in respect of demand  for energy and infrastructure. At the same  time, we are seeing signs of recovery in a  number of our more traditional markets,  with a focus on performance improvement  and capacity. Across all industries and  markets however there remains a  consistent theme of increasing regulatory  requirements with health and safety at the  forefront. Our priorities recognise the  need to act responsibly and sustainably  while improving efficiency, ensuring safety  and reducing environmental impact.  At Invensys, we develop and apply  advanced technologies that enable  theworlds manufacturing and  energy-generating facilities, mainline  and mass transit rail networks and  appliances to operate safely and in  anenergy-efficient manner.  In all three of our divisions, our  products and systems enable our  customers to make the best decisions  at the right time and to optimise their  operations and business value.

Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc	Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2012	 www.invensys.com 05  Chairmans Statement A year of signicant progress  Invensys has made signicant progress in a  number of areas which will stand us in good stead  for the future. Our divisions have each improved  their market position and we have reinforced the   Sir Nigel Rudd, Chairman Underlying EPS (p) 13.4p         Dividend (p) 4.4p Recommended nal dividend                  Dear Shareholder During the past year, Invensys has made  signicant progress in a number of  areaswhich will stand us in good stead  for the future. As our Chief Executive  Wayne Edmunds explains in his  statement on pages 8 to 9, our divisions  have each improved their market  position and we have reinforced the  Groups nancial stability with new  600 million ve-year banking facilities  and, as part of its triennial review,  nochange to the funding plan of  theInvensys Pension Scheme (UK). Wayne Edmunds has settled in well to his  new role and his actions in strengthening  the management team around him       theexecutive team. Whilst the additional  costs on a small number of contracts  have adversely affected our overall  performance, these should not detract  from the signicant progress made in  positioning our businesses for the future.  I am particularly pleased that Invensys Rail  has signicantly grown its order book and  that Invensys Operations Management has  seen excellent underlying order growth  across each of its lines of business. Invensys  Controls continues to perform well against  the background of very difcult market  conditions in its appliance segment. Also  each business is ensuring that it continues  to meet market needs by investing in  refreshing and updating many of our  coretechnology platforms.  06 Invensys plc  Dividend and dividend policy The Board has recommended a final dividend of 2.75 pence per share, which brings the total dividends payable in  respect of the year ended 31 March 2012 to 4.4 pence per share (2011: 4.0 pence per share), an increase of 10%. Subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual  General Meeting on 13 July 2012, the final dividend will be paid on 3 August 2012 to shareholders on the register at 22 June	 2012. A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is available for this final dividend, which  willenable shareholders to reinvest their  dividends directly into Invensys shares. The Boards dividend policy seeks to balance the income needs of shareholders  with the needs of the Group to retain the resources and flexibility to enhance further our growth prospects. In particular, the  Board has taken into account the investment required in working capital, particularly  onlarge projects, and in research and development, the opportunities to make  bolt-on acquisitions to increase our  technology base and market presence,  andthe need to retain flexibility should anopportunity arise to reduce our  pensionliabilities.  Accordingly we remain committed to our  progressive dividend policy with future  dividend growth reflecting more closely	 the long-term sustainable trend in  underlying earnings per share and free  cash flow. The Board On 19 May 2011, Deena Mattar was appointed to the Board as a non-executive director. She is a chartered accountant	 andwas formerly Group Finance Director	 of Kier Group plc. Deena has joined the Audit Committee. On 28 July 2011, David Thomas was appointed to the Board as Chief Financial Officer. He had been Acting Chief Financial Officer of the Group since 24 March 2011. David joined Invensys in 2002 as Group Controller, having previously been a senior  partner in Ernst & Young LLP specialising in long-term industrial contracting  businesses and has held a number of  senior roles at Invensys including CFO	 andCEO roles within the divisions. He is a  member of the Auditing Practices Board. On 29 November 2011, Victoria Hull wasappointed to the Board as an executive director. She is the Groups Chief Legal Officer with responsibility for the  management of legal, compliance and  commercial risk across the Group. She	 joined Invensys in 2001, since when she has been an integral member of the  Groups senior management team.	 The Board recognises the importance andbenefits of diversity and will continue  to take this into account in our recruitment  process whilst ensuring that candidates are  selected on merit and ensuring there is an  appropriate range and balance of skills,  experience and background on the Board.	 Outlook Invensys Operations Management markets  remain buoyant and we expect our  software and equipment lines of business  to continue to perform well. Our systems  business will benefit from its strong order  book but growth in its operating margins  will be moderated by the effects of the  lower margin greenfield projects. Invensys Rail had a very successful year in  winning major projects in its core and new markets and these orders will increasingly  benefit revenue in the year as we begin to  mobilise our project teams. Operating	 margins are expected to remain within  our medium-term target range but are  expected to be around 15% for next yearbecause we intend to take a more  conservative view of profit recognition  inthe early stages of some of the large  contracts in new markets. Invensys Controls major appliance	 customers are expecting a year of more  stable demand, particularly in North America and Europe, and we expect  continued success in commercial  andwholesale. Overall we are looking forward to a  yearofimproving performances across  ourbusinesses.

Wayne Edmunds, Chief Executive During the year, we made good progress  with some signicant achievements  thatposition us well for the future.  Inparticular, we reorganised into lines  ofbusiness within the divisions to  increase focus on our industry-leading  technologies and we are investing in  enhancing many of our core technology  platforms. We also grew the Invensys  Rail order book signicantly and agreed  the triennial review of the Invensys  Pension Scheme (UK) with no change  tothe funding plan.        achievements positioning us well for the               in both core and new markets.     achieved strong order momentum  across each line of business without  the benet of any new large greeneld  contract awards during the year.         much weaker than expected trading  conditions in the appliance market in              of business to bring additional emphasis  upon our leading brands and  technologies.       teams with several new appointments  across the divisions.       inenhancing a number of our core  technology platforms across the  divisions.         review with the Trustees of the Invensys        no change to the funding plan.       banking facilities to ensure we have  thefunding capacity to underpin our  nancial position and support our  futuregrowth.

Since the announcement	 inJanuary 2012, we have responded bystrengthening our procedures and  management teams in a number of areas.  We have three strong businesses with  leading positions in industries with  structural growth drivers and it is our  clearfocus to ensure that we capture the  opportunities available to us to build  shareholder value. Our strategy The world is changing at great speed with  rapidly developing economies (RDEs) likely	 to overtake the developed world in terms  of share of global GDP over the next decade or so. Although the core of our  overall strategy remains unchanged, we  need to ensure that we continue to extend  our success in RDEs as they become our largest customer base. Our core attributes support our strategy Across our businesses we have a number  ofcore attributes that position us well as  the global economy develops, with the  result that we should grow faster than the  competition: 	 We have distinctive technologies including software and western standard  safety systems which are attractive to  RDE customers. We are also adapting	 a number of our offerings to meet many  RDE needs for scalable and adaptable products with features tailored to their  markets, whilst maintaining effectiveness  and safety. 	 We have a large installed base with exceptional customer relationships  across both the developed world and  RDEs. 	 As we have responded to the project issues in the year, we have strengthened  our global delivery skills, in particular for  large systems integration projects. 	 We have proven our ability to be effective at business development,  teaming and partnering to provide  comprehensive market access, as  evidenced in particular by our major contract wins in Invensys Rail. 	 We have a strong balance sheet which provides us with flexibility in managing and financing our businesses and  payingdividends to shareholders. Our core markets remain robust Each of our divisions is operating in  industry verticals which have strong  growthprospects: 	 At Invensys Operations Management,	 our core markets of oil, gas and power  have long-term structural growth  prospects due to the need for greenfield  capacity in the developing world,  especially India and China, and the  potential for optimisation and efficiency  of plant operations, particularly at  brownfield sites in the developed world. 	 At Invensys Rail, the global rail infrastructure market also has long-term  structural growth prospects due to  industrialisation and urbanisation in the  developing world together with capacity  needs and pressure to reduce carbon  footprints in the developed world. 	 At Invensys Controls, our core markets	 ofappliance, commercial and wholesale  are expected to grow due to a recovery  in Europe and North America and consumer aspirations in the developing  world. In particular, RDEs including China and India are increasingly important markets  for each of our divisions and we will be  using our combined knowledge and  experience from operating in these  countries to improve our capabilities  and to capture growth opportunities. Performance highlights Although many of the Groups businesses performed strongly with order growth in  Invensys Operations Management and  Invensys Rail providing visibility into next  year, additional costs on a small number of  contracts resulted in a reduction in profits  compared to last year. Invensys Operations Management had  another year of strong order intake across  each line of business despite the absence  of any large greenfield project awards in the year. The underlying rate of order  increase was 11% at CER with orders in systems up 7%, software up a record 20% and equipment up 11%. Revenue growth was also strong mainly due to the ramp-up  of activity on many of the recently won  large greenfield projects. However	 operating profit and margins were affected  by the previously announced 40 million additional costs on our nuclear projects	 in China. Invensys Rail reported a near record  orderintake with the award of several  largecontracts in new markets. Revenue  was broadly flat with good growth in theUKand North America offset by an anticipated reduction in Spain and delays inmobilisation on some of the large new  marketcontracts. Despite the previously	 announced 20 million additional costs, operating margin was 15.0%. Invensys Controls had to cope with an  appliance market that was much weaker  than had been expected at the start of  theyear, resulting in a decline in revenue  and profit. However its wholesale and  commercial lines of business held up  muchbetter to offset some of the  declinesin appliance.  At the corporate centre, we have eliminated  several previously group-wide functions  and returned some responsibilities to the  divisions, which has resulted in central  costs being reduced by 17% at CER to 38million (2011: 46 million).

Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc	Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2012	 www.invensys.com 11  Our Business Model — Invensys Operations Management continued How do we generaterevenue? Our revenue can be broken down as  follows: 60% systems; 18% software; and 22% equipment. Our portfolio covers	 the majority of vertical markets from the more discrete and batch processing  industries (e.g. biotechnology, mining, pharmaceutical) to the more complex	 heavy process industries (e.g. refining, chemicals, oil and gas). During the year, 6%of the divisions revenue was from our	 nuclear vertical, which forms part of our  systems category. Our large installed base provides a  platform for us to generate sales from  brownfield contracts. Our traditional  markets have been affected by the difficult  economic climate but, in recent years,  we have been particularly successful in  winning large greenfield contracts in the  oil and gas, petrochemicals and power  industries. Large contracts are defined by us as in excess of 10 million. During the year, 15% of the divisions  revenue was from large contracts  (2011:16%). Our route to market varies by product: 	 The majority of our systems sales are direct; 	 Equipment sales are primarily indirect through distributors; 	 Our software sales are largely indirect through distributors and via systems  integrators; sales of our advanced software applications are direct. What is our strategy? The key elements of our strategy are  tocontinue to support our existing  customers, to expand our customer  base, to broaden our geographic profile  and to ensure the highest standards of  project execution. We will focus on our world-class control  and safety systems and on high-margin  andfaster-growing segments of the  marketsuch as advanced software  applications, equipment and enterprise  control offerings.  Support existing customers Continuing to ensure that our installed  base of existing customers receives  outstanding service and solutions will be  an important source of future revenue.  There will be significant opportunities  to replace or upgrade control and safety  systems, as well as up-sale opportunities  to provide advanced software applications  and enterprise control solutions. Commitment to project execution We are investing in the best people  with long-standing and proven domain  knowledge to manage rigorously our  project execution processes. This will be managed within our recently established  strong line of business organisation.  Expand customer base A key tenet of our strategy is to secure new  greenfield contracts that expand our  installed base and provide opportunities  to sell additional solutions. Currently 79%	 of Invensys Operations Managements  revenue derives from the oil and gas,  petrochemicals, utilities and power, and  general industries sectors. Our aim is to  expand the reach of the division into a  broader range of adjacent industries	 through the software business. Expand geographically Invensys Operations Management is  targeting a greater proportion of revenue  from the faster-growing economies of Asia  Pacific, the Middle East and South America. This will enable us to build and consolidate  a base for future brownfield and software  growth within our core verticals. As at 31 March 2012, 55% of our order  book was to emerging markets  (2011:60%). Leading technology The development of world-class  technology remains core to our strategy.

How do we generate revenue? Invensys Rails revenue can be broken  down as follows: 44% mainline engineering	 and contracting; 32% mass transit	 engineering and contracting; and 24%	 products. During the year, 54% of the divisions revenue was generated from  contracts in excess of 10 million. Rail signalling and control is a specialist  market within the rail industry as awhole  and is a higher-margin segment compared  with rolling stock and infrastructure. In the  majority of cases, the business is project- based and involves long-term contracts  spread over a number of years.  We have a flexible go-to-market approach, depending on what is appropriate for  aparticular market or specific contract.  Contracts are bid directly with customers,  through consortia or alliances, or via  a subcontract.  What is our strategy? We have established a leadership  positionthrough sustained investment  inthe research and development of  state-of-the-art technology solutions and  acommitment to the highest standards  ofproject execution. This dual approach remains at the heart of our strategy.  We will continue to expand geographically  and build sustainable businesses in new  home markets. To support this strategy,  wewill expand our partnership capability  and make select bolt-on acquisitions.   Expand geographically  Our four traditional core markets of the  UK, Iberia, North America and Australia account for 77% of the divisions revenue;	 this compares with 78% in 2011. Developing countries continue to	 accelerate rail investment and over the  coming years we expect to increase  significantly the contribution from  other, faster-growing markets.  A key part of our strategy is to establish  new home markets where we have the  necessary domain knowledge, local  presence and infrastructure to meet  our customers needs. 64% of our order book at 31March 2012  related to projects outside our traditional  core markets (2011: 44%). Technology development The majority of our markets have adopted a standards-based approach to technology  in the rail industry, with ERTMS and CBTC becoming recognised as global standards.  With signalling and rail control having an  increasing role in meeting the growing  demands for rail as a result of urbanisation  and a need for a reduced carbon footprint,  new technology implementation remains  critical for the industry. The success of Invensys Rail will  increasingly be judged on the operational	 and commercial value we provide to our  customers by managing the whole railway  system; driving up capacity and reducing	 journey times, energy usage and operational costs, while maintaining an  absolute commitment to safety.  To address  this challenge, we will invest in creating the  required technical solutions to provide new  products, and to deliver smaller, smarter  and faster solutions. We invested 6% of the divisions revenue  on research and development during the  year (2011: 7%). Commitment to project execution We adopt a best-in-class commercial  contract management and project	 management operating model to ensure  we satisfy our customers needs for  on-time commissioning.  Expansion of partnering capability With the consortia business model  becoming more prevalent in the industry,  we will expand our partnerships and  continue to build influential relationships,	 including local partners and global  players within relevant areas such as  civil engineering, rolling stock and  system integrators. Realise synergies within Invensys We will continue to leverage Invensys  Operations Managements technology.  Examples to date include safety systems  forinterlockings, asset management for  trains and track, and the use of Wonderware  technology for control room displays and  passenger information systems. Acquisitions Invensys Rail will continue to make bolt-on  acquisitions that deliver unique technologies  and/or improved market access.

The increase was driven by a near  record level of orders won by Invensys  Rail of almost 1 billion, resulting in a  Group book to bill 1  of 1.08. The value of orders received from binding  contractual agreements with customers   in the year. This excludes Invensys Rail  framework agreements. This also excludes  blanket orders (e.g. from OEMs) unless  there is a firm commitment for delivery  within a maximum of three months. This is a measure of current year  performance and supports future years  revenue performance. Order book (m) 2009 2010 2011 2,083 2,307 2,204 2012 2,360 The order book at 31 March 2012 was  2,360 million (2011: 2,204 million),  up7% (up 10% at CER). The order book achieved was driven  bythe strength of the order book at  Invensys Rail. 48% of the Groups order  book is in emerging markets. The cumulative value of orders received  (less revenue taken to date) that we expect  to convert into future revenues.  This gives us visibility into future revenue  performance and provides a measure of  our business development activities. Revenue (m) 2009 2010 2011 2,284 2,243 2,486 2012 2,539 Revenue was 2,539 million (2011:  2,486 million), up 2% (up 3% at CER). Revenue at Invensys Operations  Management grew by 12% at CER with  strong growth in the oil and gas sector  and general industries. This was largely  offset however by volume reductions  atInvensys Controls of 13%at CER,  mostly due to weakness inits appliance  markets. Revenue at Invensys Rail  remained consistent with the prior year. The invoiced value of goods and services,  excluding intra-group transactions and  sales taxes. For long-term contracts, revenue  represents the value of work performed  during the year determined by reference   to the stage of completion of the contract. This is a measure of current year  performance. Operating profit (m) 2009 2010 2011 244 248 262 2012 209 Operating profit was 209 million  (2011:262 million), down 20%  (down20% at CER). The reduction in operating profit,  compared to an overall increase in  revenue, was driven by the need to  recognise additional costs on a small  number of contracts in Invensys  Operations Management and Invensys  Rail, as announced in the Q3 Interim  Management Statement. Invensys  Controls operating profit alsofell  against the prior year followingvolume  reductions in its appliancebusiness. Profit before taxation, net finance costs  andexceptional items.  This gives us an underlying measure of  business profitability that is comparable  over time. Our directors and Group management use a range of financial key performance indicators (KPIs), reported on a periodic basis,  to track and drive performance. These focus on driving future growth, measuring our current year performance, profitability  and efficiency and value to shareholders. These KPIs are set out below and more information is set out in the Financial Review  onpages 26 to 30. We also monitor our performance in non-financial areas. A detailed explanation of our non-financial KPIs is set out in the Corporate  Responsibility section on pages 32 to 36. 1 Book to bill is defined as the ratio of orders received   to revenue. 18  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  KPI Current year performance Definition and rationale Operating margin (%) 2009 2010 2011 10.7 11.1 10.5 2012 8.2 Operating margin was 8.2% (2011: 10.5%).  The fall in operating margin was  drivenby the factors explained under  operating profit. Operating profit divided by revenue. This is a measure of the efficiency of  theprofits we generate. Operating cash flow (m) 2009 2010 2011 298 265 213 2012 159 Operating cash flow was 159 million  (2011: 213 million) down 25% (down  24% at CER). Cash performance was strong at  Invensys Operations Management;  however this was more than offset by  delays in planned receipts of upfront  payments on two recently won large  contracts at Invensys Rail. The cash flow equivalent of our operating  profit measure i.e. cash flow before net  finance costs paid, taxation paid,  exceptional items and legacy items. Cash conversion (%) 2009 2010 2011 122 107 81 2012 76 Cash conversion was 76% (2011: 81%). Cash conversion was strong, in excess  of120%, at both Invensys Operations  Management and Invensys Controls.  Invensys Rail was impacted by upfront  payment delays as noted above,  resulting in acash conversion of 30%. Operating cash flow divided by operating  profit. This measures our efficiency in generating  operating cash from our operating profit. Free cash flow (m) Free cash flow was an outflow of  (11)million (2011: inflow of 83 million). The lower free cash flow was driven  bythe lower operating cash flow as  explained above, higher finance costs  and higher pension contributions in  theUS. Operating cash flow less cash costs  ofnetfinance costs paid, taxation paid,  exceptional items and legacy items paid. This indicates the level of cash that can be  used to enhance shareholder value e.g.  through dividends, acquisitions, changes  to capital structure. Earnings per share (EPS) — underlying (p) 2009 2010 2011 14.1 13.4 19.8 2012 13.4 Underlying EPS were 13.4p (2011: 19.8p),  down 32%. The lower underlying EPS was mostly  due to the factors impacting operating  profit as explained on the previous page. Earnings per share (as defined below)   but before exceptional post-retirement  benefits – settlement loss, past service  credit and curtailment gain; and  exceptional finance costs.  This measure of EPS provides an  underlying measure of shareholder return  that is comparable over time. Earnings per share (EPS) — basic (p) 2009 2010 2011 17.4 18.5 22.4 2012 12.8 Basic EPS were 12.8p (2011: 22.4p),  down 43%. Profit attributable to shareholders, divided  by the weighted average number of shares  in issue during the year. Return on operating capital (%) 2009 2010 2011 49.0 48.6 49.9 2012 35.5 Return on operating capital was 35.5%  (2011: 49.9%). The reduction was driven by the fall  inoperating profit and an increase in  working capital, as a result of amounts  due from contract customers. Operating profit divided by average capital  employed excluding goodwill, net pension  liabilities, non-operating provisions and net  taxation liabilities. This provides a measure of the efficiency  ofthe capital employed in the business. 2009 2010 2011 296 100 83 2012 (11) Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 19  Invensys Operations Management Continuing good growth across all lines of business Year ended 31 March 2012 2011 % change at CER 1 % total change Orders (m) 1,266 1,340 (4) (6) Order book (m) 1,088 1,124 (2) (3) Revenue (m) 1,272 1,147 12 11 Operating profit2 (m) 96 123 (21) (22) Operating margin2 (%) 7.5% 10.7% Operating cash flow (m) 123 110 14 12 Operating cash conversion (%) 128% 89% Employees at year end (numbers) 9,544 8,897 7 1 % change is measured as the change at CER as a percentage of the 2011 adjusted base and is calculated on underlying amounts in 000s. 2 All references to operating profit and operating margin are arrived at before exceptional items, unless otherwise stated. Invensys Operations Management is   a leading global technology, software  and consulting business that creates   and applies advanced technologies to  enable the safe and efficient operation  of industrial and commercial operations  such as oil refineries, fossil fuel and  nuclear power plants, petrochemical  works and other manufacturing sites. Markets The strength shown by Invensys  Operations Managements markets in   2011 continued across all regions and  business segments.  The rapidly developing economies of   the Middle East, Asia and South America  continue to expand greenfield capacity in  the power, upstream and downstream oil   and gas and petrochemical sectors to meet  consumer and export demands. In North  America and Europe, growth was good  across all of our markets due to increased  investment in ageing assets, transfer of  knowledge and replacement of assets.  Across our lines of business, systems  continued to grow based on services and  upgrades of ageing assets in the developed  world and good prospects for larger  projects with some schemes, previously  deferred, being reactivated. Software is  seeing excellent recovery in areas such as  optimisation, Human Machine Interface  (HMI) and Manufacturing Execution  Systems (MES). The equipment business  isstill seeing good growth driven by  continuing investment in the energy  sector,particularly in upstream oil and  gasin North America.  Looking forward, although macroeconomic  conditions remain uncertain, we believe  that the demands for new capacity in  emerging markets and the need to improve  the efficiency of brownfield operations in  the developed world will continue to drive  growth in this division. Developments Leadership and focus Michael J (Mike) Caliel joined the division  as President and CEO with effect from  1January 2012. Mike was previously  withInvensys from 1993 to 2006, latterly  asChief Executive of Invensys Process  Systems, the largest of the predecessor  companies that were brought together to  form Invensys Operations Management in  early 2009. He has over 25 years experience  in the industries in which the division  operates and has in-depth knowledge  ofour customers as well as our products  and technologies. His enthusiasm and  drive will now be directed to building  onthe divisions strong market positions. During the year, we established a line   of business structure within the division  (systems, software and equipment), each  with its own leadership team responsible  for strategy, commercial activities and  operational delivery. This structure has  been established to drive accountability  and to increase focus to ensure that we  deliver the best value across our portfolio.  In addition, we announced in November  2011 the formation of a separate global  nuclear business unit to recognise the  significance of the nuclear industry to this  division; nuclear represented around 6%   of the divisions revenue in the year.  Contracts We continued to grow our business in the  year with some key contract wins related to  our capabilities in software technologies  and in large and complex control and  safety systems. 20  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Revenue by sector (%) Revenue by destination (%) Revenue by line of business 1 (%) Oil and gas  33 General industries  27 Utilities and power  14 Discrete manufacturing  7 Petrochemicals  5 Other  14 UK  4 Rest of Europe  22 North America  29 South America  7 Asia Pacic  24 Africa/Middle East  14 Systems  60 Software  18 Equipment  22 1  Our enterprise control offerings  are spreadacross all three  product catagories. Software 	 We	announced	an	alliance	with	  Microsoft Corp. for migrating some of  our applications to the Windows Azure  cloud. By bringing together industrial  thought and technology leaders, the  alliance expands the companys  continuing relationship with Microsoft  and will afford end users cloud-based  offerings in the manufacturing and  infrastructure operations space. As  Microsofts Alliance ISV Industry Partner  of the Year in 2011, this alliance further  defines our position as a leading  provider of automation solutions that  help optimise manufacturing business  operations in real time. 	 We	signed	a	multi-year,	multi-million	 dollar contract to deliver comprehensive  software solutions and services for Shell.  This will provide a suite of our SimSci- Esscor simulation solutions, including  our ROMeo optimisation software and  other simulation and modelling solutions,  to improve Shells global upstream,  downstream and petrochemicals  production, helping it to achieve  operational excellence in real time.  	 The	US	Department	of	Energy	has	 deployed a first-of-its-kind operator  training simulator for an integrated  gasification combined cycle (IGCC)  power plant with carbon capture using  our innovative simulation software- based training solutions. Our SimSci- Esscor DYNSIM high-fidelity simulator  will help train operators for new IGCC  plants now being built in the US. IGCC  with carbon capture holds tremendous  promise as a low-cost, clean energy  source so IGCC plants are expected to  be a key resource for the provision of  clean fossil power in the near future. 	 We	signed	a	multi-million	dollar	contract	 to implement an integrated refinery  information system (IRIS) for Saudi   Aramco Total Refining & Petrochemical  Company (SATORP). A joint venture  between Saudi  Aramco and Total France,  SATORP is constructing a state-of-the-art,   400,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Jubail,  Saudi Arabia, that is expected to be  operational before the end of 2013.  Inastrategic alliance with Wipro Arabia  Limited, we will  provide an integrated  InFusion enterprise control solution.  Systems 	 In	the	second	half	of	the	year	following	 the creation of the separate nuclear  business unit within systems, a review   was carried out of the engineering  requirements and associated costs   for the three contracts to install and  commission control and safety systems  into eight nuclear reactors under  construction in China. The review  concluded that there will be a delay in  delivery and the need for additional  engineering to be carried out on the first  contract, some of which will be reused  on the later contracts. We announced  inJanuary 2012 that the cost of the  additional engineering amounted to  around 40 million. Since then, work   has proceeded on the revised designs   in accordance with our expectations.  However until we have made further  significant progress in project execution,  we will not be recognising any profits  from these three contracts. 	 Invensys	Operations	Management	 signed two contracts with TNK-BP, the  third largest oil company in Russia and  among the top 10 private oil companies  in the world by production volumes. We  will provide comprehensive automation  solutions and services to help drive  control, environment and safety  excellence at TNK-BPs Saratov oil  refinery in western Russia, a seven   million tonnes per year refinery.  Performance  Order intake in the year was strong   across all regions and business segments.  Excluding two large China nuclear orders  last year, the underlying rate of order  increase was 11% at CER with orders in the  systems, software and equipment lines of  business up 7%, 20% and 11% respectively.  Reported order intake was 1,266 million  (2011: 1,340 million).  The order book at 31 March 2012 was  1,088 million (2011: 1,124 million), a  decrease during the period of 3% as we  continue to execute the large contracts  awarded in recent years. In addition, the  three-year pipeline of order prospects  remains strong at around 3 billion. Revenue in the year was up 12% at CER to  1,272 million (2011: 1,147 million) driven  by the significant increase in revenue from  large projects, which accounted for 15%   of revenue in the period, together with  strong growth in software and equipment.  Revenue in the systems, software and  equipment lines of business were up   14%, 16% and 6% respectively at CER. Operating profit was down 21% at CER at  96 million (2011: 123 million) due to the  40 million additional costs in respect of  our nuclear projects in China; excluding  these costs, operating profit would have  been up 12% at CER. Operating margin  was 7.5% (2011: 10.7%) or 10.7% excluding  the additional costs.  Operating cash flow was 123 million   (2011: 110 million) resulting in cash  conversion for the year of 128% (2011: 89%)  or 90% excluding the additional costs.

Invensys Rail is a multinational provider  of state-of-the-art software-based  signalling, communication and control  systems that enable the safe and  efficient operation of trains in mainline  and mass transit networks across  theworld. Our aim is to deliver  highercapacity safely and  reducedtraveltimes.  Markets The global market for rail signalling and  train control remained steady during   the year with prospects continuing to   be strong due to industrialisation,  urbanisation, increasing capacity   needs and the recognition of rail as   an environmentally sustainable and  efficient means of transport.  In our major traditional core markets, the  UK market is supported by government  commitments to continue to fund Network  Rail and other rail infrastructure projects  such as Crossrail and the second High  Speed Line. Network Rail has retendered  its signalling framework agreements  covering the UK and we were successful  infour out of the nine regions. In Spain,  activity levels were down significantly due  to government austerity measures and  future investment will be reliant upon  private sector financing. In the US, the  market for grade crossings remains robust  and we have had success in building our  presence in the mass transit and mainline  signalling markets.  There is a significant level of rail  infrastructure investment being made  outside our traditional core markets,  especially in South America, the Middle  East and Asia and we have been successful  in winning several major projects. In China  for example, major mass transit schemes  will be implemented in many regional cities  over the next few years and we remain  confident that we will participate in this  market through our agreements with China  South (CSR), Chinas largest rolling stock  manufacturer. We are also reviewing  potential contracts for future bidding with  CSR outside of China. Developments There have been several major  developments in the year, in both our  home and our export markets. Home markets Activity with Network Rail, which named   us their Supplier of the Year in July 2011,  was strong in the year and underlines  ourposition as the UKs leading supplier  ofsignalling and train control systems.  	 In	July	2011,	we	were	selected	by	 Network Rail to deliver the Thameslink  resignalling project, one of Britains  largest and most complex resignalling  schemes covering London Bridge Station  and the approaching railway. This  framework agreement was the first of  nine awards to be made, under which  there will be a series of individual  commission contracts. Work commenced  in August 2011 and runs through to the  completion of the Thameslink project  inDecember 2018.  	 In	January	2012,	we	achieved	further	 success with the Network Rail framework  contracts when we were appointed  Primary Contractor in three of the other  eight areas (Scotland, Central West and  Wales & West) and named Secondary  Contractor for a further four areas  (Central East, Sussex & Wessex, Great  Western Inner and Great Western Outer).  Where we have been named Secondary  Contractor, we could be called upon   to lead the delivery of a project if the  Primary Contractors for these areas do  not have the capacity. These framework  agreements run from 2012 to March  2014, at which point there will be an  option for Network Rail to continue with  each agreement on an annual basis for   a further five years. 22  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Revenue by sector (%) Revenue by destination (%) Mainline engineering and contracting  44 Mass transit engineering and contracting  32 Products  24 UK  27 Rest of Europe  22 North America  22 South America  8 Asia Pacic  21 Africa/Middle East  0 	 We	were	also	awarded	a	28	million	 signalling contract for the Reading  Western Mainline programme and the  35 million Glasgow South Suburban  Resignalling contract. The scope of   the Reading programme covers the  remodelling of the Reading Station area  from Sonning to Pangbourne, a new train  care depot and four new platforms which  will provide increased capacity at, and  through, the station. The Glasgow  contract includes the Cathcart Signal   Box area, the East Kilbride branch lines  and the Barrhead lines up to the limit   of control from the West of Scotland  Signalling Centre. This will include new  Westlock interlockings and see a new  generation of signalling introduced to  control the area. 	 We	were	appointed	preferred	bidder	  on one of four European Rail Traffic  Management System (ERTMS)  framework contracts. This contract  initially covers the development stage   of ERTMS provision across the UK  network, after which we will demonstrate  our solution at Network Rails Integration  Facility at Hertford. The final part of  ERTMS deployment will see the rollout   of trackside equipment on selected   parts of the UK mainline network.  New and emerging markets 	 The	Saudi	Railways	Organization	(SRO)	 announced that the Al Shoula consortium  had been awarded the contract to  provide the superstructure, systems,  rolling stock, signalling, operation and  maintenance for the Haramain High- Speed Line linking the two Holy Cities  ofMakkah and Madinah. This consortium  is a Saudi-Spanish group which will  implement the successful high-speed  line model and technology applied in  Spain to this new line. As a member of  the Al Shoula consortium, Invensys Rail  will provide the full turnkey signalling  and train control systems, including its  FUTUR 3000 and FUTUR 2500  Level2 ERTMS solution. Invensys Rails  share ofthe three-year construction  phase isvalued at 298 million (around  260 million). In addition, there will be a  12-year maintenance contract which will  be signed at the end of the construction  phase and our share will be 185 million  (around 160 million). 	 We	were	awarded	the	contract	to	 provide the signalling technology for  Istanbuls CR3 Marmaray Project, a 77km  commuter line linking Gezbe and Halkali  under the Bosphorus. The value of the  contract is 195 million (approximately  170 million). In a joint venture with  Spanish civil construction company  OHL,we will be responsible for designing  and supplying a new signalling and  Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system  for the line. The project will utilise a  range of Invensys Rails state-of-the-art  signalling and communication solutions  including SIRIUS CBTC (Communication  Based Train Control) and FUTUR  ERTMS Level 1. 	 In	January	2012,	we	achieved	further	 success in Turkey when a joint venture  including Invensys Rail was awarded   a project from Turkish State Railways  (TCDD) to install ERTMS signalling   and communications on the 310km  Bandirma-Menemen railway, the main  rail link between the Marmaray and  Mediterranean seas. Invensys Rails   share of the award is worth 59 million.  Performance Orders for the year were near record levels  at 991 million (2011: 558 million), up 77%  at CER, due to major awards in both new  and core markets, particularly in Saudi  Arabia and Turkey. In addition we won   four of the nine framework agreements  awarded by Network Rail; we do not  include framework agreements in order  intake or order book.  Our order book at 31 March 2012 was  1,202 million (2011: 1,021 million).  Inaddition, the three-year pipeline of  orderprospects remains strong at around  6billion. Revenue in the period was flat at CER at   775 million (2011: 772 million) with good  growth in the UK and North America offset  by an anticipated reduction in Spain and  delays in mobilisation on some of the large  new market contracts. Operating profit was down 11% at CER   at 116 million (2011: 129 million) and  operating margin was 15.0% (2011: 16.7%).  Operating profit and margin were below  last year due to a greater proportion   of revenue arising from lower margin  projects, together with the effect of  previously announced additional costs  amounting to 20 million on a handful of  contracts within the Asia Pacific region.  Operating cash flow was 35 million   (2011: 71 million) due to the investment   in working capital on some of our major  export contracts ahead of reaching  payment milestones and continued  delayed payments from customers in  Spain. Also we have not yet received   some significant upfront payments on the  large contracts awarded in the second   half of the year, which are now expected   to be received later in the current year.

Invensys Controls is a leading   global engineering and technology  provider that designs, engineers and  manufactures products, components,  systems and services used in appliances,  heating, air conditioning/cooling and  refrigeration products across a wide  range of industries in residential and  commercial markets. Markets The weakness seen in Invensys Controls  appliance markets in 2011 continued   with greater than expected reductions in  demand by customers. In the US, appliance  industry shipments were down compared  with the previous year, reflecting weak  consumer sentiment and low levels of  activity in the housing market. Our target  market at the mid- to higher-end saw  greater reductions with some purchasers  buying lower-end products exacerbated   by manufacturers reducing inventory levels  to reflect the lower levels of demand.  Thetrends in the European and Asian  appliance markets were similar to those  experienced in the US but South America  was less affected.  The commercial markets in North America  and Europe held up well but the wholesale  market experienced volatile demand  dueto distributors reducing their levels  ofinventory.  Looking forward, based upon customer  comments, we expect our major appliance  markets in North America and Europe to  be more stable, albeit at lower levels, and   we anticipate some improvements in  commercial and wholesale, supported by  several key new product launches in the  commercial business.  Developments During the year, Invensys Controls suffered  further significant reductions in orders  andrevenue in the appliance segment  andsubstantial raw material inflation but  remained profitable and cash generative.  In order to achieve this, the division  increased its focus on its higher-margin  commercial and wholesale segments,  further managed its manufacturing  footprint, applied stringent cost control  measures and continued to invest in new  product introductions and infrastructure. The divisions strategy of geographical  expansion within the commercial and  wholesale segments progressed well  during the year. For example, it began to  leverage its Italian energy management  solutions into other areas in Europe, North  America and Asia Pacific. For one pilot  scheme with a major retail customer, this  included a fully integrated solution for  heating, ventilation, air conditioning and  refrigeration (HVACR) and rack control   with the capability to add lighting and   cook control functionality. In addition,  traditionally North American products  were successfully exported to South  America and Europe.  In the appliance business, the emphasis   on developing global platforms to drive  cost-effectiveness and improve quality  continued to see progress. Invensys  Controls grew market share for its initial  Hydra water valve in North America.   24  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Revenue by line of business (%) Revenue by destination (%) Appliance  59 Wholesale  24 Commercial   17 UK  8 Rest of Europe  26 North America  45 South America  13 Asia Pacic  7 Africa/Middle East  1 A second production line has also started  up in its Matamoros plant with opportunities  secured for the bulk of its capacity from  customers in North America, Asia Pacific  and South America.  Investment in new product introductions  (NPIs) increased during the year and  despite some delays in customer launches,  NPIs accounted for 13% of revenue (2011:  10%). Investment was across all three lines  of business, reinforcing the divisions overall  niche proposition of providing value- engineered solutions and best-in-class  products. In the commercial segment,  thedivision launched an innovative  programmable controller for the  refrigeration business, which allows one  product to be applied across the globe  andreprogrammed for any particular  application. In the appliance segment,  Invensys Controls launched its Aegis gas  oven valve with a key customer. The valve  isa critical technology enabler allowing  further expansion into the EMEA residential  and commercial cooking market. In the  wholesale segment, a new solution for  addressing frozen condensate pipes was  recently introduced further cementing  ourleading position in heating controls. Performance Orders during the year were 493 million  (2011: 554 million), down 10% at CER  reflecting the downturn in end markets and  the effect of customers reducing inventory.  Revenue was 492 million (2011: 567  million), a 13% decrease at CER. Our order  book at 31 March 2012 was 70 million  (2011: 59 million).  Operating profit was down 36% at CER   to 35 million (2011: 56 million) with the  effect of the reduced revenue partially  offset by tight control of operating costs  and overheads. Operating margin was   7.1% (2011: 9.9%). Operating cash flow was  49 million (2011: 74 million) with cash  conversion at 140% (2011: 132%).  Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 25  Financial Review Strengthening our financial position Introduction and summary As reflected in our key performance  indicator trends, the Group has had a  mixed year with strong growth in orders  but reduced profitability, and, as seen  inour business division reviews on  pages 20 to 25, varying performances  by our divisions which have been  influenced bya number of factors.  At an overall level, the Groups profitability  has been impacted by the need to  recognise significant additional contract  costs in both Invensys Operations  Management and Invensys Rail. However  the underlying businesses have shown  some encouraging trends, the Groups  financial position has been strengthened  ina number of areas and we have  continued to invest in our future.  With the new five-year bank facilities in place and  agreement of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK)  triennial review, we enter the new financial year  witha sound financial base. This will enable us  tocontinue with the investment in our strategy. David Thomas, Chief Financial Officer Operating cash flow (m)  159m Operating cash flow was 159 million  (2011: 213 million) down 25% (down  24% at CER). Operating cash conversion  was 76% (2011: 81%) Return on operating capital (%) 35.5% Return on operating capital was 35.5%  (2011: 49.9%) To enable the continued development of  the Group, in March this year, we secured  new five-year bank facilities totalling  600million to support our bonding and  borrowing requirements. Despite tight  financial markets, this self-arranged facility  was oversubscribed and supported by all  of the Groups core banks. We are now  wellplaced to finance continued growth  over the medium term with an additional  200 million of headroom. We also concluded the triennial review  ofthe Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) with  no change required to the deficit funding  contribution schedule in terms of both  duration and quantum, giving us certainty  in our cash obligations for a number of  years. In respect of our Invensys Pension  Plan (US) we have recently concluded  theinitial phase of an offer to deferred  members which will extinguish around  $90million of liabilities. A second tranche  isexpected to be completed in the coming  year and actions are in hand on a number  of smaller schemes. We continue to keep  our legacydefined benefit pension  liabilities under review. 26  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Financial performance The table below sets out financial KPIs that the directors and Group management use to track and drive performance. A more detailed  explanation of these KPIs and other financial measures in the context of the Groups trading performance during the year are set out  throughout this Financial Review. Definitions and historical trends are set out in the Key Performance Indicators section on pages 18 to 19.

The Group closed the year with a net  cashbalance of 262 million. Although  ourcash performance in the first half was  disappointing, we succeeded in securing  100% cash conversion of operating  profitinthe second half notwithstanding  the 60million of additionally recognised  costs as referred to in the Q3 Interim  Management Statement. Looking  forward,and having regard to the forecast  receipts on our major projects, the first  halfis expected to again be challenging  due to the timing of the underlying  projectmilestones. In terms of our businesses, Invensys  Operations Management showed good  growth across all of its main lines of  business, however, the additional costs  recognised on our nuclear contracts in  China totalling 40 million in the second  half masked the underlying progress  madeby the business. The China nuclear  contracts are large, very long-term and  complex projects with final deliveries  expected to be completed in 2018.  Duringthe year the project delivery teams  have been strengthened and management  review procedures enhanced. There are  three separate contracts, and in addition  totaking a provision on the first contract,  we are trading the other contracts at a  zeromargin pending completion of key  engineering milestones. Within Invensys Rail, we have rebuilt the  order book, securing 991 million of  ordersin the year with successes in our  core UK market with Network Rail and  several major export contracts notably in  Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Despite adverse  profit adjustments on certain projects in  the Asia Pacific region, the business still  delivered an operating margin of 15.0%. Weakening consumer confidence has  adversely impacted Invensys Controls  particularly in the appliance market, but  actions taken in the prior periods to reduce  the cost base have stood the business in  good stead.  Consistent with the prior year, the Group  has continued to invest in research and  development to support its technology  base, with spend during the year amounting  to 5% of revenue. While the focus remains on overhead  control, for example as evidenced by  thefall in head office costs, investment  continues in new sales and project  management capabilities, particularly  inemerging markets, to drive future  growth. 48% of the Groups orderbook  iscomprised of orders from emerging  markets.

The policy sets out a strategy for the long-term funding of the Group, with the  objective of ensuring the Group has access to appropriate sources of funding to support its business, as and when required. In March  2012 the Group signed two new five-year bank facilities totalling 600 million, comprising a 350 million multi-currency bonding and  guarantee facility and a 250 million revolving credit facility. These replace the 400 million facility which was due to expire in July 2013.  The interest margin and covenants are in line with the previous facility. Exceptional items The exceptional charge for the year  totalled56 million (2011: 21 million). This  included restructuring costs of 31 million,  15 million of asset impairments (intangible  assets 10 million and property, plant and  equipment 5 million) and 9 million of  other operating exceptional items including  3 million relating to the Invensys Pension  Plan (US) settlement loss.  Restructuring costs included the business  improvement projects within Invensys Rail,  the integration of the Invensys Operations  Management businesses in Europe, the  reorganisation in the Invensys Controls  water heating business as a result of the  loss ofamajor contract, along with a  number ofother rationalisation projects  across theGroup. The comparative period included  restructuring costs of 21 million, 10 million  of asset impairments (intangible assets  6million and property, plant and equipment  4 million), offset by a10million credit of  other operating exceptionals. This credit  comprised a20million past service credit  arising asaresult of amendments made to  the benefits payable under the terms of the  USHealthcare Plan and a net 10 million  ofcosts to settle a legal case. Net finance costs Net finance costs increased to 10 million  in the year (2011: 5 million) due to the  write-off of unamortised fees of 2 million  remaining on the old facility following the  refinancing announced on 30 March 2012  and lower cash balances during the year. Other finance charges — IAS 19 IAS 19 finance charges decreased to  3million (2011: 14 million) mainly as a  result of lower discount rates on pension  liabilities. Taxation The tax charge for continuing operations  was 35 million (2011: 37 million), which  comprised a current year income tax  charge of 59 million (2011: 44 million),  offset by prior year credits of 4 million  (2011: 6 million) and a deferred tax credit  of 20 million (2011: 1 million). The Group  is subject to several factors which affect the  tax charge including the levels and mix of  profitability in different jurisdictions and  the availability of tax losses. The effective  tax rate for the Group was 25% (2011: 19%);  the increase was largely as a result of the  impact of the profit adjustment on our  nuclear projects in China within Invensys  Operations Management. Excluding this,  the underlying effective tax rate was 20%. Discontinued operations The loss from discontinued operations  of6 million (2011: 7 million) related  tofurther provisions in respect of prior  yeardisposals. Net profit Net profit decreased to 99 million (2011:  178 million), mostly due to a decrease in  operating profit of 53 million, an increase   in exceptional items of 35 million, offset  by a decrease in the IAS 19 finance charge  of 11 million.  Earnings per share Basic EPS from continuing operations was  12.8 pence per share (2011: 22.4 pence per  share). Underlying EPS, which excludes the  Invensys Pension Plan (US) settlement loss  of 3 million, was 13.4 pence per share  (2011: 19.8 pence per share). Free cash flow Free cash flow for the year was a 11 million  outflow (2011: 83 million inflow). The  reduced free cash flow was mainly driven  by lower operating cash flow, higher  finance costs (including the refinancing  facility fees) and additional payments into  the Invensys Pension Plan (US).  Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 29  Financial Review continued Total equity Total equity increased by 27 million,  principally represented by the net profit of  99 million, offset by the IAS 19 actuarial  losses of 31 million, dividends paid of  33million and 16 million to purchase  anddispose of non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests The non-controlling interests balance was  20 million (2011: 35 million), the majority  of which relates to Ranco Japan Limited.  The reduction in the non-controlling  interests balance since 31 March 2011  isdue to the final distribution of 6 million  to the minority interest in Baan Company  NV (in liquidation) and the 10 million  purchase  of the minority interest in a  Chinese subsidiary, Shanghai Foxboro  Company Limited.  Net cash Net cash was 262 million (2011: 348  million). The reduction in net cash was  primarily due to a free cash outflow of 11  million, dividend payments of 33 million,  16 million to purchase and dispose of  non-controlling interests, a 10 million  legal settlement, and a 7 million adverse  exchange movement. Capital employed Capital employed increased by 113  million to 314 million in the year, mainly  attributable to the profit in the year of  99million. Capital employed includes  operating capital of 440 million (2011:  390 million), generating a return of 35.5%  (2011: 49.9%). Pension liabilities and funding The IAS 19 valuation of pension assets and  liabilities as at 31 March 2012 resulted in a  net pension liability of 426 million (2011:  467 million). The overall decrease is the  result of deficit reduction payments made  throughout the year of 80 million, partially  offset by net actuarial losses of 31 million. Final agreement has been reached with the  Trustees of the Invensys Pension Scheme  (UK) concerning the triennial valuation and  funding deficit as at 31 March 2011 of  235million, compared with 285 million  as at 31 March 2008. Consequently, there  isno change to the deficit funding  contribution schedule previously agreed  with the Trustees, which requires us to pay  39 million per annum (increasing by  inflation) to 2017. In the Invensys Pension Plan (US), gross  liabilities will be reduced by 57 million  following a settlement with a number  ofdeferred plan members. This has  resulted in a settlement loss of 3 million  recognised as an exceptional item in  theyear. Dividend The Board is recommending a final  dividend of 2.75 pence per share  (2011:2.5pence per share), resulting in  total dividends for the year of 4.4 pence  pershare (2011: 4.0 pence per share). Summary and conclusions With the new five-year bank facilities  inplace and agreement of the Invensys  Pension Scheme (UK) triennial review,  weenter the new financial year with a  sound financial base. This will enable  ustocontinue with the investment in  ourstrategy.  David Thomas  Chief Financial Officer 30  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Financial Policies  Statement of accounting policies The Groups Financial Statements  havebeen prepared in accordance with  International Financial Reporting Standards  (IFRSs) in issue that are endorsed by the  European Commission and effective at  31March 2012. The Groups accounting  policies under IFRSs are set out in Note 2  tothe Group Financial Statements on  pages 87 to 95. The Parent Company  Financial Statements have been prepared  in accordance with UK Generally Accepted  Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) and  include details of the Companys  accounting policies. Treasury policy The Groups treasury policy is approved  bythe Board and seeks to ensure that: 	 appropriate	financial	resources	are	 available for the maintenance and  development of the Group; 	 the	financial	risk	of	currency,	interest	 rateand counterparty credit exposure  isunderstood, measured and managed  appropriately; and  	 the	Treasury	department	operates	as	 acost centre and that no speculative  transactions are undertaken.  Funding, liquidity and treasury  management Operating within the strict controls of  theGroups treasury policy, the Treasury  department manages this financial risk,  ensuring that sufficient funding and liquidity  are available to meet the expected needs  of the Group together with a prudent level  of headroom to allow for cash flow and  bank guarantee variability. In addition to  the free cash flow of the Group, Invensys  adopts a flexible approach to liquidity  management using a mixture of long-term  debt facilities and short-term cash  deposits. Funding is provided by bank  facilities which mature in March 2017. The  undrawn level of these facilities together  with the Groups cash balances are the key  measures of the Groups liquidity. Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to risk arising from  the effect of changes in floating interest  rates on the level of interest it receives on  its cash deposits. As at 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011,  Invensys had no significant borrowings. Currency risk Transaction exposure Currency transaction exposure arises  whenbusiness units face revenue or  costsin acurrency other than their own.  The incidence of this risk varies across  theGroup and is subject to change.  However, the majority of revenue and  costswill usually be in the functional  currency of thebusiness undertaking  thetransaction. Where this is not the case  and the exposure is significant, it is the  Groups policy for the units to hedge their  exposure. The Group predominantly uses  forward currency contracts to manage  transaction exposure. The Group is also  subject to exchange risk when making bids,  particularly on major contracts, where  movements against the specific exchange  rate assumed within abid would lead to  achange in the anticipated margin on the  contract should the bid be successful.  Thisexposure to contract risk is hedged  ifsignificant. Translation exposure The majority of the Groups operating  capital is employed in overseas locations  and is denominated in foreign currencies,  particularly US dollars. As a consequence,  changes in exchange rates affect both net  asset values and reported results. This risk  isnot hedged directly but, to the extent  that the Group has debt, any that is held  inforeign currencies would reduce the  level of net assets exposed to currency  fluctuations. The interest expense related  to such debt would also reduce the level  ofearnings exposed to exchange rate  movements. Credit risk The Group monitors the identity of the  counterparties with whom it deposits cash  and transacts other financial instruments  soas to control exposure to any territory  orinstitution. As far as it is both feasible  and practical to do so, cash is held  centrallyby the Treasury department.  Riskis assessed using ratings from major  credit rating agencies.  Further information on the risks arising  from financial instruments is included in  Note 22 to the Group Financial Statements.

We believe  thatby acting as a responsible global citizen, we will not only help minimise  business risk but also enhance our reputation as a business partner. Introduction and summary  As Chief Executive, I am pleased to present  a summary of our approach to corporate  responsibility, governance and the progress  we have made in the year. Corporate  responsibility, also referred to as  sustainability, is a guiding principle that  isintrinsic to our value proposition and  operations and it influences the way we  interact with our customers, communities,  employees and shareholders.  Our commitment to reduce the  environmental footprint of our operations  and to provide a safe workplace remain  high priorities. This past year, we exceeded  our 2% environmental key performance  indicator (KPI) reduction targets at our  manufacturing sites for energy use, carbon  emissions and water use, but missed our  reduction targets for waste generation.  Additionally, we have maintained our  leadership position in safety performance  with injury/illness incident frequency   rates that reflect our effective   management systems.  In the UK, Invensys was again listed on the  FTSE4Good Index Series, which identifies  companies that meet recognised  standards of corporate responsibility.   For the third consecutive year, Invensys   was listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability  Indexes (DJSI) in recognition of our  economic, environmental and social  performance. Invensys renewed its  participation in the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC) and we again reported  our greenhouse gas emissions to the  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Lastly,  Invensys has been recertified under the  Carbon Trust Standard by achieving  reductions in carbon emissions at our   UK operations over the past two years. This year, having engaged with several  hundred of our team members, we  refreshed our Invensys Values in order   to make them more relevant and  understandable. We continue to invest   in the development of all our people by  increasing the use of our iGrow learning  management system and by launching   a new senior leadership development  programme Leading Execution. We  improved our organisation effectiveness  by placing greater accountability upon   the business divisions, making some key  changes in our leadership teams and  aligning incentives more clearly and  directly with the areas of direct  responsibility.  Our Sustainability Report 2012, which  will be available for download from  ourwebsite, provides further details  ofour achievements and developments  in theyear.

Building a successful and sustainable  business requires strong values, strong  governance and internal communication.  Invensys corporate responsibility strategy  is driven by myself, as Chief Executive, and  implemented by the Group Leadership  Team, where key members with the  necessary expertise ensure that aspects  ofcorporate responsibility are embedded  throughout the Group. Further detail   on governance is set out in the relevant  sections that follow including discussion  ontargets and performance regarding  ourKPIs. Our approach to corporate  governance is set out in the Corporate  Governance section on pages 48 to 59. The principal risks which are specific to and  may impact our business are set out in the  Risks and Uncertainties section on pages  37 to 44. In addition to these risks, there are  other sustainability-related risks associated  with our overall business and our business  divisions which are not considered to be as  significant as these key risks, and are  therefore not discussed in this report.  Environment: reducing our  environmental footprint Environmental performance For the past year, we set a 2% absolute  reduction target at our manufacturing  locations for our environmental KPIs, which  include energy use, CO2 emissions, water  use, non-hazardous waste and hazardous  waste generation. Energy use and CO2  emissions within our manufacturing  locations on a same site basis decreased by  3% and 5% respectively, as a result of the  execution of KPI efficiency projects across  all divisions. Similarly, on a same site basis,  water consumption decreased by 8%,  non-hazardous waste generation increased  by 4% and hazardous waste generation  increased by 3%. For the current year, we  have again set a 2% absolute reduction  target for each of the KPIs. At our non-manufacturing sites, our  energyand CO2 emissions increased by  7%and 8% respectively on a same site  basis. These increases were due to the  expansion of several large operations.  We continue to encourage our site and  regional operations to seek external  management system certification, and   we have eight operations certified to the  ISO 14001 environmental management  system standard.  The Board continues to be briefed on  Group environmental performance and  receives regular reports on KPI reduction  progress and any violations or  environmental releases that occur. In the  past year, there were no environmental  releases or fines related to environmental  regulations. In the US, one minor notice of  violation was received for failing to update  agroundwater monitoring plan at a surplus  property. All deficiencies were corrected. Invensys also completed all requirements  under a Civil Sanctions enforcement  agreement entered into with the UK  Environment Agency related to a self- reported non-compliance finding in   the prior year under the UKs Producer  Responsibility (Packaging Waste)  regulations.

Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 33  Corporate Responsibility continued Social: our people and   our communities The health and safety of our employees  remains the highest priority. Health and safety in the workplace We are pleased to report that we have  maintained our world-class health and  safety performance, as reflected in our  injury/illness incident frequency rates.  From April 2011 to the end of March 2012,  our TRCIR remained constant at 0.18,  whileour Lost Workday Case Incident Rate  (LWCIR) 1 fell slightly from 0.06 to 0.05.  Overthe past four years, our TRCIR has  fallen 42% and our LWCIR has fallen 67%.  Our Safety and Sustainability Awareness  Metric (SSAM) is the model we use to drive  and measure several leading activities  atanoperational level. The SSAM, which  ismeasured and reported monthly,  includes on-time closure of corrective  actions, near misses, completion of safety  training, safety tours/inspections, and the  implementation of priority programmes  across the business and operations. We grant recognition awards to those  locations and business operations that  demonstrate consistently strong safety  performance. As of 31 March 2012,  25locations had reached the safety  milestone of one million hours or more  worked without a recordable incident.  We continue to support external  management certifications and four  operations are certified to the  Occupational Health and Safety  Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001  safetymanagement system standard.  As Chief Executive, I review health and  safety performance data, including any  violations or major incidents, on a monthly  basis and present this to the Board. In  addition, site leaders and management  teams review each recordable incident  tofully understand the root causes of  accidents and ensure adequate corrective  actions are implemented.  We are pleased to report that there were  no major incidents or work-related fatalities  during the year. During inspections by  Alignment with the Invensys Values is  considered integral to the performance of  our employees and has been supported  with personal messages from Group  Leadership Team members, workshops  that are designed to be built into team  meetings and with new recognition  arrangements. The key messages of the  Invensys brand and its values have been  clarified and made relevant to current  andpotential Invensys employees through  an employer branding initiative. This is  intended to retain and attract highly  capable and ambitious people to Invensys  who are drawn to a high-performance  workculture. Diversity and inclusion in the workforce Invensys seeks to recruit the best individual  for every position regardless of gender,  ethnic or national origin, religion, sexual  orientation or any personal characteristic  including disability, not relevant to their work.  Invensys fosters an inclusive culture where  anyone with the skills and abilities to  perform is treated fairly. We embrace the  diversity of our employees and the greater  effectiveness a diverse workforce allows  usto offer our customers. We continue to  respect and support the principles of the  European Convention on Human Rights  and the UNGC by ensuring we comply  withthe labour laws of the countries in  which weoperate and by creating an  inclusive and respectful culture for our  diverse workforce.  Invensys is committed to equal opportunities  and supportive of the recommendations  ofLord Davies and the Financial Reporting  Council regarding diversity. This is  reflected in the wide range of international  backgrounds and skills of our directors,  aswell as the appointment of two female  directors to the Board in 2011. We also  recognise the importance of diversity  below the Board level and have launched a  renewed diversity strategy with Board-level  sponsorship and a broader range of  diversity initiatives being launched over  thecoming year. Additionally, the Invensys  Womens Exchange is an established  resource group within Invensys Operations  Management that provides support,  education and networking opportunities  within Invensys and with our customers.  government officials, we received a  safety-related citation at a location in  Brazilrelated to the lack of ergonomic  equipment and an order to control noise  levels affecting neighbouring properties.  We also received safety-related citations  atlocations in China related to lack of  personal protective equipment use,  required risk assessments and required  emergency planning and fire protection  protocols. Corrective actions are being  taken and no further notices or fines have  been received.  We continue to encourage our divisions  and employees to engage with good  causes to build relationships in the  community and enhance workplace  morale and cohesiveness.  Community and charitable investment Our businesses provide a variety of  programmes including Invensys Involved  which encompasses sponsorship of  activities, use of company resources and  paid volunteer time to allow our employees  to participate actively in community events.  We used the opportunity afforded by the  relationship with one of our partners to  highlight our employees involvement  incommunity activity. This gave us the  chance to nominate one of our people to  carry the Olympic torch. Our torch bearer  was selected from our employees who  make an exceptional contribution to  charities or their communities. Information on our levels of charitable  contribution is set out in the Directors  Report on page 77. We strive to make Invensys a place where  high-performing people choose to be,  where they can enhance their lives and  careers and are motivated to perform at  their best. Invensys Values  This year we have refreshed our Invensys  Values in order to ensure they remain  relevant, understandable and reflect  theaspirations of our people. We have  retained: Innovation, Agility and Integrity  and replaced Courage and Meritocracy  with Performance. These changes  resultedfrom an extensive series of surveys  and focus groups involving employees  across Invensys.  1 The injury/illness frequency rate that results in lost time  inthe workplace per 100 employees per annum. Further  details regarding health and safety performance can be  found on our website. 34  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Communication and engagement   with employee representatives   and employees Regular and open communication is vital  tomaintaining engaged teams and  Invensys utilises many media including  regular updates from myself, an Invensys- wide intranet, global All Hands calls and  local communications networks, including  site-level briefings, smaller face-to-face  meetings and employee newsletters. Invensys has established the use of  blogging through initiatives such as  iShare and is increasingly using social  networking technologies to facilitate fast  and open communication between  employees and to realise the performance  advantages of sharing knowledge and  bestpractices across our divisions. We also recognise our obligation and the  benefits arising from consulting through  more formal channels such as the Invensys  European Employees Forum (IEEF), which  promotes dialogue between elected  employee representatives and senior  management. The annual meeting  between IEEF representatives and senior  management has been running for 13 years. Aligning our people with the Groups  goals and objectives During the year we use our goal deployment  and performance management tools  andprocesses to helpour employees  understand the organisational goals and  objectives of Invensys and align them with  their own. Line managers are required to  hold annual performance reviews with all  employees who report to them, where  theycan discuss their performance, set  personal objectives for the coming year  and create personal development plans.  Approximately 11,000 managerial,  professional and technical employees are  participating in our online performance  management processes with goals for  2012/13 on our integrated system.  Otheremployees, such as those in  manufacturing, are participating in local  performance management processes. Developing our leadership and   our talent  We continue to focus on growing our  capability and enabling internal career  moves through our Organisational  Capability Review (OCR) process. This  process takes place across Invensys and  over the past year at a corporate level has  led to the creation of robust succession  plans for 57 senior leadership roles. OCR  has also enabled the identification of key  talent across the Group with 37 High  Potential and High Professionals in our  leadership population and 35 considered   to be Rising Talent. Each of these  employees has an individual development  plan, completion of which is tracked and  reported on and is actively supported to  achieve their potential through quarterly  talent reviews with our Group Leadership  Team. We also have a range of division- or  function-based talent development  programmes including our Programme  for Action Learning and Mentoring (PALM)  in Invensys Operations Management and  Functional Expert to Business Partner  across our finance and legal functions.  Last year we launched a new set of Invensys  competencies following extensive external  benchmarking and internal research  drawing on inputs from over 200 of our  own high-performing leaders. These new  competencies have been embedded in  ourperformance management system  andform the basis for the assessment  ofour leadership and our top talent. Investing in our leadership and   delivery capability Our Learning and Development Centre   of Expertise (CoE) has become well- established and, utilising seven languages,  has this year delivered over 82,000 hours  ofonline training. Whilst nearly 450 senior  managers have participated in our new  programmes Leading Leaders and  Leading Execution, the CoE has focused  increasingly on core Invensys capabilities   with the delivery of our new Project   Taking responsibility for the future.  InvensysRail, UK, graduate engineers  helped local students to explore the world  of engineering. Helping the environment. Invensys  Operations Management, US, engaged  invarious clean-up and repair projects  following a devastating autumn snow storm. Supporting our community. Invensys  Controls, Mexico, introduced A Toy =  ASmile programme. Over 450 toys were  collected for local children. Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 35  Corporate Responsibility continued Management Development Curriculum   containing over 60 learning modules.  Thisyear, more than 500 employees  havecompleted over 7,000 hours of online  and instructor-led project management  training. We continue to focus on the  development of our talent through  assessing the capability of our project  management, sales and engineering  professionals and to date we have assessed  the competence and development needs  of over 4,000 ofour people. Employee engagement As previously reported, we conducted an  Invensys-wide Employee Engagement  Survey in November 2010 which achieved a  response rate of 83%, up from 78% in 2008.  We were pleased to see our employee  engagement levels compare positively with  our global external benchmarks. Action  plans were developed and implemented to  build on the feedback and a further survey  during 2012 will assesswhether we have  been successful inachieving further  improved results in levels of engagement. Governance: ensuring responsible,  ethical and honest behaviour Our corporate responsibility strategy is  underpinned by our business principles  and Code of Conduct which stress the  importance of responsible, ethical and  honest behaviour.  The Invensys Code of Conduct The Invensys Code of Conduct both  describes and represents our commitment  to responsible business and is the  foundation of our broader Compliance  Programme. Under the terms of the Code  of Conduct, our employees undertake to  work with integrity as representatives of  Invensys and in accordance with both local  laws and our own standards of ethical  behaviour. Where the Code of Conduct is  more exacting than local laws or standards,  the Code of Conduct must be followed. The Board is given regular updates on  compliance issues by the Chief Legal  Officer and Company Secretary. The Chief  Executive and Group Human Resources  Director receive regular briefings from  theChief Legal Officer and Company  Secretary where any concerns can be  raised. Legal and ethical compliance is  recognised as a priority for Invensys. The Code of Conduct is available on the  Invensys website and can be read by any  customer, shareholder or member of the  public. Invensys has adopted a Supplier  Code of Conduct based on our Code of  Conduct and is having major suppliers  agree to the same (or have in place a similar  code of conduct of their own) as a  condition for doing business with us. The Code of Conduct is supported by  periodic training for all employees and the  Board. All new employees must complete  Code of Conduct training within the first  month of employment. As part of our effort  to promote the Code of Conduct and our  Helpline, Invensys has produced a range   of supporting materials including Helpline  posters, abridged versions of the Code of  Conduct and other presentation materials  which are displayed at Invensys facilities  and are available in multiple languages on  the Invensys intranet. The Code of Conduct, together with  supporting policies and associated training  are the core elements in the latest iteration  of the Compliance Programme. During the  year, we launched further training on  specific areas of compliance and offered  refresher courses in our Learning  Management System on critical areas of  theCode of Conduct, such as Anti-Bribery,  Gifts and Entertainment and Conflicts   of Interest. Looking forward This report demonstrates how we have  continued to implement our strategy of  embedding corporate responsibility into  our operations. We have made progress  inreducing our environmental footprint  ina number of areas, and in increasing  efficiency even as our business has  developed over the last year. Furthermore,  we continue to insist that our suppliers  conduct business in an ethical and  responsible manner. For the coming year, our priorities centre  on building on the work we have achieved  to date. We will focus on working with our  businesses to further accentuate the  positive environmental benefits that many  of our products and services help deliver   in the marketplace. We will look to further  reduce our environmental footprint  through improvements in our KPI reduction  programme – as noted on page 33 our  reduction target is 2%. Employee safety,  whether in the workplace or at offsite  locations, will continue to be a major  priority and therefore we will look for  additional ways to keep our employees  safe and continually improve our safety  record. We will also continue to emphasise  legal compliance across the organisation. In terms of our people, we intend to  continue investing in improving employee  engagement across the business and will  conduct an Employee Engagement Survey  in November 2012, followed by detailed  action planning and change initiatives.  Ensuring that we attract and develop the  diverse talents available to us, both within  and outside Invensys, will also be a priority  as will further investment in skills, especially  in project management and in ensuring we  have engineering capability embedded in  our rapidly developing markets. We will  also continue to improve understanding  and awareness of our employer brand in  the marketplace so that we increase pride  in working for Invensys and in making our  organisation a more distinctive and  aspirational place to work.  Finally, we will continue to seek out  opportunities to bring the talents and  energy of our employees and business   to bear on local community challenges. Wayne Edmunds Chief Executive 36  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Risks and Uncertainties Introduction to our approach  andappetite for risk The effective understanding, acceptance  and management of risk is fundamental to  the long-term success of Invensys. Every  single employee has a role to play in this  process and the Invensys risk management  policy recognises that success relies on the  ability to work together cohesively to  address this.  The consistent application of the Invensys  Code of Conduct (see page 36) is a key  control in maintaining the strong reputation  of the Group with regard to customers,  regulatory bodies and employees.  Our businesses have developed specialist  knowledge in products, services, processes  and regions which allows us to understand  the associated risks and accept them in  aninformed way. Our approach is  encapsulated in the key principles of  ourrisk management policy: 	 To	understand	the	nature	and	extent	 ofrisks facing the Group; 	 To	accept	and	manage	within	the	 business those risks which our  employees have the skills and expertise  to understand and leverage; 	 To	assess	and	transfer	or	avoid	those	 risks which are beyond our appetite  forrisk; and 	 By	consideration	of	materiality	to	 establish the authority levels within  Invensys at which decisions on  acceptance and mitigation of these  risksare taken. Each division and key functional  department is required to undertake a  formal review of risks. The resulting risk  registers are maintained and reviewed on  amonthly basis. These are consolidated  and reviewed by the Head of Risk and,  onaquarterly basis, a summary of the  Groups key risks is then presented to the  Risk Committee and Audit Committee. The Risk Committee has accountability   for overseeing the risk management  processes and procedures, and reports   to the Board through the Audit Committee  on the key risks facing the Group. It also  monitors the mitigating actions put in place  by the relevant operational managers to  address the identified risks. Membership  ofthe Risk Committee is set out on page 47. The Board has approved the acceptance   of certain risks which are considered  appropriate to achieve the Groups  strategic objectives. The degree of risk   to be accepted within the business is  managed on a day-to-day basis through  the Board Delegated Authority levels.  These provide the framework for informed  risk taking within the businesses and the  route for escalating decision making up   to the Board.  Key developments in the year Our risk management approach is subject  to continuous review and updating to take  account of new and developing issues  which might impact our business  objectives. The following actions have  been undertaken during the year to  address significant developments: 	 The	Group	has	improved	its	processes	 and procedures to manage major  contracts; 	 We	have	managed	the	financial	 pressures on our home markets,  particularly with regards to our Invensys  Rail business in Spain, by continuing to  grow our presence in emerging markets; 	 The	diverse	range	of	economic,	 geopolitical and accidental external  global events has prompted a review and  updating of the crisis management and  business continuity planning across the  Group; and  	 We	have	conducted	an	independent	 external review of risk management  practices and have adopted an  enhanced governance process   to reflect the findings of the review.

The Invensys approach is consistent with ISO  31000, the international risk management  standard, and has been subject to external  review and updating to take account of  developing risk governance practices. Principal risks Invensys operates globally in varied  markets and is affected by a number of  risks inherent in its activities, not all of  which are within its control. Some of these  risks and uncertainties are common to  other companies, for example: changes  ineconomic conditions including the  impact of austerity measures and currency  and interest rate fluctuations; changes in  taxation legislation; the cost of materials;  the recruitment and retention of skilled  personnel; the impact of competition;  andpolitical stability in the countries  wherewe operate or undertake contracts.  Some of these common risks and  uncertainties are subject to significant  change, the impact of which may be  difficult to predict.   Invensys has undertaken a review of certain  country risks. This is shown on pages 43  and 44 and uses the Groups revenue by  destination as a proxy for the relative   level of exposure in each case. The principal risks which are specific to  andmay impact the Group are outlined  onpages 40 to 42. In addition, there may  be other risks and uncertainties which  areunknown to the Group or which could  become material in the future. These  risksmay cause the Groups results to  varymaterially from historic and  expectedresults. Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 39  Risks and Uncertainties continued Description of risk  Failure to maintain a competitive and technologically advanced product  range could reduce margins and revenue growth Invensys operates in highly competitive markets and the Groups products  and services are characterised by continually evolving industry standards  and rapidly changing technology, driven by the demands of the Groups  customers. As illustrations of this, Invensys Rail continues to invest in the  development of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and  Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) which are becoming globally  adopted standards of signalling and train control. Invensys Operations  Management continues to invest in enhancements to its systems, advanced  software applications and enterprise control offerings to optimise plant  performance for our global customers. Impact Failure to keep pace with technological  changes and system or application  requirements in the industrial sectors may  result in loss of market share and lower  margins. Furthermore, delays to development  programmes may adversely impact the  delivery of major projects. Mitigation The Group invests in research and  development to create new technologies and  products to sustain or improve its competitive  position. However, all new technologies and  products involve business risk in terms of  possible abortive expenditure including asset  impairments, reputational risk and customer  claims. The Group reviews its portfolio of  technologies as part of the strategic planning  process. In addition, the divisions control  individual development programmes through  a regular review process. The timing and frequency of substantial contract awards are uneven The revenue of Invensys Rail depends on a small number of large railway  operators, both in our traditional core markets in the UK, Iberia, North  America and Australia and in new markets. New contract awards are often  associated with major transport infrastructure upgrades, and as a result are  by nature large and infrequent.  Invensys Operations Management is associated with the supply of  technology, software and consulting to the oil and gas, chemical and  nuclear industries. Capital expenditure requirements from customers in  these industries are often highly cyclical and linked to the international  supply, demand and pricing of hydrocarbons. Also the timing of new  contract awards in the nuclear industry may be impacted if certain nuclear  programmes are subject to delay or cancellation. Impact The timing of contract awards is uncertain and  delays in awards may result in volatility in the  order book and our operating performance.  Major projects may also impact the business  mix because a substantial element of the  contract may be supplied by third parties.   In addition, the opportunity to develop control  and safety systems for the nuclear industry may  lead to an increased dependence on a small  number of major customers for Invensys  Operations Management.  Mitigation The Group monitors its order pipeline, sales  activity, sales cover in its order book, expected  margins and the impact of potential delays  onthe expected results to allow appropriate  mitigating actions to be considered.  40  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Description of risk  Undertaking large, long-term projects exposes the Group to risk of loss A significant amount of the Groups business involves long-term projects  that can take many months or even years to complete. These projects  maybe subject to delays and cost overruns due to delays in technology  development, equipment deliveries, engineering problems, work  stoppages, unanticipated cost increases, shortages of materials or skilled  labour or other unforeseen problems inherent in the nature of such projects. Impact The Groups failure to anticipate technical and  development problems, estimate costs  accurately, control delivery or receive timely  payments may reduce the profitability of such  acontract, impact cash collection or result in  aloss.  Mitigation The Group has an established process with  clear delegated authorities for the approval  ofmajor contracts, which includes a review  system for the approval of bids submitted to  customers. Contracts with a large monetary  value or non-standard contractual terms  require Board approval. During the year certain  contract execution issues were identified in  Invensys Rails Asia Pacific operations and  ournuclear projects in China within Invensys  Operations Management. This has prompted  an in-depth internal review with the result that  systems have been further improved and  additional risk metrics have been established  to monitor the execution of such major  projects. These are subject to regular reporting  to the Board.  The Group may be subject to financial loss and/or damage to its  reputation as a result of product liability claims Errors and defects in the Groups products, systems or applications, which  may be used in safety-critical applications, could cause injury to persons or  damage to property and equipment or be the subject of product recalls. Impact These occurrences could result in claims, loss  of revenue, warranty costs, costs and damages  associated with product recalls, litigation,  delays in market acceptance or harm to the  Groups reputation for safety and quality.  Mitigation Each division has an established quality control  function and, if an event occurs, there are  processes to investigate and manage the  occurrence. The Group may be exposed to liability through the actions of  consortium partners, cosource partners or its supply chain The business activities of the Group are often conducted with consortia,  with joint and several liability between consortium partners, and/or with  cosource partners whose day-to-day management actions are outside  ofthe control of the Group. A significant element of the Groups risk profile  is the delivery performance of its supply chain. These partnerships exist  across our businesses. For example, Invensys Rail often undertakes  contracts with consortium partners in traditional core markets and in   new ordeveloping markets. Impact Given the nature of the Groups business mix,  aquality or other failure in the supply chain  could present a risk to safety and delivery  which might have a material adverse effect on  the Groups business, financial performance  and/or reputation. There is also a risk that  regulatory non-compliance of partners could  have a material adverse effect on the Groups  reputation. Mitigation Assessment, mitigation and management  ofthese risks are addressed by the divisions  inconjunction with our legal and risk  departments. In-depth due diligence on  partners is undertaken where considered  appropriate, and cross-indemnities entered  into to mitigate liability. Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 41  Risks and Uncertainties continued Description of risk  The Group may be exposed to additional liabilities with respect to its  UKand US pension plans The Group has a large level of gross liabilities in respect of its major pension  plans relative to its market capitalisation.  Impact With respect to both of the Groups major  pension plans for its UK and US operations, any  decline in the equity market, improvements in  life expectancy, changes in expected morbidity  rates, long periods of low inflation or deflation  or future decreases in interest rates could  increase the funding deficit and require  additional funding contributions in excess   of those currently expected. Mitigation The Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) has a high  proportion of pensioners relative to its active  workforce which provides a level of certainty  with respect to the valuation of the plans  liabilities. In addition, its investment policy  hasbeen established to address the need to  match the scheme assets and liabilities as far  asis realistically possible. The current Invensys  Pension Scheme (UK) deficit funding  contribution schedule was agreed on the basis  of a valuation undertaken at 31 March 2011,  and anticipates deficit recovery contributions  being made on asix-monthly basis until March  2017. In addition, the Invensys Pension Plan (US)  was recently de-risked by reducing the number  ofdeferred participants. TheGroup regularly  monitors the performance of the principal UK  and US plans.  The Group is subject to ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities As a consequence of the past disposal of a significant number of businesses,  the Group has, or may incur, certain liabilities in relation to environmental  claims (including the cost associated with the remediation of contaminated  sites no longer owned by the Group), disputed taxes, litigation (including  personal injury claims arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and silica),  indemnity claims and other disposal costs relating to the disposed businesses.  These risks have receded over time as warranties and indemnities in relation  to past disposals have expired, existing disputes have been settled and  remediation work on contaminated sites has been completed. The Group  also has environmental liabilities in relation to the remediation of vacant sites  which it owns. Impact All of these liabilities are subject to a number of  uncertainties, assumptions and contingencies,  and there can be no assurance that the  liabilities will not be substantially higher or  become payable sooner than anticipated, or  that the provisions in the Groups accounts in  respect of any such liabilities will be sufficient. Mitigation The Group continually monitors the remaining  liabilities and has established performance  indicators to support regular reporting to the  Board. The indicators include cash spend,  provisions, insurance recoveries and estimated  exposures. The Group regularly reviews the  related provisions and aims in negotiations to  limit the risk of future liabilities or disputes.  42  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Country risks Invensys is a global organisation with its  own facilities, supply chain and customers  in many countries across the world. There  are diverse country risks to address in  certain core markets, including financial  risks relating to the Eurozone crisis, and  risks in new and developing markets,  including Asia, South America and the  Middle East.  Invensys has undertaken a review of the  following country risks in respect of those  territories where we earn revenue:  	 Financial	risk	utilising	the	rating	categories	 published by credit agency Moodys; 	 Political	stability	risk	utilising	the	risk	 categories published by Control Risks  Group;  	 Security	risk	utilising	the	risk	categories	 published by Control Risks Group; and 	 Corruption	risk	utilising	the	risk	ratings	 published by Transparency International. Revenue by destination has been analysed  and categorised in accordance with rating  criteria obtained from appropriate external  sources1. The charts overleaf illustrate   the profile of country risk for the Groups  revenue by destination and outline the  broad mitigation actions in place to  address these. 1 Financial risk rating categories are based on the  Sovereign Rating lists for Government Bonds using  information freely available from Moodys at   www.moodys.com   Political stability risk and security risk categories are as  published by Control Risks Group at www.controlrisks.com    Adapted from Corruption Perception Index  Methodology Copyright 2011 Transparency  International: the global coalition against corruption.

Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 43  Risks and Uncertainties continued Description of risk  Financial risk The global economy has continued to experience a sovereign debt crisis with  particular concern within the Eurozone. Invensys maintains oversight of its exposures  by analysing the revenue by destination for all territories against published rating  categories1. This is summarised in the adjacent chart. Mitigation Key financial risks including liquidity needs, partner/supply chain exposure and cash  management have been identified. Measures have been taken to minimise exposures  and crisis management plans have been established to respond to developing scenarios. Financial risk exposure (%) Political stability risk Political risk considers the likelihood of state or political influences negatively  affecting business operations in a country through regime instability or direct/ indirect interference. The adjacent chart illustrates the Invensys exposure using   the country ratings as published by Control Risks Group1.  Mitigation Invensys analyses current and developing issues and maintains crisis management  plans designed to respond to threats and safeguard the business operations. Political stability risk exposure (%) Security risk Security risk considers the likelihood of state or non-state engagement in actions that  harm the financial, physical and human assets of a company and the extent to which  the state is willing and able to protect those assets. The adjacent chart illustrates   the Invensys exposure using the security country risk ratings published by Control  Risks Group1. Mitigation Invensys analyses current and developing issues and maintains crisis management  plans designed to safeguard people, assets and the business. Security risk exposure (%) Corruption risk (anti-bribery compliance) The Corruption Perception Index published by Transparency International1 ranks  countries according to their perceived levels of public sector corruption. A score of 10  is considered very clean and a score of zero is highly corrupt. Invensys has considered  its revenue by destination against this index for all territories and this is shown on the  adjacent chart. Mitigation Invensys has a zero tolerance approach to bribery and maintains a programme of  communication and education for employees and partners. Particular focus is appropriate  in higher-risk territories to ensure that Group policy is understood and enforced. Corruption risk exposure (%) 1 See footnote on previous page.

Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 47  Corporate Governance Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present our Corporate  Governance report which outlines  therole and activities of the Board.  Reports from our committee chairmen  are set out on pages 54 to 74.  The Company is committed to high  standards of corporate governance  andbelieves that it has in place  effectivepractices which are essential  to business integrity, performance  andaccountability to shareholders.  TheBoard is pleased to confirm that  during the year the Company has  beenfully compliant with the provisions  of the UK Corporate Governance Code  (the Code). Directors recognise the importance  ofBoard behaviour and culture, and  understand that they must think deeply,  thoroughly and on a continuing basis  about their role and responsibilities.  This year we conducted an externally- facilitated Board evaluation and, as  reported on page 51, I am pleased to  confirm that the review concluded that  the Board worked effectively as a team.  We have closely followed the debates  on boardroom diversity and during  theyear there have been a number of  changes to the Board. We were pleased  to welcome Deena Mattar as a new  non-executive director and were  delighted with the appointment of  David Thomas and Victoria Hull as  executive directors. We have a breadth  of skills and experience on the Board  and we have a very good platform for  the future. The Board evaluation  confirmed that each director is  contributing effectively and showing  strong commitment to their role. In  accordance with the provisions of the  Code and following the practice of   last year, all Board directors will seek  re-election (or election in the case   of Mr Thomas and Ms Hull) at the   2012 AGM.  I hope that this report will provide a  good understanding of the systems of  governance and control which operate  within the Company. Sir Nigel Rudd Chairman The Board Role The Board is collectively responsible for  promoting the success of the Company by  directing and supervising the Companys  affairs to create shareholder value. The  Board provides entrepreneurial leadership  and sets the Companys strategic aims.   In doing this it ensures there are robust  corporate governance and risk  management processes in place. The governance framework for the Group  is shown on page 47. The Boards duties  areset out in a formal schedule of matters  specifically reserved for decision by the  Board, as summarised below. Certain  responsibilities are delegated to Board  committees through structured  procedures. The chairman of each  committee provides an oral update on   the activities of their committee at the   next Board meeting. A report from the  Nominating Committee, Audit Committee  and Remuneration Committee is included  on pages 54 to 74. Other operational  matters are dealt with by senior  management through formalised  delegated authorities.

The table does not include   his attendance at meetings while he was Acting Chief Financial Officer. 4  Mr Caio was unable to attend some meetings due to prior commitments. All absences were approved in advance with  theChairman or committee chairmen as relevant and Mr Caio provided input on relevant matters on the agendas before   the meetings. 5  Mr Green and Mr Lester were unable to attend the unscheduled Board meeting as it was called at such short notice. 6  Ms Mattar was appointed as a director on 19 May 2011 and her attendance is from this date. Meetings There is an agreed schedule of Board and  committee meetings. The adjacent table   sets out the attendance by directors at  Board and committee meetings. This  analysis only includes the committee  members attendance at meetings; in  addition to members, other directors  frequently attend meetings of committees  at the invitation of the respective  committee chairman.  The Board met nine times during the year,  eight of which were scheduled meetings  and one called at short notice. The  unscheduled meeting related to operational  matters as subsequently included in the  early release of the Q3 Interim Management  Statement. In addition to standing routine  matters, the summary below outlines other  matters considered by the Board and its  committees.  How the Board spent its time The chart below provides a summary of  thework of the Board and its committees  during the year. At each scheduled meeting the Board  received reports from the Chief Executive  on operational matters, the Chief Financial  Officer on financial performance and the  Chief Legal Officer on legal, regulatory   and compliance matters. The Board   spent considerable time during the year  providing constructive input into strategic  planning with a full day spent on the annual  strategic plan; this included discussions  with the divisional CEOs who attended this  session and made presentations. Other  areas of focus included the monitoring and  control of major projects, consideration   of the new banking facilities and renewal   of the Groups insurance programme.   All committee chairmen provided oral  updates on the activities of their  committees.  There were also informal meetings of the  Chairman and the non-executive directors  without the executive directors being  present. In addition, the non-executive   directors are in regular informal  communication with the executive  directors and other senior leaders. To increase the visibility of business  leadersto the Board, the divisional CEOs  join Board meetings on a rotational basis. Directors: composition and  independence There are currently 11 directors on the  Board, comprising the Chairman, seven  non-executive directors and three executive  directors. As reported in the 2011 Annual  Report, Deena Mattar was appointed a  non-executive director on 19 May 2011.   On 28 July 2011, David Thomas, who had  been Acting Chief Financial Officer of the  Group since March 2011, was appointed   to the role on a permanent basis and  became a director of the Company. In  addition, Victoria Hull, the Chief Legal  Officer, was appointed as a director of the  Company on 29 November 2011. The Board considers that all of the current  non-executive directors are independent.  The non-executive directors are drawn  from diverse international businesses and,  as illustrated on pages 46 and 47, bring   a range of skills and experience to enable  them to constructively challenge and  develop the Groups strategy and direction.

The Senior Independent Director is  Michael Parker, who has held this role since  December 2006. Mr Parker is available for  shareholders to contact through the  Investor Relations department and is also  responsible for leading the Chairmans  annual performance evaluation. Executive directors are not permitted to  hold more than one external non-executive  directorship, which is in line with the Code  requirement and assists in broadening  their experience for the benefit of the  Company. None of the executive directors  hold any external non-executive  directorships. Chairman and Chief Executive There is a clear division of responsibilities  between the Chairman and the Chief  Executive, which is defined in writing and  approved by the Board. The Chairman is  responsible for leadership of the Board and  ensuring its effectiveness. He facilitates the  contribution of the non-executive directors  and effective communication with  shareholders. He ensures that constructive  relations exist between the executive and  non-executive directors. The Chief  Executive is responsible for executing the  strategy approved by the Board for  leadership of the Group and management  of the business; he is supported by the  Group Leadership Team, as detailed in   the governance framework on page 47. Election and re-election of directors The Companys Articles of Association  require that any director appointed during  the year should stand for election at the  first Annual General Meeting (AGM)  following their appointment. In line with the  Code, all directors are required to seek  re-election by shareholders annually.  Following the evaluation of performance of  each director, the Board is proposing that  all directors stand for re-election at the  AGM on 13 July 2012. In addition, Victoria  Hull and David Thomas, who have joined  the Board since the 2011 AGM, will stand  for election at the 2012 AGM. Bay Green, non-executive director and  Chairman of the Audit Committee, has now  completed a seven-year term. Following   a rigorous review by the Nominating  Committee last year, it was concluded that  Mr Green had a range of skills which added  value to the Board and, as a result, they  recommended to the Board that his  appointment be extended and that   he continue as Chairman of the Audit  Committee. Following further review the  Board is still of this opinion and continues  to recommend the re-election of Mr Green  as a director. Michael Parker, non-executive director   and Senior Independent Director, will have  completed a six-year term in July 2012.  Following a rigorous review, the Nominating  Committee concluded that Mr Parker has  skills, experience and knowledge of value  to the Board and, as a result, recommended  to the Board the appointment of Mr Parker  be extended for a further three-year   term and that he continue as the Senior  Independent Director. In addition, the  Nominating Committee considered the  appointments of Sir Nigel Rudd, Francesco  Caio and Dr Martin Read, who will have all  completed three-year terms in July 2012,  and recommended their appointments  each be extended for a further three-year  term. Dr Martin Read will continue as the  Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.  The biographies of all directors are set out  on pages 46 and 47. Company Secretary The Company Secretary is Victoria Hull,  who is also Chief Legal Officer. She was  appointed as Company Secretary on  1January 2006 and acts as secretary   to allof the committees of the Board.   The Company Secretary is accountable   to the Board and advises on corporate  governance matters. She ensures that the  Board receives briefings on changes in  regulation and law, and that procedures  are followed. To enable the Board to  perform its duties, all directors have   full and timely access to all relevant  information and to the services of the  Company Secretary. The appointment   and removal of the Company Secretary is  decided upon by the Board as a whole. As detailed on page 49, Ms Hull was  appointed as a director during the year.  Itwas agreed by the Board that her  combination of legal skills and commercial  acumen would greatly assist the Boards  decision making. 50  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Board performance evaluation An annual review is undertaken of the  performance of the Board, committees  and individual directors. In line with the  Code and best practice, the Company  decided in 2011/12 to commission its   first independently-facilitated Board  performance evaluation. Following  areview of facilitators in the market,   Egon Zehnder, which does not have  anyother connection with the  Company,was appointed to conduct  theevaluation process.  The process began with a briefing  discussion with the Chairman and  Company Secretary. The approach that  Egon Zehnder adopted to conduct the  evaluation was to interview each Board  member and certain other senior leaders.  A structured discussion framework was  used so that the discussions were  appropriately structured and maximised  the value of time spent with individuals. The face-to-face discussions comprised  two parts. The first covered Board roles  and processes and the second part  addressed the style and content of  colleagues contributions to arrive at   an understanding of Board processes,   the behaviours of each member and   the Board as a whole.  The findings of the discussions were  presented to the Board by Egon Zehnder.  The review concluded that the Board   was aligned in its view of the main issues  facing the Company and that it worked  effectively as a team. Summary of 2012/13 actions The main themes arising from the  review, which were agreed would  formthe basisof the action plan for  further improvement in 2012/13,   were as follows: 	 Continue	the	focus	on	strategic	 discussions; 	 Ensure	there	is	appropriate	 consideration of project risk, including  bidding and control of projects; 	 Give	increased	focus	to	developing	the	 talent of the Groups senior leaders; 	 Review	the	format	of	Board	meetings	  to ensure there is appropriate time to  discuss key issues in depth; and 	 Ensure	that	the	Board	composition	 continues to have the appropriate  balance of skills, experience and  diversity. As part of the evaluation discussions with  Egon Zehnder, views on the performance  of individual directors were sought. These  views, including the performance of the  Chairman, were presented to the Board   as a whole. Induction and development On appointment, new directors receive   an induction programme tailored to their  specific requirements based on their  experience. The objective is to provide  directors with a combination of selected  written information and the opportunity   to visit business sites and meet with key  leaders of the Group.  Following her appointment to the  Company, an induction programme was  agreed for Deena Mattar which enabled  her to meet with key executives at Head  Office (including Tax, Treasury, Corporate  Communications and Legal) to develop an  awareness of core processes, people and  the business. She was briefed on Board  procedures and governance matters by the  Company Secretary. Separately she visited  the headquarters of the Invensys Rail and  Invensys Controls divisions in order to   meet key employees and gain a deeper  understanding of the Groups operations.  Arrangements to visit the Invensys  Operations Management headquarters   are to be made during the coming year.  Given her appointment as a member of   the Audit Committee, she also met with   the external auditor.  Induction for David Thomas and Victoria Hull  was deemed unnecessary given their  existing positions within the Company.  The continuing development of the  directors, collectively and individually,   is effected through a number of channels.  Directors receive regular briefings at Board  meetings which are relevant to their role.  These include developments in governance  matters, regulatory updates and legislative  changes. For example, updates on the  introduction of the Bribery Act and  changesin EU governance matters  (including the Code and Lord Davies  report on gender diversity). As part of the annual Board programme at  least one meeting is held offsite at a Group  business location so that directors can  increase their understanding of the business  activity. During 2011/12, the Board visited  Invensys Rails business location in Madrid.  This provided an opportunity for the Board  to have an in-depth discussion on several  key elements of the Invensys Rail division  including major projects, market trends,  research and development direction and  divisional processes. The Board also had  theopportunity to interact with a wider  representation of staff through an onsite  town hall meeting and tour of the facilities.  Finally, directors visited some of the major  local installations and met with key clients  including Madrid Metro and ADIF.

The Board  ensures that directors have access to  independent professional advice on how to  discharge their responsibilities as directors  of the Company. Directors conflicts of interest In line with the Companies Act 2006,  directors are required to avoid any  situation in which they have or can have a  direct	or	indirect	interest	that	conflicts	or	 may	possibly	conflict	with	the	interests	of	 the Company, unless authorised by the  Board. The Companys Articles of  Association allow the Board to authorise  such	conflicts	and	to	impose	such	limits	or	 conditions as it deems necessary. There is  no breach of duty if the relevant matter has  been authorised in advance. The Company has established a procedure  whereby	actual	and	potential	conflicts	of	 interest are reviewed regularly and in any  event annually. Appropriate authorisation  is required prior to the appointment of any  new	director	and	when	any	new	conflict	 arises for a director or there is a change in  circumstances that may affect an  authorisation previously given.  Authorisations are granted by those  directors who have no interest in the matter  being considered and are recorded by the  Company Secretary in the Register of  Directors	Conflicts.	Where	there	is	a	 conflict,	the	Board	will	confirm	whether	any	 conditions should be imposed under the  terms of the authorisation. During the year the Board considers the  procedure was operated effectively. Board committees The Board delegates specific authorities to  its Audit Committee, Remuneration  Committee, Nominating Committee and  Contracts Committee, all of which operate  within defined terms of reference. Board  committees are authorised to engage the  services of external advisers as  circumstances require, at the Companys  expense. Reports of the Nominating  Committee, Audit Committee and  Remuneration Committee are included  onpages 54 to 74. Directors receive copies  of all committee minutes and the chairman  of each committee provides an update  onmatters of significance at the Board  meeting following the committee meeting. Communication with shareholders Communication with shareholders is at all  times given a high priority, and a number  ofmeans are used to promote greater  understanding and dialogue with the  investment community. The Board receives  regular reports from the Chief Executive  and the Groups Investor Relations team.  The Chairman and the Senior Independent  Director are available to meet with major  shareholders on request. During the year,  the Chairman spoke with a number of  majorshareholders regarding general  business topics. In addition, the Chairman  of the Remuneration Committee held  discussions with major shareholders  onrelevant matters during the course  ofthe financial year. Shareholders are kept informed of the  progress of the Group during the course   of the year through half-year and full-year  results, presentations, interim management  statements, capital markets days and other  announcements of material developments  that are released through the London   Stock Exchange and other news services.  The results presentations made to the  investment community are webcast and  copies of supporting materials are made  available on the Groups website (details   of which can be found in Shareholder  Information on page 170). Other general  shareholder information can be found   on our website. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial  Officer maintain regular dialogue with   the major institutional shareholders and  participate in sector conferences.  Shareholders can also raise questions  directly with the Company at any time by  contacting the Investor Relations team,  whose contact details are listed on the  Groups website. The annual report and accounts are made  available to shareholders at least 20  working days prior to the AGM. Directors  are available at the AGM to answer  questions, which provides a useful  interface with private shareholders.  Shareholders also have an opportunity   to meet informally with directors after the  meeting. Resolutions are proposed  separately and voting is conducted by polls  at general meetings, and voting results are  announced through the London Stock  Exchange. The results and proxy levels are  also available on the Groups website and  on request from the Company Secretary.  The Company is permitted under its  Articles of Association to send or supply  communications to shareholders  electronically, and the Company now  supplies information such as notices of  meetings, forms of proxy and annual  reports and accounts via the Groups  website. Shareholders are notified by email  or post when new information is available  on the website. The Company sends   hard copy communications to those  shareholders who have requested them.  Shareholders may at any time revoke a  previous instruction and elect to receive  hard copies or electronic copies of  shareholder information. 52  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Accountability and audit Financial planning and reporting The Group has comprehensive planning  and financial reporting procedures.  Management prepares detailed  operational budgets for the year ahead  and a three-year strategic plan, which are  reviewed and approved by the Board.  Performance is monitored through the  monthly reporting of financial results and  regular updating of forecasts for the year.  The Group Accounting Policies Manual is  used by all businesses in the Group to  ensure that transactions and balances are  recognised and measured in accordance  with the Groups prescribed accounting  policies. All businesses submit their results  using the Groups consolidation system,  which ensures that information is gathered  and presented in a consistent way that  facilitates the production of the  consolidated financial statements. Internal control The directors are responsible for the  Groups system of internal control and   for reviewing its effectiveness. Each of   the Groups divisions is accountable to   the Chief Executive and is managed   by executive leadership, which provides  day-to-day control over the divisions  operations within the strategic guidelines  and delegated authorities determined by  the Board. The internal control system is  designed to meet the Groups particular  needs and the risks to which it is exposed,  but it should be appreciated that, however  effective a system of internal control is,   it can provide only reasonable and not  absolute assurance against material  misstatement or loss. The findings of the annual assessment of  the Groups system of internal controls  undertaken by the Audit Committee, as  detailed on page 57, were presented to the  Board. Where weaknesses in the operation  of internal controls were identified,   the Audit Committee considered  managements response to them.   The Audit Committee has continued   to pay particular consideration to the  management of customer contracts   and received detailed reports on major  contracts from management and the  external auditor. As reported in the Groups  Q3 Interim Management Statement in  January 2012 and referred to elsewhere in  this Annual Report and Accounts, a number  of operational issues relating to certain  nuclear projects in China within Invensys  Operations Management and rail signalling  projects in Invensys Rails Asia Pacific  operations were identified. Investigations  concluded that additional costs would be  incurred in order to complete the projects  and in some cases revenue recognition has  been delayed. An in-depth internal review  has been conducted with the result that  systems have been further improved and  additional risk metrics have been  established. The Board is satisfied that the  information that it received throughout the  year on internal controls and the  information from the annual assessment on  internal controls was sufficient to enable it  to review the effectiveness of the Groups  system of internal controls. The Board is  satisfied that, where the need to improve  internal controls was identified during the  year, appropriate actions are being taken. Risk management The Board has responsibility for  determining the nature and extent of   the significant risks it is willing to take in  achieving the strategic objectives and   has established a structured approach   to identifying, evaluating, managing,  monitoring, and reporting on key risks  facing the Group. The Risk Committee has accountability   for creating and overseeing the risk  management processes and procedures,  and provides written reports to the Board  and the Audit Committee on the key risks  facing the Group. It formulates strategy   and policy based on risk appetite and risk  exposure. It also monitors the mitigating  actions put in place by the relevant  operational managers to address the  identified risks. The Board reviews annually  the risk management process and  periodically conducts external reviews. Remuneration Committee Details of the Remuneration Committee  and its policies, together with information  on the remuneration and share interests of  directors, are set out in the Remuneration  Report on pages 60 to 74. The Remuneration  Report should be read in conjunction with  this Corporate Governance report, of  which it forms an integral part. Contracts Committee The Contracts Committee considers  certain tenders and contracts falling within  the Boards terms of reference and due for  submission to customers in a period when  there is no scheduled Board meeting at  which they can be considered prior to  submission. Meetings of the Contracts  Committee must comprise at least one  executive director, the Chairman (or in his  place the Senior Independent Director)   and at least one other independent  non-executive director. The terms of  reference for the Contracts Committee  were reviewed during the year and  nochanges recommended. The terms  ofreference are available on the  Groupswebsite.  The Contracts Committee met on five  occasions during the year.

I am pleased to present this report of the Nominating  Committee which explains our role and our principal  activities during the year. There have been a number of changes to the Board during  the year and this has been an area of focus for the  Nominating Committee. We were very pleased to be able  to recommend to the Board the appointment of Deena  Mattar as a new non-executive director and David Thomas  and Victoria Hull as executive directors. They all have high  skill levels which will contribute to the effectiveness of the  Board and, with their fellow directors, help support the  long-term success of the Company.  Membership All of the members of the Nominating Committee are  independent non-executive directors save for myself. Meetings The Nominating Committee held three meetings during  the year and details of members attendance are set out  onpage 49.  Effectiveness of the Nominating Committee  The externally-facilitated Board evaluation (detailed on  page 51) confirmed that the Nominating Committee was  operating effectively. Role The Nominating Committee has a number of  responsibilities as set out in its terms ofreference which are  available on the Groups website. In summary the key roles  areto: 	 review	the	structure,	size	and	composition	(including	the	 skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) required of  the Board compared to its current position and make  recommendations to the Board with regard to any  changes; 	 consider	succession	planning	with	regard	to	the	Board	 and senior leaders; and  	 make	recommendations	to	the	Board	regarding	the	 appointment, reappointment and retirement of  directors. Activities of the Nominating Committee  Set out below are the key matters considered by the  Nominating Committee during 2011/12. Board changes Following the appointment of Wayne Edmunds (the former  CFO) as Chief Executive, the Nominating Committee led  the selection process for a new Invensys CFO. We engaged  the services of a search agency. The search was undertaken  against a detailed job specification and included both  internal and external candidates. Having completed the  process, the Nominating Committee recommended the  appointment of David Thomas who had been Acting  ChiefFinancial Officer since 24 March 2011 and he was  subsequently appointed to the Board on 28July 2011. The Nominating Committee also recommended to the  Board the appointment of Victoria Hull as an executive  director. Ms Hull joined the Company in 2001 as the  Groups Chief Legal Officer with responsibility for the  management of legal, compliance and commercial risk  across the Group. Itwas agreed that her legal skills and  commercial acumen would greatly assist the Boards  decision making. She was appointed to the Board on  29November 2011. Corporate Governance continued 54  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Diversity The Nominating Committee reviewed the  recommendations of Lord Davies report Women on  Boards which was published in February 2011. We  recognise the importance and benefits of diversity and will  continue to take this into account in our recruitment  processes whilst ensuring that candidates are selected on  merit and ensuring that there is an appropriate range and  balance of skills, experience and background on the Board. Succession planning Succession planning is a key area of discussion for the  Nominating Committee. We reviewed the capability   of our leadership team and considered the succession  plans for the executive directors. The chart below details  the Chairman and non-executive directors and their terms  of office. The Nominating Committee regularly reviews   this information to help plan the membership of the Board  to ensure we have the appropriate skill sets, relevant  experience and diversity on the Board. As detailed  onpage50, the Board agreed that the appointments  ofSirNigel Rudd, Francesco Caio, Michael Parker  andDrMartin Read each be extended for a further   three-year term.

I invite all members ofthe Board to meetings of the Audit  Committee. Executivesfrom the Groups finance team as  well as the external auditor and internal audit partner (as  required) joinour meetings. Consequently, our meetings  are well attended. A description of our activities during the year is set out  below but I would like to preface them with a few  introductory remarks about some of our work. During the  last year, we have continued to work with the executives  toenhance key financial controls and resolve promptly  anycontrol weaknesses. Our Group was largely built  through acquisition and has a very broad geographic  spread of operations with the inevitable result that there  have been many variations in operating procedures. The  Group also continues to take on larger long-term contracts  in emergingmarkets requiring diligent monitoring and  control. Against this background the Group has been  working to standardise routine accounting processes   and strengthen contract execution and commercial  management activities on major projects. One of the Audit Committees key priorities is to ensure  that it provides oversight of the risk processes to enable the  Group to achieve its strategic goals. We have therefore  continued to focus on risk management and the risk  reporting systems that were formalised some six years ago  when the calibration of risk was only just starting to gain the  general recognition and emphasis that it has today. We aim  constantly to improve the risk reporting systems to deliver  the key information in a succinct and clear format. We have  had our risk systems reviewed against current practices  elsewhere and are encouraged that our framework is  relatively well advanced. In this connection, we were  pleased to be recognised during the year in the Institute of  Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (ICSA) Hermes  Transparency Awards for the Best Risk Management  Disclosure in last years Annual Report. The Board, the  Audit Committee and the executives have put much time  and effort into risk management. Finally, in such a widespread and diverse Group it is inevitable  that something may go wrong however well managed. In such  an event, the Audit Committee examines the circumstances   in detail and seeks to ensure that such improvements as are  appropriate are implemented without delay.  Membership All of the members of the Audit Committee are  independent non-executive directors. I am a qualified chartered accountant and Fellow of the  Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales  (FCA) and have worked in financial roles for over 30 years.  My full biography is set out on page 47 together with those  of the other members of the Audit Committee. As part of  my commitment to the Audit Committee, I attend technical  update seminars on a regular basis.  I was delighted that Deena Mattar, FCA, joined the Audit  Committee on her appointment as a non-executive director  on 19 May 2011. She chairs the audit committee at RM plc  and was formerly CFO at Kier Group plc. She is a valuable  addition to the Audit Committee. The Board is satisfied that at least one member of the Audit  Committee has recent and relevant financial experience as  required for corporate governance purposes. Meetings The Audit Committee held five scheduled meetings during  the year and details of members attendance are set out on  page 49. The chart below shows how we spent our time and our  activities are described in detail on pages 57 to 59. Categories of activities (%) Financial reporting  28 Internal controls  15 Risk management  11 External audit  17 Internal audit  10 Other matters  19 In addition, I meet periodically with the Chief Financial  Officer and Group Financial Controller for business updates  with particular emphasis on financial performance. In advance  of each Audit Committee, I meet with key executives and  the external auditor to ensure that the reporting and  discussion will appropriately address the Audit Committee  agenda matters. At the time of the half-year and full-year  results, I have a private meeting with the external auditor to  ensure that any issues they have identified are raised and  discussed appropriately at the subsequent Audit  Committee meeting. These are supplementary to those  meetings between the Audit Committee and the external  auditor without management being present as  recommended for good corporate governance. In addition to their attendance at relevant meetings where  internal audit findings are considered, I meet at least once   a year with the managing partner from Deloitte LLP who is  responsible for the provision of internal audit services to  the Group. 56  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Effectiveness of the Audit Committee The externally-facilitated Board evaluation (detailed   on page 51) confirmed that the Audit Committee was  operating effectively, being diligent and providing good  judgement. An area where we intend to continue to focus  in the coming year is long-term contract risk, particularly in  the monitoring and control of major long-term contracts. Role and responsibilities The Audit Committee has a number of responsibilities as  set out in its terms of reference which are available on the  Groups website. In summary the key roles are to: 	 review	and	recommend	to	the	Board	the	financial	 statements and formal announcements relating to  financial performance, including a review of accounting  policies and financial reporting judgements; 	 examine,	on	behalf	of	the	Board,	the	effectiveness	of	the	 Groups systems of internal controls and risk management; 	 monitor	and	review	the	effectiveness	of	the	Internal	 Audit function; 	 oversee	the	relationship	with	the	external	auditor	and	 make recommendations to the Board regarding their  appointment and remuneration; and 	 agree	the	policy	on	auditor	independence	and	the	 non-audit services policy. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are  reviewed on an annual basis. No material changes   were made to the terms of reference during 2011/12. The Audit Committee is satisfied that it has fully discharged  its responsibilities under its terms of reference. Activities of the Audit Committee  Set out below are the key matters considered by the Audit  Committee during 2011/12. Financial reporting We reviewed the form and content of the Groups Annual  Report and Accounts and half-year financial report prior   to their publication to provide assurance that the disclosures  made in the financial statements were set properly in context.   As part of this process, we received reports from management  and the external auditor. In particular we reviewed areas of  critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions.  These are set out in Note 3 to the Group Financial Statements  and include construction and long-term service provision  contracts, impairment of goodwill, pension and post- retirement benefits, development costs and provisions   and contingent liabilities. The Audit Committee reviewed the liquidity risk and the  basis for preparing the Group accounts on agoing concern  basis, this being a relatively straightforward activity this  year following the securing of new five-year bank facilities. Internal controls During the year we have examined the key elements of   the internal control processes and provided assurance   to the Board on the effectiveness of the internal control  environment. Set out below are a number of the activities  that have been completed in our review of financial,  operational and compliance controls. 	 We	considered	the	results	of	internal	control	self- assessment returns from the businesses and reviewed  management responses to any identified weaknesses. 	 We	received	a	report	from	the	external	auditor	which	 sets out their key observations on the internal control  environment that had arisen during their annual audit,  along with managements remediation plans to  strengthen further the internal controls within the Group. 	 At	most	meetings	we	receive	a	summary	of	the	financial	 control audits performed by Internal Audit, including the  key recommendations. The audits include reviews of  processes relating to accounting and finance, revenue,  project management and contracting, capital  expenditure, procurement, inventory, payroll and  general computer controls. Particular attention has   been given to ensuring a timely remediation of any   audit recommendations. 	 We	reviewed	arrangements	under	which	employees	can,	 on a confidential basis, raise concerns about potential  irregularities in financial reporting on other matters, and  the arrangements for follow-up actions.  	 Significant	variances	between	results	and	internal	 forecasts are considered and where such variances are  indicative of control failings, management actions to  address weaknesses are reviewed. 	 We	commissioned	Deloitte	LLP	(see	section	on	internal	 audit on page 59) to conduct a review of compliance with  financial controls of the Groups Agent Policy. 	 We	have	monitored	the	development	and	implementation	 of a governance risk and compliance software application  for the monitoring of key financial controls across the  Group to strengthen the overall control environment. This  application (known as the Internal Control Framework)  will document the Groups key financial controls and  collect evidence from business units of compliance with  those controls.  The Boards review of the risk management process and its  statement on internal control is contained on page 53. Risk management As the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing risk  management processes and reporting systems on behalf  of the Board, presentation of an update from the Risk  Committee has become a regular cadence. As well as  reviewing the major risks we monitored the mitigation  actions put in place by management and reviewed the  minutes of the Risk Committee.  The role of the Risk Committee is described fully on pages   37 and 38 and the risk management and review process  isoutlined on pages 38 and 39. A summary of the principal  risks anduncertainties facing the Group is presented on   pages 39 to 44. Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 57  Audit Committee Report  continued External auditor Ernst & Young LLP has been the Companys auditor  sinceOctober 1999. During the year we reviewed the  qualification of the audit team, the rotation policies, auditor  independence and their firm-wide procedures and  credentials, together with the effectiveness of the audit  process. This assessment included feedback from the  Groups senior finance management. We also considered  Ernst & Young LLPs own annual transparency report which  provides information on the structure and governance of  the audit firm and outlines their processes relating to audit  quality and auditor objectivity. Following the results of the  assessment we remained satisfied with the effectiveness  and performance of Ernst & Young LLP and recommended  to the Board their reappointment which will be considered  at the 2012 AGM. Consistent with market practice, Ernst & Young LLPs audit  services to the Group are provided annually through terms  of engagement which we reviewed. These terms do   not include any contractual obligations under which   the directors would be prevented from appointing   a different firm. As part of the annual assessment we discuss whether   there would be any benefit from a change in auditor or   a competitive tendering process. Whilst the Audit  Committee remains satisfied with the services provided   by Ernst & Young LLP, we have been following the debate  about changes to the audit system including proposals  from the Financial Reporting Council and the European  Commission. Pending finalisation of these initiatives and  taking into account also the disruption to the finance team  in organising a tender process and internal cost to the  Group, the Audit Committee does not see any benefit   in retendering at this time. We also discussed the proposed audit plan with the auditor  and agreed key initiatives to drive cost efficiencies without  impairing the service quality. Long-term contracting is a key  area of focus in the audit. Non-audit services  One of our responsibilities is to ensure theindependence  of our external auditor is not impaired in the provision  ofany non-audit services. We have a policy in place which  governs the non-audit services that can be appropriately  performed by the external auditor. This isset out in the  following table. During the year we receive a quarterly report on non-audit  services which we review at our scheduled meetings. Ernst & Young LLP was not engaged to undertake any  significant new areas of work during the year. They  continued to provide services under the global tax  compliance and legal entity rationalisation programmes,  both of which commenced during the previous year. Other  potential suppliers were originally considered for these  programmes, but the external auditors knowledge of the  Group, and the efficiencies that could be achieved as a  result, were key factors for their engagement with this work.  Non-audit services policy Under this policy the external auditor is prohibited from  undertaking any work that is considered to threaten its  independence or objectivity in its role. Prohibited work  specifically includes bookkeeping services, the design  and implementation of financial information systems,  appraisal or valuation services, actuarial or legal services  and any other work that would involve the external  auditor in preparing financial information that is included  or disclosed in the audited financial statements, or   in making judgements or taking decisions on behalf   of management. The external auditor is permitted to undertake work   in other areas as long as it is the most suitable supplier   of the service and the terms and conditions of the  engagement, including the level of the fee, do not impair  its objectivity or independence. Under the policy, the  Audit Committee pre-approves the use of the external  auditor for routine non-audit services, subject to a  quarterly and annual monetary cap. Routine non-audit  services include advice on accounting, auditing and  financial reporting matters; assurance over internal  accounting and risk management procedures; non- statutory audit (including reviews of interim financial  information); project assurance and advice on  accounting process improvement; due diligence in  connection with business acquisitions and disposals;  corporate income tax and indirect tax compliance and  advisory services; and tax services in respect of business  acquisitions and disposals. Specific approval is required  from the Audit Committee for any of these services that  would result in the pre-approved monetary cap being  exceeded, and for any other services that are not  included in the list of pre-approved services.  When determining whether the external auditor   is the most suitable supplier of a particular service,  management and the Audit Committee take into account  the cost-effectiveness of the service and the external  auditors knowledge of the Group.  Ernst & Young LLP has policies and procedures in place  to ensure that the highest standards of objectivity,  independence and integrity are maintained and these  comply with the Auditing Practices Boards (APB) Ethical  Standards for Auditors. The audit engagement partner  must approve any non-audit services offered to the  Group. This ensures that the objectives of the proposed  engagement are not inconsistent with the objectives of  the audit; allows the identification and assessment of any  related threats to Ernst & Young LLPs objectivity; and  assesses the effectiveness of available safeguards to  eliminate such threats or reduce them to an acceptable  level. Ernst & Young LLP do not carry out non-audit  services where no satisfactory safeguards exist. Corporate Governance continued 58  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Internal audit The majority of internal audit work for the Group continues  to be outsourced to Deloitte LLP. The Group maintains   a small internal audit function, to manage the outsourcing  contract and undertake certain assignments. The Deloitte  LLP internal audit managing partner has a direct reporting  line to me and at least once a year we hold a private  meeting without management present. Internal Audit has reported regularly to the Audit  Committee on the results of internal control audits  undertaken under a rolling plan agreed in advance. Internal  control issues are monitored by the Audit Committee to  resolution. Going forward, Deloitte LLP will operate to an annual plan  for financial control audits in conjunction with central  continuous monitoring of these controls using the Groups  Internal Control Framework application. The internal audit  plan will be risk-focused in the audit of financial controls,  long-term contracts and other operational audits.  We have reviewed the performance of Internal Audit and  consider the function to be effective and to perform in  accordance with the relevant professional standards.

We have closely followed the widespread debate on the  issue of executive pay. We welcomed the opportunity to  beinvolved in discussions and, on behalf of the Company,  we submitted a response to the Department of Business  Innovation & Skills discussion paper on Executive  Remuneration and the consultation The Future of  Narrative Reporting.  We note the Governments proposed initiatives to improve  the communication of remuneration and are supportive of  simplification and transparency in reporting. With this in  mind we have endeavoured to enhance our Remuneration  Report and, whilst the regulations have not yet been  finalised, we have included some additional disclosures  particularly with regard to how shareholder views are taken  into account, the link between the Companys strategy and  remuneration and our use of remuneration consultants. Our remuneration strategy has remained consistent at  Invensys over many years – the Remuneration Committee  believes that pay should reflect performance with a high  proportion of total reward based on growth in profit and  the creation of shareholder value.  As outlined in the Chief Executives Statement on   pages 8 and 9, the Company made some good progress  during the year,  but our profitability was reduced by  additional costs and provisions related to certain major  projects. Company performance has, of course, been  reflected inthe remuneration outcomes for executive  directors for2011/12: 	 The	financial	element	of	the	executive	directors	annual	 incentive plan did not achieve the threshold levels of  performance required to deliver a payment; 	 For	the	first	time	in	2011/12,	a	personal	performance	 element to the executive directors annual incentive  planwas introduced with a 25% weighting of the overall  bonus opportunity. After detailed consideration of  thepersonal performance of each executive director  inthe context of the performance objectives set, the  Remuneration Committee concluded that the executive  directors had met or exceeded their personal  performance targets for the year. However, in light of  theoverall financial performance of the Company, the  executive directors and the Remuneration Committee  agreed that no bonus payment would be made to  executive directors in respect of 2011/12; 	 The	financial	performance	thresholds	for	the	2009	 Award under the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)  (whichhad the potential to vest based on performance  over three years to 31 March 2012) were not achieved  and the 2009 Award will lapse for the Chief Executive  (who served as an executive director for that three-year  period); and 	 The	base	salary	increases	of	3%	agreed	by	the	 Remuneration Committee in relation to the executive  directors for 2012/13 are modest and reflect general  paymovements in the Group and the broader  UKmarket. Our reward policy, which remains largely unchanged, is  aligned with our broader strategic goals by providing: 	 A	high	proportion	of	remuneration	directly	linked	to	the	 annual and long-term performance of the Group. Base  salaries are, on the whole, set at levels which are around  market median for the sectors and countries in which we  operate. High levels of reward can only be achieved by  delivering our strategic financial performance goals; 	 A	clear	line	of	sight	between	divisional	leaders	rewards	 and the business for which they are responsible; and 	 A	personal	element	to	executive	directors	annual	 incentive measures to ensure a focus on business  development objectives and strengthening project  management capability. The table on page 63 provides further detail on the link  between our strategy and remuneration. The Remuneration Committee welcomes the opportunity  that this Report provides to explain our remuneration policy  and to receive feedback from our shareholders. The  Remuneration Committee was pleased that the 2010/11  Report received a 93.8% vote in favour at the 2011 AGM,  but we are not complacent and we consider carefully all  shareholder views expressed. In the lead up to the 2011  AGM, shareholders and their representative bodies raised  two main issues on which I would like to comment: 	 The additional one-off 100% of salary LTIP award  madeto the current Chief Executive in 2011 (i.e. 100%  in addition to the normal 200% as per the LTIP rules).  TheRemuneration Committee felt that it was entirely  appropriate to make this additional award on appointing  a new Chief Executive to give him a bigger potential  stake in the future success of the Group under  hisleadership. 	 The fact that the Remuneration Committee did not  apply mitigation in providing termination terms to the  former Chief Executive (Ulf Henriksson). The terms  provided were in line with his contractual entitlement  based on twelve-months base salary plus contractual  benefits and the bonus paid was a payment earned  during the financial year 2010/11. The Remuneration  Committee believes in the principle of mitigation and  allexecutive directors contractual terms include an  ability to mitigate by paying money due at termination  ininstalments. However, in this case, the Remuneration  Committee decided that it was more important to move  forward under new leadership and to achieve a prompt  clean break with the former Chief Executive, and did not  therefore invoke the contractual mitigation provisions. The Remuneration Committee remains satisfied that the  two decisions outlined above were appropriate.  In conclusion, we believe that our remuneration strategy  incentivises the delivery of strong financial results and the  creation of shareholder value.

At the invitation of the Chairman of the  Remuneration Committee, other non- executive directors also attend meetings.  The executive directors, Group Human  Resources Director and the Vice President  Total Reward are invited to attend and  speak at meetings, other than when their  own remuneration is being considered.  The Chairman of the Company does not  attend when his fee is under review. To ensure that the Groups remuneration  practices remain market competitive and  compliant, advice during the year was  received from Kepler Associates, the  independent remuneration consultants  tothe Remuneration Committee, on issues  relating to the remuneration arrangements  for the executive directors and other senior  leaders in the Company.  Kepler Associates was appointed by  theRemuneration Committee following  afull review in 2010. Their reporting  relationship is to the Chairman of the  Remuneration Committee, although  theywork with management in supporting  the Remuneration Committee. During the  year,they have provided advice to the  Remuneration Committee on a broad  range of issues including executive base  salaries, total remuneration market  positioning, incentive design and  corporate governance issues as they   relate to remuneration. The role of Kepler  Associates is to provide independent  advice to the Remuneration Committee  and they have no delegated authority   to make any decisions on behalf of the  Remuneration Committee. Kepler  Associates does not provide any other  advice to the Company. A copy of the  termsof appointment of Kepler Associates  is available on the Groups website.  KeplerAssociates is a member of the  Remuneration Consultants Group and  adheres to its code of conduct. Hewitt New Bridge Street provided the  Remuneration Committee with data in  relation to total shareholder return (TSR)  and ranking information for the 2007   Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP). The  Remuneration Committee was provided  with legal advice from Freshfields  Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, who are also  lawyers to the Company. The Remuneration Committee met on  three occasions during the year and details  of members attendance are set out on  page 49. One of the meetings was  structured as a strategy session which  focused specifically on the appropriateness  of theremuneration policy for the following  financial year. Communication with shareholders is given  a high priority and the Chairman of the  Remuneration Committee held discussions  with shareholders on relevant matters  during the course of the financial year.  Effectiveness of the Remuneration  Committee The externally-facilitated Board evaluation  (detailed on page 51) confirmed that the  Remuneration Committee was operating  effectively, being focused and providing  good judgement. In light of the increased  focus on the oversight of risk management,  the Remuneration Committee will continue  to pay particular attention to the balance  between risk and incentives. Role  The Remuneration Committee has a  number of responsibilities as set out in its  terms of reference which are available in  full on the Groups website. In summary the  key roles are to: 	 agree	with	the	Board	the	broad	policy	  for the remuneration of the Chairman,  executive directors, Company Secretary,  the Group Leadership Team (GLT) and  certain leaders below the GLT whose  remuneration is above a certain level  and, within the terms of this agreed  policy, approve individual remuneration  packages; 		approve	the	targets	for	any	 performance-related incentives and  approve the total annual payments   made under such plans; 		review	the	design	of	all	share	incentive	 plans and determine the performance  conditions; 		ensure	that	contractual	terms	on	 termination, and any payments made,  are fair to the individual and the Group,  that failure is not rewarded and that the  duty to mitigate loss is recognised;  		oversee	any	major	changes	in	employee	 benefit structures throughout the Group;  and 		select	independent	remuneration	 consultants to advise the Remuneration  Committee. The Remuneration Committee is   satisfied that it has fully discharged its  responsibilities under its terms of  reference. The fee arrangements for non-executive  directors are a matter for the Chairman  andthe executive directors of the Board  and further detail is set out on page 70.  Activities of the Remuneration  Committee  Set out below are the key matters  considered by the Remuneration  Committee during 2011/12: 	 review	of	executive	directors	and	GLT	 remuneration, including base salary and  incentive arrangements; 	 approval	of	the	outturn	of	performance	 targets for the Executive Bonus Plan for  the prior year; 	 approval	of	the	performance	targets	for	 the Executive Bonus Plan for the current  year; 	 approval	of	annual	awards	under	the	 2007 LTIP and the Restricted Share Plan  (RSP); 	 assessment	of	performance	conditions	 relating to executive share awards under  the 2007 LTIP vesting during the year; 		approval	of	termination	packages	for	 leavers within the GLT, including the  former Chief Executive; 		review	and	approval	of	service	contracts	 and remuneration packages for the  current Chief Executive, Chief Financial  Officer, Chief Legal Officer and certain  other senior leaders (as required by  theRemuneration Committees terms  ofreference); 		approval	of	an	offer	to	employees	under	 the Savings Related Share Option  Scheme;  	 approval	of	the	introduction	of	the	 Sustained Divisional Performance  Incentive for divisional CEOs which is  aimed at rewarding consistent long-term  performance; 		annual	review	of	its	terms	of	reference;	 	 approval	of	a	revised	Directors	 ExpensesPolicy; 	 annual	assessment	of	independent	 adviser services and costs; and 		monitoring	of	discussions	around	 executive pay including review of revised  institutional guidelines on remuneration.  62  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  2 Remuneration strategy and policy Strategic alignment of reward Our remuneration philosophy, which aims to balance risk and reward, encompasses all elements of remuneration including fixed pay,  short- and long-term incentives, benefits and career development. Base salary and benefits Short- and medium-term incentives Long-term incentives To enable Invensys to retain and enhance deep  domain knowledge: 	 remunerating	executive	directors	and	senior	 leaders at a level and in a manner that is  capable of attracting, retaining and  motivating high-calibre people; and 	 being	market	competitive	with	our	reward	 packages. To enable Invensys to deliver strong Group  performance through sustainable growth in the  divisions and strengthened project execution: 	 at	Group-level,	focus	on	EPS	and	cash	flow; 	 division	targets	focus	on	growing	orders	and	 operating profit 1, balanced with strong cash  delivery; 	 strong	line	of	sight	to	lines	of	business;	and 	 specific	incentives	focus	on	sustained	 financial performance in the divisions andthe  delivery of major projects over several years. To enable Invensys to deliver long-term profit  growth and superior returns to shareholders  with our leaders sharing in this success: 	 LTIP	measures	target	three-year	EPS	growth	  and above-market returns to shareholders; 	 Share	Ownership	Guidelines	create	a	 community of interest between  shareholders and executives aligning  executive remuneration with shareholders  interests; and 	 we	encourage	a	high-performance	culture	 that clearly links executive remuneration  tothe performance of the Group and  theindividual. Note 1 Operating profit is arrived at after charging exceptional items. Policy The Remuneration Committees policy is   to provide competitive remuneration for  the delivery of target performance, while  rewarding exceptional personal and  Groupperformance with upper quartile  levels of remuneration. The Remuneration  Committee believes that the total reward  package provides a strong link to, and a  good balance between, annual and  long-term performance.  In setting the remuneration policy, the  Remuneration Committee is cognisant of  the need to balance risk with reward and  remains satisfied with its reward practices.  The Remuneration Committee considers  risk each year and has discretion to adjust  any financial outturns for incentive purposes  if it considers that disproportionate risk has  been taken to deliver performance targets. The key elements of the Companys  remuneration policy are described in detail  below. A high proportion of executive  director total reward is performance-related  variable remuneration, as indicated in the  adjacent chart. Average expected value of executive  directors packages 2012/13 (%) Base salary  32 Annual bonus  30 2007 LTIP  24 Pension  13 Other benets1  1 1  Other benets are  private healthcare  and car allowance. Base salary The Remuneration Committee determines   the level of base salary for each executive  director annually. For 2011/12, the  Remuneration Committee commissioned   a full total remuneration benchmarking  report from Kepler Associates which  provided relevant comparator pay analyses  across a range of international companies  which compete with the Group and also  benchmarked pay against FTSE companies  of similar market capitalisation and/or  revenue. For 2012/13, the Remuneration  Committee asked Kepler Associates to  provide external market data to further  inform its decisions. The Remuneration  Committee additionally considers specific  factors relating to the individual (including  personal performance), internal relativities,  wage inflation elsewhere in the Group and  more general market movements, and  overall affordability. In determining base  salary, the Remuneration Committee is   mindful of the pay and conditions of  employees in the rest of the Group and   has received relevant data from the Group   Human Resources Director to support its  decisions. In establishing individual salary  levels, the Remuneration Committee is  conscious that it should pay no more   than is necessary to retain and motivate   the executive, while ensuring business  objectives are fulfilled. There is no  automatic annual base salary adjustment.  The base salary increases of 3% for the  executive directors reflect individual  personal performance and are in line with  general pay movements in the Group and  broader UK market. On his promotion to Chief Executive with  effect from 24 March 2011 (his date of  appointment which superseded the normal  review date of 1 April), Wayne Edmunds  base salary was set at 650,000. Effective   1 April 2012, his salary was increased by   3% to 669,500. On promotion to the Board as Chief  Financial Officer with effect from 28 July  2011, David Thomas base salary was set at  360,000. Effective 1 April 2012, his base  salary was increased by 3% to 370,800. On promotion to the Board with effect  from29 November 2011, Victoria Hulls  base salary was set at 340,000. Effective  1April 2012, her base salary was increased  by 3% to350,200. The Remuneration Committee considers  these base salary levels necessary and  appropriate to meet its objective of  incentivising the executive directors and  maintaining competitive pay levels. The  next review date for the executive directors  base salaries will be 1 April 2013. Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 63  Remuneration Report continued Annual incentive arrangements Performance-related bonuses may be paid  to executive directors and senior leaders  under the Executive Bonus Plan. This plan  provides annual incentives to encourage  the achievement of pre-defined annual  financial objectives and personal targets  (which commenced in 2011/12 for executive  directors) to focus on the most critical  measures of business success, while  rewarding them for outstanding  performance. In this way, the Executive  Bonus Plan seeks to align the interests of  shareholders and those participating in it. For 2011/12 and 2012/13, the Remuneration  Committee approved the following  performance calibration for the Executive  Bonus Plan: Threshold 10% of target  payout  Target 100% of target  payout Stretch 150% of target  payout Super-stretch 200% of target  payout The Chief Executive and Chief Financial  Officers bonus payment for target  performance is 100% of base salary,  resulting in a maximum bonus opportunity  for the achievement of super-stretch  performance of 200% of base salary for  2011/12 and 2012/13. The Chief Legal  Officers bonus payment for target  performance was 75% of base salary with  amaximum opportunity of 150% ofbase  salary for 2011/12. For 2012/13, the  Remuneration Committee agreed to  increase the Chief Legal Officers bonus  opportunity to 100% of base salary for  target performance and 200% of base  salary for the achievement of super-stretch  performance. This change was made to  reflect the Chief Legal Officers contribution  to the Group and to create a consistent  incentive framework for the three executive  directors. Executive Bonus Plan 2011/12 The targets for executive directors for  2011/12 are set out in the table below:  Underlying EPS 50%  Free cash  flow 25% Personal performance 25% In line with the Executive Bonus Plan rules,  the salary used for bonus calculation  purposes is the salary effective from   1 April 2011 (adjusted for any promotion  increases). In respect of2011/12 actual  performance, the bonusoutcome reflects  the fact that the underlying EPS as  measured fell below the threshold level  ofperformance, and free cash flow  performance was also below threshold  level, resulting in an aggregate zero  payment in relation to the financial  measures (75% weighting). In relation  tothepersonal performance element  ofbonus (25% weighting), after careful  consideration theRemuneration  Committee concluded that the executive  directors had met or exceeded their  personal performance targets for the year.  However, in light of theoverall financial  performance of the Group, the executive  directors and theRemuneration  Committee agreed thatno bonus payment  would be made to executive directors in  respect of 2011/12. The bonus in excess of 100% of target for  members of the GLT is paid in deferred  shares (in accordance with the Deferred  Share Plan), which are transferred to the  individual after three years (executive  directors) or two years (other GLT  members). No deferred shares will  beawarded to executive directors in  respectof 2011/12 as performance  wasbelow target.  Having reviewed the results achieved  against the financial performance targets  set for 2011/12, the Remuneration  Committee is satisfied that the targets  setwere challenging. The threshold for  bonus payment in respect to the financial  performance targets was not met. Executive Bonus Plan 2012/13 The targets for executive directors for  2012/13 are set out in the table below: Underlying EPS 50%  Free cash  flow 25% Personal performance 25% The Remuneration Committee has  carefullyreviewed the financial and  personal performance targets to be  applied for the Executive Bonus Plan for  2012/13 and is of the opinion that they  areset at appropriately stretching levels.  Bonus payments may also be influenced  through the exercise of discretion by the  Remuneration Committee. Any bonus  earned in excess of target by the GLT will  be paid in deferred shares as set out  previously. Deferred shares are  onlyforfeitable in the event of dismissal  forcause. 64  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Long-term incentive arrangements The 2007 LTIP was approved by  shareholders at the 2007 AGM and since  then the Company has made annual  awards under this plan. The maximum  annual award level for executive directors  and other participants is normally 200% of  base salary, although the Remuneration  Committee has discretion to make awards  in excess of this level in exceptional  circumstances. Vesting of awards is based on meeting  stretching performance targets over a  three-year performance period and,  subject to meeting all relevant conditions,  shares will normally be released to  participants as soon as possible following  the third anniversary of the award. The  satisfaction of all performance targets is  subject to external verification. Performance targets for 2011/12 and  2012/13 are set out in the table below.  For awards to be granted in 2012/13, the  Remuneration Committee considered all  relevant factors and determined that the  two partsof the award, half TSR and half  EPS,continue to provide a focus on  bothcomparative shareholder returns  anddelivering stretching internal financial  targets. In the opinion of the Remuneration  Committee these TSR and EPS targets are  appropriately stretching. With regard to the EPS part of the awards to  be granted in 2012/13, the EPS compound  annual growth rate (CAGR) target would  normally use the EPSfor the prior year as  the base (i.e. EPS for 2011/12). The Groups  reported EPS for 2011/12 wasdepressed  due to the loss of profit associated with  certain projects as discussed in the  Business Review on pages 18 to 30 and the  Remuneration Committee therefore  decided that the 2011/12 reported EPS  does not form an appropriate base  onwhich to apply the CAGR target  forthepurpose of LTIP performance  measurement. Reported underlying EPS  for 2011/12 was 13.4p. In determining the  adjusted base EPS figure of 17.2p for  awards to be granted in 2012/13, the  Remuneration Committee took account  ofthe: 	 historical EPS performance of the Group; 	 exceptional impact which certain projects had on profitability in 2011/12;  and 	 need to set performance conditions which are both stretching and achievable. The use of an adjusted base EPS figure of  17.2p for awards to be granted in 2012/13  means that the CAGR target is significantly  more stretching than it would be using the  underlying EPS for 2011/12 of 13.4p. In light of the significant decrease in the  share price of the Company over the year,  the Remuneration Committee gave  detailed consideration as to whether it  would be appropriate to reduce the level of  awards to be granted to executive directors   in 2012/13 to a level below the normal  award of 200% of base salary. However,  given that the adjusted EPS base for the  EPS part of the awards to be granted in  2012/13 is 28% higher than the underlying  EPS for 2011/12, and our wish to incentivise  executive directors to deliver a significant  improvement in shareholder value going  forward, awards at the normal level of 200%  of base salary are considered appropriate.  For 2011/12 and 2012/13 the performance criteria for the LTIP awards measured over a three-year period are set out below: Award Performance measure Outline of performance measure Target calibration 50% of award Total Shareholder  Return (TSR) 	 Chosen to reinforce the focus on delivering high levels of return to shareholders.

Factors that will be taken  intoaccount will include consistency of  earnings and the Groups cash position.  Vested awards will include an additional  number of shares representing the value  ofany dividends that would have been  paidon those vested shares had they been  held throughout the vesting period. The  performance conditions do not apply to  30% of an award for participants below GLT  level. This is to address specific recruitment  and retention issues facing the Group. For  awards granted in 2012/13, for the GLT  members who are not executive directors  (i.e. the three divisional CEOs and the  Group Human Resources Director), the  percentage of shares under award to which  performance conditions donot apply will  be reduced from 30%to 20% of the award  to better reflect the ability of senior  executives to influence performance. If a participant is dismissed for cause  before shares are released, they will be  forfeited. If a participants employment  ceases due to ill-health, disability or any  other reason determined at the discretion  of the Remuneration Committee, the  financial performance tests will be  measured at the normal vesting date. If a  participant resigns their award will lapse  unless the Remuneration Committee  exercises itsdiscretion. Subject to the  outcome of the financial performance tests,  the award will then be pro rated based  onthe period of service, save that the  Remuneration Committee may moderate  the application of the pro rata reduction  ifitconsiders that the participants  contribution to the business would not  beproperly recognised if the award  wasscaled down. The Remuneration  Committee has discretion to accelerate  vesting in compassionate circumstances.  In the event of a change of control during  the performance period, performance will  be measured at the latest possible date  before the change of control takes place to  determine the proportion vesting based on  performance. The proportion of the award  that may be released will then be time pro  rated. Subject to performance conditions,  the Remuneration Committee has  discretion to disapply the impact of time  pro rating and to permit up to 100% of  awards to vest on a change of control if,  due to exceptional business circumstances  (to be assessed by the Remuneration  Committee), returns to shareholders are  considered to be at a superior level. 2011 Award to Chief Executive As disclosed in the 2011 Annual Report,  related to his appointment as Chief  Executive, Mr Edmunds was granted an  exceptional 2007 LTIP award in 2011 of an  additional 100% of base salary (i.e. 300% in  total) as permitted by the rules of the 2007  LTIP. This exceptional 2007 LTIP award was  agreed by the Remuneration Committee  after careful consideration of the lock-in  provided by existing 2007 LTIP awards  andthe need to incentivise the new Chief  Executive to lead Invensys through the  nextstage of its development. 2009 Award under the 2007 LTIP For awards granted under the 2007 LTIP  in2009 (2009 Award) the performance  condition was measured over the three- year period to 31 March 2012. Following  determination of the TSR (provided by  anindependent third party) and EPS  performance conditions, neither targets  were met. The 2009 Award granted to the  Chief Executive will therefore lapse in full.   In respect of the Chief Financial Officer and  Chief Legal Officer, their 2009 Awards  weregranted prior to their appointment  asexecutive directors and performance  conditions do not apply to 30% of their  awards; this portion of shares will vest  following the third anniversary of the  dateof grant. Pension arrangements The Chief Executive receives a cash  allowance in lieu of pension with a value  of30% of base salary. As both the Chief Financial Officer and the  Chief Legal Officer joined Invensys prior  tothe defined benefit plan being closed  tonew participants in 2004, both continue  to participate in a defined benefit plan for  part of base salary. These defined benefit  arrangements are based on a specified  salary and are part externally-funded  through a registered pension scheme and  part reserved for within the Company. The  specified salaries covered by the defined  benefit arrangements are 280,000 and  321,360 with regard to the Chief  FinancialOfficer and Chief Legal Officer  respectively. The pension benefit on the  difference between actual salary and the  level covered by the defined benefit  arrangements is delivered through a cash  allowance with a value of 30% of that  difference.

Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 67  Remuneration Report continued Other benefits Other benefits provided for executive  directors include the provision of a cash  allowance in place of a company car, typical  life assurance/permanent health insurance  benefits, private medical insurance and  annual health checks. In addition, the  Company pays certain third-party fees  incurred for UK and US tax filings and  relevant immigration matters. Restricted Share Plan (RSP) The Company operates its RSP to grant  executive leaders (other than executive  directors) restricted share awards,  nominal/nil price options or cash awards  over Invensys shares. Release of shares  isgenerally subject to continued  employment at the relevant date,  althoughshares may be released early  onapro rated basis in defined good  leavercases or for any other reason at the  discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Savings Related Share Option Scheme The Company operates its Savings Related  Share Option Scheme (Scheme) in the UK  and certain other countries. Participants  are granted an option to purchase Invensys  shares at a discounted price set at the  dateof invitation, using the proceeds  ofasavings account to which they make  monthly contributions (of up to 250) for  athree-year period. Executive directors  areeligible to participate in the Scheme,  which operates in the UK within specific  taxlegislation. The Scheme is not subject  toperformance conditions. A grant was  made under the Scheme in 2009/10 and  2011/12. Awards granted in 2009/10 will  mature in September 2012 and participants  will be entitled to purchase their shares  under option at the original option price.  Dilution limits The Company has at all times complied  with the dilution limits set out in the rules of  its share plans (principally a limit of 10% in  10 years). In the 10-year period to 31 March  2012, awards made under the Companys  share schemes represented 4.2% (2011:  3.9%) of the Companys issued ordinary  share capital. Shares to satisfy the deferred  share element of the Executive Bonus Plan  and the RSP are purchased in the market  and therefore do not count towards the  dilution limits. Share Ownership Guidelines Executives are required to build up and  maintain a shareholding over time under  the Share Ownership Guidelines. Under  the guidelines, executives should retain at  least 50% of the shares (100% of shares for  executive directors) vesting under any of  the executive share incentive plans or the  payment of annual incentives in shares  (other than to meet any tax obligations),  until such time as the following minimum  level of qualifying interest is reached: Category Executive directors GLT Other executives % of base salary 200% 50% 25% External directorships The executive directors are permitted  tohold not more than one external  non-executive directorship in order to  broaden their experience for the benefit of  the Company. Such appointments are  subject to approval by the Board, and the  director may retain any fees paid in respect  of such a directorship.  Service contracts Policy The Code and guidelines issued by  institutional investors recommend that  notice periods of no more than 12 months  be set as an objective for executive  directors and that any payments to a  departing executive director should be  determined having full regard to the duty  of mitigation, other than in the case of  termination for cause or where a contract  contains specific termination payment  provisions. It is the Companys policy to  achieve these objectives wherever  possible. It is the Companys intention that  new executive service contracts continue  to contain provisions allowing the Company  to terminate employment by making a  payment in lieu of notice and allowing  contractual offset for future earnings. 68 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Specific contracts Set out below is a summary of the main provisions of the service contracts of the executive directors.  Director Date of contract Notice period Summary of the main provisions Wayne Edmunds 17 May 2011 12 months Other than in the case of summary termination, the Company may  terminate Mr Edmunds service contract by making a payment in lieu  ofnotice equal to the value of the base salary and contractual benefits  (including a pension allowance of 30% of base salary) MrEdmunds would  have received during his notice period. Any payment due under those  provisions may be made to him in equal monthly instalments and the  Company may reduce the payment by 50% if MrEdmunds obtains  alternative employment. Mr Edmunds service contract entitles him, in  theevent of a material adverse change to his title, responsibilities or status  following a change of control ofthe Company, toterminate his employment  and receive a payment equal to the payment in lieu of notice. David Thomas 8 November 2011 12 months The termination provisions (including rights in the event of a change of  control) of the service contracts for Mr Thomas and Ms Hull are the same  asfor Mr Edmunds. Victoria Hull 15 May 2012 12 months Tax loans It is the Companys policy that if, as a result  of the Company recharging a proportion of  an executives employment costs to the US  business, the executive incurs temporary  double taxation by UK and US tax authorities,  a US Group subsidiary may advance a loan  to the executive equal to the amount of  such double taxation, pending a refund  from HMRC.  The Company anticipates that a loan with  respect to temporary double taxation may  be advanced by Invensys Systems Inc to  MrEdmunds in the 2012/13 financial year  inrespect of his employment duties  undertaken for the Company in the US  in2011.  As described in last years Remuneration  Report, in 2009/10, Mr Henriksson incurred  both US and UK tax liabilities in respect  ofhis employment duties undertaken  forthe Company in the US in 2009.  InvensysSystems Inc advanced a loan  toMrHenriksson in June 2010 equal to  312,691 and this loan will be repayable  toInvensys Systems Inc on HMRC  refunding the amount to MrHenriksson.  Former Chief Executive Mr Henriksson retired from the Board on  24March 2011 and was paid a payment in  lieu of notice as fully described in last years  Remuneration Report. On 11May 2012, the  Company agreed with MrHenriksson that,  in consideration for arelease and waiver of  any claims MrHenriksson might have  against theCompany: (a) consistent with its policy in relation  totemporary double taxation in the  UKand US (as described above), the  Company would make a payment  tocover the funding costs of any  temporary double taxation arising in  respect of MrHenrikssons post-2009/10  periods of employment with the  Company, calculated by reference to a  notional interest rate of 3% per annum; (b) in relation to certain non-business use  by Mr Henriksson of a company driver  and car/fuel benefits which potentially  gave rise to a taxable benefit (a matter  previously disclosed to shareholders),  the Company will be responsible for  thecost of any settlement with HMRC,  subject to MrHenrikssons cooperation  in dealing with this matter; (c) as permitted by the rules, the  Companywill accelerate the vesting  of124,491 shares conditionally awarded  to MrHenriksson in 2010 under the  Deferred Share Plan (with an additional  4,163 shares to be released representing  accrued dividend shares), rather than  such shares vesting in 2013 (as  previously indicated to shareholders);  (d) in relation to relocation costs of  upto50,000 (plus tax thereon) if  MrHenriksson relocates to the US  (anobligation previously disclosed to  shareholders), the Company will extend  the period in which it will pay such costs,  from 24 March 2012 to 31 August 2012;  and (e) the Company will pay a maximum of  30,000 in respect of legal fees incurred  by Mr Henriksson in connection with the  termination of his employment. As reported in the 2011 Annual Report,  MrHenriksson was entitled to contractual  benefits during his notice period. Such  taxable benefits amounted to 17,744  andcomprised private medical insurance,  certain third party fees incurred for UK and  US tax filings, and a notional interest charge  on the loan made in relation to UK and US  double taxation as detailed above.  3 Chairman and non-executive  directors Chairmans appointment, terms and fee Sir Nigel Rudd, who was appointed a  non-executive director and Deputy  Chairman on 1 January 2009, was  appointed Chairman on 17 July 2009. The  terms of Sir Nigel Rudds appointment are  set out in a contract dated 3 December  2008 which requires, except in the case of  dismissal for cause, 12-months notice by  either party. On early termination, at the  request of the Company, any compensation  would be subject to mitigation. Sir Nigel Rudd spends, on average, two  days per week in his role as Chairman. The  Company funds the cost of acar and driver  based on two fifths of the annualised cost  of the provision of such services.  Sir Nigel Rudds fee is 270,000 per  annumand he participates in the same  arrangement as the other non-executive  directors, whereby 8,000 of his fee per  annum is paid in shares. The Remuneration Committee is  responsible for reviewing the Chairmans  fee. The Chairman is not involved in any  decision on his own remuneration. The fees  currently paid to the Chairman and the  other non-executive directors are subject  to the limits set out in the Companys  Articles of Association.  As set out in the Corporate Governance  report, Sir Nigel Rudds appointment  wasfor a three-year term from his date  ofappointment as Chairman. The Board  hasagreed to extend his appointment  asChairman for a further three-year  termon the same terms as set out in his  original contract. Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 69  Remuneration Report continued Non-executive directors appointments,  terms and fees Non-executive directors serve the  Company under letters of appointment  that do not contain any notice period and  are initially appointed for a term of three  years. In accordance with the Code all  directors will seek re-election annually by  shareholders. Non-executive directors do not participate  in any bonus or performance-related plans  or any of the Companys share incentive  plans or pension schemes. Appointments  of non-executive directors are terminable  without payment or compensation by  either the Company or director giving  written notice. Fees for non-executive directors other  thanthe Chairman are determined by a  committee of the Board comprising the  Chairman and the executive directors.  Theyare subject to the limits set out  intheArticles of Association and are  determined by taking account of time  commitments and responsibilities,  together with comparative market  ratesand benchmarking data. The fee  structure for the non-executive directors  isset out below. Non-executive directors fees Basic fee 52,000 1 Additional fee for chairing  committees – Audit 14,000 – Remuneration 10,000 Additional fee for Senior  Independent Director 10,000 Note 1 Basic fee includes 8,000 paid in shares. The Remuneration  table on page 71 includes that part of the fee used  topurchase shares, and the shares are included in  Directors interests, also on page 71. The portion of fee paid in shares helps to  align the interests of the non-executive  directors with those of shareholders. Each  non-executive director commits to retain  their shares for the period of their  directorship.

In respect of MrEdmunds and  MrThomas, their 2008 Awards were granted prior to their appointment as executive directors and 30% of their award was not subject to performance conditions; therefore, in aggregate,  their 2008 Awards vested at 65%. Mr Thomas shares were released on 16 August 2011 and a further 1,245 shares were issued representing accrued dividends. Mr Edmunds shares were  released on 15 November 2011 and a further 2,070 shares were issued representing accrued dividends. 3 Following consideration of the performance conditions of the 2009 Award, the Remuneration Committee determined (as outlined on page 66) that the threshold underlying EPS CAGR  and TSRperformance had not been met and shares subject to these targets will lapse.

Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 75  Directors Report continued Capital structure Details of the issued share capital, together  with details of movements in the issued  share capital of the Company during the  year, are shown in Note 27 on pages 133  and 134. The Company has one class of ordinary  shares which carry no right to fixed income.  Each share carries the right to one vote  atgeneral meetings of the Company.  Whether or not a shareholder intends to  attend the AGM, votes on the resolutions  are to be lodged by no later than 48 hours  before the meeting takes place. There are  no specific restrictions on the size of a  holding nor on the transfer of shares (save  as detailed below), both of which are  governed by the general provisions of the  Articles of Association and prevailing  legislation. The Company operates an employee  benefit trust in Jersey called the Invensys  No.2 Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) which  may be used to deliver ordinary shares in  the Company under certain executive  share schemes, as appropriate. The EBT  has an independent trustee which waives  its rights to dividends and to vote on the  shareholding. Details of executive share  schemes and shares held by the EBT are set  out in Notes 27 and 29 on pages 133 to 134  and 135 to 142 respectively. Shares acquired through the Companys  executive share plans rank pari passu with  other shares in issue and have no special  rights or restrictions, save that certain  shareawards involve retention periods  after vesting. Further information is set  outin Note 29 on pages 135 to 142. The  nonexecutive directors use a proportion  of their fees to purchase sharesin the  Company which may not normally be  transferred during a directors period  ofoffice. At the 2011 AGM, the directors were  authorised to issue relevant securities  uptoan aggregate nominal amount of  26.7 million (approximately one third  ofthe issued ordinary share capital as at  24May 2011). In addition, the directors  were authorised to allot an extra third of  theissued share capital in respect of a fully  preemptive rights issue. Renewal was also  sought for the directors authorisation to  allot relevant securities and to allot equity  securities for cash (up to a maximum  aggregate nominal amount of 4.1 million)  on a preemptive basis. The directors did  not use this authority during the year under  review, other than to issue shares to satisfy  awards under the Companys share  incentive plans. The directors will seek to  renew allotment authorities at the 2012  AGM in line with revised guidelines issued  by the Association of British Insurers. In addition, the Company was authorised at  the 2011 AGM to purchase in the market up  to 80,971,705 ordinary shares, representing  approximately 10% of the issued share  capital of the Company. Although this  authority was not used by the Company,  approval will be sought from shareholders  atthe 2012 AGM to renew this standard  authority for afurther year. The Company will  only buy back shares if the directors believe  that it is in the shareholders best interests. Substantial shareholders At the date of this report, the Company has  been notified, in accordance with the DTRs,  of the following interests in the ordinary  share capital of the Company: Name  % interest1 in issued  share capital Ameriprise 4.565% (indirect interest) 0.16% (direct interest) 0.01% (nominal interest) BlackRock 4.37% (indirect interest) 0.73%2 (nominal interest) Lloyds Banking  Group 6.75% (indirect interest) Marathon Asset  Management 4.94% (indirect interest) Prudential 9.88%  (direct interest) 0.04% (indirect interest) Ruffer 5.11%  (direct interest) Schroders 5.105% (indirect interest) Standard Life  Investments 2.853% (direct interest) 1.495% (indirect interest) 1 The percentage interests stated are as disclosed at the  date on which the interests were notified in accordance  with DTR 5. 2 This interest is a contract for difference and does not  carry any voting rights. Supplier payment policy It is the policy of the Group that subsidiary  companies should develop longterm  relationships with suppliers and establish  terms of trade consistent with established  practice in their country of operation, and  to ensure that suppliers are aware of the  terms of payment and that such terms are  followed. The Company is a holding  company and has no trade creditors. Employee policy and development Invensys has a range of active policies  thatextend from business compliance,  asreflected in our Code of Conduct, to  developing the full capabilities of our  people. We continue to focus on  promoting diversity and equal  opportunities in areas ranging from  selection and recruitment to training and  development so that we can meet the  needs of our businesses and customers  around the world. If necessary, reasonable  adjustments will be made for the benefit  ofdisabled employees. People with  disabilities are given full and fair  consideration for employment and  subsequent training (including, if needed,  retraining for alternative work where  employees have become temporarily  orpermanently disabled), career  development and promotion on the  basisof their aptitudes and abilities. The Group recognises the need to consult  and systematically provide information  onmatters that impact our employees.  Tosatisfy that need, the Group provides  employees with published financial and  economic information through its  consultative procedures and through  groups such as the Invensys European  Employees Forum (IEEF). Invensys  encourages employees involvement in  theCompanys performance through the  Invensys Savings Related Share Option  Scheme. Invensys also encourages the  involvement of technical, professional  andmanagerial level employees in the  Groups performance through the Invensys  Performance Management System, which  reinforces the links between the Groups  business goals, the employees  contribution and his/her remuneration.  Greater detail on these topics and further  information concerning employees and  social and community issues is set out in  the Corporate Responsibility report, which  begins on page 32. 76 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  Charitable and political contributions During the year, Group donations to  charities and community causes worldwide  were 0.2 million (2011: 0.3 million), with  UK charities receiving nil (2011: nil).  TheBoard is of the view that it is not  appropriate for the Company to make  charitable donations given that the  Company only resumed the payment of  dividends in recent years. However, many  of the Groups subsidiaries are influential  companies and important employers in  their own countries or localities, and it is  therefore believed to be in the best  interests of the Group for those companies  community involvement to be maintained  at reasonable levels.  At the 2011 AGM, shareholders passed  aresolution, on a precautionary basis,  toauthorise the Company to make  politicaldonations and/or incur political  expenditure (as such terms are defined  insections 362 to 379 of the Companies  Act 2006), in each case in amounts not  exceeding 25,000 in aggregate. The  definitions used in the Companies Act  2006 are broad in nature and this authority  was sought to ensure that any activities  undertaken throughout the Group, which  could otherwise be construed to fall within  these provisions, could be undertaken  without inadvertently infringing them.  Shareholders will be asked to renew this  resolution at the 2012 AGM. No political donations were made during  the year under review. Research and development The Group carries out research and  development in support of its activities.  During the year, expenditure on the  research and development of new  products and processes amounted to  117million (2011: 129 million). Significant agreements The Company is required to disclose any  contractual or other arrangements which  itconsiders are essential to its business.  Invensys critical relationships are with its  major customers and its suppliers of  services, components and raw materials, as  discussed in the Business Review on pages  17 to 44. Whilst the loss of, or disruption to,  certain of these arrangements could  temporarily affect the operations of the  Group, none of these arrangements are  considered to be essential.  The Company is also required to disclose  any significant agreements that take effect,  alter or terminate on a change of control of  the Company. Pursuant to Schedule 7 of  the Large and Mediumsized Companies  and Groups (Accounts and Reports)  Regulations 2008, the directors disclose  that in the event of a change of control in  the Company: (i) the banking facilities  described in Note 21, totalling 600 million  at 31 March 2012, could cease to be  available to the Group; (ii) a Master Service  Agreement dated 15 May 2007, made with  Genpact International, LLC for the provision  of outsourced business services in relation  to certain finance, IT and related functions,  would become terminable at the option of  the Company; and (iii) a Master Service  Agreement dated 3 July 2009, made with  Cognizant Technology Solutions U.S.  Corporation forthe provision of certain  research and development services to the  Invensys Operations Management division  (and alsoto Invensys Rail from December  2009), would become terminable at the  option ofthe Company.  The executive directors service contracts  contain provisions which would take effect  in the event of a change of control. In the  event of a material adverse change to their  title, responsibilities or status following  achange of control of the Company, they  would be entitled to terminate their  employment and receive a payment equal  to the termination payment set out in the  Remuneration Report on page 69. The  service contracts of a small number of  other key employees also contain  provisions entitling them to terminate  employment and receive compensation  inthe event of a change of control. Auditor In accordance with section 418(2) of the  Companies Act 2006, each of the directors  at the date of approval of this Report  confirms that, so far as they are aware, there  is no relevant audit information of which the  Companys auditor is unaware, and that the  directors have taken all the steps that they  ought to have taken as directors in order to  make themselves aware of, and to establish  that the auditor is aware of, any relevant  audit information. Ernst & Young LLP has  expressed willingness to continue in office  as auditor and, in accordance with the  recommendation of the Audit Committee,  resolutions proposing its reappointment  and to authorise the directors to determine  its remuneration will be proposed at the  2012 AGM. Annual General Meeting The AGM of the Company will be held  onFriday, 13 July 2012 at 11.00am at  TheQueen Elizabeth II Conference Centre,  Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London  SW1P 3EE.

Company law requires the directors to  prepare Company and Group Financial  Statements for each financial year. Under  that law the directors must not approve  theFinancial Statements unless they are  satisfied that they give a true and fair view  of the state of affairs of the Company and  Group and of their profit or loss for that  period. In preparing the Company and  Group Financial Statements, the directors  are required to: 	 select suitable accounting policies	 andthen apply them consistently; 	 present information, including	 accounting policies, in a manner that  provides relevant, reliable, comparable  and understandable information; 	 provide additional disclosures	 whencompliance with the specific  requirements in applicable accounting  standards is insufficient to enable users  to understand the impact of particular  transactions, other events and conditions  on the entitys financial position and  financial performance; and 	 state that the Company and the Grouphave complied with applicable  accounting standards, subject to any  material departures disclosed and  explained in the Financial Statements. The directors are responsible for keeping  adequate accounting records that are  sufficient to show and explain the  transactions of the Company and of the  Group and disclose with reasonable  accuracy at any time the financial position  of the Company and of the Group and  enable them to ensure that the Financial  Statements comply with the Companies  Act 2006. They are also responsible for  safeguarding the assets of the Company  and the Group, and hence for taking  reasonable steps for the prevention and  detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Groups business activities, together  with the factors likely to affect its future  development, performance and position  are set out in the Business Review on pages  18 to 45. The financial position of the  Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and  borrowing facilities are described in the  Financial Review on pages 26 to 30. Note  22 to the Financial Statements includes: the  Groups objectives, policies and processes  for managing its capital; its financial risk  management objectives; details of its  financial instruments and hedging  activities; and its exposure to credit risk  and liquidity risk. The principal risks and  uncertainties facing the Group, along  withmitigating actions, are set out on  pages 39 to 44. The Group remains generally in a sound  financial position with net cash, banking  facilities totalling 600 million in place until  2017, and wellestablished relationships  with key customers and suppliers. The directors have a reasonable  expectation that the Company and Group  have adequate resources to continue in  operational existence for the foreseeable  future. For this reason, they continue to  adopt the going concern basis in preparing  the annual Financial Statements. Directors responsibility statement We confirm that to the best of our  knowledge: a) the Financial Statements for the year  ended 31 March 2012, prepared in  accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards as adopted for  use in the European Union, give a true  and fair view of the assets, liabilities,  financial position and profit of the  Company and the undertakings  included in the consolidation as a  whole; and b) the Business Review includes a fair  review of the development and  performance of the business and the  position of the Company and the  undertakings included in the  consolidation as a whole, together  witha description of the principal  risksand uncertainties that they face.

The financial reporting framework  that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by  the European Union. This report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body,  in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act  2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state  to the Companys members those matters we are required to state  to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.  To the  fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume  responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the  Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  or for the opinions we have formed. Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors  Responsibilities set out on page 78, the directors are responsible  for the preparation of the Group Financial Statements and for  being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  Our  responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group  Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and  International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  Those  standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards  Ethical Standards for Auditors. Scope of the audit of the Group Financial Statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and  disclosures in the Group Financial Statements sufficient to give  reasonable assurance that the Group Financial Statements are free  from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.   This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies  are appropriate to the Groups circumstances and have been  consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the  reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the  directors; and the overall presentation of the Group Financial  Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial  information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material  inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we  become aware of any apparent material misstatements or  inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. Opinion on Group Financial Statements In our opinion the Group Financial Statements: 	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups affairs as at  31March 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended; 	 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as  adopted by the European Union; and 	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the  Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

Invensys plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales whose shares are  publiclytraded.  Invensys Group comprises continuing operations and discontinued operations. No further operations have been discontinued  in the current year. Additional costs have been incurred relating to prior year disposals. Operations presented as discontinued  are explained in Note 11. Continuing operations consist of the following divisions: Invensys Operations Management, Invensys Rail and Invensys Controls.  The principal activities of each of the continuing operations divisions are as follows: 	 Invensys Operations Management — is a technology, software and consulting business that creates and applies technologies  to enable the safe and efficient operation of industrial and commercial operations such as oil refineries, fossil fuel and nuclear  power plants, petrochemical works and other manufacturing sites. 	 Invensys Rail — provides software-based signalling, communication and control systems that enable the safe and efficient  operation of trains in mainline and mass transit networks across the world. 	 Invensys Controls — designs, engineers and manufactures products, components, systems and services used in appliances,  heating, air conditioning/cooling and refrigeration products across a wide range of industries in residential and commercial  markets. Further details on the activities of each of the above continuing operations are given in the Our Business Model section of this  Annual Report and Accounts. This is the basis on which the Group is managed.  2 Accounting policies      Statement of compliance   The Groups consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting  Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. Basis of preparation    The accounting policies which follow set out the policies and measurement bases that have been applied in preparing the  Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012. The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling and all  amounts are rounded to the nearest million (m) unless otherwise indicated.    Changes in accounting policies    The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows:    The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee  (IFRIC) interpretations during the year. All have been endorsed for use in the EU.    IAS 24  Related Party Disclosures (revised)  Amendments to IFRS 1  Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures  Amendments to IFRIC 14  Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement  IFRIC 19  Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments  Improvements to IFRSs  Annual improvements May 2010 Adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had any material effect on the Financial Statements of the Group.  Basis of consolidation    The consolidated Financial Statements comprise Invensys plc and its subsidiaries for the financial year to 31 March each year.  The Group does not currently have any material associates. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same  reporting year as the Parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.    All intragroup balances and transactions have been eliminated.    The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are consolidated up to, or from, the date control passes. Business combinations completed on or after 1 April 2010    Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business combination is measured as  the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling  interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree is measured either at fair  value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets. Consideration transferred includes any contingent  consideration measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration  which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to  other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that qualifies for classification as equity is not remeasured until it is  finally settled. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.    Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net identifiable assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the balance sheet.  If the cost is lower than the net identifiable assets acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.    88  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued      A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group  loses control over a subsidiary, it:    	 Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary;    	 Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;    	 Derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity;   	 Recognises the fair value of the consideration received;    	 Recognises the fair value of any investment retained;   	 Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; and   	 Reclassifies the parents share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or  retained earnings, as appropriate.   If a subsidiary with a non-controlling interest incurs losses, the non-controlling interests share in those losses is attributed to  non-controlling interests in equity even if that results in a deficit balance.      Business combinations completed prior to 1 April 2010    In comparison to the approach explained above, the following differences apply to the accounting for business combinations  completed prior to 1 April 2010.    Non-controlling interests (formerly known as minority interests) were measured at the proportionate share of the acquirees  identifiable net assets and costs directly attributable to the acquisition formed part of the cost of the business combination.  Contingent consideration was included in the cost of the business combination if, and only if, the Group had a present  obligation, the economic outflow was more likely than not and a reliable estimate could be determined. Subsequent  adjustments to the contingent consideration were recognised as part of goodwill.     On loss of control, the Group accounted for the investment retained at its proportionate share of net asset value at the date  control was lost. The carrying value of such investments at 1 April 2010 has not been restated.   A non-controlling interests share in losses was attributed to non-controlling interests in equity until the balance was reduced to  nil. Any further excess losses were attributed to the parent unless the non-controlling interest had a binding obligation to cover  them. Any such losses prior to 1 April 2010 have not been reallocated between the non-controlling interest and the parent.  In accordance with the exemption permitted by IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards,  applied by the Group on transition to IFRSs (1 April 2004), business combinations prior to IFRS transition were not restated to  comply with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.    Exceptional items    Exceptional items are material items of income and expense that are separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the  Groups financial performance and in making projections of future results. Such items may be operating or non-operating in  nature. Exceptional items are presented separately on the face of the income statement and analysed in the Notes to the  Financial Statements.    Foreign currencies    The presentational currency of the Group and functional currency of Invensys plc is sterling.    The Financial Statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries are prepared using their functional currency. The functional  currency is generally the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.     Foreign currency transactions    Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the dates of the transactions.    Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance  sheet date. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the income statement unless:    a)   the monetary assets or liabilities to which they relate form the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedging relationship that  qualifies for hedge accounting; or   b)  the monetary assets or liabilities to which they relate form part of a net investment in a foreign operation;    in which case they are recognised directly in equity.    Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as  at the date of the initial transaction.    Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated at the rates prevailing when the  fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period, except  for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly  inequity.        Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 89 Financial statements of foreign operations   The trading results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the year. Assets  and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill, are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange ruling at the  balance sheet date. All resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in a separate component of equity. On disposal  of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in equity are transferred to the consolidated income  statement, as part of the profit or loss on sale.   Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRSs (1 April 2004) were deemed to be zero at that date. As a  result, if a foreign operation is sold, there is no exchange difference recognised in the income statement relating to the period  prior to that date.   Revenue    Composition of revenue   Revenue comprises the invoiced value of goods and services supplied by the Group excluding intragroup transactions and  sales taxes. Revenue relating to construction contracts, including long-term service provision contracts, represents the value of  work performed during the year determined by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Discounts given to  customers against list prices, such as trade or volume discounts, are deducted in arriving at the value of revenue. Settlement  discounts are reported as an expense in the income statement.    Recognition of revenue and profits   Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can  bereliably measured. The specific methods used to recognise the different forms of revenue earned by the Group are set  outbelow.    Sale of goods    Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to  the buyer and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. For sales of software solutions, revenue is recognised when a  signed contract exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the  sales proceeds is considered probable. A contract to deliver goods, including software solutions, that requires significant  production, modification, customisation or integration of the goods, is accounted for in its entirety as a construction contract. Profit is recognised at the time of sale.    Construction contracts and rendering of services    Revenue from construction contracts and long-term service provision contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of  completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally determined by the proportion that contract costs  incurred to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of  completion. If the nature of a particular contract means that costs incurred do not accurately reflect the progress of contract  activity, an alternative approach is used such as the achievement of pre-determined contract milestones.    Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included in revenue from construction contracts when certain  criteria are met. Variations are included when the customer has agreed to the variation or acknowledged liability for the  variation in principle. Claims are included when negotiations with the customer have reached an advanced stage such that the  customer is certain to accept the claim. Incentive payments are included when a contract is sufficiently advanced that it is  probable that the performance standards triggering the incentive will be achieved.   Profit attributable to contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed. On all  contracts, full provision is made for any losses in the year in which they are first foreseen.    Revenue from services provided on a short-term or one-off basis is recognised when the service is complete.    When a transaction combines a supply of goods with the provision of a significant service, revenue from the provision of the  service is recognised separately from the revenue from the sale of goods by reference to the stage of completion of the service  unless the service is essential to the functionality of the goods supplied, in which case the whole transaction is treated as a  construction contract. Revenue from a service that is incidental to the supply of goods is recognised at the same time as the  revenue from the supply of goods.    Research and development    All research expenditure is expensed as incurred. Development expenditure is expensed as incurred unless it meets the criteria  for recognition as an intangible asset (see policy on Other intangible assets).    Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits    For defined benefit plans, the service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to  operating profit or loss in the year. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for  each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in  respect of past service that vest immediately is also charged to operating profit or loss in the year. The expected return on the  assets, of the schemes during the year, based on the market value of scheme assets at the start of the financial year is included  within Other finance charges — IAS 19. This also includes a charge representing the expected increase in liabilities of the  schemes during the year, arising from the liabilities of the scheme being one year closer to payment. Differences between actual  and expected returns on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year, together  with differences from changes in assumptions. The net surplus or deficit on defined benefit pension schemes is reported on the  balance sheet within the pension asset or liability.      90  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued      The value of any defined benefit asset recognised is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the  form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. When the Group is committed to making  minimum funding payments to a defined benefit plan, and the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the  liability in respect of the plan as measured under IFRSs, a provision is recognised for any part of the resulting surplus that would  not be recoverable.     For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs is the contributions  payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as  accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.   Goodwill    On a business combination the net identifiable assets are assessed and adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies  of the business acquired into alignment with those of the Group. For a business combination with an acquisition date on or after  1 April 2010, the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred and the amount  recognised for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree over the identifiable net assets acquired is included in intangible  assets as goodwill. For a business combination with an acquisition date before 1 April 2010, goodwill was determined as the  excess of the price paid over the Groups interest in the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.     Any costs of integrating the acquired business are taken to the income statement.    Goodwill arising on business combinations before 1 April 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount subject to  being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated  and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.    Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, and it is subsequently carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  TheGroups policy on testing assets for impairment is set out under Impairment of non-financial assets on page 91. Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold. Other intangible assets    Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of  intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at acquisition date. The cost of separately acquired  intangible assets, including computer software, comprises the purchase price and any directly attributable costs of preparing  the asset for use. Amortisation begins when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate the  cost less residual value of assets over their estimated useful lives using the following annual rates or useful lives:   Development costs  10 to 25% Computer software costs  10 to 25% Patents, trademarks and licences  Shorter of period of the agreement or 15 years Useful lives are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. No  intangible assets other than goodwill are considered to have indefinite useful lives.   Expenditure incurred on development projects is capitalised as an intangible asset if it meets the recognition criteria set out in  IAS 38, Intangible Assets. These require it to be probable that the expenditure will generate future economic benefits and can  be measured reliably. To meet these criteria, it is necessary to be able to demonstrate, among other things, the technical  feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.   Costs incurred in the preliminary stage of a development project are considered to be research costs, and are recognised in the  income statement as incurred. These costs are incurred to determine the product concepts and alternatives, evaluate the  alternatives and related risks, assess the technical feasibility of concepts, make the final selection from the possible alternatives  and prepare the high level design and project planning. The costs incurred in the following development stage for substantially  new or improved products are assessed against the IAS 38 criteria and considered for recognition as an asset when they meet  those criteria. These costs are generally incurred in developing the detailed product design, software configuration and  software interfaces; the coding of software, building of prototypes and integration of the software with hardware; and testing  and releasing the product to manufacture and pilot production.    Development expenditure directed towards incremental improvements in existing products does not qualify for recognition as  an intangible asset.    In general the costs of developing software products that are sold in packaged form and not integrated and sold with hardware  are not recognised as intangible assets. The uncertainties associated with the functionality of these products mean that  technical feasibility is achieved only immediately prior to or after field trial tests at customer sites. As a result minimal or no costs  are considered to meet the IAS 38 criteria for recognition.    An intangible asset acquired in a business combination is recognised separately from the goodwill arising on the business  combination if the assets fair value can be measured reliably, regardless of whether the asset had been recognised previously  by the acquiree.     Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 91 Property, plant and equipment    Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.  The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs.    Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated  useful lives at the following rates applied to original cost:    Freehold land  nil Freehold buildings  2 to 2.5% Leasehold properties  Over the period of the lease Plant and equipment  7 to 35% Useful lives and residual values are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective  basis.    Impairment of non-financial assets   At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any non-financial asset (excluding goodwill) may  be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually whether or not there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill was also  tested for impairment at the date of transition to IFRSs (1 April 2004). If there is an indication of impairment, the Group makes an  estimate of the assets recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is  written down to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.   An assets recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an  individual asset. If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of  assets the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.    The calculation of an assets value in use uses a discount rate that reflects the asset specific risks and the time value of money. Leased assets    Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value or, if lower, the  present value of the minimum lease payments. Capitalised leased assets are subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the  lease term or the assets useful life. Obligations related to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are  included as appropriate within liabilities. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the  lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged  directly against income.    Other leases are classified as operating leases. Lease payments, including any premium paid at the outset of the lease, made  under operating leases are recognised as an expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.    The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at its  inception date and an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or  assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.    A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies:    a)   there is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement;    b)   a renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the  lease term;    c)   there is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is dependent on a specified asset; or    d)  there is a substantial change to the asset.    Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave  rise to the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b).    Inventories    Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving  items. Cost comprises the cost of raw materials, determined on a first-in, first-out cost basis, and an appropriate proportion of  labour and manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity, to reflect the costs incurred in bringing the product  to its present location and condition.   Cash and cash equivalents    Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, call deposits and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities  of three months or less.    Cash and short-term deposits at the balance sheet date are offset against bank loans and overdrafts where formal rights of  set-off exist and there is an intention to settle on a net basis.         92  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued      Taxation   Income tax on profit or loss    Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income  statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in  which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.    Current tax    The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  Taxable profit differs from profit reported in the income statement as it excludes items that are never taxable or deductible, or  which are taxable or deductible in other years. The Groups current tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates and tax  laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.    Deferred income tax    Deferred income tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the  carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes.  Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the  asset can be utilised.     No deferred income tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in  subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the  temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Such assets and liabilities are also not recognised if the  temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets other than goodwill or  liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. A deferred income tax asset is  recognised on the initial recognition of goodwill arising in a business combination if the carrying amount of the goodwill is less  than its tax base and the deferred income tax asset qualifies for recognition. No deferred income tax liability is recognised as a  result of the initial recognition of goodwill.    The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.  Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it is  probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.  Deferred income tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the  liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against  current tax liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its  current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.   Financial instruments    Derivative financial instruments    The Group primarily uses forward foreign currency contracts to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  These instruments are accounted for as hedges when they are designated as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Group  does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes.   All derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair values of forward foreign exchange  contracts are calculated by reference to forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.    The designation of derivative financial instruments as hedges is carried out according to the Groups risk management policies.  Hedges fall into three categories:    a)   Fair value hedges, which hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability;    b)   Cash flow hedges, which hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated  with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, or the foreign currency risk of a firm  commitment; and    c)   Net investment hedges, which hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups net investment in foreign operations  due to changes in exchange rates.    The accounting treatment for these categories is outlined below:   Fair value hedges   When a hedging instrument is remeasured at fair value, any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Any  gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged  item and similarly recognised in the income statement.    Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 93 Cash flow and net investment hedges    The portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity. Any  ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. When a hedged cash flow related to a hedged item  results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are  included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised  in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement. In  the case of a net investment hedge, this takes place on disposal.   Where borrowings are used to hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the  borrowings that is determined to be an effective hedge, in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and  Measurement, is recognised in equity. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments  that do not qualify as hedges are recognised in the income statement.    Derivative instruments held by the Groups pension and post-retirement benefit schemes are accounted for within the schemes  themselves and are reflected in the Group Financial Statements within the amounts reported for those schemes.   Other financial assets    The Groups other financial assets are classified as either available-for-sale, at fair value through profit or loss, or held-to- maturity. These financial assets are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured as follows: (a) at fair value for  available-for-sale financial assets. Gains and losses are recognised in equity except for impairment losses, interest and  dividends arising from these assets which are recognised in the income statement; (b) at fair value for financial assets at fair  value through profit or loss. Net gains or losses are based on changes in fair value; and (c) at amortised cost, using the effective  interest rate method, for held-to-maturity financial assets. Changes to the carrying amount of held-to-maturity assets are  recognised in the income statement.   Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment. Trade and other receivables are  discounted when the time value of money is considered material. Any change in their value is recognised in the income  statement.    Debt instruments    All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable issue costs.  After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective  interest rate method. This cost is computed as the amount initially recognised minus principal repayments, plus or minus the  cumulative amortisation of any difference between the initially recognised amount and the maturity amount. Amortised cost is  calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.    Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement through the amortisation process and when the liabilities are  derecognised.    Financial guarantee contracts    A financial guarantee contract is a contract issued by the Group that requires the Group to make specified payments to  reimburse the holder of the guarantee for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in  accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. In a very limited number of cases, the Group has issued  such contracts to guarantee certain borrowings by third parties.   Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of (a) the estimated  outflow of resources required to meet any present obligation under the contract (in accordance with IAS 37, Provisions,  Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets), and (b) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative  amortisation recognised (in accordance with IAS 18, Revenue).    Derecognition of financial instruments    A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of  an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original  liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income  statement.     94  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued      Impairment of financial assets    At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.    Assets carried at amortised cost    Assets carried at amortised cost, such as loans and receivables, are impaired if there is objective evidence that an impairment  loss has been incurred. The loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of  estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial  assets original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the  asset is reduced through use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.  The assessment considers whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually  significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no  objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, the asset is included in a group of financial  assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that  are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is recognised are not included in a collective  assessment of impairment.   If the amount of a recognised impairment loss decreases in a subsequent period, and the decrease can be related objectively to  an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. The reversal is  recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the  reversal date.    For trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency  or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the  original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired  debts are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.   Available-for-sale financial investments    If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and  amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred  from equity to the income statement. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available for sale are not  recognised in the income statement. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through the income  statement, if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment  loss was recognised in the income statement.   Share-based payment    The Group operates various equity-settled and cash-settled share schemes.    For equity-settled share options, the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share  options. The fair value is calculated at grant date using a valuation model and recognised in the consolidated income statement,  together with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an  estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into  account when estimating the fair value. Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to the share price of the  Company.    For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is calculated based on the share price at the grant date and, where  applicable, any market vesting conditions, and expensed over the vesting period based on the number of shares expected to  vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a  market or non-vesting condition; which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition  is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.    Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the  terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any  modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the  employee as measured at the date of modification.    Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet  recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of  either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as  a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of  the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.     For cash-settled share awards, the services received from employees are measured at fair value and recognised in the  consolidated income statement as an expense over the vesting period with recognition of a corresponding liability. The fair  value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in  the consolidated income statement.        Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 95 Treasury shares   Own equity instruments which are re-acquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit  or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments. Treasury shares are purchased and  held by the Employee Share Trust to meet future distributions of shares to employees under the Groups various share option  and share award schemes.    New standards and interpretations not applied    The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these  Financial Statements:    International Accounting Standards (IASs/IFRSs)  Effective date – financial periods  beginning on or after IFRS 1  Amendments to IFRS 1 — Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for  First-Time Adopters  1 July 2011 IFRS 7  Amendments to IFRS 7 — Disclosures: Transfers of Assets  1 July 2011 IAS 12  Amendments to IAS 12 — Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets  1 January 2012 IAS 1 Amendments to IAS 1 — Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 1 July 2012 IFRS 1 Amendments to IFRS 1 — Government Loans 1 January 2013 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosures of Involvement with Other Entities 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013 IAS 19 Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits 1 January 2013 IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (2011) 1 January 2013 IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) 1 January 2013 IAS 32 Amendments to IAS 32 — Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2014 IFRS 9  Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement (and subsequent amendments) 1 January 2015   International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)  Effective date – financial periods  beginning on or after IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine 1 January 2013 The Group expects to adopt these standards and interpretations in accordance with their effective dates.     The amendments to IAS 19 are expected to have an impact on the amounts recognised in profit or loss and other  comprehensive income for the Groups defined benefit pension plans. Under the amendments, the return on plan assets  recognised in profit or loss within Other finance charges — IAS 19 will be calculated using a plans discount rate, rather than its  expected rate of return on plan assets. Assuming that the discount rate is lower than the expected rate of return on plan assets,  this will result in an increase in the net charge recognised as Other finance charges — IAS 19 within profit or loss. The extent of  the impact will depend on the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets that apply when the amendments are  first adopted in the financial year ending 31 March 2014. There will be a corresponding change in the amount recognised in  other comprehensive income, so that the net impact on total comprehensive income will be nil. The Group will assess the impact  of this and other aspects of the amendments to IAS 19 prior to their first adoption.    Other than the amendment to IAS 19 noted above, the directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and  interpretations will have a material impact on the Group Financial Statements in the period of initial application.  96  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3 Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions    In applying the Groups accounting policies, management is required to make judgements and assumptions concerning the  future in a number of areas. Actual results may be different from those estimated using these judgements andassumptions.  Thekey sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material  adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. Construction and long-term service provision contracts    Invensys Operations Management and Invensys Rail undertake projects that frequently span more than one accounting period  and are accounted for as construction or long-term service provision contracts. The Groups accounting policies for these  projects require revenues and costs to be allocated to individual accounting periods and the consequent recognition at period  end of contract assets or liabilities for projects still in progress. The application of these policies requires management to apply  judgement in estimating the total revenue and total costs expected on each project. Such estimates are revised as a project  progresses to reflect the current status of the project and the latest information available to management. Project management  teams perform regular reviews to ensure the latest estimates are appropriate.    The amount of revenue relating to projects accounted for as construction or long-term service provision contracts recognised  inthe year ended 31 March 2012 was 1,233 million (2011: 1,193 million). The net amount due from contract customers on  projects in progress at 31 March 2012 was 56 million (2011: 19 million). Further details of amounts due from and to contract  customers are included in Note 18.    Impairment of goodwill    The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use  of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value in use amount requires management to  makean estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate  inorder to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 March 2012 was 289 million  (2011: 291 million). Details of the key assumptions used in testing for impairment and the sensitivity of the calculations to any  reasonably possible change in those assumptions are given in Note 14.    Pension and post-retirement benefits    The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post employment medical benefits is determined using actuarial  valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future  salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are  subject to significant uncertainty. The net pension liability at 31 March 2012 was 426 million (2011: 467 million). Further details,  including an analysis of the sensitivity of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) and Invensys Pension Plan (US) to changes in the  principal assumptions, are given in Note 25.    Development costs    Costs incurred in developing new products are capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for other  intangible assets. These costs arise mainly in the Invensys Operations Management and Invensys Rail divisions. Determining  theamounts to be capitalised requires management to make assumptions and estimates regarding the expected future cash  generation of new products and the expected period of benefits. At 31 March 2012, the carrying amount of capitalised  development costs was 155 million (2011: 150 million). Further details including an explanation of impairment losses  recognised are given in Note 15.    Provisions and contingent liabilities    The Group currently recognises provisions for a number of liabilities including environmental claims and onerous lease rentals.  The amounts recognised for provisions represent the best estimate of the probable outflow of resources embodying economic  benefits that will be required to settle these liabilities. No provisions are recognised for contingent liabilities. Contingent  liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, or current obligations that  are not recognised because it is not probable that they will result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits or  because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.   The determination of whether a liability should be disclosed as a contingent liability or recognised as a provision requires  judgements to be made on the existence of a present obligation and the probability of future events. When a provision is  required, the amount recognised is determined using judgements and assumptions, based on current knowledge, to estimate  the amount and timing of future cash outflows arising from the liabilities. At 31 March 2012, the estimated amount of liabilities  requiring provisions was 139 million (2011: 173 million). Further details are given in Note 24. Details of the Groups contingent  liabilities are set out in Note 30.     Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 97 4 Operating segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into divisions based on their products and services and has three  reportable operating segments as explained in the Our Business Model section; Invensys Operations Management, Invensys  Rail and Invensys Controls. There have been no changes to the composition of these operating segments during the year.  Descriptions of the products and services provided by these divisions are set out in Note 1. Operations presented as  discontinued are explained in Note 11. Operating results of each of these divisions are monitored separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource  allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated primarily on operating profit or loss before  exceptional items as identified in the consolidated income statement. Restructuring costs and impairment losses on operating  assets, which are reported in the consolidated income statement as exceptional items, are also monitored at the segment level.  Other exceptional items together with foreign exchange gains or losses, finance costs, finance income, finance charges relating  to pension arrangements under IAS 19, Employee Benefits and income tax are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated  to operating segments.

Invensys contends that these tax liabilities were incurred in breach of its EU community law rights. Invensys is part of a Group  Litigation Order with 24 other corporates from whom two test cases were selected to proceed to trial on a representative basis. In December 2006 the European Court of Justice issued its guidance to the UK High Court on the compatibility of certain UK tax  provisions within EU community law. The test cases returned to the UK High Court for the full hearing in July 2008, with the UK  High Court issuing its judgement on 27 November 2008. The UK High Court judgement in November 2008 found in favour of the claimants on certain key aspects of the claim. The  judgement concluded, inter alia, that dividends received from EU subsidiaries should be, and should have been, effectively  exempt from UK taxation. It also concluded that certain dividends received from EU subsidiaries before 5 April 1999 and, in  some limited circumstances, after 1993 from outside the EU, should have been treated as franked investment income, with the  consequence that advance corporation tax need not have been paid. The case was heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2009 and the judgement was handed down on 23 February 2010. The  Court of Appeal has determined that various questions should be referred back to the European Court of Justice for further  clarification. In addition, the Court determined that the claim should be restricted to six years and not cover claims dating back  to 1973. The principal test claimant has sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in the UK on the time limits and the  Supreme Court heard the appeal in February 2012. Several questions were separately referred back to the European Court of  Justice for further clarification and a hearing took place in February 2012 at the European Court of Justice. The courts decisions  are awaited. It is expected that the overall process may take several years to complete. Given the complexity and uncertainty over the issues raised it is not possible to predict the amounts and final outcome with any  reasonable certainty. Therefore no contingent asset has been recognised in the Group Financial Statements. 11 Discontinued operations No operations have been discontinued in the year ended 31 March 2012 or 31 March 2011. In the year ended 31 March 2012,  there was a net charge of 6 million (2011: 7 million) representing additional costs of 8 million (2011: 7 million) incurred in  respect of prior year disposals against which there was a 2 million tax credit (2011: nil).

The title to plant and machinery with a carrying amount of  nil (2011: 1 million) has been pledged as security for liabilities. Included in plant and equipment at 31 March 2012 was an amount of 12 million (2011: 6 million) relating to expenditure for  plant and equipment in the course of construction. Impairment losses of 5 million in the year ended 31 March 2012 comprises 3 million for the write-down of buildings and  equipment associated with a restructuring project undertaken in Invensys Controls and 2 million for the write-down of land  and buildings in Corporate (2011: 4 million related to the write-down of buildings in Invensys Controls resulting from further  changes in production). The recoverable amounts of these assets were estimated based on their fair value less costs to sell.  Fairvalues were determined based on an assessment of the current market values of the assets and past experience of sales  ofsimilar assets.

IMServ is a part of  Invensys Operations Management, but management continues to monitor IMServs goodwill separately. These four CGUs  represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.   108  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 14 Intangible assets — goodwill continued Annual impairment test The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.  Goodwill is tested separately for each CGU or group of CGUs that represent the lowest level within the Group at which the  goodwill is allocated and monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined  from value in use calculations using cash flow projections over a five-year period. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are: 	 revenue volumes; 	 revenue prices; 	 operating costs; 	 growth rate assumptions for years four and five of the cash flow projections; 	 growth in perpetuity applied to calculate the terminal value; and 	 discount rate. Expected revenue volumes, revenue prices and operating costs are those included in the most recent financial annual operating  plans and three-year strategic plans approved by the Board. Annual operating plans are detailed financial forecasts covering  the first year of the Groups three-year strategic plan. The key assumptions underlying the forecasts for the CGUs over the  period of the annual operating and strategic plans are order growth, taking account of the level of historic growth and expected  future developments in markets and operations, and macroeconomic forecasts for the territories and industries in which  theyoperate. Cash flows for years four and five are projected at a growth rate appropriate for the relevant CGUs. These growth rates take into  consideration forecast GDP growth rates for the countries of operation, expected market growth rates for those regions and the  levels of growth achieved historically by the CGUs and forecast in the periods covered by the three-year strategic plan. Lower  growth rates are applied in perpetuity to calculate the terminal values of the CGUs. These rates do not exceed the average  long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. A long-term discount rate is derived for the CGUs by adjusting the Groups  weighted average cost of capital to reflect the relative level of risk associated with the cash flow projections. The discount rate is  a pre-tax rate.

In all cases the recoverable amounts of these CGUs were in excess of their carrying values and no impairment arose in the year  (2011: nil). Sensitivity to change in assumptions With respect to the assessment of value in use of all CGUs, except IMServ, management believes that no reasonable change in  any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount. With respect  to IMServ the details are tabulated below: Amount by which the CGUs recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount 1.2m Key assumption Terminal growth rate Discount rate Value of key assumption 2.4% 11.1% Amount by which the value assigned to the key assumption must change in order for the  CGUs recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying amount (% points) 0.2% 0.1% The assumptions for the terminal growth rate would change if the long term GDP for market growth differ from the actual  growth. The discount rate would change if there is a change to the Groups weighted cost of capital caused by a change in  market rates or the risk profile of the Group.

The following is the  analysis of the deferred income tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes: 2012 m 2011 m Deferred income tax assets  70   46  Deferred income tax liabilities  (15)  (18)  55   28  As a result of changes to tax legislation, dividends received from subsidiaries on or after 1 July 2009 are largely exempt from UK  tax but may be subject to dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.  The gross temporary differences of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such potential taxes is 34 million (2011: 13 million).  No deferred income tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of  reversal and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it is  probable that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised. As at 31 March 2012 the Group had income tax losses, capital losses, pension and other retirement benefit obligations and  other deductible temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred income tax assets were recognised  amounting to 8,196 million (2011: 8,098 million). The Groups pension, other retirement obligations and other deductible  temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions. The expiry date of income tax losses and capital losses carried forward  is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose. A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect  of which these restrictions apply is set out below: Gross losses m Tax value m Gross losses  expiring  within  four years m Income tax losses Americas  453   158  — Europe  875   221   8  Asia Pacific  49   18   32   1,377   397   40  Capital losses 1  6,194   1,493   5  Pension, other retirement obligations and other deductible temporary differences  625   191  —  8,196   2,081   45  1 Of the total capital losses in the Group, 6 billion are carried forward in the UK. The standard rate of UK corporation tax has reduced to 24% from 1 April 2012 and is expected to continue to fall by 1% each  year to 22% in 2014. The impact of the rate change to 22% would reduce the total unrecognised deferred income tax assets by  130 million.

This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience and future recoverability. The net impairment loss  recognised in the year as a result of irrecoverable receivables balances is nil (2011: nil). Trade and other receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing.

Restricted cash and short-term deposits The Group has operations in a number of territories including China, Brazil and India which place restrictions on the ability of  subsidiaries to lend money to other Group entities outside those territories. However, distributions to the Group are permitted  from audited reserves. At 31 March 2012 restricted cash and cash equivalents held in such territories totalled 58 million  (2011:58 million).

This was replaced by two new five-year bank facilities totalling 600 million, comprising a  250million revolving credit facility and a 350 million multi-currency bonding and guarantee facility. On 30 March 2012 the 25 million bilateral credit facility, maturing in July 2013, was also cancelled. Uncommitted bond and guarantee facilities  In addition, at 31 March 2012, the Group had bonds and guarantees totalling 227 million (2011: 219 million) issued under  uncommitted facilities. Of these, 29 million (2011: 31 million) are supported by cash collateral and a further 14 million   (2011: 17 million) are supported by guarantees issued under the Groups committed syndicated loan facility. 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank facilities for cash advances, guarantees, leases, cash and cash  equivalents, other financial assets, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables. The Group also enters into  derivative transactions, primarily forward currency contracts. This note explains the nature and extent of the risks arising from  financial instruments; how those risks arise; the objectives, policies and processes used by the Group for managing the risks;  and the methods used to measure the risks. Overview of treasury policy The Group manages its exposure to risks arising from its use of financial instruments by the application of its treasury policy. The Groups treasury policy is approved by the Board and seeks to ensure that: 	 appropriate financial resources are available for the maintenance and development of the Groups divisions; 	 the financial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty credit exposure is understood, measured and managed  appropriately; and 	 the Treasury department operates as a cost centre and that no speculative transactions are undertaken. There have been no significant changes in the Groups exposures to risk, and its approach to managing those exposures, in the  year ended 31 March 2012. The Groups policy in respect of the major areas of treasury management is set out below. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. Operating within the strict controls of the Groups treasury policy, the Treasury department manages this risk, ensuring that  sufficient funding and liquidity is available to meet the expected needs of the Group together with a prudent level of headroom  to allow for cash flow and bank guarantee variability. In addition to the free cash flow of the Group, Invensys adopts a flexible  approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt facilities and short-term cash deposits. Funding is  provided by a 250 million bank facility which matures in March 2017, as described in Note 21(ii). The undrawn level of this  facility together with the Groups cash balances, as set out in Note 20, are the key measures of the Groups liquidity. Bank guarantees issued by the Group as set out in Note 21(ii) represent a potential liquidity requirement. This risk is mitigated by  issuing guarantees under the committed syndicated loan facility and holding sufficient liquidity to cover the forecast cash  requirements of guarantees issued under uncommitted facilities. Liquidity management is centralised through cash pooling arrangements and inter-company funding structures, under the  control of the Treasury department. In countries where cash pooling arrangements cannot be implemented, cash balances are  monitored to ensure that surplus amounts are repatriated and deficits adequately funded. The Treasury department maintains  sufficient back-up liquidity in the form of available cash balances and committed facilities. Standard business practices include the strict application of credit control procedures to ensure the collection of cash from  customers in accordance with agreed credit periods and terms that result in positive cash flows over the life of a construction or  long-term service provision contract whenever possible.

As at 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011, Invensys had no significant borrowings.  The interest rate profiles of the Groups cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term borrowings are set out in Notes 20  and 21 respectively. All other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are non-interest bearing and a statement has been  made to that effect in the relevant balance sheet notes.  116  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held  constant, on the Groups profit before tax (through the impact on floating-rate cash and borrowings). There is no impact on the  Groups equity. The same assumptions have been used for the years ended 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011.

The  incidence ofthis risk varies across the Group and is subject to change. However, the majority of revenues and costs will usually  be in the functional currency of the business unit undertaking the transaction. Where this is not the case and the exposure is  significant, it is the Groups policy for business units to hedge their exposures. The Group predominantly uses forward currency  contracts to manage transaction exposure. The Group is also subject to exchange risk when making bids, particularly on major contracts, where movements against the  specific exchange rate assumed within a bid would lead to a change in the anticipated margin on the contract should the bid be  successful. This exposure to contract risk is hedged if significant. Translation exposure The majority of the Groups operating capital is employed in overseas locations and is denominated in foreign currencies,  particularly US dollars. As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both net asset values and reported results. This risk  is not hedged directly, but to the extent that the Group has debt, any that is held in foreign currency would reduce the level of  net assets exposed to currency fluctuations. The interest expense related to such debt would also reduce the level of earnings  exposed to exchange rate movements.  The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows: At 31 March  US dollar  2012   m  Euro  2012   m  Other  (excl Sterling)  2012   m  US dollar  2011   m  Euro  2011   m  Other (excl Sterling) 2011  m Net assets of non-Sterling functional currency  entities   261   134   212   221   107   200  Net unhedged monetary assets not held in  entities functional currencies  44   21   22   56   16   (41) Gross exposure  305   155   234   277   123   159  The significant exchange rates that applied during the year are set out in Note 37.

Such a risk arises  principally in relation to receivables due from customers and cash deposited with banks or other financial institutions. The Group monitors the identity of the counterparties with whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial instruments so as  to control exposure to any territory or institution. As far as it is both feasible and practical to do so, cash is held centrally by the  Treasury department. Risk is assessed using ratings from major credit rating agencies.  The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their respective carrying values as at the balance  sheet date (see Note 22(i) on page 119). Credit risks arising from acting as guarantor are disclosed in Note 30. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. Details of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements in respect of receivables are given in Note 19. Based on past experience, the directors believe that there is no significant credit risk associated with receivables that are neither  past due nor impaired. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties, and performs credit verification  procedures on all major customers. Receivable balances, including uninvoiced receivables reported as amounts due from  contract customers, are monitored on an ongoing basis.  The Group has not renegotiated the terms of any significant financial assets such that those assets would have been past due or  impaired had the terms not been renegotiated. Capital management Capital is managed under the Groups treasury policy. The policy sets out a strategy for the long-term funding of the Group, with  the objective of ensuring the Group has access to appropriate sources of funding to support its businesses, as and when  required. Key aspects of the policy are: 	 The Groups debt capacity is determined as part of the annual strategic review process; 	 Appropriate contingency levels are maintained to cover unforeseen events; 	 Financing is obtained from multiple sources, for example capital markets, bank debt and cash resources; 	 Funds are raised from various geographical locations; 	 The Group aims to maintain a consistent credit rating; 	 The Group aims to maintain strong relationships with its banks and rating agencies; 	 Interest cover and other financial ratios (principally the ratio of EBITDA to total borrowings and net finance costs) are  maintained at appropriate levels, and compliance with covenant arrangements is tested semi-annually.  118  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Funding is arranged centrally and managed by the Treasury department. The Treasury department can make use of a number  ofapproved funding instruments, including bilateral bank facilities, syndicated bank facilities, public bonds or loan notes,  private placements and commercial paper programmes. New long-term funding requires approval under the Groups Board  Delegated Authority Levels, with facilities in excess of 100 million requiring Board approval. The main credit facility in place at 31 March 2012 provides liquidity for the Group until March 2017 and supports the current  strategy of the Group. This facility, including the related covenant arrangements, is described further in Note 21(ii).  Investigations are continually undertaken to review financing requirements and the availability of funding to meet these.  Inmaking those considerations the Board takes into account the cost of any refinancing compared to the benefits, which  includeterms and conditions, the cost of funding and repayment schedules.  There were no significant changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the years ended 31 March 2012 and  31 March 2011. The Groups capital structure is as follows: At 31 March   Notes 2012  m  2011  m  Capital employed  314   201  Cash and cash equivalents  20  263   349  Borrowings  21  (1)  (1) Net cash  262   348  Total capital (equals total equity)  576   549  Comprising: — Equity holders of parent   556   514  — Non-controlling interests   20   35   576  549  Net cash was 262 million (2011: 348 million), with no amounts held on deposit with a maturity of more than three months  (2011: nil). (i) Classification and fair values of financial assets and liabilities The following table sets out the classification, carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.  Thefair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction  between informed and willing parties. Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting  cash flows at prevailing interest rates translated at year end exchange rates. Provisions have been included where there is  acontractual obligation to settle in cash.

The following methods and assumptions  were used to estimate the fair values: 	 Loans and receivables: trade and other receivables; cash and cash equivalents; provisions and trade and other payables:  thedirectors consider that the carrying amount of these financial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value. 	 Short- and long-term bank and other loans; finance leases: fair values are evaluated based on interest rates. 	 Derivative financial instruments: foreign exchange swaps and forwards: fair values are derived using forward pricing and  swap models. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign exchange spot  and forward rates. The Group has, in the ordinary course of business, provided indemnities to banks in respect of performance guarantees  issuedto customers. The fair value of such indemnities is not material as the likelihood of any liability arising from them is  considered remote. At 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011, the Group had no arrangements in place to guarantee borrowings by third parties. Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation  technique: 	 Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 	 Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either  directly or indirectly; 	 Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on  observable market data. At 31 March 2012: Level 1 m  Level 2 m  Level 3 m  Total m  Financial assets at fair value Derivative financial instruments: — Foreign exchange swaps and forwards   —    3   —    3   —    3   —    3  Financial liabilities at fair value Derivative financial instruments: — Foreign exchange swaps and forwards   —    (3)  —    (3)  —    (3)  —    (3)  120  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued At 31 March 2011: Level 1 m  Level 2 m  Level 3 m  Total m  Financial assets at fair value Derivative financial instruments: — Foreign exchange swaps and forwards   —    2   —    2   —    2   —    2  Financial liabilities at fair value Derivative financial instruments: — Foreign exchange swaps and forwards   —    (4)  —    (4)  —    (4)  —    (4) During the years ended 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011, there were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 fair value  measurements, and no financial instruments requiring Level 3 fair value measurements were held. (ii) Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives to hedge currency transaction exposure, currency translation exposure and contract pricing  exposure. A summary of derivative financial instruments, all of which related to foreign exchange swaps and forwards, is as follows: Fair value 2012  m  Fair value 2011  m  Derivative assets   3   2  Derivative liabilities   (3)  (4)  —    (2) Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge transaction exposure The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to hedge currency exposure arising from sales and purchases made  bythe Groups business units in currencies other than their own functional currency. The turnover (i.e. notional principal) of  suchderivatives (which typically have a term of less than one year), excluding swaps, in the year ended 31 March 2012 was  1,165million (2011: 506 million). All of these instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges. 8 million relating to hedged cash flows that have not  yet impacted the income statement have been deferred and recognised in equity at 31 March 2012 (2011: 8 million). nil (2011:  nil) has been transferred to the income statement during the year ended 31 March 2012 in respect of contracts which matured. Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge translation exposure The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to match the currency profile of its net debt to that of its net assets,  revenue and earnings, and ensures that it has sufficient cash available to meet its payment obligations by currency as they fall  due. The fair value of such derivatives (which typically have a term of less than one year) is nil (2011: nil).  The currency assets and liabilities created by such derivatives at 31 March were: Assets  2012  m  Liabilities  2012  m  Net assets/  (liabilities)  2012  m  Assets  2011  m  Liabilities  2011  m  Net assets/  (liabilities)  2011  m  Sterling   3   (84)  (81)  4   (81)  (77) Euro   23   —    23   35   (5)  30  US dollar   35   —    35   30   —    30  Japanese yen   12   —    12   11   —    11  Other   12   (3)  9   4   —    4   85   (87)  (2)  84   (86)  (2)  Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 121 Changes in the fair value of these derivatives resulted in a gain of nil in the year ended 31 March 2012 (2011: 1 million).  Theseare taken directly to foreign exchange in the income statement, see Note 8. (iii) Ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement No amounts were recognised in the income statement relating to the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges (2011: nil). 23 Assets held for sale Assets held for sale relate to surplus freehold properties that are vacant, no longer used for operational purposes and are being  actively marketed for sale. These properties are expected to be sold within a year of the date of their classification as held for  sale and are included in Corporate in the operating segment analysis in Note 4. The major classes of assets classified as held for sale as at 31 March are: 2012  m  2011 m Current assets Surplus property portfolio  10 11 10 11 24 Provisions  Warranties  m  Restructuring  m  Environmental  m  Onerous  contracts  m  Other  m  Total  m  At 1 April 2011   17   13   46   23   74   173  Charged in year   6   32   6   1   11   56  Released in year   —    (1)  —    (2)  (2)  (5) Utilised in year   (10)  (27)  (8)  (6)  (35)  (86) Unwind of discount of provisions  —    —    1   —    —    1  At 31 March 2012  13   17   45   16   48   139   Note  2012   m  2011   m  Analysed as: Current liabilities   65   85  Non-current liabilities   74   88   139   173  Classification to financial liabilities Financial liabilities at amortised cost  22(i)  16   23  Non-financial liabilities   123   150   139   173  Warranties are provided for in the normal course of business based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past  claims. Such costs are generally incurred over the product life cycle. The actual amount of costs that will be incurred will depend  upon the level and nature of future claims. Restructuring provisions cover committed costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred within one year of the  balance sheet date. Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount can be determined reliably.  This generally coincides with a commitment to a formal plan or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites. These costs  are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.  122  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 24 Provisions continued Provisions for onerous contracts relate to lease rentals in respect of vacant property and the costs of other onerous contracts.  An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the  economic benefits expected to be received under it. The provisions represent the best estimate of the unavoidable costs  remaining under the current contractual terms of the contracts. These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the  next 15 years. Other provisions principally relate to legal claims, claims under workers compensation or similar employee disability benefit  schemes and other miscellaneous obligations. These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next ten years. The  costs are estimated based on the expected outcome of the legal claim or obligation. The amount of the final liability and timing  of payment, if any, is dependent upon the final outcome of any litigation or other negotiation involved. The directors consider that the carrying amount of provisions equates to their fair value. 25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits (i) Defined contribution schemes The Group operates 30 defined contribution schemes. Pension costs in respect of defined contribution schemes  representedcontributions payable in the year and amounted to 19 million (2011: 18 million). At 31 March 2012, there  werenil(2011:1 million) of outstanding contributions included in payables. (ii) Defined benefit schemes — general The Group operates 53 funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement schemes. Contributions to the  defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the independent actuary of the relevant  scheme. There are two main funded defined benefit schemes in the UK and US, together with other smaller schemes in the  restof the world. The Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) is final salary in nature. The  Invensys Pension Plan (US) ceased to be afinal  salary scheme following its closure to future accrual and the freezing of benefits for existing members with effect from  1November 2009. The principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees is the Invensys Pension Scheme. The Invensys Pension  Scheme (UK) is a funded defined benefit scheme. The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group. These  assets are managed by trustees, who are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries. The Trustee Board is  made up of nine directors, four nominated by the Company and five by the members. The Company is responsible for  appointing the Chairman from the Board. The last full actuarial valuation of the scheme for funding purposes was carried out  with a valuation date of 31 March 2011 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the  liabilities. This latest valuation has not changed the schemes funding plan for the next three years. The assumptions that had the  most effect on the results of this valuation for funding purposes are those relating to the discount rate and inflation on scheme  liabilities and mortality assumptions. There are numerous schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries. Of these the largest, Invensys Pension Plan (US), is assessed  annually by an actuary, and the other overseas defined benefit schemes are normally assessed periodically by independent  actuaries in accordance with local practice. The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, the majority of which relate to the provision of  medical benefits to retired former employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US. These schemes are generally unfunded. The last full valuations of all schemes on an IAS 19 basis have been updated to 31 March 2012 to reflect market conditions and  material events in the plans. (iii) Defined benefit schemes — major assumptions The major assumptions made when valuing the liabilities of funded and unfunded schemes under IAS 19 are as follows: As at 31 March 2012 the major financial assumptions are: Funded schemes  Unfunded  schemes Invensys  Pension  Scheme (UK)  %  Invensys  Pension  Plan (US)  % Other  %  %  Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries   4.75   n/a   4.30   3.67  Rate of increase to pensions in payment 1   3.60   n/a   2.47   2.58  Discount rate for scheme liabilities   4.70   4.55   4.61   4.28  Inflation rate 2  3.50   n/a   3.11   2.55  1 The pension increase assumption disclosed for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) is in line with RPI, subject to a floor of 3.0% and a ceiling of 5.0%. 2 The inflation rate for the UK schemes is based on RPI. An additional inflation rate assumption for CPI is required for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK), one Other Funded  scheme and one Other Unfunded scheme to reflect the UK Governments change of the inflation measure used to determine minimum pension increases which impacts  onsome of the pension increases within these schemes. This has been assessed as 2.50% for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK), 2.60% (reflecting a longer duration) for the  Other Funded scheme and 2.50% for the Other Unfunded scheme.   Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 123 As at 31 March 2011 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes  Unfunded  schemes Invensys  Pension  Scheme (UK)  %  Invensys  Pension  Plan (US)  % Other  %  %  Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries   4.95   n/a   4.19   3.09  Rate of increase to pensions in payment 1   3.80   n/a   2.64   2.63  Discount rate for scheme liabilities   5.30   5.65   5.27   5.15  Inflation rate 2  3.70   n/a   3.16   2.60  1 The pension increase assumption disclosed for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) is in line with RPI, subject to a floor of 3.0% and a ceiling of 5.0%. 2 The inflation rate for the UK schemes is based on RPI. An additional inflation rate assumption for CPI is required for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) and for one Other  Funded scheme and one Other Unfunded scheme to reflect the UK Governments change of the inflation measure used to determine minimum pension increases which  impacts on some of the pension increases within these schemes. This has been assessed as 2.95% for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) and 2.95% for the Other Funded plan.  Invensys Pension Scheme (UK): Deferred pension increases In order to determine some minimum pension increases, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used as the inflation measure.  Themain inflation rate remains the Retail Prices Index (RPI) which is the driver for pension increases in payment. This is in line  with changes made by the UK Government to statutory index-linked features of retirement benefits. As the scheme was not  obligated to increase pensions in line with RPI, the change to using CPI was considered to be a change in the increase  assumption, and gave rise to an actuarial gain in accordance with IAS 19. In the main, the change to CPI affected only deferred  pensions and had limited impact on pensions already in payment.  The demographic assumptions which were applied for the main schemes are as follows: Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) Standard SAPS actuarial mortality tables S1PA were adopted. Based on Scheme experience, the probability of death at each  age was multiplied by 103% for males and 113% for females. Future improvements in life expectancy have been allowed for in  line with the standard CMI model projections subject to a long term trend of 1.00% for males and females. These mortality  tables are consistent with those agreed by the Trustees for the 31 March 2011 formal valuation of the Scheme. By way of illustration the impact of the application of these mortality tables on the expected longevity of pensioners is shown  below: Years Retiring today at age 65:  Male  22.0 Female  23.3 Retiring in 20 years at age 65:  Male  23.3 Female  24.9 Invensys Pension Plan (US) The mortality table adopted was the RP 2000 Table for combined employee/annuitants, projected to 2015 using projection  scale AA.   124  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued Sensitivities Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) and Invensys Pension Plan (US) The two largest schemes within the Group are the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) (representing 75% of gross liabilities of all  defined benefit schemes) and the Invensys Pension Plan (US) (18%). The principal sensitivities, with all other variables held  constant, for these two schemes are illustrated below: Invensys Pension Scheme (UK)  Invensys Pension Plan (US) Defined  benefit  obligation  m  Assets 1 m  Net effect m  Defined  benefit  obligation  m  Assets 1 m  Net effect m  Total defined benefit obligation / scheme assets  (Note 25 (v))  (4,326)  4,233   (93)  (1,070)  972  (98)   A 0.1% increase in the assumed inflation rate  would have the following effect 2: (Increase in defined benefit obligation)/increase  in scheme assets  (50)  30   (20)  —   — — A 0.1% decrease in the assumed interest rate  would have the following effect 3: (Increase in defined benefit obligation)/increase  in scheme assets  (61)  49   (12)  (11) 9 (2) A one year increase to the pensioners lives  wouldhave the following effect: Increase in defined benefit obligation  (208)  —    (208)  (29)  —    (29) Applying an additional 0.25% to the  improvement in mortality would have the  following effect: Increase in defined benefit obligation 4  (52)  —    (52)  n/a   n/a   n/a  1 The movement of assets in this table shows the estimated impact on asset values arising from a change of market conditions consistent with the change in discount rate and  inflation assumptions shown. 2 This sensitivity assumes that a 0.1% increase in future inflation expectations result in a 0.1% increase in all inflation-related pension increase assumptions. As a result of the  upper and lower limits on the majority of inflation related pension increases, a given change in the inflation assumption may result in a smaller change in pension increase  assumptions and hence smaller change in the liabilities (particularly where such a change in inflation is large). 3 This illustrates the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to a 0.1% change in all bond yields. The discount rate used to determine the liabilities is based on AA corporate bond yields. 4 This is a slightly different sensitivity to last year, where there was a 0.25% increase in the underpin to mortality improvements.

Where the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the  scheme as measured under IFRSs, and would therefore, when paid, give rise to a surplus as measured under IFRSs, a provision  isrecognised for any part of that surplus that would not be recoverable. Any surplus on the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK)  ultimately repaid by the trustees would currently be subject to a 35% tax charge prior to being repaid, so a liability for this tax  isrecognised at the relevant balance sheet date. At 31 March 2012 the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds  the liability of the scheme under IFRSs and consequently the irrecoverable element of the pension surplus is 34 million  (2011:30 million).

Thisis an accrued benefits valuation method that discounts the best estimate of future cash flows and makes allowance for  projected earnings. If the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) were to be wound up, the relevant employers would be responsible, under section 75 of the  Pensions Act 1995 to fund the  Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) up to the levels of the cost of buying out the benefits for all scheme  members with an insurer. This cost would be considerably more than the value placed on the ongoing liabilities for accounting  purposes. The deficit in the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) calculated on a winding up basis was approximately 1.5billion as at  31March 2011, the date of the last actuarial valuation. This will be reviewed and updated at the next valuation.

The expected return on each asset class has been determined on the basis of market expectations for the rate of return on each  asset class over the life of the related obligation, at the balance sheet date. In respect of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK),   Government and Corporate Bond indices have been used to set the expected rate of return on bonds, and a risk premium  hasbeen applied to determine the expected long-term rate of return on equity investments. Similar processes are applied  toother schemes. The investment strategy determined by the trustees of the Invensys Pension Scheme continues to reflect the mature nature of  the scheme with assets predominantly invested in bonds or bond-like investments.

In addition, the Company will continue to make annual  supplemental contributions to the scheme. These amount to 40 million in the year ending 31 March 2013 increasing by a  further 1 million in the year ending 31 March 2014 and then 2 million per annum thereafter until 2017. Where the proceeds  from the sale of a business exceed 1 million, at least 8% of the proceeds net of tax and costs will be paid as additional  contributions to the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK). The funding plan is subject to revision after the next triennial valuation  whichwillhave a reference date of 31 March 2014. Under the Invensys Pension Plan (US), contributions will be made at the level required to meet the minimum requirements set  forth by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and related regulations.

The nature and purpose of these reserves are as follows: Share premium account This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value. Capital reserve Previously the Group merger reserve, this reserve was created on the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc in February 1999 and  isnon-distributable.  Special reserve This reserve represents the balance remaining after the elimination of the deficit in the reserves of the Parent Company  following the capital reduction on 22 January 2009 . The reserve will remain pending the settlement or consent of creditors  (orcontingent creditors) of the Parent Company in existence at the date of the capital reduction. The reserve is non-distributable. Cash flow hedge reserve This reserve records, for each hedged item in an effective cash flow hedge, the cumulative change in fair value of the expected  future cash flow on the hedged item from the inception of the hedge relationship. Foreign exchange reserve The foreign exchange reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements  offoreign subsidiaries. It is also used to record the foreign exchange on net investments in these subsidiaries.  29 Share-based payment plans (i) Measurement of fair value Share awards An adjusted market value method of valuation, based on market value at grant date and market-based performance  conditions, has been used to calculate the fair value of all share awards granted during the year. Share options The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to calculate the fair value of all share options granted during the year.  These options were granted under savings related share option schemes for which vesting is not dependent on market  conditions. Expected volatility was based on both historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous ten years and on the  implied volatility of traded options of the Groups shares. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on  managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Share-based payment expense The Group recognised total expenses of 5 million (2011: 9 million) related to share-based payment transactions during the  year, of which 4 million (2011: 8 million) related to equity-settled and 1 million (2011: 1 million) related to cash-settled  transactions. The carrying amount of the liability relating to the cash-settled awards at 31 March 2012 is 1 million  (2011:1million).

Options were exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant date at a price equal to the average middle  market quoted price of the Companys shares over the five dealing days which preceded the date of grant. Options were  satisfied by the issue of new shares or, in the case of awards granted as share appreciation rights, in cash. Vesting requirements Performance requirements:  Earnings per share (EPS) performance of RPI +12% over a three-year period to be applied each year until the earlier of when  thecondition is met, or the measurement period, the last financial year of which is the year preceding that in which the option  will lapse.  No performance conditions attached to the option granted to the former Chief Executive Mr Henriksson under a separate  arrangement on 1 June 2004. Service requirements:  Options would be forfeited if the participant left employment, although options may have been exercisable for a certain period  oftime in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. Scheme use The Company can no longer make grants under this scheme as the plan expired in July 2008. Long-term incentives Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Grant details A long-term incentive plan under which awards were granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal)  cost. Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following  mechanisms: (a) a nominal or nil price option which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal or nil payment (unless the Company  determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a notional number of shares).  Awards are normally subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention  period. For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years; for awards made on or after 22 July 2005,  50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements were released at the end of the performance period  with the other 50% being deferred for one year. Vesting requirements Performance requirements: Total Shareholder Return (TSR)  test TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (with no retesting opportunities).  TSR must rank at the median position (when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR) in order for 25% of the shares  subject to the award to be available (subject to the retention period), rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position was  achieved. Between these positions, the number of shares would be calculated on a straight-line basis. If at least median position  was not achieved the whole award would lapse. The peer groups selected for the relevant awards were as follows:  	 awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant; and 	 awards granted on or after 22 July 2005: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger,  Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa.  140  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 Share-based payment plans continued Overall performance test The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that: (a) for awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 there had been a sustained  delivery over the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and  reduction in Group indebtedness; (b) for awards granted on or after 22 July 2005 that two underpins had been met: (1)  achievement of stretching internal free cash flow targets; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items; and (c) for  awards granted on or after 1 June 2006 that two underpin tests had been met: (1) successful completion of the 2006 Refinancing  and, in addition, a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group; and (2) efficient management  of legacy liability items. Service requirements:  Awards would be forfeited if the participant left employment, although shares may have been released subject to the  satisfaction of the performance conditions in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. Scheme use Awards are no longer granted under this scheme since its expiry in July 2008. Long-term incentive awards are now granted  under the Invensys 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan. Invensys 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP) Grant details A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) cost.  Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following  mechanisms: (a) a nominal or nil price option which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal or nil payment (unless the Company  determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a nominal number of shares).  Awards are normally subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on the start of the financial year in which the date  of award falls. There is no retention period. Vesting requirements Performance requirements: Awards are subject to two independent performance conditions. For executive directors: (a) 50% of an award is based on  growth in the Companys TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index;  and (b) 50% of an award is based on the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the Groups Earnings Per Share. For all other  participants (a) 35% of an award is based on growth in the Companys TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard  & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 35% of an award is based on the CAGR in the Groups Earnings Per Share.  There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 30% of an award. The Remuneration Committee retains  discretion to ensure that, as a condition for the vesting of any TSR/EPS shares, the underlying overall performance of the Group  has been satisfactory. Factors that will be taken into account will include consistency of earnings and the Groups cash position  over the performance period. Service requirements:  If a participant is dismissed for cause before shares are released, the award will be forfeited. If a participant resigns, their award  will lapse unless the Remuneration Committee exercise their discretion. If a participants employment ceases for good leaver  reasons or any other reason determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, the financial performance tests will  be measured at the normal vesting date and, subject to the outcome of the financial performance tests, the award will be  pro-rated based on the period of service and released on the normal vesting date. Scheme use The 2007 LTIP is used as the Groups main share-based long-term incentive plan under which share awards are granted.  Thefirstgrants under this plan were made in the year ended 31 March 2008. 2007 CEO Special Award (Special Award) Grant details Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award was a one-off conditional share award  granted to the former Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007/08 base salary. The Special Award was subject to a three-year  performance period ending on 31 March 2010 followed by a holding period as detailed below. Vesting requirements Performance requirements: The performance measures applying to the Special Award reflected those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being  more demanding. The Special Award was split into two layers, each of which vested on a different basis. For the first layer equal  to 200% of base salary, 20% would vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance. For the second layer  equal to 500% of base salary, there would be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% would vest for maximum  performance. Vesting in each layer was to be on a straight-line basis between these points. For each layer of the Special Award 50% would vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP. However,  for the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting would require more stretching performance equivalent to upper  quintile. This was calculated by the advisers to the Remuneration Committee as outperformance of the mean of the Standard  &Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 (i.e. 40%). In addition, the Remuneration Committee  retained discretion to ensure that as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of the Group had  been satisfactory. In the case of the TSR performance target factors that would be taken into account included EPS growth and  the Companys cash position.  Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 141 Result of performance requirements for CEO Special Award With regard to the TSR test, the Remuneration Committee determined that 93.0% of the first layer of shares and 91.3%  ofthesecond layer of shares were available to vest. Of this total, 50% were released as soon as practicable following the  announcement of the full-year results for 2009/10 and the balance was released following a 12-month period from the  firstrelease at 25 May 2010, on 26 May 2011. With regard to the EPS part of the award (50%), after considering the 2009/10 audited financial results, the Remuneration  Committee determined that the threshold level of EPS CAGR required for vesting was not achieved and the shares subject  totheEPS performance condition, as a result, lapsed. Service requirements: The general rule is that the award would be forfeited if the participant left employment, although shares may be released in  defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. The holder left the Company on 24 March 2011  and the Remuneration Committee permitted retention of the entitlement to the remaining shares under the Special Award, that  have now been released. Scheme use The Special Award was a one-off grant at no cost made during the year ended 31 March 2008. Invensys Restricted Share Plan (RSP) Grant details A restricted share plan whereby awards, to be satisfied by the transfer of existing issued shares or in cash, are granted to certain  senior employees at no cost. The vesting period for awards is determined separately for each award. Vesting periods normally  fall between one and three years. Vesting requirements Performance requirements:  Awards are not subject to specific performance conditions apart from continued employment throughout the vesting period  and satisfactory personal performance. Service requirements: Release of shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date, although shares may be released early,  onapro-rata basis, in defined good leaver cases or for any other reason at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Scheme use The plan is operated predominantly for senior executives in special circumstances, such as recruitment and retention situations. Deferred Share Plan (DSP) Grant details The DSP was introduced in 2007/08 to replace the Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan (TBOP). Any bonus earned under the  Executive Bonus Plan (EBP) for 2007/08 in excess of target performance was paid in deferred shares, with any bonus earned  upto the target performance being paid in cash. The shares would be released to the individual after three years in the case  ofexecutive directors and two years for all other participants.  All awards are satisfied by the transfer of existing issued shares. Vesting requirements Performance requirements:  The amount of shares granted is set by reference to the performance targets specified for the relevant executives in the EBP. Service requirements: Save where a participant is dismissed for cause before the relevant release date, shares under award will be released to  participants on the release date, unless the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion should decide on a different  release date. Scheme use The first grant under the DSP was made on 24 July 2008 and was used for all participants in the EBP who earned bonuses in  excess of target. For 2008/09 onwards, where applicable, bonus in excess of target performance will only be paid in deferred  shares to executive directors and members of the Group Leadership Team. Bonus payments for all other members of the EBP  are paid entirely in cash.  142  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 Share-based payment plans continued All employee schemes Invensys Savings Related Share Option Scheme Grant details The Scheme which operates in the UK, is based on a savings plan and is offered to eligible full and part-time employees.  Options may be granted at up to a 20% discount to the market price of the Companys shares immediately preceding the date  ofinvitation. The vesting period for the options is three years.  Vesting requirements Performance requirements:  The Scheme operates in the UK within specific tax legislation and is therefore not subject to performance conditions.

The average effective borrowing rate for the year ended 31 March 2012 was 4% (2011: 4%). The fair  value of the Groups finance lease obligations approximates to their carrying amount. The Groups finance lease liabilities are secured against the assets to which they relate. Contingent liabilities Group companies have given performance guarantees to certain subsidiaries (and certain former subsidiaries prior to disposal)  in the normal course of business. Counter-indemnities have been received from purchasers in the case of guarantees given in  favour of former subsidiaries. At the balance sheet date, the directors are not aware of any circumstances that may give rise to  aliability to the Group under these performance guarantees. No member of the Group is engaged in nor (so far as the directors are aware) has pending, or is threatened by, or has against it  any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group, other than those  already disclosed. The Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank guarantees issued under uncommitted local facilities of 227 million as  at 31 March 2012 (2011: 219 million) which are outlined in Note 21. 31 Reconciliation of cash flows 2012  m  2011 m Net cash flows from operating activities   27   139  Capital expenditure included within investing activities   (51)  (61) Interest paid   10   6  Taxation paid (operating)   34   30  Restructuring  27   25  Other operating exceptional item: costs to settle legal case  10   —    Facility fees paid   5  — Legacy items:  — Pension contributions   80  62 — Other legacy payments  17  12    97   74  Operating cash flow  159   213  Restructuring (27)  (25) Net finance costs paid  (7)  (1) Facility fees paid   (5)  —    Taxation paid (operating)   (34)  (30) Legacy items  (97)  (74) Free cash flow   (11)  83  Operating cash flow attributable to: Continuing operations   159   213  The directors use two KPI measures of the Groups cash performance, operating cash flow and free cash flow.

Year ended 31 March 2011 On 21 April 2010, Invensys acquired 100% of the share capital of Skelta Software Private Limited (Skelta), a privately held  software company headquartered in Bangalore, India, for cash consideration of 6.4 million. Skelta provides business process  management and advanced workflow software solutions. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of  accounting and the Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2011 include the results of Skelta from its date of  acquisition to 31 March 2011, with goodwill arising on the acquisition of 3 million. The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Skelta at the date of acquisition was: Fair value recognised on acquisition m Property, plant and equipment  0.2  Intangible assets — other1  2.9  Trade and other receivables  1.3  Cash and cash equivalents  0.6  Total assets  5.0  Trade and other payables  (0.1) Amounts due to contract customers (0.4) Current tax payable and deferred income tax liability (1.1) Total liabilities (1.6) Total identifiable net assets at fair value 3.4  Goodwill arising on acquisition  3.0  Total purchase consideration transferred 6.4  Total purchase consideration transferred comprises: — cash payment  6.4  6.4  Analysis of cash flows on acquisition: — cash paid (included in cash flows from investing activities) (6.4) — net cash acquired with the subsidiary (included in cash flows from investing activities) 0.6  — transaction costs of the acquisition (included in cash flows from operating activities) (0.3) Net cash outflow  (6.1) 1 The intangible assets acquired relate to capitalised development costs.                 146  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 32 Analysis of business combinations and business disposals continued Trade and other receivables includes trade receivables of 0.7 million. The gross contractual amount of trade receivables is  1.2million. 0.5 million of the trade receivables have been impaired, 0.2 million has been collected and it is expected that  0.5million of the remaining contractual amount can be collected. The goodwill shown above is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits arising from combining the assets and  activities of Skelta with those of the Group. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Costs relating to the acquisition of Skelta of 0.3 million were expensed in the year ended 31 March 2011 and are included in  exceptional items in the income statement. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, costs of up to 2.0 million will become payable to the former owners of Skelta  dependent on the achievement of certain agreed performance targets subsequent to the acquisition of Skelta by the Group. From its acquisition date of 21 April 2010 to 31 March 2011, Skelta contributed a profit of 0.1 million to the net profit before tax  of the Group and revenue of 2.2 million. These amounts are included in the Group Financial Statements for the year ended  31March 2011. Had Skelta been part of the Group for the whole of the year ended 31 March 2011, the profit and revenue of  theGroup for the year would not have been materially different from the amounts shown in the Group Financial Statements. (ii) Business disposals No operations have been discontinued in the years ended 31 March 2012 or 31 March 2011. In the year ended 31 March 2011,  the Group disposed of net assets of 4 million relating to a small European business in Invensys Controls. The sale completed  on31 December 2010 for cash consideration of 5 million. The net assets sold comprised property, plant and equipment of  4million, working capital of 1 million and pension liabilities of 1 million. The gain on disposal of 1 million is included within  exceptional items in the income statement. The assets and liabilities had not been treated as held for sale and prior to their  disposal, were included in the Invensys Controls operating segment. Additional costs have also been incurred in both years,  inrelation to prior year disposals. 2012  m  2011 m Net cash flow arising on disposal: — cash consideration  —   5  — cash costs of disposal  (7)  (9) (7)  (4) 33 Directors loan During the year ended 31 March 2011, a loan was made to Mr Henriksson while he was a director of the Company in view of the  double taxation suffered in relation to his US employment duties in 2009/10.  Mr Henriksson left the Company on 24 March 2011.   Invensys Systems Inc. advanced 312,691 on 29 June 2010 to Mr Henriksson, being an amount equal to the expected refunds  due from HMRC. As at 31 March 2012 this loan remains outstanding, is free of any interest, and will be repayable within five  business days from the date of HMRC making the expected refund to Mr Henriksson. Mr Henrikssons repayment obligations  arenot affected by the termination of his employment with the company.  No further loan has been advanced to any director during the year ended 31 March 2012.

To the fullest  extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility  to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members  as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we  have formed. Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors  Responsibilities set out on page 78, the directors are responsible  for the preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements  and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

The policies are consistent with the previous year except for the adoption of the following amended standards and new Urgent  Issues Task Force (UITF) abstract:  	 Improvements to Financial Reporting Standards 2010  	 UITF 47 (IFRIC 19), Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments  The adoption of these annual improvements and the new UITF abstract has not had any material effect on the Financial  Statements of the Company.  Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities  denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account for the year. Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits  For defined benefit plans, the service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to  operating profit or loss in the year. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit schemes is determined separately  for each scheme using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in  respect of past service that vests immediately is also charged to operating profit or loss in the year. The net surplus or deficit on  defined benefit pension schemes is reported on the balance sheet within the pension asset or liability.  For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the  contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are  shown either as accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.  Investments in subsidiary undertakings  Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less provisions for impairment where a permanent diminution in value  has been identified.  Borrowing costs  Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.  Debt instruments  Borrowings are stated at net proceeds received after deduction of issue costs. The issue costs of debt instruments are  amortised over the life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.  Taxation  Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet  date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less  tax, in the future. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods  different to those in which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable  taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred income tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which  timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Share-based payment  The Company operates various equity-settled and cash-settled share schemes. For equity-settled share options, the services  received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options. The fair value is calculated at grant  date using a valuation model and recognised in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in  shareholders equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will  eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.  Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to the share price of the Company.      Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 153 For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is calculated based on the share price at the grant date and, where  applicable, any market vesting conditions, and expensed over the vesting period based on the number of shares expected to  vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a  market or non-vesting condition; which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition  is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied. The financial effect of share options and awards over its equity shares granted to employees of subsidiary undertakings are  recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements. In particular, the Company records an increase in its  investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the FRS 20 cost in subsidiary undertakings. Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the  terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any  modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the  employee as measured at the date of modification. Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet  recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of  either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as  a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of  the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated  equally.  For cash-settled share awards, the services received from employees are measured at the fair value of the liability and  recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value of the liability is  remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the profit and loss  account.  In accordance with the transitional arrangements in FRS 20 (IFRS 2), Share-based Payment, the requirements of FRS 20 have not  been applied to equity instruments granted on or before 7 November 2002 and those vesting before 1 January 2005. Treasury shares  Own equity instruments which are re-acquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit  or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments. Treasury shares are purchased and  held by the Employee Share Trust to meet future distributions of shares to employees under the Groups various share option  and share award schemes.  Dividend income   Revenue is recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.  2 Profit attributable to the Parent Company The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Parent Company, Invensys plc, is 95 million (2011: 96 million). In accordance with  the exemption granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has  not been presented. 3 Fees for audit and other services Fees paid to the Companys auditor for the audit of the Financial Statements were 0.1 million (2011: 0.1 million).  Fees paid to the Companys auditor for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the Company Financial  Statements of Invensys plc because the Group Financial Statements are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.  154  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 4 Investments in subsidiary undertakings  m  Cost    At 1 April 2011   3,061  Cost of share-based payments in respect of employees of subsidiary undertakings 4 At 31 March 2012   3,065  Amounts provided At 1 April 2011   (3) At 31 March 2012   (3) Net book value  At 1 April 2011   3,058  At 31 March 2012   3,062  Principal subsidiary undertakings at 31 March 2012 are disclosed on page 169.

The last full valuation of the scheme on a FRS 17 (IAS 19)  basis has been updated to 31 March 2012, to reflect market conditions and material events in the plan. The Company also participates in the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK), which is the principal Group scheme covering the majority  of UK employees. The Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) is a funded defined benefit scheme. However, the Company is unable to  separately identify on a consistent and reasonable basis its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Groups defined  benefit scheme to which it participates, mainly because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate information for disposed  companies and the subjective nature of any allocation basis. Therefore the Company accounts for this scheme as a defined  contribution scheme, in accordance with the provisions of FRS 17. The scheme is currently in deficit on an IAS 19 basis using the  projected credit actuarial valuation method to determine the schemes liabilities. Details of the scheme, its deficit and its  principle sensitivities are included in Note 25 to the Group Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting and  disclosure requirements of IAS 19, which are generally equivalent to those of FRS 17. Pension costs in respect of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) represented contributions payable in the year and amounted  tonil (2011: nil). At 31 March 2012, the outstanding contributions included in creditors were nil (2011: nil). (ii) Unfunded defined benefit scheme The major assumptions relating to the unfunded scheme are: 2012   m  2011   m  Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries   4.75   4.95  Rate of increase to pensions in payment1   3.60   3.80  Discount rate for scheme liabilities   4.70   5.30  Inflation rate2  3.50   3.70  1 The rate of increase for UK deferred pensions was 3.50% (2011: 3.70%). 2 The inflation rate is based on RPI. An additional inflation rate assumption for CPI of 2.50% is used to reflect the UK Governments change of the inflation measure used to  determine minimum pension increases. Standard SAPS actuarial mortality tables S1PA were adopted. Based on Scheme experience, the probability of death at each  age was multiplied by 103% for males and 113% for females. Future improvements in life expectancy have been allowed for in  line with the standard CMI model projections subject to a long term trend of 1.00% for males and 1.00% for females.  The changes in the present value of the unfunded scheme liabilities are analysed below: 2012   m  2011   m  Present value of scheme liabilities at beginning of year   27   26  Current service cost1  — —  Contributions  (1)  (1) Other finance charges2   3   2  Actuarial loss  2  —  Present value of scheme liabilities at end of year   31   27  1 Charged to operating profit (less than 0.5 million). 2 Charged to profit before tax.

Contributions — rates for future years Regarding rates of contributions for future years, in respect of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK), contributions to the Scheme  willbemade at the rate of 19.8% of pensionable salaries up to the date of the next triennial valuation. Details of the annual  supplemental contributions to be made to the Scheme are set out in Note 25(x) to the Group Financial Statements.

Options were satisfied by the  issue of new shares or, in the case of awards granted as share appreciation rights, in cash. Vesting requirements Performance requirements:  Earnings per share (EPS) performance of RPI +12% over a three-year period to be applied each year until the earlier of when  thecondition is met, or the measurement period, the last financial year of which is the year preceding that, in which the option  would lapse. No performance conditions attached to the option granted to the former Chief Executive Mr Ulf Henriksson under aseparate  arrangement on 1 June 2004. Service requirements:  Options would be forfeited if the participant left employment, although options may have been exercisable for a certain period  oftime in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. Scheme use The Company can no longer make grants under this scheme as the plan expired in July 2008.  162  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 13 Share-based payment plans continued Long-term incentives Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Grant details A long-term incentive plan under which awards were granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal)  cost. Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following  mechanisms: (a) a nominal or nil price option which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal or nil payment (unless the Company  determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a notional number of shares).  Awards are normally subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention  period. For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years; for awards made on or after 22 July 2005,  50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements were released at the end of the performance period  with the other 50% being deferred for one year. Vesting requirements Performance requirements: Total Shareholder Return (TSR) test TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (with no retesting opportunities).  TSR must rank at the median position (when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR) in order for 25% of the shares  subject to the award to be available (subject to the retention period), rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is  achieved. Between these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis. If at least median position is  not achieved the whole award will lapse. The peer groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows:  		awards	granted	prior	to	22	July	2005:	the	companies	that	comprised	the	FTSE	Mid	250	Index	on	the	date	of	grant;	and 	 awards granted on or after 22 July 2005: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger,  Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa. Overall performance test The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that: (a) for awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 there has been a sustained  delivery over the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and  reduction in Group indebtedness; (b) for awards granted on or after 22 July 2005 that two underpins have been met: (1)  achievement of stretching internal free cash flow targets; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items; and (c) for  awards granted on or after 1 June 2006 that two underpin tests have been met: (1) successful completion of the 2006  Refinancing and, in addition, that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the  Group; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items. Service requirements:  Awards would be forfeited if the participant left employment, although shares may have been released subject to the  satisfaction of the performance conditions in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. Scheme use Awards are no longer granted under this scheme since its expiry in July 2008. Long-term incentive awards are now granted  under the Invensys 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan. Invensys 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP) Grant details A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) cost.  Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following  mechanisms: (a) a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment (unless the Company  determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a nominal number of shares).  Awards are normally subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on the start of the financial year in which the date  of award falls.  Vesting requirements Performance requirements: Awards are subject to two independent performance conditions. For executive directors: (a) 50% of an award is based on  growth in the Companys TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index;  and (b) 50% of an award is based on the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the Groups Earnings Per Share. For all other  participants: (a) 35% of an award is based on growth in the Companys TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard  & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 35% of an award is based on the CAGR in the Groups Earnings Per Share.  There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 30% of an award. The Remuneration Committee retains  discretion to ensure that, as a condition for the vesting of any TSR/EPS shares, the underlying overall performance of the  Company has been satisfactory. Factors that will be taken into account will include consistency of earnings and the Groups cash  position over the performance period.  Group Financial Statements Overview Business Review Governance Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012  www.invensys.com 163 Service requirements:  If a participant is dismissed for cause before shares are released, the award will be forfeited. If a participant resigns their award  will lapse unless the Remuneration Committee exercise their discretion. If a participants employment ceases for defined good  leaver reasons or any other reason determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee the financial performance tests  will be measured at the normal vesting date and, subject to the outcome of the financial performance tests, the award will be  pro-rated based on the period of service and released on the normal vesting date.  Scheme use The 2007 LTIP is used as the Groups main share-based long-term incentive plan under which share awards are granted. The first  grants under this plan were made in the year ended 31 March 2008. 2007 CEO Special Award (Special Award) Grant details Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted  to the Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007/08 base salary. The Special Award was subject to a three-year performance  period ending on 31 March 2010 followed by a holding period as detailed below. Vesting requirements Performance requirements: The performance measures applying to the Special Award reflected those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being  more demanding. The Special Award was split into two layers, each of which vested on a different basis. For the first layer equal  to 200% of base salary, 20% would vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance. For the second layer  equal to 500% of base salary, there would be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% would vest for maximum  performance. Vesting in each layer was to be on a straight-line basis between these points. For each layer of the Special Award 50% would vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP. However,  for the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting would require more stretching performance equivalent to upper  quintile. This was calculated by the advisers to the Remuneration Committee as outperformance of the mean of the Standard &  Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 (i.e. 40%). In addition, the Remuneration Committee  retained discretion to ensure that as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of the Company  had been satisfactory. In the case of the TSR performance target factors that would be taken into account included EPS growth  and the Companys cash position. Result of performance requirements for CEO Special Award With regard to the TSR test, the Remuneration Committee determined that 93.0% of the first layer of shares and 91.3%  ofthesecond layer of shares were available to vest. Of this total, 50% were released as soon as practicable following the  announcement of the full-year results for 2009/10 and the balance was released following a 12-month period from the first  release at 25 May 2010, on 26 May 2011. With regard to the EPS part of the award (50%), after considering the 2009/10 audited financial results, the Remuneration  Committee determined that the threshold level of EPS CAGR required for vesting was not achieved and the shares subject to  the EPS performance condition, as a result, lapsed. Service requirements: The general rule is that the award would be forfeited if the participant left employment, although shares may be released in  defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. The holder left the Company on 24 March 2011  and the Remuneration Committee permitted retention of the entitlement to the remaining shares under the Special Award, that  have now been released. Scheme use The Special Award is a one-off grant at no cost made during the year ended 31 March 2008. Invensys Restricted Share Plan (RSP) Grant details A restricted share plan whereby awards, to be satisfied by the transfer of existing issued shares or in cash, are granted to certain  senior employees at no cost. The vesting period for awards is determined separately for each award. Vesting periods normally  fall between one and three years. Vesting requirements Performance requirements: Awards are not subject to specific performance conditions apart from continued employment throughout the vesting period  and satisfactory personal performance. Service requirements: Release of shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date, although shares may be released early, on  a pro-rated basis, in defined good leaver cases or for any other reason at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Scheme use The plan is operated predominantly for senior executives in special circumstances, such as recruitment and retention situations.  164  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 13 Share-based payment plans continued Deferred Share Plan (DSP) Grant details The DSP was introduced in 2007/08 to replace the TBOP. Any bonus earned under the Executive Bonus Plan (EBP) for 2007/08 in  excess of target performance was paid in deferred shares, with any bonus earned up to the target performance being paid in  cash. The shares would be released to the individual after three years in the case of executive directors and two years for all  other participants. For 2008/09 onwards, the DSP is only used for executive directors and members of the Group Leadership  Team; in all other respects the same terms apply as outlined in the previous paragraph. All awards are satisfied by shares  purchased in the market. Vesting requirements Performance requirements: The amount of shares granted is set by reference to the performance targets specified for the relevant executives in the EBP. Service requirements: Save where a participant is dismissed for cause before the relevant release date, shares under award will be released to  participants on the release date, unless the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion should decide on a different  release date. Scheme use The first grant under the DSP was made on 24 July 2008 and was used for all participants in the EBP who earned bonuses in  excess of target. For 2008/09 onwards, where applicable, bonus in excess of target performance is only paid in deferred shares  to executive directors and members of the Group Leadership Team. Bonus payments for all other members of the EBP are paid  entirely in cash. 14 Deferred income tax assets Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it is  probable that profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised. A deferred income tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of 31 million with a tax value of 7 million  (2011: 28 million with a tax value of 7 million) in respect of pension obligations. The Company has unrecognised income tax losses of 51 million with a tax value of 12 million (2011: 51 million with a tax value  of 13 million) available for offset against future profits. The Company has unrecognised capital losses of 50 million (2011: 50 million) that are only available for offset against future  capital gains. These capital losses may be carried forward indefinitely. The standard rate of UK corporation tax has reduced to 24% from 1 April 2012 and is expected to continue to fall by 1% each  year to 22% in 2014. The impact of the rate change to 22% would reduce the total unrecognised deferred income tax assets   by 3 million.

ShareGift Shareholders with small holdings of shares who do not wish to sell  such shares because the sales commission applied would be  disproportionate to the sale price may consider donating them to  charity. The Orr Mackintosh Foundation operates a charity share  donation scheme, ShareGift. ShareGift can be contacted at 17 Carlton House Terrace, London  SW1Y 5AH or by telephone on +44 (0)20 7930 3737 or online at  www.sharegift.org Dividend Subject to shareholder approval, the directors recommend a  2011/12 final dividend of 2.75 pence per share (2011: 2.5 pence per  share). The total dividends for the year ended 31 March 2012 are  4.4 pence per share (2011: 4.0 pence per share). The Company decided to introduce a dividend reinvestment plan  (DRIP) in 2011, which enables shareholders to reinvest their  dividends directly into Invensys shares. For further information on  the DRIP please contact Equiniti. The Company will issue a  consolidated tax voucher to those shareholders who receive  dividends direct to their bank accounts. This will be issued in  December of each year when the interim dividend (if any) is  normally paid, unless shareholders advise the registrars in writing  that they wish to receive a separate tax voucher with each dividend  payment. Institutions and other companies that hold shares in the  Company will continue to receive a tax voucher for each dividend  payment. As dividends are currently only paid in sterling, for overseas  shareholders with small shareholdings it may not be economically  viable for them to convert sterling payments into their local  currency. Shareholders can, should they so wish, arrange for their  dividends to be paid to a charity in the UK. ShareGift is a UK  registered charity which takes unwanted shares and donations and  uses the proceeds to make donations to a wide range of other UK  registered charities. In order to donate outstanding dividend payments to charity,  shareholders need to send a signed letter of authority to Equiniti  asking them to make all outstanding payments payable to  ShareGift or another charity. If not ShareGift, the charitys full name  and address needs to be included. For future dividends, if shareholders wish for these to be paid  direct to ShareGift, this needs to be clearly stated in their letter of  authority. For all other charities, shareholders will need to include  the charitys bank account details to enable the payments to be  made by Equiniti via BACS.

Tips on protecting your shareholding: 	 Ensure all your certificates are kept in a safe place or hold your  shares electronically in CREST via a nominee. 	 Keep all correspondence from the registrars which shows your  shareholder reference number in a safe place, or destroy  correspondence by shredding. 	 If you change address, inform the registrars. If you receive a  letter from the registrars regarding a change of address and  have not recently moved, please contact them immediately.  Youmay be the victim of identity theft. 	 If you are buying or selling shares, only deal with brokers  registered in your country of residence or the UK.

Forward-looking statements are by their nature  subject to uncertainties and external factors that may affect the  actual outcomes compared with those anticipated. Unsolicited mail The Company is legally obliged to make its share register available  to the general public. Consequently, some shareholders may  receive unsolicited mail, including correspondence from  unauthorised investment firms. If you wish to limit the amount of  unsolicited mail you receive please contact:  The Mailing Preference Service, DMA House, 70 Margaret Street,  London W1W 8SS  Tel: 0845 703 4599 or online at www.mpsonline.org.uk Registered office Invensys plc, 3rd Floor, 40 Grosvenor Place, London SW1X 7AW Tel: +44 (0)20 3155 1200 Fax: +44 (0)20 3155 1201 Registered in England & Wales number 166023 For the latest investor information and news, visit our website at  www.invensys.com Warning to shareholders In recent years, many companies have become aware that their  shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or  correspondence concerning investment matters which imply a  connection to the company concerned. These are typically from  overseas-based brokers who target UK shareholders, offering to  sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares in  US or UK investments. They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive, and a  2006survey by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) reported  thatthe average amount lost by investors is around 20,000.   It is not just the novice investor who has been duped in this way:  manyof the victims had been successfully investing for several  years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited  advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports  about the Company. If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: 	 Make sure you get the correct name of the person and  organisation and make a record of any other information they  give you (e.g. telephone number, address, etc.). 	 Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before  getting involved. You can check at   www.fsa.gov.uk/register/home.do 	 The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised  overseas firms who are targeting or have targeted UK investors,  and any approach from such organisations should be reported  to the FSA, so that this list can be kept up-to-date and any other  appropriate action can be considered. 	 If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible  to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation  Scheme. The FSA can be contacted on 0845 606 1234 or by  completing an online form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/ regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml 	 Inform the Companys registrars on 0871 384 2036.
