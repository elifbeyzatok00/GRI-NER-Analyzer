We are always looking for ways to become more efficient in  managing and communicating our performance in terms of sustainability. For our fourth  sustainability report, we were determined to take our sense of corporate sustainability to  new highs. In order to improve our reporting of sustainability issues for the past year, we  have added five new features.   Themes   In the past, our reports were divided into four sections: Sustainability Management, Econ- omy, Environment, and Society. In order to make the report more reader-friendly and give it  greater emotional depth, we renamed the sections Sustainable Steel, Constructing a New  World, Creating a Greener World and Instilling Hope.  Q&A Section   To more effectively address questions from stakeholders, we have included a Q&A section  which puts the companys activities and performance into perspective.   Steel in Life   Although steel is a commonly used resource, stakeholders may find it difficult to understand  the mechanisms and processes involved in its creation. As a result, we have earmarked a  separate section called Steel in Life (Pages 8-11) to show show the extent to which steel has  been incorporated into peoples daily lives.   Communication with Stakeholders   For this years report, we strengthened our stakeholder survey mechanism to more closely  reflect the opinions of our stakeholders. In the beginning of each section, we have earmarked  Stakeholder Communication pages which include the results of surveys containing stake- holder feedback on our performance in each area.   A More Reader-friendly Report    In response to stakeholder opinion regarding the reporting structure of our reports, we have  improved the reader-friendliness of this publication by using more illustrations and an im- proved design layout.  |  Reporting Standards  | GRI G3 Guidelines, BEST Guidelines, UNGC principles |  Report Structure  | Sustainability Management, Economy, Environment, Society |  Reporting Period & Cycle  | January to December 2010, annual publication (Information on activities and achievements of significance to stakeholders or having an impact  on our business is included up to the end of May 2010.) |  Reporting Scope  | Headquarters, Incheon Works, Pohang Works, Dangjin Works |  Third Party Assurance  | Independent assurance carried out by the Institute for Industrial Policy Studies (IPS) |  Contact Information  | Tel: +82.2.3464.6187/Fax: +82.2.3464.6210 CSR Team, Strategy & Planning Office, Hyundai Steel  231, Yangjae-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 137-938, Korea  Scan the QR code with your  smartphone and youll be  taken directly to our mobile  website, where you can  download a PDF version of  our sustainability report. ONE STEP FOR TOMORROW HYUNDAI STEEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 ONE STEP FOR TOMORROW    HYUNDAI STEEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  As we continue to discover the sustainable value  of steel, we will never stop caring about the  sustainable growth of humanity.  Hyundai Steel takes pride in growing along with its  stakeholders, while striving for a better future for  humanity.   Aiming for a greener low-carbon economy has become the norm in the global  community, and nations around the world have risen to this challenge. In line with this new green economy, Hyundai Steel is always seeking new  opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases, while also building upon our carbon  credit schemes and renewable energy businesses. Protecting the environment remains at the top of our list of priorities in all of our  business activities, which is part of the reason we have recently completed work on  our eco-friendly steel mills. With state-of-the-art environmental technologies and facilities, Hyundai Steel will  continue to lead the way in Koreas low-carbon green growth initiatives.

Leading the global economy with cutting-edge  products and advanced technologies, we will harness  the potential of steel as a sustainable resource. We will continue to grow as a leader in the global  steel industry, while creating value for our  stakeholders. Hyundai Steel is walking towards  bringing about a more sustainable  future for everyone.  Distinguished Stakeholders, I am pleased to report on our activities and achievements in sustainability  management over the past year in our fourth sustainability report. These re- ports have become a significant channel for continued and close communica- tion with our stakeholders. In 2010, the business world faced numerous challenges due to such adversity as  the continuing economic recession in the U.S. and a growing financial crisis in Eu- rope. Uncertainties abounded in the global economy, creating unfavorable condi- tions in business environments, which directly affected the global steel industry. CHAIRMANS  MESSAGE The Hyundai Motor Group  has set a new mid-term goal  for the upcoming 10 years,  Vision 2020: Together for a  better future. As we continue  to grow, we are improving our  sustainability management and  increasing stakeholder value  by adopting and developing the  concept of triple bottom line  reporting. In partnership with our stakeholders, we will  continue to grow as a sustainable company. Chairman Hyundai Motor Group  Mong-koo Chung Even in such trying circumstances, Hyundai Steel performed well, successfully  stabilizing and operating two new blast furnaces which increased our annual pro- duction capacity by eight million tons within one year. Such a notable achievement  over such a short period of time was unprecedented in the history of the global steel  industry. At the same time, Hyundai Steel continued to reinforce its competitiveness through  further development of its human resources, improvements in workplace safety,  strengthened win-win partnerships with business partners, and upgrades to the  quality control system for customer satisfaction.  Since its pledge to uphold sustainability management and the UN Global Compact  in 2008, we have worked hard to create a balance between our economic and social  values and expectations as a responsible corporate citizen. In 2010, Hyundai Steel  remained faithful to our social responsibilities. For instance, we took an active role  in addressing climate change in collaboration with major global steelmakers. Under Hyundai Steels new vision of Leading the new era of steel we have identi- fied five core values that will enable us to achieve this goal: Challenge (unwavering  passion and ingenious thinking), People (respect for talent), Customers (a custom- er-driven corporate culture), Collaboration (mutual communication and coopera- tion), and Globality (a global corporate citizen). Under Hyundai Motor Groups new vision, Vision 2020: Together for a better fu- ture, Hyundai Steel  will take further steps forward to become a globally competi- tive steelmaker, while adhering to the highest standards in environmental steward- ship. At this time, I would like to ask for your continued encouragement and support  for Hyundai Steel as we continue our sustainable growth well into the future. Thank you.

We will strive to create a better tomorrow for all  stakeholders by achieving sustainable growth. #01 Hyundai Steels Story Company Overview  Making a Better World R A I L W A Y  R A I L S Hyundai steel was the first Korean company to manufacture Railway Rail using its own technology in 1979. Since  then, we have been the only rail manufacturer in Korea and have continued to develop technologies in step with new  advances in high-speed rail and weight factors. One result of such efforts has been our production and supply of  UIC60 rails for the KTX, Koreas high-speed railway, since 1998. In 2008, we became the second company to develop  rails for magnetic levitation trains. The Strongest of the Strong W I D E  F L A N G E  B E A M S  &  R E I N F O R C I N G  B A R S Hyundai Steels H-beams, H-bearing piles, and checkered H-beams have earned an excellent reputation with our  domestic and global customers due to their high quality. Hyundai Steel produces several products using advanced  technologies under strict quality control, including slim beam-HR asymmetric H-beams, the first Korean company  and second in the world to do so, ultra-thick large H-beams (458X417, 900X300 series), of which we are the only  supplier in Korea, high-strength H-beams, paint-free weather-proof H-beams, and hot-rolled H-beams for build- ing structures. Due to the lower standard deviation for each of these type of beams, all are highly competitive in the  global market. In addition, we produce reinforced bars,  from D10mm to D57mm, which are suitable for a variety of  applications, including reinforced concrete structures, nuclear power plant construction, and construction projects.  Developed in 2001, our super bar has a yield strength that is 25% stronger than standard bars, which allows for bet- ter use of space, is stronger in the construction of high-rise buildings, and reduces construction costs. Sailing into the Deep Blue Ocean S T E E L  P L A T E Steel Plate consist of sheets of thick flat steel of more than 6mm in thickness. Such plates are mainly used on outside  decks, as double-flooring, and bulkheads for hulls. These heavy plates must be strong enough to withstand changes  in loads, and rolling and pitching in rough seas. Recently, shipbuilding standards have changed in terms of how  plates are joined, from rivets to welding, as market demand for larger size vessels has grown. As such, regulations  and standards governing the production of heavy plates have become more stringent, requiring certification by the  Korean Register of Shipping. As a result, Hyundai Steel obtained certifications for various classifications of steel  plates from 10 major international registers of shipping in March and April of 2010 in preparation for the manufac- ture of heavy plates. W i d e  F l a n g e  B e a m s  &  R e i n f o r c i n g  B a r s R a i l w a y  r a i l s S t e e l  P l a t e HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 08. 09 SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT Steel in Life  Shining like Diamonds C O L D  R O L L E D  S T A I N L E S S  S T E E L  S H E E T S In general, steel products consist of iron (Fe) that has 0.02-2% carbon, also known as carbon steel. Steelmakers then  add alloys to create special types of steel, which are named according to their different usages.  The most well-known and popular type of steel is rust-free stainless steel. Created by adding chrome (Cr) and nickel  (Ni) to normal carbon steel, stainless steel was first invented in the early 20 th century. Stainless steel was a break- through for the steel industry, as it significantly improved the diversity and choice of products depending on usage,  resulting in a significant growth in sales. Most notably, durable and rust-free stainless steel tableware brought about  a revolution in the kitchen, replacing expensive silverware or heavy brassware that rusted easily. Due to its heat- resistant properties, stainless steel is also excellent for use in the exhaust systems of automobiles. Hyundai Steel has  manufactured stainless steel products since 1990. A Solid Bridge H I G H  P E R F O R M A N C E  S T E E L  F O R  B R I D G E S Under normal conditions, iron oxidizes or corrodes easily when it comes in contact with dioxides (O2) or water  (H2O). The red oxidized substance (Fe2O3) that results is called rust. The conventional means of preventing corro- sion was to paint the surface of the steel, but this was only a temporary stop-gap measure. Painting buildings and  construction materials was costly and the use of paint polluted the environment. Atmospheric Corrosion Resistant Steel Plate, however, are resistant to corrosion even without painting the surface.  When used in buildings, it decreases maintenance costs and reduces the impact on the environment. The resistance  to corrosion is reinforced by adding such alloys as copper (Cu), chrome (Cr) and nickel (Ni). These layers of alloy  help to stabilize rust from corrosion, insulating the surface of the steel from the effects of water and oxygen. H i g h  P e r f o r m a n c e  S t e e l  f o r  B r i d g e s A t m o s p h e r i c  C o r r o s i o n  R e s i s t a n t  S t e e l  P l a t e C o l d  R o l l e d  S t a i n l e s s  S t e e l  S h e e t s An Eco-Friendly Material A T M O S P H E R I C  C O R R O S I O N  R E S I S T A N T  S T E E L  P L A T E Heavy plates are universally used in the construction of steel bridges. In close proximity to rivers or the sea, mois- ture and salt make steel bridges vulnerable to rust. As a result, bridge materials must be able to withstand extreme  weather conditions such as heat between 20-30C and cold winter temperatures of below -30C.  Our HSB products, with significantly improved strength, tenacity, and weldability, include HSB500 and HSB600  steel plates, each boasting tensile strengths of 500MPa and 600MPa. Hyundai Steel initiated the manufacturing of HSB500 and HSB600 in April 2010 at its heavy plate mills. In less than  a year, we made our mark in the HSB market, gaining a 30% market share to emerge as a new and important player  in the HSB market. HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 10. 11 SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT  Q. What do you think of the companys performance in terms of sustainability management in 2010? I believe that Hyundai Steel remained steadfast to its commitment to sustainability management despite an unfa- vorable business environment in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. In 2010, we stayed connected to our  five core values and pushed forward with sustainability management practices. Q. Could you share with us Hyundai Steels most remarkable economic achievement in 2010? Hyundai Steel successfully commenced operations of two blast furnaces in 2010. As the new driver of growth  for the company, the combined annual output of these two units will be eight million tons. The addition of these  furnaces has also laid the groundwork for Hyundai Steel to become a steelmaker with an annual capacity of 20  million tons of steel, including an annual output of 12 million tons by the companys electric arc furnaces. With  the new integrated steel mills, flat steel has been added to our traditional long-steel product portfolio. Most  importantly, we successfully brought the blast furnaces on-stream, in line with our normal processes, and this  led to the generation of profits in the first quarter of 2010, contributing to overall sales of KRW 10 trillion and an  operating profit of KRW 1 trillion. Q. How does Hyundai Steel contribute to the competitiveness of its customers? We initiated the Hyundai Steel R&D Center in 2007 in order to develop our own technologies in integrated steel mills as well as next- generation source technologies. At the R&D center, a total of 400 competent researchers from affiliates of the Hyundai Motor Group  collaborate on developing products tailored to customer needs. We strongly believe that we can contribute to our customers competi- tiveness by developing technologies for high value-added products and the worlds best steel products. To that end, we work in close col- laboration with our client companies to improve product quality and develop new products suited to their needs. Q. Your management philosophy states a respect for humanity. What steps did you take to implement such a principle in 2010? As one of the pillars of our management philosophy, respect for humanity implies our dedication to sustainable growth based on mutu- al trust and understanding between our company and our employees. We aim to create a great workplace (GWP) through various fam- ily events and activities. In 2010, we established a SMART Board to facilitate open communication with employees. At the same time,  safety is our top priority in our workplaces, and to this end we installed safety booths at each of our steelworks to provide safety train- ing for employees. Furthermore, Hyundai Steel encourages suppliers to pledge their support of the companys Win-Win Cooperation  Agreement and Mutual Growth Agreement to strengthen relationships based on trust. We also assist our suppliers in offering various  training programs on information security and safety in the workplace, helping them to reinforce the competencies of their employees. Q. Hyundai Steel has three steelworks. With community engagement playing an important role in business management,  what are your community engagement programs? Hyundai Steel was selected as one of the 100 best performers in job creation for 2010 by the Ministry of Labor. We are well aware that  a company can only thrive when it is supported by local communities. As such, we remain vigilant to the needs of our communities  and offer support in various forms. As part of an initiative for industrial-academic cooperation, Hyundai Steel offers scholarships  and donates educational materials and equipment to schools in the vicinity of our workplaces. We also recruit graduates from these  communities, contributing to job creation at a local level. Committed to economic growth, locally and nationally, we take part in  campaigns to revive local traditional markets and have signed agreements of support to this end. Furthermore, we sponsor a number  of artistic and cultural activities in local communities. We also remain involved in the Home Repair for Hope project and operate the  Green Guardians, a project that is offered to one thousand elementary school students every year to help them understand the dangers  of climate change and global warming and encourage them to conserve energy. Our employees also volunteer to keep local communi- ties clean. Going forward, we will continue to develop close relationships with local communities through on-going communication.  Q. Hyundai Steel aspires to be the worlds leading eco-friendly steelmaker. What plans do you have in place to realize this vision? With Hyundai Steels completion of an integrated steel mill, the Hyundai Motor Group has also put in place a resource recycling value  chain, the first time this has been done in the steelmaking industry. At the beginning of the value chain, Hyundai Steel and Hyundai Hy- sco manufacture steel sheets for automobiles using natural resources such as iron ore. The steel sheets then move along the value chain  to car makers such as Hyundai Motor and Kia Motor. At the end of the product lifecycle, steel scrap is returned to Hyundai Steel, which  we recycle and then reuse in the production of long steel. This is then used in the construction of buildings. This unprecedented eco- friendly value chain for the recycling of resources was a key idea of management at the Hyundai Motor Group. Dedicated to creating a  cleaner and better environment, Hyundai Steel will continue to strive for a more sustainable society. Q. Today, companies are obliged to consider future generations in their business decisions. Hyundai Steel achieved  remarkable results in 2010, but what are your plans for improvements in the future? Under the vision of Leading the new era of steel, Hyundai Steel is seeking to become an eco-friendly, resource recycling steelmaker,  while striving to provide the best quality products and services in the industry. That is how we are working to build a better world for  our stakeholders. In addressing the worldwide environmental issue of global warming, Hyundai Steel aims to play a part in reducing  greenhouse gas emissions. As such, we have already implemented an environmental energy management system and completed a  greenhouse gas inventory, while cooperating with domestic and international climate change initiatives for reducing greenhouse gas  emissions. In the future, we will proactively deal with climate change issues through various cooperative networks on policies and tech- nologies. CEO  INTERVIEW Under the new vision of  Leading the new era of steel,  Hyundai Steel will build a  better world in cooperation  with its stakeholders by  offering advanced eco-friendly  products and services and the  recycling of resources. HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 12. 13 SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT Hyundai Steel Vice-chairman & CEO Seung-ha Park  SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT Hyundai Steel operates eco-friendly steelworks that use advanced steel technologies to bring about a diversified  product portfolio.

We have also developed nine detailed  action plans to support these three grand strategies. #02 Building Our Own Future Paradigm Shift Over the past 10 years, the global steel industry has achieved steady growth amid the ups and downs  of the global economy. However, a completely different landscape is forecast for the next decade due to  changes in the competition model and paradigm shifts in the industry. Based on an in-depth analysis and  preemptive countermeasures, Hyundai Steel will take advantage of opportunities arising from such risks,  laying the foundation for sustainable growth. HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 14. 15 The Process of Developing a New Vision Throughout history, companies that have survived have had one thing in common: they all remained stead- fast in their commitment to company philosophies and core values. In light of this, the Hyundai Motor Group  has redefined its management philosophy to ensure a continuation of the factors that have propelled us to  success in the past and to take great strides forward to achieve sustainable and sizeable growth.  Based on the management philosophy of the Group, Hyundai Steel has developed a new vision and ac- companying strategies with the aim of setting a framework for proactively responding to the changing  business environment and for creating mutual growth in conjunction with stakeholders.

Sustainability Management Awards Hyundai Steel is implementing sustainability management practices in all of our business activities. Since  2008, we have published annual sustainability reports on our Sustainability Management activities and  achievements, and have consistently gained  positive feedback from stakeholders on our Sustainability  Management performances. In September 2010, Hyundai Steel was listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability  Index (DJSI) Asia. Scoring above the industry average in all 17 criteria, we earned 70 points, 10 higher than  the 60 points of 2009. We were also awarded a Best Practice Prize at the 2010 Korea Sustainability Man- agement Awards, which was held by the Hankyoreh Economic Research Institute.  We were the first steel company in the world to adopt an enclosed raw material processing system at our  new integrated steel mill at Dangjin Works, reducing at the source the amount of fugitive dust. In recogni- tion of this achievement in dealing with a chronic environmental problem faced by the steel industry and  for our efforts at setting a new vision and installing a new system for the processing of raw materials for  steel, the Jeongjinki Media & Culture Foundation awarded Hyundai Steel the Grand Prize in the Science  & Technology category. The sponsors of the Jeongjinki Media & Culture Awards select individuals and  organizations whose original and creative scientific and technological achievements contribute to the  development of the Koreas economy and industry. We were also named one of the 100 best performers in  job creation by the Ministry of Labor for creating more than 4,000 new jobs through large investments in  the integrated steel mill and other facilities over a four-year period, from 2006 to 2010. CSR Committee At Hyundai Steel, sustainability management has its roots in the mutual trust and prosperity of our stake- holders. Since April 2008, when we adopted our Resolution for Implementing Corporate Social Respon- sibility, Hyundai Steel has implemented a management framework based on CSR principles, organized  a CSR Committee that is chaired by the CEO, and joined the UN Global Compact. The Committee devises  mid- to long-term CSR strategies in three areas, including trust-based management, environmental man- agement, and social contributions.  Hyundai Steel has developed Seven Ideals as guidelines for implementing CSR strategies.  2009  Hyundai Steel       Industry Average 2010 60 45 70 44 Economy Total 2009 2010 63 56 70 52 Environment  2009 2010 67 39 63 39 Society 2009 2010 54 44 73 44 |  DJSI Average Scores (Hyundai Steel vs. Industry Average)  | HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 18. 19 SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT |  The Seven Ideals  | A leader in  addressing climate  change A company that  grows alongside  stakeholders An eco-friendly  value chain A reliable  partner A transparent  company A trustworthy  company A company  people want to  work for Sustainability Management Environmental  Management Social  Contributions Trust-based  Management  SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT Adhering to principles is the first step towards establishing fair competition practices. At Hyundai Steel, we  work to establish sound and transparent corporate governance and make management information available  to stakeholders through various avenues of communication. We have also implemented a system for risk  management, business ethics practices, and fair trade as we seek to build trust in our relationships with  stakeholders. Today, Hyundai Steel is working tirelessly to ensure a sustainable corporate culture. #03    Standing  at the Center of the World HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 20. 21 Materiality Test  Materiality Test Process Hyundai Steel has identified 25 issues of the highest importance through a three-step materiality test.

The board also reviewed managements performance in terms of sustainability based on  reports on the current status of the internal accounting control and compliance program. The attendance  rate of outside directors at all meetings was 84%. Passing a resolution requires the presence of more than  half of the BOD members, with a majority of those present voting in favor. Any member of the BOD facing  a conflict of interest on a particular issue is not allowed to cast a vote on the issue. While a cap on annual  compensation for the nine directors was set at KRW 10 billion, the total remuneration actually paid out to  directors for fiscal 2010 stood at KRW 6.7 billion. Major IR Activities Hyundai Steel holds annual meetings to strengthen its communication with analysts. In 2010, we con- ducted two surveys of analyst opinions regarding our IR activities. The survey results showed that  analysts scored the company highly on our IR activities. In particular, they gave high scores in terms of  reliability and integrity as well as plant tours. Analysts also requested that we increase the number of  overseas non-deal road shows.

In addition, the compa- nys sales forecast for the first and second halves of 2009 achieved a 98% accuracy (a percentage of the variance between the outlook  and actual sales records; the higher the score, the more accurate the outlook). Topped IR Best Practices Hyundai Steels 2009 annual report, titled a Second Leap Forward, won a platinum award in the material industry category at the  2009 Vision Awards, sponsored by the League of American Communications Professionals (LACP). The book scored 97 points on a  scale of 100, earning a perfect score in six out of the eight criteria, including creativity, clarity of message, and accessibility of informa- tion. 2009 Annual Report: Platinum Award at the LACP Vision Awards Audit Committee Ethics Committee Outside Director Candidate Recommendation Committee Board of Directors Hyundai Steel has an established system for outside directors to ensure their independence from the  Board of Directors (BOD) and to manage potential conflicts of interest. In 2010, Hyundai Steels Board of  Directors  held 10 meetings. Shareholder Composition As of the end of 2010, Hyundai Steels total outstanding shares amounted to 85,314,475 shares, as listed on  the Korea Stock Exchange (KRX). The largest shareholder of the company is Kia Motors, which holds 21.29%.  The percentage of shares held by Kia and its related parties stood at 33.86% overall. Shareholders holding  more than 5% of the companys shares include the National Pension Fund, which owns 6.06% of the company. Board of Directors Hyundai Steels Board of Directors consists of four inside and five outside directors. Under the BOD are the sub- committees chaired by or with the active participation of outside directors. Comprised exclusively of outside  directors, the Ethics Committee and Audit Committee meet regularly to fulfill duties independent of the BOD.  Defying concerns over the success of the plan, Hyundai Steel successfully completed and commenced  operation of an integrated steel mill ahead of schedule in 2010. Backing this success was a confident and  insightful management which remained firm in its resolve to bring the project to completion by steadily  investing more than KRW 6 trillion, even in 2008, when global steelmakers halted investment in facilities  in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. Hyundai Steels management remained positive enough  about the future of the project to conclude  long-term contracts with suppliers of raw materials in Brazil  and Australia. Management also regularly visited the construction site of the blast furnaces to check on the  progress being made and to encourage workers. We are building sound corporate governance practices. Powerful  leadership is decisive  in implementing new  business plans. We are building  sound corporate  governance practices. We provide  transparent management  information. What does Hyundai Steel do to ensure transparency in its corporate  governance and adherence to responsible management practices?  Risk management system Developing a hedging strategy Daily monitoring Audit Monitoring System Self-checking TFT organization Risk Management Financial Risks Hyundai Steel established a risk management system based on risk management processes in 2006 to  detect potential risk factors and to minimize the impact of risks. By classifying the company-wide work  processes into production, sales, purchasing, and finance, the risk management system was used to  develop risk indicators for each category that could be evaluated and managed according to category. In  step with changing business environments and in consideration of feedback from each department, the  risk indicators are updated and managed on a regular basis. Further to that, Hyundai Steel established a  Risk Monitoring Task Force Team in 2009, and also holds regular meetings where executives and working- level managers in production, sales, purchasing, and finance are briefed on operations, enabling more  efficient decision-making in response to changing circumstances. In the meetings, executives and manag- ers are updated on economic and steel industry trends and briefed on the companys daily monitoring of  various internal and external factors, including raw materials, production, and sales. Non-financial Risks Hyundai Steels audit monitoring system eliminates risk factors at source and strengthens follow-up  measures to prevent the recurrence of similar risks. In 2010, we conducted a diagnosis of management  practices to improve the working processes and applied stricter measures to combat unethical behavior  through administrative means such as directives and corrective actions, or impediments to promotion such  as sanctions or warnings. We also improved the purchasing system and inspection processes to prevent  the occurrence of unethical behavior. For  departments with close and frequent contact with stakeholders,  we also developed checklists for the monitoring of ethical behavior, while encouraging staff to monitor  their own behavior in the daily fulfillment of duties. A company can achieve sustainable growth only when it practices business ethics, as this is the only  way it can earn the unwavering trust of stakeholders. Today, Hyundai Steel continues to offer education  programs and run campaigns to raise employee awareness about business ethics. In addition, we have  established and share business ethics principles company-wide to ensure mutual growth alongside our  stakeholders. At many other companies, procurement-related departments can be prone to corruption or other unethi- cal behavior. As a result, Hyundai Steel operates a specific business ethics system for employees who  work in these departments to increase their understanding and practice of business ethics. Furthermore,  we have developed an integrated purchasing system and a separate ethics committee for the purchasing  division to promote fair and transparent purchasing practices. Business Ethics Guidebook Hyundai Steel declared its full commitment to business ethics in 2002. Since then, we have instituted an  Ethics Charter and Code of Ethical Conduct based on three management policies: trust-based manage- ment, field-oriented management and transparent management. We have also adopted our own Compli- ance Program (CP). As part of our business ethics practices, we published the Hyundai Steel Business  Ethics Guidebook in 2008, and it now serves to guide employees while offering them solutions to ethical  issues they might face in the course of carrying out their day-to-day responsibilities. Education & Campaigns Hyundai Steel operates online business ethics courses for our entire workforce. We also give new employ- ees an ethics training session during orientation. In 2010, we provided two mandatory ethics training ses- sions to all our employees on anti-corruption and anti-bribery, information security, prohibition on illegal po- litical contributions, tax compliance, compliance with fair trade, and trade secret protection. In addition, we  provided outsourced security personnel with nine sessions of ethics and human rights education in 2010.  Cyber Auditor Hyundai Steel operates a Cyber Auditor page on its website. Employees, customers, suppliers and stake- holders can report any unethical employee behavior by phone, Internet, e-mail or fax. An informants iden- tity is always protected, with every reported case being given an exhaustive investigation in accordance  with internal regulations and processes. Any and all appropriate measures are then carried out. HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 24. 25 SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT   Hyundai Steel has established a comprehensive framework for pre-emptive and follow-up measures, as well  as a system for responding swiftly to risks from the outset. The risk management process consists of preven- tion, management, and monitoring of risk factors.

We promote  business ethics through  education programs  and a wide variety of  campaigns. Hyundai Steel launched the Risk Responsiveness PR TFT in 2010. Consisting of 28 experts from the production, sales and PR depart- ments, the TFT team previews potential problems and develops response manuals for the facilitation of swift responses in the event of  an incident of concern,  minimizing any tangible and intangible impact on the business. Risk Responsiveness PR TFT Hyundai Steels basic risk hedging policy on foreign exchange (FX) is to remove or minimize FX risk factors by mobilizing internal man- agement mechanisms before resorting to the use of derivatives such as currency forwarding, currency swaps or options. The FX risks  are monitored on a regular basis and reported on to top management, whenever necessary, for effective internal control. FX Risk Management What do you do to systematically manage risk? What are you doing to incorporate business ethics practices into your  corporate culture?  Fair trade underpins an ethical corporate culture. As such, Hyundai Steel adopted a Compliance Program  (CP) in 2002. We also host the Growth Potential (GP) Council, a CP sub-organization for each sector that  promotes voluntary compliance with fair trade throughout the value chain. Adoption of the Compliance Program Under the stewardship of the CEO, Hyundai Steels CP program has been committed to voluntarily comply- ing with fair trade principles since 2002. Hyundai Steel received an A rating for our compliance practices  in CP ratings reviews by Koreas Fair Trade Commission in 2008 and 2010. In April 2010, we were awarded a  Fair Trade Commissioners Commendation for exemplary achievements in CP practices.  CP Performance Hyundai Steel employees are subject to four sessions of in-class training courses every year on fair trade  principles and the companys compliance program. Employees working in the sales and purchasing de- partments, as well as other departments vulnerable to unfair trading, are subject to separate educational  programs, which include online courses, lectures by external agencies, and fair trade experts.      2008      2009      2010    No. of sessions No. of trainees Hours  No. of sessions No. of trainees Hours  No. of sessions No. of trainees Hours In-class training  6  366  8  12  620  12  9  414  9 e-Learning  -  -  -  -  -  -  1  202  17 External training  6  10  48  3  6  48  5  7  27 Total  12  376  56  15  626  60  15  623  53 |  Fair Trade Voluntary Compliance Organization | Business Planning Raw Materials Sourcing Incheon Works Business Management Purchasing Sales Pohang Works Dangjin Works Chief Compliance Officer (executive) Compliance Management Team  CEO Internal Monitoring Hyundai Steel conducts regular and ad hoc internal monitoring on the teams whose job duties are vulner- able to unfair common practices and other unfair trade practices. The teams are also provided with educa- tion on fair trade issues accompanying the regular fulfillment of their duties. When employees begin a job  vulnerable to unfair trade practices, the Legal Affairs Team monitors their legal compliance practices. In  addition, these teams closely collaborate with the CP Team to prevent any unintentional violation of the  Fair Trade Act.   2008  2009  2010 No. of teams subject to internal monitoring  39 teams  36 teams  102 teams As a result of our consistent internal monitoring and commitment to voluntary compliance with fair trade,  Hyundai Steel was found to have no violations in our transactions with subcontractors in a written survey  conducted by Koreas Fair Trade Commission. We also printed our Compliance Code of Conduct on the inside cover of the official Hyundai Steel Employ- ee Handbook, which is distributed to everyone at the company. Furthermore, we published the Compli- ance Program Guidebook, a collection of compliance program case studies, and distributed it to all of the  companys departments. In 2011, we plan on hosting GP Council meetings by sector and inviting external experts for a CP workshop.  We will also be increasing incentives for CP best practices, revising CP stipulations, creating a CP Day, and  running an online test on CP training to effectively promote voluntary compliance with fair trade through- out the company. Information Security Hyundai Steel has established an information security framework which operates at the highest global  standards and protects tangible and intangible intellectual properties and technologies, as well as man- agement information related to the company. In addition, Hyundai Steel is subject to an ISO 27001 review  on a biannual basis by an external agency called BSI Korea. We have also developed and put in place a  checklist for quarterly information security practices, which encourages employees to voluntarily partici- pate in information security management. Hyundai Steel runs various information security training programs and campaigns to raise employee  awareness on information security. Team managers in the information security department receive regu- lar training and are encouraged to share pertinent information with their colleagues to help point out how  important information security is throughout the entire company. We also give separate training sessions  about information security to new employees, employees working for overseas subsidiaries, and employ- ees working for our suppliers. In addition, Hyundai Steel publishes a monthly newsletter called Informa- tion Security News in an effort to share case studies related to information leaks. Screensavers have also  been installed that reiterate the importance of information protection with the aim of ensuring the com- panys entire workforce remains vigilant about information security.

SUSTAINABLE  GROWTH Constructing aNewWorld An objective assessment of the sustainability of a company begins with monitoring  to ensure that it remains faithful to its innate values.  Based on the strength of its diversified product line-up and advanced technologies, Hyundai Steel is competing with the worlds leading steelmakers. Our latest success is our newly completed integrated steel mill that has boosted the  range and size of the companys business portfolio. As we move forward, we will focus on high value-added steel products to ensure  mutual growth with our global stakeholders, while enhancing Hyundai Steels  name as a leading global steelmaker.  Sustainable  Growth Highlights Hyundai Steel successfully developed three ultra-strength steel products,  hot rolled H-beams with enhanced earthquake-resistance for building  structures (SHN520 and 570) and ultra-strength reinforcing bars, after  five years of meticulous R&D. The new products can withstand wind  speeds of over 250km/h and earthquakes. They are also flame-resistant  for at least four hours in the event of a fire and have a lifespan of more than  50 years. With a yield strength 1 of 800MPa, the new reinforcing bars are perfect for  ultra-high skyscrapers and enormous bridges. 1  Yield strength: the marginal point required to recover from deformation when exposed  to stress Full operation of Dangjin Integrated Steel Mill (Pages 39-41) Ultra-Strength H-beams and Reinforcing Bars (Page 34) January 2010 With the blow-in of its first blast furnace on January 5, 2010, Dangjin Inte- grated Steel Mill commenced full operation, with the plants second blast  furnace blowing just 10 months later, in November. The successful opera- tion of the two blast furnaces led to profits for the integrated steel mill at  Dangjin Works in their first year of full operation. With an annual output of  four million tons of steel each, the two blast furnaces, each one 5,250m 3 in  capacity, 17m in diameter and 110m in height, added a total of eight million  tons to Hyundai Steels annual production. 28-1. 29 Stakeholder Communication Hyundai Steel is a financially sound company.

This achievement can be attrib- uted to the early normalization of the two blast furnaces at Dangjin Works, continued technology develop- ment and KPI management, and the resultant enhancement in cost competitiveness throughout the year.  In 2011, we have set the goal of achieving a 34% growth in sales, to reach KRW 13,739.3 billion, and a  32% growth in sales volume, to reach 15.94 million tons, based on the prediction that there will be sharp  growth in flat steel sales brought about by the full-scale operation of our two new blast furnaces. To that  end, Hyundai Steel will continue to increase its technological competitiveness through R&D on high- profit products, such as steel sheets for automobiles and Steel Plate. In November and then again in December of 2010, Hyundai Steel obtained an investment-grade rating from S&P and Moodys. This rat- ing is not only a reflection of the companys successful operation of its integrated steel mill but is expected to enhance Hyundai Steels  overall credibility and stature as a global steelmaker, while also improving its cost of funds.

Economic value at Hyundai Steel is always fairly  distributed back to stakeholders and reinvested into the company for its continued success in the future. As a result of its stable operations, Hyundai Steel has earned excellent ratings from overseas credit  rating agencies. #01 Creating Economic Value  HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 32. 33 With the completion of the integrated steel mill at Dangjin Works, Hyundai Steel has opened a new  chapter in the Korean steel industry. A diversified product portfolio and aggressive export strategies  will lead the companys market expansion strategies, with a stable and long-term raw materials  supply line contributing to our cost competitiveness in the global market. Hyundai Steel will not  relent in its pursuit to become the world leader in all its business areas. #02     Reinforcing  Global Competitiveness Value Creation and Distribution to Stakeholders  In 2010, Hyundai Steel purchased raw materials from domestic and international suppliers worth KRW 6,825.8 billion. At every step of  the way we collaborated with our major stakeholders – shareholders, investors, customers, suppliers, employees, and partners – in our  economic value creation activities. The value created from this contributed not just to improving the corporate value of Hyundai Steel  but also in enhancing value for each of our stakeholders. For example, shareholders and investors receive profits through dividends  and the interest we pay them, while employees are supported through self-realization and the financial stability brought about by the  job itself. We also contribute to the growth of our partners through fair trading and win-win cooperation programs, with the high-quality  products we provide our customers contributing to the enhancement of their productivity and competitiveness. Furthermore, as a cor- porate citizen, Hyundai Steel makes donations and contributions to the communities it operates in and faithfully complies with all its  tax obligations.

Through the use of our proprietary technologies, we became only the second  company in the world to develop magnetic levitation train rails. Our steel used for megastructures has  heightened the vertical limit of buildings and made them safer than ever before. Hyundai Steel also pos- sesses the technology necessary to customize sheet pile product size to an individual customers needs. Magnetic Levitation Train Rails Koreas railroad rail market requires 50,000 tons of steel per year for both new construction and replace- ment work, and Hyundai Steel is the countrys sole producer of this type of rail. In 2008, we employed in- house technology to become only the second company in the world to develop the rails for a national  project aimed at commercializing unmanned automatic urban maglev trains. A 53km railroad for urban  maglev trains is now under construction in Yeongjongdo, near Incheon International Airport. Hyundai  Steel is providing all 35,000 tons of the rail required for the construction. At the same time, we are aggres- sively pursuing new markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Ultra-Strength H-Beam and Reinforcing Bars Hyundai Steel joined the government-led Megastructure Steel Development project in 2004 and has since  pushed forward with related R&D activities. After five years of constant R&D, we successfully developed  hot rolled H-beams that have enhanced earthquake resistance for building structures (SHN520 and 570)  and ultra-strength reinforcing bars (SD800: yield strength 800MPa). Megastructure steel products are made from high-quality steel and feature special properties meant  for skyscrapers and very large floating structures (VLFSs). Boasting at least 650MPa of tensile strength,  structures made from this steel are able to withstand wind speeds of over 250km/h and earthquakes.  They are also fire resistant for at least 240 minutes in the event of fire and have a lifespan of more than 50  years. Officially unveiled in April 2011, the warranty guarantee on this earthquake-resistant steel product  speaks volumes of how confident we are in our products. In the future, Hyundai Steel will step up its R&D  efforts and develop even safer steel products, ones that can endure a range of natural disasters such as  the devastating earthquake that struck Japan in 2005 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Hyundai Steels R&D Center mobilizes our advanced source technology, component processing tech- nologies, and auto body design technologies to develop new steel products for automobiles. At the heart  of an R&D network connecting subsidiaries of the Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Hyundai Hysco,  Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, the R&D Center allows clients to be involved from the early stages of product  development through a process stage-based research and development system that maximizes synergies  in technology R&D. Consisting of a research building, a rolling laboratory, and a steelmaking laboratory,  the Hyundai Steel R&D Center is equipped with everything needed for the stable operation of an integrated  steel mill. In early 2011, our Total Solutions Center will be completed, providing support to application tech- nologies that will be tailored to individual customer needs. Since the opening of the Hyundai Steel R&D Center, it has increased the number of patents it files every  year. In 2010, it filed 1,061 patents, with the total number of patents filed up until April 2011 standing at  3,516. Since introducing a high-performance computing (HPC) system, Hyundai Steel has been able to have supercomputers and computer  clusters solve advanced computation problems. The HPC system has increased the speed at which we can respond to demands by de- partments at customer contact points as well as help in the development of advanced analysis technologies, thereby enhancing produc- tivity and product quality. As a result, Hyundai Steel has the ability to provide competitive and optimized products to customers, and  this has led to increased customer satisfaction levels.  HPC System  R&D Center is at  the forefront of all our  R&D endeavors. |  No. of Filings for Patents | 2007 2008 2009 2010 351 555  888  1,061  We are developing  new products and  technologies that  reflect market needs.

In a bid to offset sagging  sales of long steel to the sluggish domestic construction and shipbuilding industries, we have aggres- sively engaged in entering new export markets. As a result of these and other efforts, exports have grown  25.2% since 2009 and 62.2% since 2008. Export Volume Ratio by Region Hyundai Steel has developed energy-efficient water-cooled panels which are used to prevent the inside of an electric arc furnace from  melting in extreme heat. By widening and reforming the shape of conventional water-cooled panel pipelines, we can now agglutinate  more slag. In addition, the new panels have reduced the heating surface area part of the furnace that is exposed to the arc or hot metal  heat by 17%. An automatic temperature controller is attached to control the flow of cooling water, which has considerably reduced en- ergy losses and extended durability from the previous six months to 12 months. Slag is adhered to the surface of the water-cooled panel to protect it, with temperatures reaching high enough to melt steel scrap. Con- ventional water-cooled panels use vertically shaped pipelines that make it difficult to attach slag, which easily falls off from the pipe- lines due to the narrow space. Also, the long pipeline has increased the heating surface area, resulting in a greater loss of energy. Energy-Efficient Water-Cooled Panels Developed at Pohang Works Hyundai Steel collaborated with a subcontractor to develop copper molds, which were previously imported, using in-house technolo- gies. Furthermore, they adjusted the lower part of the dummy bar head and improved the spray filter, extending the use of copper molds  10 fold and halving annual purchase expenses. In addition, the new molds address procurement issues arising from high import prices  and lengthy transportation times.   Copper molds are components that cool down hot metal used to manufacture semi-finished products such as slab, bloom, and billet. Molds account for 90% of their  quality and directly affect the surface of semi-finished goods.  Copper Mold Developed at Incheon Works To overcome adverse business environments brought about by sagging sales of long steel and which are  affected by a sluggish construction economy and the global oversupply of steel products, we continu- ously strive for early normalization and cost reduction in blast furnace operations. While streamlining the  process through the production of low-quality pig iron, increased recovery rate, and energy conservation,  we are improving our wide array of production systems by implementing cost-cutting measures in all  business sectors. Monthly cost reduction meetings provide a venue for the company-wide review of cost- cutting activities and achievements. Furthermore, workshops, campaigns, and slogan contests are also  carried out throughout the company to further this end. The full operation of our two new blast furnaces has further enhanced Hyundai Steels product portfolio  competitiveness. We are penetrating more new markets based on the companys differentiated produc- tion line-up, which focuses on highly profitable products such as Steel Plate and offshore structures.   2008  2009  2010 Domestic  8,383  7,250  8,692 Exports (percentage)  2,066(20%)  2,676(27%)  3,353(28%) Total  10,449  9,926  12,045 (Unit: 1,000 tons) Region  2008  2009  2010 Southeast Asia  21.5  39.4  35.6 Middle East/Southwest Asia  24.3  14.8  24.9 China  8.6  18.4  20.2 US/Europe  38.8  17.5  14.0 Others  6.8  9.9  5.3 Total  100.0  100.0  100.0 (Unit: %) Hyundai Steel has an annual capacity of 1.5 million tons.

In the future, Hyundai Steel will strive to expand its share of the heavy plate  market, while completing work on a differentiated production line-up whose focus will be on highly profitable TMCPs and HRC for ship- builders. First Rollout and Export of Steel Plate Hyundai Steel signed an MOU with Malaysias EEW Group to supply 200,000 tons of heavy plates annually for offshore structures. Since  completing our integrated steel mill, we have supplied heavy plates to domestic manufacturers of petronas (thick pipes). Recently,  Hyundai Steel has utilized its advance R&D marketing capabilities to develop heavy plates for offshore structures.  Exporting Heavy Plates for Offshore Structures Diversified  export markets have  led to an increase in  exports. We are  implementing  various cost  reduction initiatives  company-wide.

Following its completion in January  2010, Dangjins integrated steel mill commenced commercial production on April 1, 2010. On April 8, 2010, Hyundai Steel celebrated the completion of the integrated steel mill, Koreas first blast furnace built  using private funds and the worlds first eco-friendly system to encompass the entire process, from raw materials to  finished products. Fifty-seven years after our foundation as Koreas first steelmaker in 1953, Hyundai Steel has rewritten  the history of Koreas steelmaking industry.  With the completion of the integrated steel mill, the Hyundai Motor Group completed the worlds first entire value chain  in car manufacturing, from hot metal to automobiles. The operation of a second blast furnace in November 2010 added  to our steelmaking capacity, and has since reached 20 million tons of steel per annum (12 million tons from electric arc  furnaces and 8 million tons from blast furnaces). Our product portfolio has also become more balanced, with high-end  steel sheets such as HRC for automobiles and Steel Plate being added to the product line-up. Furthermore, completion  of the integrated steel mill is expected to help improve market supply in the domestic steelmaking industry, which im- ports more than 20 million tons of steel per year. This, in turn, will reinforce Koreas competitiveness in major end-user  industries such as car manufacturing, shipbuilding, machinery, and home appliances.  According to a resolution passed by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2011, Hyundai Steel announced construction  plans for a third blast furnace, with a projected total investment of KRW 3,255 billion. The price of steel products depends on market supply and the prices of major raw materials such as iron  ore, coal, and steel scrap. The price of steel scrap, the main raw material for steelmaking in electric arc fur- naces, is affected by its supply and the global construction economy. In a bid to hedge exchange risks aris- ing from imported steel scrap, Hyundai Steel has secured domestic suppliers of quality steel scrap for its  long-term supply line and worked hard to enhance domestic self-sufficiency and reduce mediator margins  in order to stabilize procurement. With iron ore and coal being the main raw materials of blast furnace steelmaking, Hyundai Steel has se- cured stable long-term supply channels through several supply MOUs, including one with Australias BHP  Billiton. Hyundai Steel will continue to seek new supply lines in order to secure the reserves required for  the stable operation of our integrated steel mills.

In line with this new green economy, Hyundai Steel is always seeking new  opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases, while also building upon our carbon  credit schemes and renewable energy businesses. Protecting the environment remains at the top of our list of priorities in all of our  business activities, which is part of the reason we have recently completed work on  our eco-friendly steel mills. With state-of-the-art environmental technologies and facilities, Hyundai Steel will  continue to lead the way in Koreas low-carbon green growth initiatives. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE Creating a Greener World  Environmental Performance Highlights As the newly operated Dangjin Integrated Steel Mills were assessed  and found to meet the requirements of ISO 14001 standard and scope,  Hyundai Steel acquired the integrated ISO 14001 certification with three  existing sites, approved by Korea Standards Association and the British  Standards Institution (BSI). The ISO 14001 is an international standard  ensuring environmental management systems improve environmental  performance throughout the entire value chain of business activities. Acquisition of Environmental Management System ISO 14001  Certification (Page 48) October 2010 In June 2010, Hyundai Steel participated in the Energy Management Sys- tem pilot project, a comprehensive management system covering every- thing from energy use connected to target goals and reduction efforts to  monitoring and evaluation. Based on the findings from its consultations  with the Korea Foundation for Quality (KFQ), Hyundai Steels energy use  management system was verified in accordance with all relevant govern- ment guidelines.

Hyundai Steel is well aware of the envi- ronmental impact of the steel industry and strives to minimize its own environmental impact. By taking an  environmental approach to the entire production process, from raw material management to the rollout  of finished products, Hyundai Steel aims to fulfill its responsibility as an eco-friendly company. Since our  acquisition in 2003 of the ISO 14001 certificate, a highly respected international environmental manage- ment certificate, Hyundai Steel has phased in an environmental management platform. Under the goal  of becoming an internationally renowned eco-friendly steelmaker, we have instituted the following strict  environmental management policies. Hyundai Steel is well aware of the environmental impact of the steel industry, and has committed  itself to minimizing the companys environmental impact, while also establishing an environmental  management infrastructure. We will continue our investments and R&D efforts into developing  environmental facilities, which will reduce the total volume of pollutants and recycling byproducts. #01 In Harmony with Nature Hyundai Steel  considers its  environmental  impact throughout all  business processes.

While keeping up with relentless R&D efforts to develop GHG reduction  technologies, we are also being proactive with industrial initiatives to mitigate climate change  through technological collaborations with leading global steelmakers. #02         Addressing  Climate Change With the full operation of the new integrated steel mill, Hyundai Steel has renewed its ISO  14001 environmental management certificate with the Korea Standards Association and the  British Standards Institution for the new mill and three other steelwork plants. The environ- mental management system is an internationally recognized standard for the environmental  management of businesses, and meant to improve environmental performance throughout  the entire value chain of business activities. The certification provides Hyundai Steel with a  platform for an integrated environmental approach, as well as giving us the ability to review  and improve all business activities, products and services that have the potential to impact  the environment. |  Environmental Management Organization | Hyundai Steel operates dedicated Environment and Energy Management teams at all major operation  sites, including the headquarters in Seoul, steelwork plants in Incheon, Pohang and Dangjin, and the  companys R&D Center. These teams develop environmental management strategies, manage environ- mental facilities, oversee all legal compliances at a company-wide level, and oversee environmental tech- nology development. Seoul Incheon Pohang Dangjin R&D Center CEO  Environmental Management Council   Environment & Energy Workshop  Task force team at each division level Environmental Management Certification  Industry Climate Change Response Task Force Hyundai Steel is a member of the Industry Climate Change Response Task Force, which was initiated by  the Business Institute for Sustainable Development. We also actively cooperate with other companies in  the industry regarding climate change policies, and have taken the lead in certain industrial initiatives to  mitigate climate change, two of which were the adoption of an industry-wide GHG energy target manage- ment system and an emissions trading scheme. Global Steel Industry Climate Change Response Task Force Hyundai Steel is an active member of the Environmental Policy Committee and the Environmental Technol- ogy Committee under the World Steel Association (WSA) and participates in the committees Better Air Qual- ity project, which is designed to produce policy and technological countermeasures to deal with climate  change. In addition, we participate in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Climate Change (APP), a collaborative  initiative of governments and eight industries, including steel, power generation and cement, whose pur- pose is to establish a worldwide cooperative network for developing policies and technologies to mitigate  climate change.  Asia-Pacific Partnership on Climate Change (APP): Originally proposed by the US government in 2005, the APP is an initiative by Asia- Pacific countries to counter EU-oriented climate change conventions. The governments and industries from the seven members (Australia,  Canada, China, India, Japan, Korea, and the US) gather to discuss voluntary initiatives to enhance energy efficiency and effectively reduce  greenhouse gases. HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 50. 51 ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE Facility improvements, technological development, systems formulation, and keeping up with the global  trend of stricter regulations to deal with climate change can pose risks to business activities; it can also  present opportunities for eco-friendly businesses. Thus, Hyundai Steel has introduced an energy use tar- get management program to achieve low-carbon green growth by saving energy. Hyundai Steel has also  implemented a target management system on GHG emissions and energy use. In addition, we have com- piled a GHG inventory and a computerized system to control GHG emissions, participate in a target man- agement pilot project, and have developed technology to reduce GHG emissions in proactive response  to climate change. Under the Carbon Footprint Management (CFM) project, Hyundai Steel is sharing its  knowledge and experience of mitigating climate change with suppliers. Furthermore, we have put in place  a mid- to long-term plan to develop technologies for the accurate analysis and effective reduction of GHG  emissions which are applicable to our production processes. Internal Preparedness System The precise measuring of GHG emissions is critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which is why Hyun- dai Steel commissioned outside experts to compile its GHG inventory in March 2010, listing all GHG emissions  volume by source five months later. Based on these results, we have completed an IT system for comprehen- sive data management and target management of energy use and GHG emissions at all our work sites. Energy Use Target Management Pilot Project Committed to a preemptive response to the GHG energy target management system, Hyundai Steel has  become involved in an energy target management pilot project spearheaded by the Ministry of Knowledge  Economy. Conducted jointly by Motiva, a leading Finnish-based energy and material efficiency company,  and the Korea Management Association Consulting organization in August 2010, the technology exchange  program involved inspections of Hyundai Steels energy management system and the energy use at our  production facilities. This opportunity provided us with opportunities to acquire skills in operating a globally  recognized energy management system. Following this, Hyundai Steel ran a verification test in November  of 2010 which only improved the companys preparedness for introducing the GHG energy target manage- ment system. In the pilot project, we set a target of reducing energy use by 0.7% and prepared legal forms  that included specification forms and an implementation plan, all in accordance with target management  guidelines, upon which they were verified by the Korean government. These procedures offered an excellent  opportunity for Hyundai Steel to prepare for the introduction of a GHG energy target management system. Participation in Energy Management System Pilot Project In response to energy issues stemming from surging oil prices and climate change, Hyundai Steel partici- pated in an energy management system pilot project in order to establish a system that would encompass  all aspects of our business, from setting energy use targets to monitoring and performance evaluations.  As a result of this experience, Hyundai Steel is now aiming to acquire certification for its energy manage- ment practices by December 2011. Hyundai Steel signed an agreement with the Ministry of Knowledge Economy and suppliers in October 2009 to establish a carbon foot- print management system meant to reduce GHG emissions. A joint project between large corporations and the government, the Carbon  Footprint Management System projects mandate is to assist SMEs in their efforts to build competencies in GHG reduction initiatives.  During the primary stage of the project, which ended in June 2010, Hyundai Steel prepared a GHG inventory, an energy management  system, and carbon emissions statistics for each of our products. We also looked into energy consumption patterns and developed  countermeasures to improve related practices. We then provided all this information to 20 suppliers as a platform for their own climate  change preparation activities. The average energy use reduction rate for suppliers participating in the first stage was 5.7%. During the  second stage, slated to end in June 2011, Hyundai Steel will provide the platform to another 20 suppliers, while continuing to provide as- sistance to participants from the projects first stage. Carbon Footprint Management System Byproduct gases generated from the steelmaking process include blast furnace gas, coke oven gas, and  basic oxygen furnace gas. To efficiently make use of these energy sources, Hyundai Steel has developed  the technologies to mix these three byproduct gases for the purpose of internal recycling, thereby en- hancing energy efficiency and reducing the imported volume of energy sources. As part of our efforts to  enhance energy efficiency, we are also developing high-temperature air combustion technology which  reuses exhaust heat to heat up combustion air for use in the steelmaking process, which considerably re- duces energy usage.     2008  2009  2010 Incheon    1,736,164  1,625,248  1,632,348 Pohang    1,343,770  1,244,837  1,332,611 Dangjin    1,546,370  1,349,995  7,169,684 Total    4,626,304  4,220,080  10,134,643 (Unit : tons) GHG Emissions  Hyundai Steel employees measure and minimize GHG emissions and energy use in the course of normal business activities.

What does Hyundai Steel do to mitigate climate change?  HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 52. 53 ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE Hyundai Steel is dedicated to investing in environmental initiatives designed to reduce environmental  pollution. Environmental pollution reduction expenses include electricity bills, chemical and labor costs,  and waste treatment expenses at environmental facilities. The expenses are comprised of construction  and repair, and maintenance costs at environmental prevention facilities, but exclude construction costs  for the new integrated steel mills. In 2010, Hyundai Steel spent KRW 153,741 million, up 170.4% from  the previous year, on reducing environmental pollution. This surge can be attributed to the operation of  Dangjins integrated steel mills, which began operating in 2010, and which caused an increase in overall  expenses to reduce wastewater, air pollutants, and waste. Alternatively, environmental investment ex- penses declined 1.2% from the previous year, to KRW 19,839 million.

The waste acid content from wastewater stemming from the  stainless steel shop at Incheon Works goes through chemical and biological treatment before being dis- charged. We also replaced methanol with fruit sugar waste as a carbon source in 2010. Although the water  quality control was temporarily disturbed by this trial in the course of finding the optimal operational con- ditions, the concentration has since been normalized. The resultant economic effect of reducing the use  of chemical treatments and byproduct recycling amounted to KRW 130 million. Figures for Dangjin Works  represent the concentration of emissions from the electric arc furnace. -  Tap water : water for public use that is supplied by local water purifying plants  -  Industrial water : lower quality water used for production activities at factories and supplied by local water purifying plants  only after primary treatment is carried out  -  Recycled water : Incheon Works receives effluent from the Gajwa Wastewater Treatment Plant and reprocesses it at its reverse  osmosis pressure facility for use in its own processes.       2008  2009  2010   Tap Water    1,925  1,571  2,329  Water Usage  Industrial Water    6,414  5,490  18,907   (1,000 tons)  Recycled Water    4,746  4,306  3,807   Total    13,085  11,367  25,043 Water Use for Crude Steel Production (m 3/ton)    1.33  1.35  1.90 Wastewater Treatment Effluent (1,000 m 3)    762  555  6,233 Water Quality Control Activities In an effort to apply stricter internal standards to wastewater treatment than legally required, Hyundai  Steel operates advanced facilities involving chemical and biological processing and activated carbon pro- cessing, as well as integrated reprocessing at wastewater treatment areas. We also monitor for any impact  on marine life and changes to toxic units in order to prevent any impact on local ecology. Committed to mini- mizing the concentration of pollutants discharged into water anywhere in the vicinity, Hyundai Steel built  a pilot facility measuring 1/80,000 of biological processors as part of its continued R&D activities for opti- mized processing, while also maintaining the efficient operation of wastewater treatment plants. In 2010,  we consumed a total of 25.04 million tons of water for cooling and cleaning at our three steelwork plants.  The integrated steel mill used approximately 14.01 million tons of water, accounting for 54.8% of the total  water used. However, Incheon Works recycled treated sewage water with an annual substitute effect of  3.81 million tons. Despite a decrease in water use at the electric arc furnace in 2010, the water used in crude  steel production increased sharply due to the operation of the integrated steel mill. Environmental Management Activities Air Pollutant Control Activities Hyundai Steel actively carries out R&D to improve the efficiency of dust collection and to develop activated carbon  in order to reduce the emissions of major air pollutants such as dust, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides. Since 2009,  we have been regularly monitoring air quality and applying diffusion modeling techniques by checking the content  of dust and odors in the vicinities of all work sites to minimize any impact on local communities. Hyundai Steel has  also installed a filter dust collector on its sinters. This filter dust collector can remove pollutants from the exhaust gas  stemming from combustion in the sintering process without any other equipment. In addition, it can effectively treat  SOx and NOx, as well as high concentrations of dust from the sintering processs exhaust gas. This device has not  only enhanced the efficiency in the simultaneous treatment of pollutants but also maximized the efficiency and cost  reduction in the installment and maintenance expenses of the treatment facilities. Conventional filters located at  the sinter plants can be replaced with catalyst-embedded filters to the same effect.

We have also installed an electric dust collec- tor and filter dust collector in our sintering plant, maximizing dust removal. An activated carbon absorber was also  added in order to fully treat SOx, NOx, and dioxins in a bid to minimize the generation of air pollutants.  The emissions of dust, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides, by plant, are shown in the table below.

In fact, the concentration of emissions at Dangjin Works remained  at an incredibly low 0.03 at its electric arc furnaces and 0.24 at its sintering plants. Incheon Works and  Pohang Works thoroughly check product quality from the raw material stage and optimize the cooling of  exhaust gases from electric arc furnaces, which prevents the recomposition of dioxins and maintains a  moderate level of emissions.           2008  2009  2010  Emissions Allowance     Incheon    0.05  0.10  0.05    Dioxin  Pohang    0.04  0.15  0.06  Electric arc furnace: 0.7      Dangjin   Electric arc furnace  0.03  0.03  0.03  Sintering plant: 0.5     Sintering plant  -  -  0.24  (Unit : ng-TEQ/m 3) Chemical Substance Reduction Activities The emissions of chemical substances from Hyundai Steels operations into the air and water amounted  to 22,545kg in 2010. Under Koreas Hazardous Chemical Substance Discharge Act, we measure the  amount of chemical substances such as aluminum, copper and zinc that are discharged from each pro- cess before disclosing all results.        2008  2009  2010 Incheon      4,259  3,208  5,369 Pohang      1,100  1,170  1,144 Dangjin  Electric arc furnace    3,097  3,502  3,520   Blast furnace    -  -  12,512 Total      8,456  7,880  22,545 (Unit :  kg) In 2010, the total volume of byproducts, water pollutants, and air pollutants generated by all of Hyundai  Steels operations temporarily increased from 2009. However, we remain committed to developing and  implementing measures to reduce the total volume and intensity of emissions through ceaseless invest- ment, improvements to the emissions control system, and strengthened R&D. Byproduct Reuse The total volume of byproducts generated at Hyundai Steels three steelwork plants amounted to 3.74  million tons in 2010, with slag accounting for 83% of the total, followed by dust (4.5%), refractory waste  (1.6%), and sludge (1.8%). Hyundai Steel reused 94.3% of these byproducts for cement, aggregates for  road construction, ascon aggregates, and for recovering valuable metals. We will continue to reduce and  reuse byproducts by adopting valuable metal recovery technologies for dust, while also improving the  quality of steel scrap.  Hyundai Steel has developed technologies to reuse the slag generated during the steelmaking process as  construction aggregate. Furthermore, we have developed the technology to recycle dust and sludge con- taining high concentrations of iron and carbon generated from the blast furnace in the electric arc furnace  process. At the same time, dust and sludge containing low amounts of iron and carbon are recycled as  eco-labeled products, which are then used for landfills and as exhaust gas treatment agents. Environmentally-friendly steel slag-based aggregate has a similar structure to that of conventional aggregate, but contains higher  quality properties. This plays a significant role in the development of construction aggregates and various other recycling technologies.  In consideration of the physical and chemical properties of the slag created from its steelmaking process, Hyundai Steel ran a series of  tests to verify the eco-friendliness of the slag when recycled as construction aggregates such as concrete and ascon and obtained posi- tive results. Furthermore, we ensured its suitability for the construction field, achieving a higher quality than conventional aggregates  through a number of tests at construction sites. In the future, we will continue our technology R&D activities so we can use this slag for  special-purpose construction and offshore construction materials.  Byproduct recycling rate:  the percentage of byproducts recycled as cement component, aggregate substitute, and recycling  in the steelmaking process, excluding that which is treated through incinerations and landfills.     2008  2009  2010 Byproduct Volume (1,000 tons)    2,099  1,613  3,741 Byproduct Recycling Rate (%)    88.4  92.8  94.3 Legal Compliance & Improvements In response to concerns raised by local residents, Hyundai Steel invested a total of KRW 2.4 billion planting  dust hoods at Dangjin Works to improve the facilities in 2010. Aside from this, we have not been in any oth- er violation of environmental regulations. Following the completion of our integrated steel mill, Hyundai  Steel is now obliged to conduct regular environmental impact assessments under Article 24 of the Environ- mental Impact Assessment Act and reveal these results to authorities by the end of January of the following  year. We measure the air quality, water quality, quality of marine life, underground water, soil, noise and  vibration, as well as the state of marine and inland ecology of neighboring areas every year. In addition,  Hyundai Steel does not use or discharge any ozone-depleting substances or use any environmental pollut- ants for packaging. Converting Steel Slag into Construction Aggregate  Companies have a responsibility to the societies in which they operate. When profits are shared with stakeholders, corporate value can grow even more.  The sustainable future of a company relies on its stakeholders. Thus, Hyundai Steels employees, stakeholders and communities constitute our underlying  assets. When every stakeholder makes a concerted effort under a shared goal, powerful  synergies can be generated. Through win-win partnerships with stakeholders, career development programs for  employees, and various engagement programs with communities, Hyundai Steel is  committed to building a better society for everyone. SOCIAL VALUE Instilling Hope  Social Performance Highlights Hyundai Steel holds team seminars to enhance employee performance  and to mobilize the companys resources. The seminars have four stages  in place: team diagnosis questionnaires, team manager seminars, prelim- inary meetings by team, and team seminars. Based on the findings at each  stage, we identify any issue for improvement and develop subsequent  action plans, while working on an infrastructure for communication and  collaboration between team managers and team members. Team Seminars to Promote Communication (Page 61) May 2010 In November 2010, we held the Hyundai Steel Win-Win Cooperation Agree- ment Declaration Ceremony. The agreement calls for expanding the scope  of financial aid, improving transactional conditions, promoting the devel- opment of quality and technology, reinforcing win-win cooperation with  supplier subcontractors, increasing inter-company councils, and support- ing training and business activities. Win-Win Cooperation Agreement (Page 70) November 2010 Hyundai Steel signed an agreement with Koreas Housing Welfare Associa- tion for House Repair for Hope and Energy Efficiency in March 2011. Under  the agreement, we provided a total of KRW 385.91 million to the associa- tion in 2011, and for a period of 10 years, until 2020, Hyundai Steel is com- mitted to repairing and weatherizing 1,000 houses in Incheon, Pohang,  and Dangjin.

As such, Hyundai Steel fosters future leaders of the steel industry through our  performance-oriented next-generation human resource development system. At Hyundai Steel, we are  dedicated to bringing about the best workplaces based on safe and healthy working conditions, and a  communicative and cooperative corporate culture. #01     Increasing  Employee Competencies SOCIAL VALUE Workforce As of the end of 2010, Hyundai Steel employed a total of 8,356 people, with technicians making up 69.7% of  that number, followed by office workers/engineers (18.3%), then salespeople (3.0%), researchers (2.5%),  and other employees (5.4%). That same year our job creation rate stood at 8% and the turnover rate at 2.2%. |  Female Workforce |   2008  2009  2010 Total  204  210  243 (above senior-level)  15  15  17 (Unit :  persons) |  Job Creation Rate | (Unit :  persons)   2008  2009  2010 No. of workers  6,756  7,757  8,356 Job creation rate  10%  15%  8% People constitute the true competitiveness of any company, which is why Hyundai Steel invests in the  potential of its employees. We offer equal opportunities to all employees so they can realize their full  potential, offering fair and reasonable compensation for excellent performance results. The three aims of  human resources development at Hyundai Steel are to internalize core values, foster future leaders, and  establish a performance-oriented human resource development system. 3 HRD Directions  Internalizing core values   Promoting inter-departmental communication   Establishing a Great Workplace (GWP) CULTURE Realizing a  communicative and  cooperative corporate  culture  Defining the roles and responsibilities of team  managers   Promoting self-directed learning   Fostering experts in their respective areas PEOPLE  Fostering performance- oriented future leaders  of the steel industry  Creating an effective job training system   Reorganizing educational programs   Building an educational infrastructure SYSTEM Establishing a  framework for long- term human resource  development HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 58. 59 Fostering future leaders who are always willing to change and innovate We systematically  develop human  resources based on  competence-building  training systems  and human resource  development  planning.

Designed to address basic competencies, leadership, and expertise, the educational system  does not discriminate based on job position or job duties. We foster future leaders of the steel industry  through this educational system. Hyundai Steel has reopened its team motivation and cultural exchange programs. We have also launched  new courses that include team seminars to promote communication, and they have increased the number  of educational opportunities open to employees. Leadership Program for Team Managers Hyundai Steel provides leadership training to team managers. The two-day course includes extensive  debates and special lectures on the roles and responsibilities of team managers. Held in March 2010, the  2010 team manager leadership course had five aspects to it, including discussions on future corporate  strategies, Great Workplace initiatives, talks on core values, and special lectures by celebrities.   2008  2009  2010 Total Training Hours  536,009  323,581  432,898 Total Training Expenses (KRW million)  4,957  2,340  5,699 Internalizing Core Values Hyundai Steel gives training sessions to employees to internalize core values of the company as behav- ioral guidelines, which also helps reinforce solidarity among workers. The course is designed to help em- ployees understand and practice the companys core values in their jobs. Cultural Exchanges Hyundai Steel has run a cultural exchange program since 2006, providing employees with the opportunity  to experience foreign cultures and cultivate a global mindset. A total of 74 people in 21 groups have had  the chance to travel to Europe, the United States, and other countries. In 2010, there was little change to  the program. For example, participants are still required to accomplish goals during their trips. The goals  are in line with the companys five core values. The purpose of the trip is to learn the best practices of one  of the five core values at a foreign country. Upon their return to Korea, employees are required to write  an essay about their experiences overseas and then to post it online. This program turned out to be very  effective in drawing attention to the companys core values and in better understanding them. Hyundai  Steel will continue to develop this program in the future through employee surveys. Team Seminars to Promote Communication Hyundai Steel holds team seminars to enhance employee performance and to mobilize company re- sources. The four-stage seminars aim at developing practical solutions and goals for each team through  debates on the strengths and weaknesses of the team. The first stage begins with a diagnostic survey.  For one week in May 2010, every member of participating teams, including team managers, answered  questionnaires about the five criteria of trust, pride, interest, creativity, and accomplishment. In the sec- ond stage, team mangers reviewed the corporate culture and developed strategies based on the survey  findings. The third stage is a preliminary meeting for teams where they discussed the results of the previ- ous two stages and brainstormed on issues that required improvement. At the fourth stage, all teams got  together to analyze the resolutions of the previous stages and set their own goals. This provides valu- able opportunities for teams to collaborate and communicate, while clearly diagnosing their respective  strengths and weaknesses.

Based on these results, the company determines  the employees annual salary, ensuring fair compensation for their work. In addition, we keep the evalua- tion criteria and judgment system up to date with the changing business environment. The latest update  was in 2001 when we adopted a new capability evaluation scheme. For the evaluation of lower-level  employees, we have a multi-layered evaluation scheme, where team managers and teammates evaluate  each others performance, helping ensure fair and objective evaluations. As with the team-based perfor- mance evaluations, we use Key Performance Indicators (KPI) as the prime indicator for teams to fine-tune  their goals and strategies in line with corporate management policies and goals. Hyundai Steel puts safety and enjoyable workplaces at the top of our priority list with respect to employee  welfare policy. In line with this, we have in place safety and health guidelines which stipulate how the  health and safety of employees are protected and looked after in the course of their daily job duties. Hyun- dai Steel employees, as well as employees of suppliers and business partners, are obliged to abide by the  guidelines. We also offer regular seminars and campaigns on safety to raise employee awareness on the  issue. Industrial Safety & Health Committee Hyundai Steel operates an Industrial Safety & Health Committee consisting of 20 members, 10 from labor  and 10 from management, at each of its steel plants. The committees hold quarterly meetings to deliber- ate annual safety and health plans, review and keep track of initiatives and safety and health facility man- agement, and discuss safety education and accident prevention activities. Monthly Safety Meetings Each steel plant holds monthly meetings to check on safety issues and track improvements that need  to be made at each particular work site. Every plant also sets accident-free target periods and provides  rewards to departments depending on their accomplishments. In addition, Hyundai Steel holds council  meetings with partners to ensure collaboration on safety control at worksites by raising safety awareness  among employees and employees of business partner companies. Safety Rallies and Related Safety Campaigns Hyundai Steel holds regular meetings at each steel plant to share information and experiences and to  develop ideas to prevent accidents. Safety rallies and various other safety campaigns remind employees  about the safety mindset they need to remember every day they enter their work site. Furthermore, we  provide regular training to safety and health managers and supervisors. Employees working at produc- tion lines are subject to quarterly safety training sessions to ensure safe and accident-free workplaces. Health Management Hyundai Steel is committed to a safe and healthy workplace for all its employees. Each plant operates an  infirmary and fitness room. In addition, the company subsidizes various health expenses, provides regu- lar health check-ups, and provides subsidies for medical expenses. The Facility Team at Incheon Works reached a monumental 4,000 days of accident-free work on June 17, 2010, an unprecedented event  by any subsidiary of the Hyundai Motor Group. By November 8, 2011, the team will have surpassed the industry standard for accident- free work hours 19 times over. This remarkable achievement can be attributed to the concerted efforts of all team members who share  common goals through regular training and after-work rallies. The team also keeps all working conditions as clean as possible. With this  accomplishment, the Facility Team has set the bar at new highs for other plants, improved work efficiency, and raised company-wide  safety awareness. Back to Basics: Safety Comes First Hyundai Steels Pohang Works holds a contest every May whereby family members of employees are asked to write letters asking to  keep the workplace safe in an effort to instill safety awareness among employees. To date, we have chosen 32 winners, and when Po- hang Works published a compilation of winning letters from the 2009 contest, it brought yet more attention to employee safety. Safe Work Places Equal Happy Families Safety Training Center Hyundai Steel has safety training centers at its Incheon, Pohang and Dangjin Works to more effectively  educate employees on safety issues. Equipped with diverse safety devices and accident simulation pro- grams, the centers are accessible to both our employees and outside visitors. We continue to repair and  upgrade the facilities for the efficient operation of training programs and to ensure accident-free work- places. Performances  are fairly evaluated  and compensated. We are dedicated  to industrial safety  management and  operate training  programs and  campaigns with  employees to increase  knowledge about safety  awareness. What do you do to ensure the safety and health of employees at  workplaces? Accident-free declaration ceremony Incheon Works Facility Teams accident-free  records Compilation of letters  As the business environment grows more complex, Hyundai Steel sees opportunities – and not  crises – in its partnership with stakeholders. From our raw material suppliers to customers and  investors, the growth of our stakeholders provides the foundation for the profitable growth of  Hyundai Steel.  Firmly dedicated to the development of the steel industry, we will continue to work tirelessly for  mutual growth with our stakeholders as we strive to create new growth engines. #02           Growing  with Our Stakeholders Labor-Management Council Each plant runs a Labor-Management Council that consists of 20 people, 10 representatives from labor  and 10 from management. The councils convene quarterly meetings to discuss ways for mutually ben- eficial cooperation. In 2010, councils at all three plants held four meetings to discuss improvements that  needed to be made to working conditions. Labor Union As of the end of December 2010, the number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements  stood at 5,742, or 68.7% of Hyundai Steels 8,356 employees. GWP Hyundai Steel initiated a Great Workplace (GWP) campaign in 2007 to build a corporate culture filled with  trust, pride and interest, which has since enhanced the companys business performance. We operate  GWP initiatives at each plant and award one GWP champion at each division, with one GWP agent repre- senting each team. In 2010, the three GWP goals were the same as in 2009: raising employee morale, im- proving the work process, and promoting a fun workplace. In consideration of the specific needs of each  division, more action plans were added, such as encouraging self-development, improving work habits  and processes, and promoting bottom-up communication. SMART Board In 2010, Hyundai Steel launched a SMART Board program, which stands for Self-determining, Motivated,  Active, Revolutionary and Together. The SMART Board is intended for the 42 people who represent lower- level employees, from clerks to managers, at Incheon, Pohang and Dangjin Works, as well as the Seoul of- fice. These members work to develop innovative ideas and promote internal communication, developing  and promoting future corporate plans at company-wide meetings and division level meetings. In the past  they have suggested new ideas for enhancing customer satisfaction and win-win cooperation, both of  which were reflected when Hyundai Steel developed its new 2020 Vision and Strategies. |  GWP procedures | 2008 Improving the work process 2009 Boosting employee morale 2010 Boosting employee morale 2007 Promoting communication GWP Roadmap  Employee Communication HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 64. 65 SOCIAL VALUE The Machinery Team at Pohang Works held a GWP event in the run-up to Teachers Day.  Under the belief that great mentors also make great teachers, lower-level employees deliv- ered thank-you letters and small flowerpots to their more senior staff members. They also  presented carnations to their superiors on Teachers Day in 2009. The Machinery Team was  selected the best GWP team for the third consecutive year and spent their reward money on buying an LCD TV and then donating it to a  local charity. The team successfully made full use of the companys various GWP programs to improve their work process and efficiency.  The team also won the top prize at a nationwide contest in 2009. Mentors Make Great Teachers: Pohang Machinery Team Holds GWP Event  Hyundai Steel considers the growth of its stakeholders growth for itself. As such, we promote mutual  growth based on fair and transparent partnerships. In June 2006, we established a dedicated team for a  company-wide integrated approach to win-win cooperation with suppliers. We invited stakeholders to  win-win cooperation forums with customers, pledged to carry out win-win cooperation with suppliers,  and held regular meetings with suppliers to review related strategies and best practices. We also offer  financial aid to our suppliers through such programs as the Green Bridge Loan and by paying steel scrap  suppliers earlier than before.  Customer Satisfaction Hyundai Steel trains its sales force on how to build customer satisfaction capabilities in order to provide  specially tailored customer service. We have also expanded our technology sales network, developed  customer-oriented steel products and enhanced the quality of our products in a bid to increase products  suited to our specific customer needs. We will stay in close communication with our customers to cre- ate opportunities for mutual growth, while proactively supporting our value creation for them with our  reinforced technology marketing. We will also collaborate with client companies as we advance into new  markets in search of lucrative new business opportunities. HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 66. 67 SOCIAL VALUE Communication with Customers Customer Satisfaction Survey Hyundai Steel issues annual customer satisfaction surveys to get customer opinions on our product de- velopment and the work process. We carry out in-depth interviews with client companies by email or face- to-face on 11 criteria, including product quality, supply volume, response to orders, and claim processing.  The latest results from 2010 indicate that our technician services, prices, and claim processing continue  to improve.

Blast furnace products are all high-quality steel products that include things such  as steel sheets for automobiles and Steel Plate. As a result, customers tend to be very demanding about the quality of these products  and will not buy them from an unverified blast furnace. The manufacturer should also have extensive experience and know-how about  the optimal mixture of cokes and iron ores that come from different mines around the world, which is why it is very difficult to penetrate  any market in the early stages of a blast furnaces operations. Nevertheless, we were able to generate an operating profit from our first  blast furnace through years of extensive preparation. In fact, since the start of construction on the first blast furnace in 2007, we dis- patched 150 employees to ThyssenKrupp, a leading global steelmaker, for a two-year course that included on-site training on the main  processes of integrated steel mills. In 2008, we invited experienced engineers and technicians from Japan, Germany, Austria, and the  US to provide technical advice to employees at our in-house training center. We also invited 700 supervisors from our facility suppliers  for on-site support at each stage of the building of the blast furnace as well as during its operation. Due to all these efforts, our first blast  furnace unit has become a stable source of income ahead of schedule. In addition, this success with our first blast furnace was the result  of our advanced R&D efforts to swiftly respond to customer needs with respect to product quality. Hyundai Steel completed work on its  Technology R&D Center in 2007. Since then, the center has been involved in advanced R&D with the integrated steel mill processes and  acquired the essential factors to raise the quality of Steel Plate and steel sheets for automobiles. Hyundai Steels heavy plates acquired  the necessary classification certification from the Korean Register of Shipping as soon as they rolled out from the blast furnace in April.  The first heavy plates were supplied to the worlds top shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, and to the Vietnamese state-run ship- builder Vinashin. Advanced R&D and Strict Quality Control  Financial Aid Hyundai Steel runs its Green Bridge Loan program in alliance with the Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK). The  program offers loan guarantees up to 80% of raw material purchase prices to our suppliers of eco-friendly  facilities or those who lack guarantees. In 2010, we provided substantial loan support to partners through  the Green Bridge Loan and expanded the scope of beneficiaries from only facility suppliers to construction  and procurement subcontractors. The Green Bridge Loan program has earned an excellent reputation for  its contribution to Green Growth and win-win cooperation.   Green Bridge Loan: loan support worth KRW 11.7 billion in alliance with IBK to facility suppliers for raw material  purchases and outsourcing expenses    Financial aid worth KRW 9.0 billion to suppliers for land purchases and capital expenditures    Quality guarantee program ensured cost recovery and no-check warehousing, which shortens unloading times    Monitoring of steel scrap yards allowed preferred pricing for the volume of delivery after warehousing at the yard    Plans to shorten term of payment bills from 85 days to 60 days, effective July 2011, to support stable purchases  and hedging financial risks for steel scrap suppliers (mutual growth agreement between steelmakers and steel  scrap suppliers on November 4, 2010)    Agreement with eight commercial banks on loans dealing with accounts receivable for financial aid to suppliers  (balance stood at KRW 1,050 billion as of the end of December 2010) Technology R&D Support and Protection Whenever we introduce new technology, we hold technology exchange forums to share newfound knowl- edge with our partners. Also, seminars and on-site training sessions help them learn of these new tech- nologies and save on R&D expenses.

The two groups have maintained a close relationship through regular gatherings for a significant amount of time, while playing soccer  together since 2008. Hyundai Steel agreed to the soccer games during work hours as we knew the positive influence this would have on  closer ties and closer communication with business partners. Hyundai Steel builds mutual trust with partners under the shared notion  that Together we can do it! Together We Can Do It! Communication Hyundai Steel has declared its determination to win-win cooperation with partners with our win-win coop- eration agreement and reinforced communication with partners to listen to their opinions and concerns.  We also hold regular conferences to listen to the thoughts of partners and to share information on raw  material prices and market developments. We take turns and move among different work sites, holding  conferences with steel scrap suppliers, facility suppliers, and construction subcontractors in turn.    Training & Educational Support We provide information on security and safety training to business partners at our work sites to raise their  awareness concerning information on security and safe workplaces.  Safety training : visits and on-site training at safety training centers   Information security education : ensuring people know the importance of information security   Technical training : new technologies and policy changes   Business support training : training to reinforce competitiveness through win-win management system 2011 Plan In line with the governments Large-SME Win-Win Cooperation initiative, which was announced in Sep- tember 2010, Hyundai Steel held an agreement signing ceremony as a member of the Hyundai Motor  Group, a first in the industry, on win-win cooperation and fair transactions in March 2011.

This  criteria includes business ethics practices to ensure transparency of supplier management practices. We  select and reward suppliers of good standing once a year and support them with competence-building  through educational support programs. In 2010, we evaluated 223 procurement partners and 53 raw ma- terials suppliers. Outsourcers are evaluated on a biannual basis for their management capacity, perfor- mance capability, and safety control practices, as well as their independent project performance. We have also completed an online procurement system, allowing suppliers real-time access to our pro- curement information.

Mutual Growth Agreement Ceremony Declaration of Mutual Growth and Fair Trade Agreement  It is our responsibility to our children to protect the environment. We also help invigorate local  economies through our investments in business operations, which help create jobs. As a responsible  corporate citizen, Hyundai Steel promotes a wide range of social contribution activities in the fields of  social welfare, arts and culture, education, and the environment. #03    In Harmony  with Communities SOCIAL VALUE House Remodeling for Hope Since 2009, Hyundai Steel has run House Remodeling for Hope, which improves housing conditions for  low-income people who live in the vicinity of our work sites. In 2009, we remodeled 32 farm houses in  Dangjin. Then, in 2010, we remodeled 40 houses around Incheon and 80 houses in Pohang. We have also  signed agreements with city officials in Pohang and Incheon to establish a steering committee which will  collaborate with local authorities on House Remodeling for Hope, even from the selection of beneficiaries.  With the help of architects, Hyundai Steel employees volunteer their time alongside other volunteers  from universities and local communities to carry out this work. In 2011, we began expanding the project  and came up with Home Repair for Better Energy Efficiency, a way to reduce CO2 emissions through the  enhancement of home energy efficiency. Green Guardians Under the motto Children and the environment are our future, Hyundai Steel operates several environ- mental protection programs, including camps, quiz contests and special classes for elementary students  who go to school in communities around our work sites. We develop a full-year curriculum on the environ- ment for children to learn from while also offering them the chance to take part in programs firsthand. In  2010, we launched our Green Guardians program at elementary schools located around our work sites with  the belief that instilling green habits into the next generation will drive long-term initiatives concerning  environmental protection. Happy Yes As part of our corporate social responsibility to local communities, we have set up a volunteer corps for  university students called Happy Yes. This program encourages university students to help the under- privileged. In 2009, we recruited 100 university students from across the country to initiate the program as  the first class. The second class was chosen in June 2010 and they participated in the House Remodeling  for Hope program, as well as many other volunteer activities, during the summer and winter volunteer  camps, not to mention the matching grant campaign carried out for eight months until February 2011. HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 72. 73 We run programs  like Home Repair for  Hope, Green Guards,  and Happy Yes for local  communities. What kind of social contribution activities does Hyundai Steel take  part in? Green Guardians Happy Yes  HYUNDAI STEEL  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 74. 75 SOCIAL VALUE Employees Participation in Matching Grant Program Volunteer Activities Hyundai Steel is proud of its matching grant program, which is different from other companies as we do  not deduct anything from an employees paycheck. Instead, we encourage voluntary donations from em- ployees. Since 2008, employees have been able to donate up to KRW 20,000 and be guaranteed that their  donation will be matched by Hyundai Steel. The total amount raised is then spent on the companys social  contribution programs at the end of the year. In 2010, 787 employees agreed to make donations, raising a  total of KRW 192,959,000, up KRW 21,675,000 from 2009. To ensure that social contribution activities are systematic and consistent, training a volunteer corps is  as essential as collaborating with local communities. As a result, Hyundai Steel has trained team leaders  for our volunteer corps on a yearly basis since 2006. One team leader is chosen from every department at  Hyundai Steel and they are responsible for their respective teams volunteer activities. Although the par- ticipation rate of employees who volunteered in 2010 dropped by 3% from 2009, the participants average  volunteer hours for the year increased by three hours, from 33 hours per person in 2009 to 36 hours per  person in 2010.   2008  2009  2010 Participation rate  80%  86%  83% Time spent volunteering  83,886 hours  85,039 hours  99,496 hours   2008  2009  2010 No. of participants  2,061 persons  2,590 persons  3,108 persons Participation rate  31%  33%  37% Fund amount  KRW 141,606,000  KRW 171,284,000  KRW 192,959,000 Matching Grant Fund Execution   2008  2009  2010 Selected programs  Provision of throw-type fire extinguishers  Home Repair for Hope  Home Repair for Hope Beneficiaries  184 welfare institutes for disabilities  32 low-income families in Dangjin  80 low-income families in Incheon and Pohang Funding size   KRW219,216,000  KRW 283,212,000  KRW 342,568,000  (employee donation + company contribution)    We are actively  involved in campaigns  to revive traditional  markets.

What kind of social contribution activities does Hyundai Steel take part in? Traditional Market Day Agreement to help revitalize traditional markets Hyundai Steel is also involved in a campaign to revitalize traditional markets. We have signed food supply  agreements and encourage employees to shop for groceries at traditional markets. In 2010, we purchased  goods worth KRW 280 million at traditional markets to donate to local charities. In addition, many of our  employees participate in a Traditional Market Day campaign twice a year to support shopping at nearby  traditional markets. Incheon  Mar. 2009     Entered into food supply agreement with nearby Hyundai Traditional Market and      purchased groceries worth KRW 300 million for the year.

Year-End Volunteer Weeks Hyundai Steel designates every December as Social Contribution Month, encouraging employees to  volunteer and help the underprivileged in local communities. In 2010, some of our employees dressed  up as Santa Claus and visited local charities to deliver 1,630 gifts to needy children, elderly citizens, and  multicultural families. We also delivered heating oil to 13 charities and visited local military troops, police  stations, and fire stations to show them our support.  Culture, Art and Sports Hyundai Steel is committed to promoting cultural and artistic activities in local communities. We are  actively engaged in a number of local festivals and events where we work as volunteers and take part in  such events as the Incheon Korean Traditional Music Festival, the Pohang Hope Concert, and the Dangjin  Tug of War. Sports Teams (Womens Soccer & Mens Archery) Hyundai Steel is proud to have formed the Red Angels, Koreas first company-run womens soccer club, in  December 1993. Dedicated to the development of womens soccer in Korea, Hyundai Steel owns a stadi- um which its womens team uses to play in and train. Founded in February 1993, the Hyundai Steel Mens  Archery Team has been at the forefront of the development of archery in Korea. A highly competitive group  of archers, the team has seen many remarkable performances in a number of domestic and international  competitions. Childrens Soccer Academy Hyundai Steel runs a soccer academy for elementary school students in Incheon, using the same soccer  stadium which the companys womens soccer team plays at.

[Inclusivity]: Is Hyundai Steels strategy-setting and engagement process for stakeholder participation adequate? The Assurance Provider noted the emphasis placed by the Company on stakeholder communications in the implementa- tion of its sustainability management program. Hyundai Steel has put in place a regular channel of communication with its  respective stakeholders i.e. shareholders, investors, customers, suppliers, management and staff, and the local commu- nity. It is the Assurance Providers view that Hyundai Steel has been using these channels to better identify issues requiring  a greater focused effort, while engaging stakeholders in the development and implementation of a strategic and respon- sible response to achieve sustainability management. The following points were found to be particularly commendable.    Continuous use of stakeholder surveys, with an increasingly extended scope to be more inclusive of multiple stakeholders.    Efforts to actively reflect stakeholder views in identifying priority issues for sustainability management.    Efforts to reflect customer views on product development and quality improvement. Going forward, the Assurance Provider suggests providing a fuller account of the process for managing customer view- points at the level of the top management and other decision-making processes. [Materiality]: Does the Report contain information of the highest material importance to Hyundai Steel stakeholders? It is the Assurance Providers view that the Report covers issues of material importance to the stakeholders of Hyundai  Steel. We verified that the Company has identified issues material to Hyundai Steels internal and external stakehold- ers through a refined process of materiality test, consistent with the Assurance Provider s recommendations regarding  last years Report on expanding the scope of its surveys. The following points were found to be particularly commend- able.   The Report presents issues of material importance specific to different stakeholders; and   Presents performance outcomes centering on material issues in a question and answer reporting format. Going forward, the Assurance Provider suggests providing additional information on any emergent or newly identified  issues, while comparing the relative materiality of the reported issues, and providing trend data tracking how the as- sessed materiality of particular issues changed by reporting period. [Responsiveness]: Does the Report provide an adequate response to stakeholder demands and areas of interest? It is the Assurance Providers view that Hyundai Steel has been working to be responsive to stakeholder demands.  Recognizing the importance of effective communication with all stakeholders, the Company has employed various  channels of communication to collect their views while also implementing various programs designed to respond to  stakeholder requirements and high-interest issues. The following points were found to be particularly commendable.   The Report provides information on the companys organization that is in charge of responding to key issues; and   Accounts for outcomes regarding issues of high-interest for stakeholders such as new product development, responding  to climate change, fairness and transparency in business partner selection etc. Going forward, the Assurance Provider suggests providing stronger coverage on actual stakeholder communication  results on key material issues as well as presenting how it has processed and responded to stakeholder requirements. [GRI Application Levels] The Assurance Provider found the Report to apply to GRI G3 Reporting Framework at the level of A+. The GRI Applica- tion Level is assessed by the following table. [BEST Fulfillment Levels] The Assurance Provider found the Report to fulfill 96.3% of the reporting requirements necessary to qualify for a Level  5 Report (from among Level 1 ~ 5) Recommendations Relative to the prior year, the Assurance Provider found HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2011, Hyundai Steels  fourth Report, commendable on the following counts.

Based on the findings of this assurance report as well as the recommendation letter that was submitted separately, the  Assurance Provider recommends that Hyundai Steel establish a more systematic system for sustainability manage- ment and reporting. Third Party Assurance Report  1 AA1000 AS(Assurance Standard)  is a sustainability reporting standard  developed by Accountability in its pur- suit to promote overall organizational  performance and accountability by  improving the quality of social and  ethical accounting. As a U. K. based  not-for-profit organization focusing  on corporate social responsibility and  business ethics, Accountability first  developed AA1000AS in 1999 and  amended the standards in 2008 for  application in 2010.  2 BEST Guideline or BEST Sustain- ability Reporting Guideline is a  guideline for the preparation and  assurance of sustainability report- ing and offers five levels of reporting  quality assessment.
