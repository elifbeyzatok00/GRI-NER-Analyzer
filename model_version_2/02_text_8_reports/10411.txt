In this annual report, we review the  initiatives implemented in fiscal 2009, ended March 31, 2010, and explain our management policies for fiscal  2010. Principal Initiatives in Fiscal 2009 Having designated fiscal 2009 as the year for establishing the  next foundation for future growth, while continuing to strengthen  business consistent with our philosophy of Follow the Basics,  we have been implementing initiatives to control expenses, credit  costs and risk-adjusted assets in the core operation of our group  companies. Additionally, to achieve growth over the medium and  long term, we continued to focus on two strategic initiatives: real- izing a solid financial base as a global player and strengthening  targeted growth business areas.   Specifically, at SMBC we reinforced our efforts to reduce  expenses during fiscal 2009, and kept the overhead ratio to  below 50%. We also took measures to reduce credit costs mainly  through measures tailored to the business circumstances of our  corporate borrowers. SMFG took steps to strengthen its capital  base during fiscal 2009, principally through a common equity  offering totaling 861.0 billion completed in July 2009, followed  by another offering totaling 973.0 billion completed in February  2010. Consequently, our consolidated Tier I ratio at the end of  March 2010 was 11.15%, an increase of 2.93% compared with  the end of March 2009. In addition, in October 2009 we laid the  foundation for the next stage of strong growth by consolidating  Nikko Cordial Securities into the Group as a wholly-owned subsid- iary of SMBC.   As a result of these initiatives, consolidated ordinary profit  for fiscal 2009 was 558.7 billion, a year-on-year increase of  513.4 billion, while consolidated net income also increased, by  645.0 billion year on year, to 271.5 billion. In view of the public  nature of our business, while enhancing the Groups capital to  maintain a sound financial position, we have set a fundamental  policy of increasing dividends stably and continuously through  sustainable growth in enterprise value and achieving a dividend  payout ratio of over 20% on a consolidated net income basis. As  SMFG recorded consolidated net income in fiscal 2009 versus  consolidated net loss of the previous fiscal year and the amount  was higher than the forecast announced in November 2009, we  have decided to increase the annual dividend for common shares  by 10 to 100 per share.   Regarding our medium-term management plan, or LEAD  THE VALUE plan that ended in March 2010, the macroeco- nomic reality has diverged substantially from the plans original  assumptions, particularly since fiscal 2008, amid increasingly  uncertain business environment in domestic and overseas mar- kets. Accordingly, we were unable to attain the originally targeted  level of earnings for fiscal 2009. We, however, have been making  steady progress in realizing the strategic initiatives â€“ strengthen- ing targeted growth business areas, and fortifying platforms to  support sustainable growth. Management Policies in Fiscal 2010 The business environment surrounding financial institutions is  changing greatly amid the global discussion about financial regu- latory and supervisory reform to prevent another financial crisis.  Under these circumstances, we have designated our manage- ment policies for fiscal 2010 as 1) forward looking - transforming  our business model to grow steadily under a new regulatory and  competitive environment and 2) emphasizing return on risks and  costs, in order to improve asset quality and thoroughly control  expenses and credit costs, so as to secure a resilient capital  base and reinforce our business portfolio to achieve sustainable  growth. (1) Securing a resilient capital base During fiscal 2009 we took steps to establish a resilient capital  base through the issuance of new shares, among other measures.  Moving forward, our focus will shift to steps such as reducing  stock price fluctuation risks associated with our stockholdings,  and building up retained earnings by reinforcing a business port- folio to achieve sustainable growth. Through these measures, we  aim to maintain over around 10% of consolidated Tier I ratio.    Meanwhile, as a result of the common equity offerings exe- cuted during fiscal 2009, the number of SMFGs ordinary shares  issued reached approximately 1.4 billion shares, or more than  90% of the authorized ordinary shares of 1.5 billion stipulated  in SMFGs Articles of Incorporation. We believe that securing  strategic flexibility, which will enable us to further strengthen  our targeted growth business areas, is essential to enhancing  SMFGs medium- to long-term enterprise value. For this reason,  Teisuke Kitayama President Sumitomo Mitsui  Financial Group, Inc.  SMFG 2010 3 at the ordinary general shareholders meeting held in June 2010,  we proposed and received approval to increase the number of  authorized ordinary shares to 3.0 billion. (2)  Reinforcing our business portfolio to  achieve sustainable growth We will focus on targeted growth business areas to pursue profit- ability, as well as review current businesses to fortify the bottom- line profit. At the same time, we will further enhance customer  responsiveness by leveraging advisory functions and increase  productivity by improving business processes.   Fortify bottom-line profit by reviewing current  businesses Facilitating financing to customers in an appropriate and proac- tive manner is one of our management priorities.   SMBC has always worked hard on delivering optimal products  and services to customers based on a thorough understanding of  their needs and issues. Further, pursuant to the Act concerning  Temporary Measures to Facilitate Financing for SMEs, etc., which  took effect in December 2009, we are enhancing our capability to  meet their needs, including establishing consulting desks for  SMEs and retail customers to address their financing concerns.   In addition to meeting customers financing needs, we will  continue to control and reduce credit costs and expenses and  rebalance our asset portfolio for more growth and profitability  in order to improve the risk-return profile and fortify bottom-line  profit.   The economic situation in Europe remains uncertain, but our  credit exposure in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain as  of March 31, 2010 totaled approximately 300 billion and was  mainly to large corporations and project-finance related. In the  case of Greece, where the economic situation is a particularly  serious cause for concern, the amount of exposure is not so large  and is mostly secured by collateral. We therefore believe that the  associated risks from this source are limited.   Pursue profitability by focusing on targeted  growth business areas Nikko Cordial Securities Nikko Cordial Securities in March 2010 drew up a three-year  medium-term management plan, up to the end of fiscal 2012,  with a prospect of becoming a No. 1 general securities company  in Japan, which is excellent both in quality and in quantity and  globally competitive. Maintaining a low-cost operation using  IT, Nikko Cordial Securities aims for sustainable expansion of  its businesses centered on the retail business, and creation of  new businesses centered on the wholesale business. It has  also adopted an active stance on employment of personnel and  enhancement of personnel development programs, while increas- ing system investment and improving the organizational structure  of the head office in response to the full-line business operation. Overseas operations, centered on Asia Regarding SMFGs operations in the Asia-Pacific region, in May  2010 we established the Financial Products Marketing Dept.,  which has taken charge of certain functions hitherto performed  by the representative offices of individual departments of SMBCs  Investment Banking Unit. This is part of our efforts to offer fast  and appropriate solutions to customers whose financial needs  are becoming more diversified and sophisticated. Regarding  our operations in China, in April 2009 we established Sumitomo  Mitsui Banking Corporation (China) Limited to facilitate even more  closely tailored individual solutions for customers who operate  globally. With effect from April 2010, the responsibility for planning  and management of business with Japanese corporate custom- ers was transferred from the Planning Dept., International Banking  Unit, to the Planning Dept., Corporate Banking Unit & Middle  Market Banking Unit. This change allows us to offer seamless  services both inside and outside Japan. In addition, in June 2010,  we received permission to establish a subsidiary in Malaysia, and  preparation is currently underway for its establishment in the first  half of 2011. As well as expanding our network of business base  in this way, we have also formed alliances with leading banks  in Asia to enable us to offer even higher value-added services.  These banks include Kookmin Bank in Korea, First Commercial  Bank in Taiwan, Eximbank in Vietnam, The Bank of East Asia in  Hong Kong, Bank Central Asia in Indonesia, and Kotak Mahindra  Bank in India.   In European and American markets, we will continue to bol- ster our competitive-edge products, including project finance.  Through a business alliance with a South African subsidiary of the  major British financial institution Barclays PLC, we are strengthen- ing our ability to provide services to Japanese companies operat- ing in South Africa. Masayuki Oku President Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation  SMFG 2010 4   We also take into account the discussions being held on the  introduction of liquidity standards, and are taking steps to ensure  more stable funding and investment in foreign currencies. Payment & settlement services, and Consumer finance In the credit card business, we have established a two-company  system within the Group, centered on Sumitomo Mitsui Card and  Cedyna. Our aim is to become the number one credit card busi- ness entity in Japan, and we will continue to pursue economies  of scale while leveraging the strengths of each company to maxi- mize top-line synergy.    Cedyna is now implementing initiatives for investment in  new businesses and system development to increase enterprise  value and speed up cost restructuring. To accelerate such initia- tives, and to further clarify the positioning of Cedyna as one of  the Groups core business entities in the credit card business  and enhance Cedynas capital base, the intermediate holding  company SMFG Card & Credit acquired new shares issued by  Cedyna through a third-party allotment in May 2010.    In the consumer finance business, our goal is to create an  even better foundation for meeting the sound financing needs of  individual consumers, capitalizing on strategic alliances of Group  companies to capture market share and thereby become more  efficient. As part of this strategy, ORIX Credit Corporation became  a consolidated subsidiary of SMBC in July 2009. In March 2010  we reviewed the consumer finance business model, which we  call cascade strategy, jointly operated by SMBC, Promise and  At-Loan, and the three companies reached a basic agreement on  the absorption-type merger between Promise and At-Loan with  Promise as the surviving company. Through these moves, we aim  to further raise our profile in Japans evolving consumer finance  market and target an even broader array of customer needs.   Further enhance customer responsiveness by  leveraging advisory functions Solution providing for corporations, investment banking and  trust businesses We remain strongly committed to delivering to our corporate  clients high-quality solutions that precisely target a broad range  of management issues. Specifically, SMBC has three special- ized departments, Corporate Advisory Division, Private Advisory  Department and Global Advisory Department, that operate cross- sectionally across business segments â€” consumer, corporate  and overseas. This structure facilitates the pooling among these  departments of V-KIP â€” value, knowledge, information and  profits. As a result, we can deliver more tailored support to corpo- rate clients and upgrade our ability to provide solutions. Sumitomo  Mitsui Finance and Leasing is engaged in aircraft operating lease  business, one of the strategic joint businesses in leasing with  Sumitomo Corporation, as well as a variety of other leasing ser- vices that offer financial and sales solutions for both users and  suppliers. In addition, Japan Research Institute offers a lineup of  high value-added services by continuously strengthening services  that range from consulting for managerial innovation and IT utiliza- tion to the planning and creation of strategic IT systems. Financial consulting for individuals Our aim is to harness the total capabilities of the Group to estab- lish SMBC as the leading bank in the field of full-line personal  financial services for individuals. To this end, we are working to  realize even higher levels of customer convenience, principally  Basel Committee  Consultative proposal  to strengthen the resilience  of the banking sector Reorganization in  global financial  industry /  Rebuilding  business model Maintain over  around 10% of  consolidated  Tier I ratio Target around  10% of  consolidated ROE in the  medium term New financial regime Our strategy Securing a  resilient capital base Reinforcing business  portfolio to achieve  sustainable growth Benchmark targets  Management policy under the new financial regime  SMFG 2010 5 by reinforcing our online financial services. We also continue to  strive to realize total consulting services which offers customers  a wide range of one-stop financial services to meet diversifying  financial needs of individual customers. For example, in August  2009, all branches of SMBC started selling level-premium insur- ances, and after making Nikko Cordial Securities SMBCs wholly- owned subsidiary in October 2009, through cooperation with  Nikko Cordial Securities, we have commenced a range of new  services including the sale of jointly developed investment trusts,  joint seminars and financial instruments intermediary service for  individuals. In May 2010 we also began handling single-premium  type variable permanent life insurances jointly developed with  Nikko Cordial Securities.   In June 2010 SMBC, Nikko Cordial Securities, and Barclays  PLC reached an agreement to commence joint operation in  private banking in Japan. Individual customers of SMBC will  be introduced to SMBC Barclays Wealth Division, which has  been set up within Nikko Cordial Securities. The Division will offer  investment solutions making use of unique strengths and the  know-how of Barclays Wealth, which is a leading global wealth  manager and a division of Barclays.   We are pursuing still closer collaboration between SMFGs  banking and securities businesses in the field of financial services  for individuals, in order to offer a wider lineup of products and  services. For this purpose, in addition to the start of the finan- cial instruments intermediary service for individuals by SMBC  and Nikko Cordial Securities, by the end of January 2011 Nikko  Cordial Securities will take over the services for individuals cur- rently being offered by SMBC Friend Securities in collaboration  with SMBC. Meanwhile, with the goal of increasing the number  of customers using the services of SMBC Friend Securities, we  are expanding the companys product lineup and diversifying  its information dissemination channels by holding investment  seminars, among other measures.   Further increase productivity by improving  business processes We aim to maintain SMBCs non-consolidated overhead ratio at  below 50%. We will do this by prioritizing expenses based on  size, timing, and effectiveness and adopt a stronger focus on our  targeted growth business areas in the allocation of the expenses  budget, while taking measures to raise operational efficiency.   These measures will be implemented in tandem with our  constant efforts to thoroughly comply with laws and regulations  both within and outside Japan and create a strong compliance  system. Specifically, SMBC aims to ensure consumer protection  by enhancing its framework for explaining financial products and  services to its customers. SMBC is also taking measures to miti- gate potential conflicts of interest and avoid all transactions with  anti-social forces, and is pressing forward with the reinforcement  of its system for the prevention of money laundering.   With regard to customer satisfaction and the enhancement of  service quality, we intend to create a stronger system for ensur- ing that customers requests are reflected in our management  decisions.   Concerning SMFGs listing on the New York Stock Exchange,  we aim to build a framework that will greatly accelerate our drive  to develop our business as a global player. Expanding and diver- sifying our investor base by securing access to the worlds largest  securities market is a key piece of the framework and, to this  end, we are pursuing further financial transparency and greater  convenience for investors. We are currently making final-stage  preparations for listing on the NYSE within fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2010 Outlook and Policies  Going Forward Outlook for fiscal 2010 We expect consolidated ordinary profit of 690 billion, a year- on-year increase of 131.3 billion and consolidated net income  of 340 billion, a 68.5 billion increase from the previous fiscal  year. This is based mainly on an increase in profit at SMBC and a  steady recovery in earnings of certain subsidiaries and affiliates.  We are planning an annual dividend of 100 per share of common  stock, the same level as the previous fiscal year, and half of the  amount (50 per share) will be paid as an interim dividend. Dedicated to medium- to long-term growth in enterprise value The business environment of financial institutions is changing  radically as regulators discuss the global reform of financial  regulations in order to prevent another financial crisis, but our  basic policy remains unchanged, namely, to become a globally  competitive financial services group with the highest trust by  maximizing our strengths of Spirit of Innovation, Speed and  Solution & Execution. While securing a resilient capital base,  we look forward, anticipate future changes and steadily transform  our business model. Through such means, we aim for sustainable  growth in enterprise value in order to meet the expectations of our  stakeholders. We ask for your support and understanding as we  endeavor to achieve these goals. September 2010 Teisuke Kitayama President Sumitomo Mitsui  Financial Group, Inc.

In investment trusts, SMBC  expanded our lineup of investment  targets to include funds such as  those investing in bonds issued by  emerging countries, while allow- ing customers to select from a  number of currencies including the  Australian dollar and the Brazilian Real for hedging purposes,  and funds primarily focused on the World Bank Green Bonds.  Since October 2009 we have launched funds with customer  access only via the Internet or mobile phones, and as of July  1, 2010 the number of such funds had reached thirty. In these  ways, we are responding to a wide range of customer needs.   In the field of life insurance policies, in August 2009  we expanded our over-the-counter sales of life insurance  products at all our branches in Japan. By offering 20 dif- ferent insurance policies (as of March 31, 2010), including  whole-life, term and medical, we can now meet a still broader  range of customer needs. We have also further expanded our  insurance policy lineup, including offering annuity insurance  for individuals in which the annuity amount is set at a higher- than-normal level for an initial specified period.   In our financial products intermediation business, we  diversified our product lineup by offering yen-denominated  bonds for the first time, as well as subscription of SMBCs  subordinated bonds (yen-denominated) and sale of foreign  bonds.   It is important to support customers after they have  bought our products. As part of this commitment, we take  many measures to keep customers up-to-date with devel- opments â€” for example, holding seminars about fund  performance, issuing monthly and special market reports,  and sending customers statements detailing assets via direct  mailing. Loan Business To enable us to respond to the wide-ranging needs of our custom- ers, we have developed new products, and enhanced services.   In February 2010, following our introduction in December  2008 of an unsecured educational loan, we began offering  loans for car purchases (guaranteed by Promise Co., Ltd.)  and a general-purpose unsecured loan. Customers can  apply for these loans to the Consumer Finance Promotion  Office, every day (except January 1) up to nine in the eve- ning using the automated loan contract machines installed  within SMBC branches, the Internet, or other channels. In  most cases, applicants receive a response on the same day.  Such advantages mean these new loan products offer much  greater convenience than conventional loans.   As a result of these initiatives, more than 3,000 customers  per year have applied for our unsecured educational loans,  the first of this type of product to be  offered.   The Act concerning Temporary  Measures to Facilitate Financing  for  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises, etc. was enforced on  December 4, 2009, with facilitating  financing to housing loan borrowers  as one of the objectives. In line with  this objective, SMBC has set up the  Consumer Facilitating Financing  Dept. within the Planning Dept. of the Consumer Banking Unit.  We have also appointed specialist staff for providing consult- ing and other forms of assistance tailored to the individual  circumstances of customers experiencing difficulties repaying  their housing loans, at all bank branches as well as within the  nine special Loan Support Offices located nationwide.   We will continue working to provide closely tailored sup- port services for such customers, and are working to improve  the speed and precision of these services. Settlement and Consumer Finance Business The iD* credit service, which is based on a strategic alliance  between SMFG and NTT DoCoMo, Inc., continues to grow.  As of March 31, 2010, subscribers to this service and the  terminals for accessing the service located on the premises  of affiliated merchants totaled approximately 14.2 million and  440,000, respectively. *iD is a trademark of NTT DoCoMo, Inc.   The consumer finance business collab- oratively launched in April 2005 by SMBC,  Promise Co., Ltd. and At-Loan Co., Ltd.,  continues to grow also. There were 716 auto- mated contract machines and the balance of  loans made by SMBC and At-Loan together  totaled approximately 423.5 billion, as of  March 31, 2010. Business Overview  SMFG 2010 11 Transaction Channels In fiscal 2009, SMBC opened new branches in 14 locations:  Wakabadai in Tokyo, Hiyoshi and Shonandai in Kanagawa  Prefecture, Chiba New Town in Chiba Prefecture, Tsukuba in  Ibaraki Prefecture, Tenpaku-Ueda, Okazaki, Gokiso, Nonami,  Irinaka, and Kanayama in Aichi Prefecture, and Izumi-Chuo,  Shoji, and Komyoike in Osaka Prefecture.   Also, in the Tokai Region centered on Aichi Prefecture,  in addition to opening conventional staffed offices, we are  installing ATMs at or near stations of the Nagoya municipal  subway system, for increased customer convenience.   For the SMBC Direct online banking service, we are con- stantly adding highly advanced services to meet customer  needs and deliver greater convenience, and reinforcing  security. In October 2009 we began a major expansion of  the scope of our banking services offered via the Internet  and mobile phones. For example, customers with an ATM  card can check the balance in their savings account over the  Internet. This is just one of the steps we have taken to further  enhance the convenience of our online services.   SMBC Direct has come first for seven consecutive years  in the ranking of Internet banking by e-commerce website  rating firm Gomez Consulting Co., Ltd. As of March 31, 2010,  there were approximately 10.12 million registered customers.   We opened a third call center in June 2009, in Fukuoka,  to serve retail customers, along with existing facilities in Tokyo  and Kobe. We also offer telephone-based services for online  users who prefer to discuss important matters with a real per- son. Operating three centers enhances our capacity to offer  telephone consulting on asset management and loans, as  well as other information services, and tailor financial services  to the lifestyle and needs of each customer. Topics l Businesses Operated Jointly with Nikko Cordial  Securities Nikko Cordial Securities became a subsidiary of SMBC  on October 1, 2009, in a move that further enhanced the  ability of all Group companies to offer our customers com- petitive products and services.   A number of joint initiatives have been implemented  since then: three new investment trust products devel- oped jointly by SMBC and Nikko Cordial Securities were  launched on the market, the two companies held joint sem- inars, and also proactively introduced customers to each  other when either one was better suited to deal with their  specific requirements. On April 19, 2010, we expanded our  financial instruments intermediary service for individuals to  include Nikko Cordial Securities as an agent to execute the  actual transactions. The same service operated with SMBC  Friend Securities is scheduled to be integrated into Nikko  Cordial Securities by January 31, 2011.   Further joint activities that combine banking and secu- rities transactions are planned, including Nikko Cordial  Securities conducting banking agency business. Wakabadai Branch Nonami Branch A joint seminar held with Nikko Cordial Securities  SMFG 2010 12   Corporate Banking  Improving Products and Services for Midsized  Companies and SMEs Initiatives to provide easier access to financing SMBC believes that the smooth and efficient supply of funds  to its clients is its main social responsibility as a financial insti- tution. With companies facing growing challenges caused by  the global financial crisis, we are making every effort to facili- tate financing to our corporate clients â€” midsized companies  and SMEs â€” proactively and more tailored to their needs. To  this end, in December 2009, SMBC established the Middle  Market Facilitating Financing Department within the Planning  Department of the Corporate Banking Unit.   We will continue to implement initiatives to identify the  ever-changing needs and issues of our corporate clients and  offer more tailored products and services in order to support  their business growth. Products and services to meet financing needs Amid the economic uncertainty, a broad range of financing  needs is emerging. In order to meet these needs, we are con- stantly expanding our lineup of loans for our corporate clients.  In 2008, SMBC introduced the Certified Company Support  Loan for companies who have received SMBC designated  national/local management-related certification or award; the  Web Report Loan for companies using the Japanese national  tax authorities e-Tax service; and the Asset Value Truck and  Bus Loan which uses commercial vehicles as collateral (loan  features were upgraded in 2009). Environmentally responsible products and services In October 2008, SMBC launched the SMBC Environmental   Assessment Loan/Private Placement Bonds. To be eligible, an  applicant company must undergo an environmental evalua- tion using Japan Research Institutes assessment standards.  Loan terms depend on the evaluation results, which are  disclosed to the applicant company to help improve its envi- ronmental protection measures. As of March 31, 2010, about  30 companies had raised approximately 100 billion in loans  and bonds. SMBC announces these transactions to the public  through SMBC press releases, newspaper advertisements  and other forms of mass media, receiving high marks from our  clients. In January 2010, this loan/bond product won the 2009  Nikkei Superior Products and Services Award for Superiority  from Nikkei Inc., indicating the high regard in which it is held  by Japanese society as a whole.   Another initiative was the Fight Global Warming  Campaign held from May through July 2009 in connection  with SMBC-ECO Loan for companies with environmental  management certifications. During the campaign period,  SMBC used part of the earnings from the SMBC-ECO Loan to  purchase and write off carbon credits equivalent to five tons  of CO2 emissions per borrower, enabling the borrowers to  play a part in combating global warming.   In April 2010, we added companies reporting their energy  consumption to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government under  its initiatives on reducing global warming to the scope of  companies eligible for the SMBC-ECO Loan. In this way, we  are supporting those midsized companies and SMEs that are  taking a proactive approach to environmental issues.   In addition, SMBC extends loans under two programs  operated by the Ministry of the Environment in which the  government pays the interest. One program is for supporting  initiatives aimed at reaching the goals of the Kyoto Protocol,  in which investments in facilities that reduce greenhouse  gas emissions are partly subsidized. The other program is to  support the acceleration of countermeasures against global  warming. The Japanese government has set a high target of  25% reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases, and we  believe this financing mechanism will provide invaluable sup- port for the environmental initiatives of Japanese industries. Information services SMBC has been strengthening its internal systems for busi- ness-matching, resulting in a dramatic increase in the number  of business meetings we have arranged between possible  partners. In particular, in our all-in-one matching program,  which simultaneously matches a large number of corporate  clients with the purchasing departments of large corporations,  we have enhanced our corporate client information database,  and are able to supply information on the purchasing needs  of major corporations to more corporate clients.   We will continue enhancing our ability to provide a wide  spectrum of information to our clients. Reinforcing Services for Globalizing  Corporations An increasing number of our corporate clients are setting  up businesses overseas, and they face a growing need to  address issues such as differences in business practices;  cultures; legal, accounting, and taxation systems, and inter- pretation of such systems; as well as funding.   At SMBC, the Global Advisory Department was estab- lished to specifically help devise solutions for cross-border  issues of globally operating clients. The department works  to provide seamless support for the operations of companies  both inside and outside Japan by straddling the three units  of SMBC that do business with corporate clients â€“ the Middle  Market Banking Unit, the Corporate Banking Unit, and the  International Banking Unit. Based in Tokyo, the department  has staff members at SMBC offices overseas, chiefly in Asia.  With about 200 professionals in the fields of foreign trade  and global business operations, the department maximizes  synergies by integrating issue-solving skills with expertise in  collecting and analyzing information, and by making effective  use of relationships with clients and business partners world- wide. Thanks to this infrastructure, we can devise customized  solutions from a global perspective to serve both companies  in Japan and their overseas subsidiaries.  SMFG 2010 13   We hold overseas business-related seminars with themes  of particular interest to our clients, and distribute the latest  information on overseas markets, enabling companies con- sidering the launch of an overseas business to gain insight  into local conditions, regulations, industry trends, and other  relevant matters. Our services are also useful for companies  with established overseas operations who can count on us  for valuable assistance in areas such as growth strategy and  reorganization. Intensifying Initiatives in the Chinese Market China is a major driver of global economic growth and many  Japanese companies have already set up operations there,  targeting the market that continues to grow. Japanese cor- porations entry into and business development in China is  projected to accelerate in the coming years.   To be able to more effectively meet the needs of such  clients whose business straddles the Japanese and Chinese  markets, at the beginning of fiscal 2010 SMBC appointed a  director to be responsible for overseeing its Chinese subsid- iary Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (China) Limited. It  also transferred responsibility for the planning, promotion, and  management of transactions between the SMBC subsidiary  in China and Japanese corporations from the International  Banking Unit to a domestic banking unit. The aim of this move  was to integrate SMBC services for clients head offices in  Japan and their local subsidiaries in China, facilitating the  smooth transaction of business and enabling us to deliver  more closely tailored services. Intensifying Initiatives in the Public and  Financial Sectors We are working to create solutions for issues of regional  governments, public corporations and financial institutions.  Moreover, to upgrade services for regional clients, we under- take joint initiatives with regional governments and financial  institutions.   In October 2009 SMBC was selected as the primary  financial institution for the Tokyo Metropolitan Governments  Eco Finance Project. In partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui  Finance & Leasing and other financial institutions, SMBC  has created a number of financial products and programs,  such as mortgage loans, leasing plans, and so on, that are  designed to help improve the environment. These products  proved popular, and over 300 applications for the mortgage  loan had been received by the end of fiscal 2009. l Business Alliance in the Environment Business  in China In November 2009, SMBC together with the Japan  Research Institute signed a basic agreement with the  Tianjin Eco-City Administrative Committee on initiatives  to attract Japanese business corporations to the Tianjin  Eco-city project.   The Tianjin Eco-City project is the first large-scale  project in China to build an ecologically friendly city to  have been approved at the national government level.  The new city will feature various measures to harmonize  human activities with the natural environment, measures  for conserving natural resources, and an efficient system  of resource recycling.   The environment business is expected to show signifi- cant further development in China along with the growth  of the countrys overall market, and SMBC intends to play  an important role in introducing Japanese companies to  projects where they can make a major contribution.   SMBC is strongly committed to delivering enhanced  services for Japanese corporate clients in the process of  setting up businesses in China or planning to do so. Topics   In July 2008 SMBC signed a Cooperative Agreement  for the Promotion of Industry with the Miyagi Prefectural  Government and The 77 Bank, Ltd. In the third venture under  this agreement, the three partners initiated a project to help  companies in Miyagi Prefecture become more environmen- tally responsible as well as cut  costs. Subsidies are provided  by the prefectural government to  help companies purchase equip- ment that contribute to energy  conservation and cost-cutting.  We are taking a variety of steps to  make this project a success, such  as holding seminars.   We will continue to step up initiatives that contribute to  regional economic growth while delivering high value-added  services to clients throughout Japan.

We share and understand  customers financial goals, including risk profiles, through  a series of discussions with each customer. After agreeing  on the goals, we create proposals for asset allocation and  management. Workplace Banking The management environment for SMBCs corporate cus- tomers is undergoing dramatic changes that are giving rise  to various issues in the field of HR strategy. PAD employs  the wide range of financial products and services offered  by SMBC to prepare solutions to these issues, and supports  corporate customers to create employee financial benefit  programs and defined-contribution pension plans.    Further, employees can obtain SMBC products and  services for achieving financial and other goals in their lives  through their employers in addition to SMBC marketing  channels.    Services for High Networth Individuals,  Business Owners and Employees Private Advisory Department The Private Advisory Department (PAD) of SMBC specializes  in products and services that meet the diverse requirements  of business owners and high networth individuals. Activities  of this department span three areas. The first is carefully  tailored support services for business and asset succes- sion. We combine the extensive know-how of our own staff,  accumulated over many years of experience, with the input  of alliance partners such as leading tax accountancy firms.  The second area is private banking services, which include  comprehensive financial services for managing customers  financial assets. These services, too, are offered in collabora- tion with alliance partners. The third area is workplace bank- ing services to support the HR strategies of corporate clients.  This service category includes providing assistance in the  design of employee savings and other employee financial  benefit programs, and defined-contribution pension plans.   By working with other SMBC Group companies and alli- ance partners, PAD uses its One Bank approach to provide  seamlessly a broad range of products and services. This  allows the department to cover many types of needs involving  both individual and corporate clients. Support for Business and Asset Succession PAD specialists prepare tailored proposals for customers with  concerns about business and asset succession. We hold a  variety of seminars to supply timely information and advise  business owners on a wide range of matters.

It was  also awarded Global Arranger of the Year by Infrastructure  Journal in project finance for infrastructure development for  its seawater desalination project finance deal in the Australian  state of Victoria, and other projects. In addition, in settlement  services, SMBC is steadily increasing its profile, ranking first  for two consecutive years among Japanese banks in the  Asia-Pacific region, in a cash management services survey  conducted by Asiamoney magazine. Collaboration with Nikko Cordial Securities Since October 2009, Nikko Cordial Securities, Inc. (NCS) has  been operating as a full-line securities company by adding  wholesale capabilities to its retail securities business. SMBC  has been referring its customers to NCS since the latter  half of fiscal 2009, and as a result, NCS closed more than  100 deals introduced by SMBC in underwriting and M&A.  Benefiting from the collaboration between SMBC and NCS,  in the league tables published by Thomson Reuters, SMFG  was third in the ranking of bookrunners in the Japanese  Corporate Bonds category with a market share of 20.0% in  the second half of fiscal 2009, and fourth with a market share  of 8.8% in the Global Equity & Equity-Related â€“ Underwriting  Value in Japan category. SMFG will continue to strengthen  further collaboration between SMBC and NCS so as to meet  the diverse needs of our customers, including fund raising  through capital markets, cross-border M&A, and debt securi- tization, more fully.

SMBC has three regional headquarters â€” Europe, the  Americas and the Asia-Pacific region â€” and subsidiaries in  the emerging markets of China, Russia and Brazil. With this  network, we have the speed and flexibility to respond to dif- fering needs in each region. We endeavor to become a global  commercial bank, capable of delivering our strengths in vari- ous business opportunities in this vast international market. Expansion of Overseas Network We are working to expand our overseas branch network to  enhance services for Japanese companies and increase our  presence in the emerging markets.   Considerable progress is being made in developing the  infrastructure in Africa, and in March 2010 SMBC enhanced  the functions of its Johannesburg Representative Office in  a move to better serve the needs of our customers, mainly  Japanese corporations that are planning to set up businesses  in Africa or expand their existing operations there. In May  2010, SMBC signed an agreement on a business alliance  with Absa Bank Limited, one of the largest private-sector  banks in South Africa and a subsidiary of Barclays PLC of  the United Kingdom. This builds on the capital and business  alliance entered into with Barclays PLC in 2008. We hope  to leverage Absas wide marketing base in South Africa to  further enhance our services. Capital and Business Alliances  with Prominent Asian Financial Institutions Our alliance strategy in Asia is tailored to the characteristics  of each country and region. We aim to strengthen our solution  providing capability in the region, such as by expanding our  Asian currency denominated services.   In July 2009, SMBC established an alliance with PT Bank  Central Asia Tbk, the largest privately owned commercial  bank in Indonesia. Forming this partnership positions us  to better provide our customers with solutions that include  stable local-currency financing, cash management services,  and other corporate finance activities. In the same month,  SMBC signed a technical service agreement, including risk  management, with its capital and business alliance partner  Vietnam Export Import Commercial Joint Stock Bank. Then,  in December 2009, through private placement, SMBC  acquired shares of The Bank of East Asia, Ltd., a major  private-sector bank in Hong Kong. The bank was already  one of our business partners, and this investment has further  strengthened our collaborative ties.   We will continue to forge ties with leading financial institu- tions, while organically growing our marketing network in  Asia â€” a multifaceted approach to expanding our business  operations in Asia. Core IT System Upgrades Starting in fiscal 2009, SMBC has been revamping its Asian  accounting systems and customer information and manage- ment administration systems as part of a worldwide opera- tions system upgrade to support corporate clients operating  globally. Strengthening of Risk Management As part of a broader strategy for reinforcing our credit cost  control framework, SMBC has enhanced its credit monitoring  system, and has set up dedicated credit management units  in Europe and the United States.   SMBC has also reinforced coordination between the  Credit Management Department of the International Banking  Unit, which was established in fiscal 2009, and the credit  portfolio management (CPM) functions of regional head- quarters to create an even more effective hedging system to  minimize the impact of economic fluctuations. Strengthening of Compliance System The global regulatory environment is changing rapidly, and  we are focusing our efforts on creating a compliance system  capable of swiftly responding to BIS guidelines and the regu- latory authorities of countries across the globe.   SMBC has taken various steps to computerize adminis- trative processes at its overseas offices and introduce more  advanced management systems in order to create an anti- money laundering system in line with international standards.  Moving forward, we will continue to tighten controls on the  operational side still further. Fostering Professionals Needed to Realize  Overseas Business Growth We are strengthening our training and educational programs  in order to meet seamlessly and accurately customers  increasingly diverse and advanced needs. We station promis- ing young employees at our overseas offices or dispatch them  to specialist overseas financial institutions outside the Group.  In this way, we are developing employees with invaluable  expertise in international business. In Asia, where our opera- tions are growing noticeably, SMBCs Asia Pacific Training  Department is constantly enhancing seminars and e-learning  programs for our national staff in order to strengthen their abil- ity to deliver the best solutions to our customers.  SMFG 2010 17 Topics l Issuance of A$-denominated bonds for individual  investors We have been diversifying our longer-term procurement  channels to adapt more effectively to new regulations and  cope with an increasingly competitive market. In March  2010, SMBC issued corporate bonds denominated in  Australian dollars for individual investors. lSound Market Operations SMBC executes sound market operations in response to  changes in market conditions based on a conservative risk  management policy. In addition, we are constantly taking  steps to use even more advanced methods for our ALM  activities. Topics lEnvironmental Business Opportunities Overseas We are reinforcing our initiatives in the global environ- mental business. In Asia, SMBC is one of the advisors in  the Tianjin Eco-City project in northern China. In March  2010, SMBC signed a financing agreement on a renew- able energy development project and other matters with  the International Finance Corporation and Environmental  Cooperation-Asia (ECO-Asia), a regional program of the  United States Agency for International Development. On  April 20, 2010, SMBC signed a memorandum of under- standing on the promotion of environmental business in  Malaysia with the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers  (FMM) and the NGO Green Purchasing Network  Association Malaysia (GPNM). In the Americas, SMBC  signed a memorandum on a business alliance in emis- sions trading with the Banco de la Republica Oriental del  Uruguay (a major financial institution administered by the  government of Uruguay). This is the latest move in our  continued expansion of our network of business alliances  in South America, which began with Banco do Brasil, a  leading Brazilian commercial bank, in August 2006. trends in financial markets.   We are constantly improving the functions of i-Deal, a  system that allows clients to conclude foreign exchange con- tracts over the Internet. Moving forward, the Treasury Unit will  continue working to fulfill all our customers market transaction  needs by offering full support services of the highest quality  in the industry. ALM and Trading Operations Through its ALM and trading operations, and while controlling  market and liquidity risks, the Treasury Unit seeks to maximize  earnings by targeting opportunities created by trends in many  financial markets.   We will continue to conduct trading operations that take  advantage of changes in market conditions in order to gener- ate a consistent stream of earnings.   Treasury Markets  SMFG, through the Treasury Unit of SMBC, aims to offer  increasingly higher value-added services to meet the ever  more sophisticated and diverse needs of its customers for  transactions in the money, foreign exchange, bond and  derivatives markets. To maintain and further strengthen profit- ability, and while managing risk appropriately, the Treasury  Unit focuses on three goals: (a) expanding transaction volume  from its customers; (b) strengthening its asset-liability man- agement (ALM) system and trading skills; and (c) bringing  sharper focus to portfolio management.

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc., was  established in December 2002 through a stock  transfer as a bank holding company, and SMBC  became a wholly owned subsidiary of SMFG. In  March 2003, SMBC merged with the Wakashio  Bank, Ltd.

Number of employees has been reported on the basis of full-time workers. Number of employees includes locally hired overseas staff members  but excludes contract employees, temporary staff, and executive officers who are not also Board members.   4.  From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, in calculating total net assets and total assets, SMBC has applied Accounting Standard for Presentation  of Net Assets in the Balance Sheet (ASBJ Statement No. 5) and Guidance on Accounting Standard for Presentation of Net Assets in the Balance  Sheet (ASBJ Guidance No. 8).   5.   The ASBJ has revised Guidance on Accounting Standard for Earnings per Share (ASBJ Guidance No. 4). From the fiscal year ended March 31,  2007, SMBC has applied the revised Guidance and calculated net assets per share by including net deferred gains (losses) on hedges.   6.  From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 (fiscal 2006), the nonconsolidated capital ratio has been calculated according to the formula specified  in the FSA Notification No. 19 issued in fiscal 2006, which is based on Article 14-2 of the Banking Act of Japan. The nonconsolidated capital ratio of  SMBC is calculated under Basel II. Please note that in fiscal 2005, the capital ratio was calculated according to the formula specified in the Ministry  of Finance Notification No. 55 issued in fiscal 1993, which was based on Article 14-2 of the Banking Act of Japan.   7.  Net income â€” diluted per share for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and after is not reported because no potentially dilutive shares have  been issued. l Nonconsolidated  SMFG 2010 25 Financial Review Operating results for fiscal 2009 include the results of 307  consolidated subsidiaries and 58 subsidiaries and affiliates  accounted for by the equity method. Gross profit increased 70.7 billion year on year, to  2,236.6 billion. The principal reasons for this increase were  1) an increase in net interest income in SMBCs international  operations as a result of a decline in U.S. interest rates and  an improvement in net interest margins, and 2) an increase  in net fees and commissions resulting from the acquisition  of Nikko Cordial Securities. After adjusting for general and  administrative expenses, credit cost, net losses on stocks,  equity in losses of affiliates, and other items, ordinary profit  increased 513.4 billion year on year, to 558.7 billion. The  main factors were decreases in both credit cost and losses on  devaluation of stocks resulting from the recovery in stock  prices.

The figures above include unrealized gains (losses) on negotiable certificates of deposit in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with banks  and beneficiary claims on loan trusts in Monetary claims bought, etc.   2.  Unrealized gains (losses) on stocks (including foreign stocks) are mainly calculated using the average market price during the final month of the  respective reporting period. The rest of the securities are valuated at the market price as of the balance sheet date.   3.  Other securities and Other money held in trust are valuated and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at market prices. The figures in the  table above indicate the differences between the acquisition costs (or amortized costs) and the balance sheet amounts.  Among net unrealized gains (losses) on other securities as of March 31, 2010, 105 million that is recognized in the fiscal year's earnings by apply- ing fair value hedge accounting is not included in net assets.   4.  Floating-rate Japanese government bonds which SMFG held as Other securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at their reasonably  estimated amounts in accordance with the Practical Solution on Measurement of Fair Value for Financial Assets (ASBJ Practical Issues Task Force  No. 25).   5.  Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments (ASBJ Statement No. 10, partially revised on March 10, 2008) and Implementation Guidance on  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (ASBJ Guidance No. 19, issued on March 10, 2008) became effective from the fiscal year  ending on and after March 31, 2010. SMFG has applied them from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010.  As a result of this accounting change, compared with the former accounting method, Monetary claims bought increased by 8,710 million,  Securities increased by 41,914 million, Net unrealized gains (losses) on other securities increased by 39,315 million, Deferred tax assets  related to net unrealized gains (losses) on other securities decreased by 27,056 million, and Reserve for possible loan losses decreased by  34,999 million.

Total capital, which is the numerator in the capital ratio  calculation equation, rose 2,080.4 billion year on year, to  8,128.2 billion. This was due mainly to increases in  capital stock and capital surplus resulting from the issu- ance of new shares. Risk-adjusted assets, the denominator  in the equation, increased 1,357.9 billion year on year, to  54,084.4 billion due mainly to the acquisition of Nikko  Cordial Securities. In view of the public nature of its business, SMFG has set a  fundamental policy of increasing dividends stably and contin- uously through sustainable growth in enterprise value, while  enhancing the Groups capital to maintain a sound financial  position. SMFG aims for a dividend payout ratio of over  20% on a consolidated net income basis, and its fundamen- tal policy is to distribute dividends from retained earnings  twice a year in the form of an interim dividend and a yearend  dividend. An interim dividend can be declared by the Board  of Directors, with September 30 of each year as the recorded  date, but the approval of shareholders at the annual general  meeting is required to pay a yearend dividend.  After taking into account the fiscal 2009 business perfor- mance, SMFG has decided to pay a term-end dividend of  100 per share of common stock for the fiscal year, a year-on  year increase of 10, and the predetermined amounts for each  category of preferred stock. SMFG will employ its retained earnings to increase its  enterprise value by investing mainly in growth business areas  in order to build a business portfolio for achieving sustainable  growth. 4.

This was  mainly attributable to the posting of income before income  taxes and an increase in deferred tax liabilities resulting from  an improvement in unrealized gains on other securities due  to higher stock prices.  SMFG takes a conservative approach to recognizing  deferred tax assets in order to secure a sound financial  position.  SMFG 2010 28 Gross banking profit in fiscal 2009 decreased 69.5 bil- lion from the previous fiscal year, to 1,455.2 billion, and  expenses (excluding nonrecurring losses) declined 15.7  billion, to 685.7 billion. As a result, banking profit  (before provision for general reserve for possible loan losses)  decreased 53.8 billion, to 769.5 billion. Ordinary profit â€” banking profit (before provision for  general reserve for possible loan losses) adjusted for non- recurring items such as total credit cost and net gains on  stocks â€” increased 426.6 billion, to 462.7 billion. After adjustment of ordinary profit for extraordinary losses  and income taxes, SMBC posted net income of 317.9 bil- lion, a year-on-year increase of 619.1 billion. Gross Banking Profit Gross banking profit decreased 69.5 billion year on year,  to 1,455.2 billion. This was due mainly to a decrease in  foreign exchange-related gains resulting from the economic  slowdown. This factor more than offset the higher net trad- ing income. Expenses Expenses (excluding nonrecurring losses) decreased 15.7 bil- lion to 685.7 billion, due mainly to more restrained opera- tions in light of the severe overall business environment. Banking Profit Banking profit (before provision for general reserve for pos- sible loan losses) decreased 53.8 billion from the previous  fiscal year, to 769.5 billion. 2. Income Analysis 1.

The main  factor was a decrease of 210.5 billion in credit cost, to 263.8  billion, due to the effects of the governments economic stimu- lus package and SMBCs business improvement and other  measures tailored to each customers individual circumstances.  In addition, SMBC recorded net gain on stocks of 3.8 billion  versus net losses on stocks of 220.4 billion in the previous fis- cal year, an improvement of 224.2 billion, owing to gains on  sale of stocks and a decrease in losses on devaluation of stocks  due to the markets recovery.  Total credit cost â€” the sum of credit cost recorded under  Nonrecurring losses, provision for general reserve for possible  loan losses, and gains on recoveries of written-off claims â€”  amounted to 254.6 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 295.4  billion. Ordinary Profit As a result of the foregoing, ordinary profit totaled 462.7 bil- lion, 426.6 billion higher than in the previous fiscal year. Extraordinary Gains (Losses) Extraordinary losses amounted to 7.9 billion, a decrease of  0.2 billion from the previous year. Net Income Current income taxes amounted to 44.9 billion, and deferred  income taxes were 91.7 billion. As a result, net income  increased 619.1 billion to 317.9 billion year on year.  SMFG 2010 30 Assets In spite of efforts to ensure a smooth supply of funds to our  customers, SMBCs assets as of March 31, 2010 decreased  3,941.8 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, to a total  of 103,536.3 billion. This was due mainly to a 3,622.2  billion year on year decrease in loans and bills discounted,  due to the weak borrowing demand in Japan and SMBCs  conservative stance on asset operations overseas. Liabilities Liabilities as of March 31, 2010 amounted to 98,138.4  billion, a decrease of 6,793.2 billion from the previous fis- cal year-end. This is mainly due to a decrease of 4,153.7  billion in payables under securities lending transactions con- ducted as part of overall funding activities, and the amount  declined in line with the decrease in assets. Net Assets Net assets at fiscal year-end amounted to 5,397.9 billion. Of  this total, stockholders equity amounted to 4,949.0 billion,  consisting of 1,770.9 billion in capital stock, 2,473.5 bil- lion in capital surplus (including 702.5 billion in other capi- tal surplus), and 704.4 billion in retained earnings.  Valuation and translation adjustments were 448.9 billion,  comprising 379.3 billion in net unrealized gains on other  securities, 48.0 billion in net deferred gains on hedges, and  21.5 billion in land revaluation excess. 3.

SMFG 2010 34 Risk Management Basic Approach As risks in the financial services increase in diversity and com- plexity, risk managementâ€”identifying, measuring, and controlling  riskâ€”has never been more important in the management of a  financial holding company.   SMFG has encapsulated the basic principles to be employed  in risk management in the manual entitled Regulations on Risk  Management. In the manual, we have specified the basic poli- cies for risk management: 1) Set forth SMFGs Groupwide basic  policies for risk management after specifying the categories of  risk to which these policies apply; 2) Provide all necessary guid- ance to Group companies to enable them to follow the basic  risk management policies set forth by SMFG and set up their  own appropriate risk management systems; and 3) Monitor the  implementation of risk management by all Group companies to  ensure that their practices meet the relevant standards. (1) Types of Risk to Be Managed At SMFG, we classify risk into the following categories:  (1) credit risk, (2) market risk, (3) liquidity risk and (4) operational  risk (including processing risk and system risk). In addition, we  provide individually tailored guidance to help Group companies  identify categories of risk that need to be addressed. Risk cat- egories are constantly reviewed, and new categories may be  added in response to changes in the operating environment.  The Corporate Risk Management Department works with the  Corporate Planning Department to comprehensively and sys- tematically manage all these categories of risk across the entire  Group. (2)  Fundamental Principles and Basic Policies for Risk  Management SMFGs Groupwide basic policies for risk management stipulate  the fundamental principles for risk management that must be  followed, and spell out risk management procedures from various  perspectives. These include managing risk on a consolidated  accounting basis, managing risk using quantification methods,  ensuring consistency with business strategies, setting up a sys- tem of checks and balances, contingency planning for emergen- cies and serious situations, and verifying preparedness to handle  all conceivable risk situations. In addition, there are specific  operational policies for implementing appropriate management  of risk by all Group companies.   Under SMFGs Groupwide basic policies for risk manage- ment, all Group companies periodically carry out reviews of the  basic management policies for each risk category, or whenever  deemed necessary, thus ensuring that the policies followed at  any time are the most appropriate. The management of SMFG  constantly monitors the conduct of risk management at Group  companies, providing guidance when necessary. Risk Management System Top management plays an active role in determining SMFGs  Groupwide basic policies for risk management. The system  works as follows: The basic policies for risk management are  determined by the Management Committee before being autho- rized by the Board. The Management Committee, the designated  board members, and the relevant risk management departments  perform risk management according to the basic policies.

Market risk is the possibility that fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, stock prices,  or other market prices will change the market value of financial products, leading to a loss. Processing risk is the possibility of losses arising from negligent processing by  employees, accidents, or unauthorized activities. System risk is the possibility of a loss arising from the failure, malfunction, or  unauthorized use of computer systems. Operational risk is the possibility of losses arising from inadequate or failed internal  processes, people, and systems or from external events.   Risk management systems are in place at the individual  Group companies in accordance with SMFGs Groupwide basic  policies for risk management. For example, at SMBC, specific  departments have been appointed to oversee the handling of  the four risk categories listed above, in addition to risks asso- ciated with settlement. Each risk category is managed taking  into account the particular characteristics of that category. In  addition, the Risk Management Unit has been establishedâ€” independent of the business unitsâ€”and the risk management  framework has been strengthened by consolidating the functions  for managing major risksâ€”credit, market, liquidity and opera- tionalâ€”into the Risk Management Unit and enhancing our across- the-board risk monitoring ability. A board member is assigned to  oversee the Risk Management Unit comprising the Corporate  Risk Management Department and Credit & Investment Planning  Department. The Corporate Risk Management Departmentâ€”the  units planning departmentâ€”comprehensively and systematically  manages all categories of risk in cooperation with the Corporate  Planning Department. Moreover, the Internal Audit Unitâ€” independent of all business unitsâ€”conducts periodic audits to  ensure that the management system is functioning properly.   Furthermore, under our system top management plays an  active role in the approval of basic policies for risk management.  The decision-making process for addressing credit, market, and  liquidity risk at the operating level is strengthened by the Credit  Risk Management Committee and the Market Risk Management  Committee, which are subcommittees of the Management  Committee. The Management Committee is also attended by the  relevant department heads. Risk Capital-Based Management (1) Framework In order to maintain a balance between risk and return as well  as ensure the soundness of the Group from an overall perspec- tive, we employ the risk capital-based management method.  We measure risk capital based on value at risk (VaR), etc.  as a uniform basic measure of credit, market, and operational  risk, taking account of the special characteristics of each type  of risk and the business activities of each Group company. We  then allocate capital appropriately and effectively to each unit  to keep total exposure to various risks within the scope of our  resources, i.e., capital. In this framework, risk capital includes  credit concentration risk and interest rate risk in the banking book  which are taken into account under the Second Pillar of Basel II.  In addition, we conduct risk capital-based management activities  on a consolidated basis, including each Group company.   Liquidity risk is managed within the context of cash-flow  plans and funding gap. Other risk categories are managed with  procedures closely attuned to the nature of the risk, as described  in the following paragraphs. (2) Risk Capital Limit In the case of credit and market risk, we set maximum risk capital  limits, which indicate the maximum risk that may be taken during  the period, taking account the level of stress stipulated in busi- ness plans. In addition, for operational risk, we also allocate risk  capital, and, for the Group as a whole, we set total risk capital  allocations within SMFGs capital. In the case of credit and market   SMFG 2010 36 risk, risk capital limits are sub-divided into guidelines or ceil- ings for each business including VaR and loss limits. Therefore,  by strictly observing the VaR and loss limits, and other factors,  SMFG maintains the soundness of the Group as a whole. Implementation of Basel II The Basel Capital Accord, an international agreement for ensur- ing the soundness of banks through adherence to BIS capital  adequacy regulations, was revised in response to the diversifica- tion of the banking business and the increasing sophistication of  risk management technology. The revised BIS regulations, known  as Basel II, became effective from March 31, 2007 in Japan.   Basel II requires banks to implement internal controls to serve  as the basis for capital calculation, and to strengthen their risk  management framework. It also requires disclosure of information  to encourage market discipline in risk management.   We have been implementing initiatives to strengthen our risk  management framework, taking into account Basel II and other  considerations. We introduced the advanced internal ratings- based (IRB) approach for credit risk on March 31, 2009, and the  Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) for operational risk on  March 31, 2008.   Details of the initiatives are provided below, and detailed  information on the capital ratio is provided in the discussion on  Capital Ratio Information appearing in the Financial Section and  Corporate Data. Credit Risk 1. Basic Approach to Credit Risk Management (1) Definition of Credit Risk Credit risk is the possibility of a loss arising from a credit event,  such as deterioration in the financial condition of a borrower, that  causes an asset (including off-balance sheet transactions) to  lose value or become worthless.   Overseas credits also include an element of country risk,  which is closely related to credit risk. This is the risk of loss  caused by changes in foreign exchange, or political or economic  situations. (2)  Fundamental Principles for Credit Risk Management All Group companies follow the fundamental principles  established by SMFG to assess and manage credit risk on a  Groupwide basis and further raise the level of accuracy and  comprehensiveness of Groupwide credit risk management.  Each Group company must comprehensively manage credit risk  according to the nature of its business, and assess and manage  credit risk of individual loans and credit portfolios quantitatively  and using consistent standards.    Credit risk is the most significant risk to which SMFG is  exposed. Without effective credit risk management, the impact of  the corresponding losses on operations can be overwhelming.    The purpose of credit risk management is to keep credit risk  exposure to a permissible level relative to capital, to maintain  the soundness of Groupwide assets, and to ensure returns com- mensurate with risk. This leads to a loan portfolio that achieves  high returns on capital and assets. (3) Credit Policy SMBCs credit policy comprises clearly stated universal and  basic operating concepts, policies, and standards for credit  operations, in accordance with the business mission and rules  of conduct.   SMBC is promoting the understanding of and strict adher- ence to its credit policy among all its managers and employees.  By conducting risk-sensitive credit management, SMBC aims  to enhance shareholder value and play a key part in society by  providing high-value-added financial services. 2. Credit Risk Management System At SMBC, the Credit & Investment Planning Department within  the Risk Management Unit is responsible for the comprehensive  management of credit risk. This department drafts and admin- isters credit policies, the internal rating system, credit authority  guidelines, and credit application guidelines, and manages non- performing loans (NPLs) and other aspects of credit portfolio  management. The department also cooperates with the  Corporate Risk Management Department in quantifying credit  risk (risk capital and risk-weighted assets) and controls the  banks entire credit risk. Further, the Credit Portfolio Management  Department within the Credit & Investment Planning Department  has been strengthening its active portfolio management function  whereby loan securitization and other market transactions are  used to stabilize the portfolios credit risk for a more sophisticated  portfolio.   The Corporate Research Department within the Corporate  Services Unit performs research on industries as well as  investigates the business situations of borrower enterprises to  detect early signs of problems or growth potential. The Credit  Administration Department is responsible for handling NPLs of  borrowers classified as potentially bankrupt or lower, and draws  up plans for their workouts, including write-offs, and corporate  rehabilitation. The department closely liaises with the Group  company SMBC Servicer Co., Ltd., which engages in related  services, and works to efficiently reduce the amount of NPLs by  such means as the sell-off of claims.   The credit departments within each business unit conduct  credit risk management along with branches, for loans handled  by their units and manage their units portfolios. The credit limits  they use are based on the baseline amounts established for each  grading category, with particular attention paid to evaluating and  managing customers or loans perceived to have particularly high  credit risk.

The Internal Audit Unit, operating independently of the busi- ness units, audits asset quality, accuracy of gradings and self- assessment, and state of credit risk management, and reports  the results directly to the Board of Directors and the Management  Committee.    SMBC has established the Credit Risk Committee, as a con- sultative body, to round out its oversight system for undertaking  flexible and efficient control of credit risk, and ensuring the overall  soundness of the banks loan operations.  SMBCs Credit Risk Management System 3. Credit Risk Management Methods (1) Credit Risk Assessment and Quantification At SMBC, to effectively manage the risk involved in individual  loans as well as the credit portfolio as a whole, we first acknowl- edge that every loan entails credit risks, assess the credit risk  posed by each borrower and loan using an internal rating system,  and quantify that risk for control purposes. (a) Internal Rating System There is an internal rating system for each asset control category  set according to portfolio characteristics. For example, credits  to commercial and industrial (C&I) companies, individuals for  business purposes (domestic only), sovereigns, public-sector  entities, and financial institutions are assigned an obligor grade,  which indicates the borrowers creditworthiness, and/or facility  grade, which indicates the collectibility of assets taking into  account transaction conditions such as guarantee/collateral,  and tenor. An obligor grade is determined by first assigning a  financial grade using a financial strength grading model and data  obtained from the obligors financial statements. The financial  grade is then adjusted taking into account the actual state of the  obligors balance sheet and qualitative factors to derive the obli- gor grade. In the event that the borrower is domiciled overseas,  internal ratings for credit are made after taking into consideration  country rank, which represents an assessment of the credit qual- ity of each country, based on its political and economic situation,  as well as its current account balance and external debt. Self- assessment is the obligor grading process for assigning lower  grades, and the borrower categories used in self-assessment are  consistent with the obligor grade categories.    Obligor grades and facility grades are reviewed once a year,  and, whenever necessary, such as when there are changes in the  credit situation.    There are also grading systems for small and medium-sized  enterprises (SME) loans, loans to individuals, and project finance  and other structured finance tailored according to the risk   SMFG 2010 38 characteristics of these types of assets.    The Credit & Investment Planning Department centrally man- ages the internal rating systems, and properly designs, operates,  supervises, and validates the grading models. It validates the  grading models (including statistical validation) of main assets  following the procedures manual once a year, to ensure their  effectiveness and suitability.  (b) Quantification of Credit Risk Credit risk quantification refers to the process of estimating the  degree of credit risk of a portfolio or individual loan taking into  account not just the obligors probability of default (PD), but also  the concentration of risk in a specific customer or industry and  the loss impact of fluctuations in the value of collateral, such as  real estate and securities.   Specifically, first, the PD by grade, loss given default (LGD),  credit quality correlation among obligors, and other parameter  values are estimated using historical data of obligors and facili- ties stored in a database to calculate the credit risk. Then, based  on these parameters, we run a simulation of simultaneous default  using the Monte Carlo method to calculate our maximum loss  exposure to the estimated amount of the maximum losses that  may be incurred. Based on these quantitative results, we allocate  risk capital.     Risk quantification is also executed for purposes such as  to determine the portfolios risk concentration, or to simulate  economic movements (stress tests), and the results are used for  making optimal decisions across the whole range of business  operations, including formulating business plans and provid- ing a standard against which individual credit applications are  assessed. (2) Framework for Managing Individual Loans (a) Credit Assessment At SMBC, credit assessment of corporate loans involves a variety  of financial analyses, including cash flow, to predict an enter- prises capability of loan repayment and its growth prospects.  These quantitative measures, when combined with qualitative  analyses of industrial trends, the enterprises R&D capabilities,  the competitiveness of its products or services, and its manage- ment caliber, result in a comprehensive credit assessment. The  loan application is analyzed in terms of the intended utilization  of the funds and the repayment schedule. Thus, SMBC is able to  arrive at an accurate and fair credit decision based on an objec- tive examination of all relevant factors.   Increasing the understandability to customers of loan condi- tions and approval standards for specific borrowing purposes  and loan categories is a part of SMBCs ongoing review of lend- ing practices, which includes the revision of loan contract forms  with the chief aim of clarifying lending conditions utilizing financial  covenants.    SMBC is also making steady progress in rationalizing its  credit assessment process. To respond pro- actively and promptly to customers funding  needsâ€”particularly those of SMEsâ€”we employ  a standardized credit risk assessment process  for SMEs that uses a credit-scoring model.  With this process, we are building a regime for  efficiently marketing our Business Select Loan  and other SME loans.    In the field of housing loans for individuals,  we employ a credit assessment model based  on credit data amassed and analyzed by SMBC  over many years. This model enables our loan  officers to efficiently make rational decisions on  housing loan applications, and to reply to the  customers without delay. It also facilitates the  effective management of credit risk, as well as  the flexible setting of interest rates.    We also provide loans to individuals who  rent out properties such as apartments. The  loan applications are subjected to a precise  credit risk assessment process utilizing a risk  assessment model that factors in the projected  revenue from the rental business.

(b) Credit Monitoring System At SMBC, in addition to analyzing loans at the application stage,  the Credit Monitoring System is utilized to reassess obligor  grades and review self-assessment and credit policies so that  problems can be detected at an early stage, and quick and  effective action can be taken. The system includes periodic  monitoring carried out each time an obligor enterprise discloses  financial results, as well as continuous monitoring performed  each time credit conditions change, as indicated in the diagram  below. (3) Framework for Credit Portfolio Management In addition to managing individual loans, SMBC applies the  following basic policies to the management of the entire credit  portfolio to maintain and improve its soundness and profitability  over the mid to long term. (a) Risk-Taking within the Scope of Capital To keep credit risk exposure to a permissible level relative to  capital, SMBC sets credit risk capital limits for internal control  purposes. Under these limits, separate guidelines are issued for  each business unit and marketing unit, such as for real estate  finance, fund investment, and investment in securitization prod- ucts. Regular monitoring is conducted to make sure that these  guidelines are being followed, thus ensuring appropriate overall  management of credit risk. (b) Controlling Concentration Risk Because the concentration of credit risk in an industry or corpo- rate group has the potential to substantially impair capital, SMBC  implements measures to prevent the excessive concentration of  loans in an industry and to control large exposure to individual  companies or corporate groups by setting guidelines for maxi- mum loan amounts.   To manage country risk, SMBC also has credit limit guidelines  based on each countrys creditworthiness. (c)  Researching Borrowers More Rigorously and Balancing Risk  and Returns Against a backdrop of drastic change in the business environ- ment, SMBC rigorously researches borrower companies actual  conditions. It runs credit operations on the basic principle  of earning returns that are commensurate with the credit risk  involved, and makes every effort to reduce credit and capital  costs as well as general and administrative expenses. (d) Prevention and Reduction of Non-Performing Loans On NPLs and potential NPLs, SMBC carries out regular loan  reviews to clarify handling policies and action plans, enabling it  to swiftly implement measures to prevent deterioration of borrow- ers business situations, support business recoveries, collect on  loans, and enhance loan security. (e) Toward Active Portfolio Management SMBC makes active use of credit derivatives, loan asset sales,  and other instruments to proactively and flexibly manage its port- folio to stabilize credit risk.  SMFG 2010 40 (4)  Self-Assessment, Asset Write-Offs and Provisions,  and Disclosure of Problem Assets (a) Self-Assessment SMBC conducts rigorous self-assessment of asset quality  using criteria based on the Financial Inspection Manual of the  Financial Services Agency and the Practical Guideline published  by the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Self- assessment is the latter stage of the obligor grading process for  determining the borrowers ability to fulfill debt obligations, and  the obligor grade criteria are consistent with the categories used  in self-assessment.   At the same time, self-assessment is a preparatory task for  ensuring SMBCs asset quality and calculating the appropri- ate level of write-offs and provisions. Each asset is assessed  individually for its security and collectibility. Depending on the  borrowers current situation, the borrower is assigned to one of  five categories: Normal Borrowers, Borrowers Requiring Caution,  Potentially Bankrupt Borrowers, Effectively Bankrupt Borrowers,  and Bankrupt Borrowers. Based on the borrowers category,  claims on the borrower are classified into Classification I, II, III,  and IV assets according to their default and impairment risk lev- els, taking into account such factors as collateral and guarantees.  As part of our efforts to bolster risk management throughout the  Group, our consolidated subsidiaries carry out self-assessment  in substantially the same manner. Borrower Categories, Defined Normal Borrowers Borrowers with good earnings performances and no significant  financial problems Borrowers Requiring Caution Borrowers identified for close monitoring Potentially Bankrupt Borrowers Borrowers perceived to have a high risk of falling into  bankruptcy Effectively Bankrupt Borrowers Borrowers that may not have legally or formally declared  bankruptcy but are essentially bankrupt Bankrupt Borrowers Borrowers that have been legally or formally declared bankrupt Asset Classifications, Defined Classification I Assets not classified under Classifications II, III, or IV Classification II Assets perceived to have an above-average risk of  uncollectibility Classification III Assets for which final collection or asset value is very doubtful  and which pose a high risk of incurring a loss Classification IV Assets assessed as uncollectible or worthless (b) Asset Write-Offs and Provisions In cases where claims have been determined to be uncollectible,  or deemed to be uncollectible, write-offs signify the recognition  of losses on the account books with respect to such claims.  Write-offs can be made either in the form of loss recognition by  offsetting uncollectible amounts against corresponding balance  sheet items, referred to as a direct write-off, or else by recog- nition of a loan loss provision on a contra-asset account in the  amount deemed uncollectible, referred to as an indirect write-off.  Recognition of indirect write-offs is generally known as provision  for the reserve for possible loan losses.   SMBCs write-off and provision criteria for each self- assessment borrower category are shown in the table below.  As part of our overall measures to strengthen risk management  throughout the Group, all consolidated subsidiaries use substan- tially the same standards as SMBC for write-offs and provisions. Self-Assessment  Borrower Categories Standards for Write-Offs and Provisions Normal Borrowers The expected loss amount for the next 12 months is calculated  for each grade based on the grades historical bankruptcy rate,  and the total amount is recorded as provision for the general  reserve for possible loan losses. Borrowers Requiring Caution These assets are divided into groups according to the level  of default risk. Amounts are recorded as provisions for the  general reserve in proportion to the expected losses based  on the historical bankruptcy rate of each group. The groups  are claims on Substandard Borrowers and claims on other  Borrowers Requiring Caution. The latter group is further  subdivided according to the borrowers financial position,  credit situation, and other factors. Further, when cash flows  can be estimated reasonably accurately, the discounted cash  flow (DCF) method is applied mainly to large claims for  calculating the provision amount. Potentially Bankrupt Borrowers A provision for the specific reserve for possible loan losses is  made for the portion of Classification III assets (calculated for  each borrower) not secured by collateral, guarantee, or other  means. Further, when cash flows can be estimated reasonably  accurately, the DCF method is applied mainly to large claims  for calculating the provision amount. Effectively Bankrupt/ Bankrupt  Borrowers Classification III asset and Classification IV asset amounts  for each borrower are calculated, and the full amount of  Classification IV assets (deemed to be uncollectible or of no  value) is written off in principle and provision for the specific  reserve is made for the full amount of Classification III assets. Notes General reserve  Provisions made in accordance with general inherent default  risk of loans, unrelated to specific individual loans or other  claims Specific reserve Provisions made for claims that have been found uncollectible  in part or in total (individually evaluated claims) Discounted Cash Flow Method SMBC uses the discounted cash flow (DCF) method to cal- culate the provision amounts for large claims on Substandard  Borrowers and Potentially Bankrupt Borrowers when the cash  flow from repayment of principal and interest received can be  estimated reasonably accurately. SMBC then makes provisions  equivalent to the excess of the book value of the claims over  the said cash inflow discounted by the initial contractual interest  rate or the effective interest rate at the time of origination. One  of the major advantages of the DCF method over conventional  methods of calculating the provision amount is that it enables  effective evaluation of each individual borrower. However, as the  provision amount depends on the future cash flow estimated on  the basis of the borrowers business reconstruction plan and  the DCF formula input values, such as the discount rate and the  probability of the borrower going into bankruptcy, SMBC makes  every effort to utilize up-to-date and correct data to realize the  most accurate estimates possible.  SMFG 2010 41 (c) Disclosure of Problem Assets Problem assets are loans and other claims of which recovery of  either principal or interest appears doubtful, and are disclosed  in accordance with the Banking Law (in which they are referred  to as risk-monitored loans) and the Financial Reconstruction  Law (where they are referred to as problem assets). Problem  assets are classified based on the borrower categories assigned  during self-assessment. For detailed information on results of  self-assessments, asset write-offs and provisions, and disclosure  of problem assets at March 31, 2010, please refer to page 162. 4. Market Credit Risk Management Financial products, such as investments in funds, securitized  products, and credit derivatives, that bear indirect risk arising  from underlying assets such as bonds and loan obligations, are  considered to be exposed to both credit risk from the underlying  assets as well as market risk and liquidity risk that arise from  their trading as financial products. This is referred to as market  credit risk.   For these types of products, we manage credit risk using the  methods of analysis and assessment in detail of characteristics  of underlying assets, but, for the sake of complete risk manage- ment, we also apply the methods for management of market and  liquidity risks.   In addition, we have established guidelines based on the  characteristics of these types of risk and appropriately manage  the risk of losses. Market and Liquidity Risks 1.  Basic Approach to Market and Liquidity Risk  Management (1) Definitions of Market and Liquidity Risks Market risk is the possibility that fluctuations in interest rates,  foreign exchange rates, stock prices, or other market prices will  change the market value of financial products, leading to a loss.    Liquidity risk is the risk that there may be difficulties in raising  funds needed for settlements, as a result of the mismatching  of uses of funds and sources of funds or unexpected outflows  of funds, which may make it necessary to raise funds at higher  rates than normal levels. (2)  Fundamental Principles for Market and Liquidity  Risk Management  SMFG is working to further enhance the effectiveness of its quan- titative management of market and liquidity risks across the entire  Group by setting allowable risk limits; ensuring the transparency  of the risk management process; clearly separating front-office,  middle-office and back-office operations; and establishing a  control system of mutual checks and balances. 2.  Market and Liquidity Risk Management System On the basis of SMFGs Groupwide basic policies for risk  management, SMBCs Board of Directors authorizes important  matters relating to the management of market and liquidity risks,  such as basic policies and risk limits, which are decided by the  Management Committee. Additionally, at SMBC, the Corporate  Risk Management Department, which is the planning department  of the Risk Management Unit, an independent of the business  units that directly handle market transactions, manages mar- ket and liquidity risks in an integrated manner. The Corporate  Risk Management Department not only monitors the current  risk situations, but also reports regularly to the Management  Committee and the Board of Directors.  Furthermore, SMBCs  ALM Committee meets on a monthly basis to examine reports on  the state of observance of SMBCs limits on market and liquidity  risks, and to review and discuss the SMBCs ALM operation.    To prevent unforeseen processing errors as well as fraudulent  transactions, it is important to establish a system of checks on  the business units (front office). At SMBC, both the processing  Management Committee Market Risk Management Committee ALM Committee Board Member in Charge of Risk Management Unit Policy Reporting Back Office (Back offices of Japan  and overseas branches) Other market- related operations Front Office Market  operations  (Treasury Unit) Market  operations  (International   Banking Unit) (Group companies) Front/Middle/Back Offices Market  operations Managing Depts.

SMBCs Market Risk and Liquidity Risk Management  System  SMFG 2010 42 departments (back office) and the administrative departments  (middle office) conduct the checks. In addition, the Internal Audit  Unit of SMBC periodically performs comprehensive internal  audits to verify that the risk management framework is functioning  properly. 3. Market and Liquidity Risk Management Methods (1) Market Risk Management SMBC manages market risk by setting maximum limits for VaR  and maximum loss. These limits are set within the market risk  capital limit which is determined taking into account the banks  shareholders equity and other principal indicators of the banks  financial position and management resources.    Market risk can be divided into various factors: foreign  exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices and option risks.  SMBC manages each of these risk categories by employing the  VaR method as well as supplemental indicators suitable for man- aging the risk of each risk factor, such as the BPV.   Please note that, in the case of interest rate fluctuation risk,  the methods for recognizing the dates for maturity of demand  deposits (current accounts and ordinary deposit accounts that  can be withdrawn at any time) and the method for estimating  the time of cancellation prior to maturity of time deposits and  consumer loans differ substantially. At SMBC, the maturity of  demand deposits that are expected to be left with the bank for  a prolonged period is regarded to be five years (2.5 years on  average). The cancellation prior to maturity of time deposits and  consumer loans is estimated based on historical data. (a) VaR Results The results of VaR calculations for fiscal 2009 are shown in the  table below. SMBCs internal VaR model makes use of historical  data to prepare scenarios for market fluctuations and, by con- ducting simulations of gains and losses, the model estimates  the maximum losses that may occur (this is known as the his- torical simulation method). This internal SMBC model is evaluated  periodically by an independent auditing firm to assess its  appropriateness and accuracy. (b) Back-Testing Results The relationship between the VaR calculated with the model and  the actual profit and loss data is back-tested daily. The back- testing results for SMBCs trading accounts for fiscal 2009  are shown at the top of the next page. A data point below the  diagonal line indicates a loss in excess of the predicted VaR for  that day; however, as in fiscal 2008, there were no such excess  losses during fiscal 2009. This demonstrates that the SMBC VaR  model, with a one-sided confidence interval of 99.0%, is suf- ficiently reliable. Glossary 1. VaR (Value at risk)  The largest predicted loss that is possible given a fixed  confidence interval. For example, VaR indicates, for a hold- ing period of one day and a confidence interval of 99.0%,  the maximum loss that may occur as a result of market fluc- tuations in one day with a probability of 1%. 2.

To manage market risk, therefore, it is impor- tant to run simulations of unforeseen situations that may occur in  financial markets (stress testing). To prepare for unforeseeable  market swings, SMBC performs stress testing on a monthly  basis based on various scenarios including historical simulations  which reflect past market fluctuations. (d) Outlier Framework In the event the economic value of a bank declines by more than  20% of the sum of Tier I and Tier II capital (outlier ratio) as a  result of interest rate shocks, the bank falls into the category of  outlier bank, as stipulated under the Second Pillar of Basel II.   As of March 31, 2010, the outlier ratio was around 6%, sub- stantially below the 20% criterion. (e) Managing Risk of Stocks Held for Strategic Purposes The Corporate Risk Management Department establishes limits  on allowable risk for strategic equity investments, and monitors  the observance of those limits in order to control stock price  fluctuation risk.   SMBC has been reducing its strategic equity investments and  the outstanding amount is now significantly below the amount  of Tier I capital, the maximum level permitted under the Act on  Financial Institutions (,etc.), Limits for Share, etc. Holdings. (2) Liquidity Risk Management At SMBC, liquidity risk is regarded as one of the major risks.  SMBCs liquidity risk management is based on a framework con- sisting of setting funding gap limits and guidelines, maintaining  highly liquid supplementary funding sources, and establishing  contingency plans.    So as not to be overly dependent on short-term market-based  funding to cover cash outflows, SMBC sets funding gap limits and  guidelines. The funding gap limits and guidelines are set Bank- wide and for each region, taking into account cash management  plans, external environment, funding status, characteristics of  local currency and other factors. Additionally, a risk limit is set by  currency as needed to achieve more rigorous management.   To minimize the impact of crises on the SMBCs funding,  SMBC manages highly liquid supplementary funding sources,  whereby SMBC maintains high quality liquid assets, such as  government bonds and has emergency borrowing facilities.   In addition, for emergency situations, there are contingency  plans in place for addressing funding liquidity risk that include  an action plan with measures for reducing funding gap limits and  guidelines.

Basic Approach to Operational Risk Management (1) Definition of Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or  failed internal processes, people and systems or from external  events. Specifically, Basel IIâ€”which, in addition to processing  risk and system risk, also covers legal risk, personnel risk, and  physical asset riskâ€”defines the following seven types of events  that may lead to the risk of loss: (1) internal fraud, (2) external  fraud, (3) employment practices and workplace safety, (4) clients,  products and business practices, (5) damage to physical assets,  (6) business disruption and system failures, and (7) execution,  delivery, and process management.  (2)  Fundamental Principles for Operational Risk Management  SMFG and SMBC have drawn up the Regulations on Operational  Risk Management to define the basic rules to be observed in  the conduct of operational risk management across the entire  Group. Under these regulations, SMFG and SMBC have been  working to enhance the operational risk management framework  across the whole Group by establishing an effective system for  identification, assessment, controlling, and monitoring of material  operational risk and a system for executing contingency and  business continuity plans. In view of the inclusion of operational  risk in the framework of the capital adequacy requirements of  Basel II, SMFG has been working on a continuing basis to cre- ate a more sophisticated quantification model and to enhance  operational risk management throughout the Group. 2. Operational Risk Management System SMFG has designed and implemented an operational risk  management framework for Groupwide basic policies for risk  management.   At SMBC, the Management Committee makes decisions  on important matters such as basic policies for operational  risk management, and these decisions are authorized by the  SMBC Board of Directors. In addition, SMBC has established its  Operational Risk Management Department, within the Corporate  Risk Management Department as an integrated operational risk  management department. This department works together with  other departments responsible for controlling processing risk and  system risk.   The operational risk management framework is described in  more detail in the later part of this section, but it can be outlined  as follows: operational risk is managed by (1) collecting and  analyzing internal loss data, and (2) comprehensively identifying  risk scenarios in each business process through a regular risk  control assessment to estimate the loss severity and frequency.  Operational risk impact is assessed for each risk scenario. When  high-severity scenarios are identified, each branch/department  establishes a risk mitigation plan and the Operational Risk  Management Department monitors the progress. Furthermore,  operational risk is quantified using the internal loss data and  scenarios, and the results of quantification are used to manage  and reduce operational risk.   The generation of internal loss data, scenarios identified  through risk control assessments, and status of risk mitigation  activities are regularly reported to the director in charge of the  Auditing of management and measurement system Integrated Operational Risk Supervisory Dept.

In addition, there  is the Operational Risk Committee, comprising all relevant units  of the bank, where operational risk information is reported and  risk mitigation plans are discussed. In this way, we realize a  highly effective operational risk management framework. The  operational risk situation is also reported to the Management  Committee and the Board of Directors on a regular basis, for  review of the basic policies on operational risk management.  Moreover, the banks independent Internal Audit Department  conducts periodic audits to ensure that the operational risk man- agement system is functioning properly. 3. Operational Risk Management Methodology As previously defined, operational risk covers a wide range of  events, including the risk of losses due to errors in operation,  system failures, and natural disasters. Also, operational risk  events can occur virtually anywhere and everywhere. Thus, it is  essential to check whether material operational risks have been  overlooked, monitor the overall status of risks, and manage/ control them. To this end, it is necessary to be able to quantify  risks using a measurement methodology that can be applied  to all types of operational risk, and to comprehensively and  comparatively capture the status of and changes in potential  operational risks of business processes. Also, from the viewpoint  of internal control, the measurement methodology used to create  a risk mitigation plan must be such that the implementation of the  plan quantitatively reduces operational risk.   SMFG and SMBC have received an approval from Japans  Financial Services Agency for the application of the Advanced  Measurement Approach (AMA), which is the most sophisticated  measurement method out of the three cited methods under Basel  II for measurement of operational risk. SMFG and SMBC have  adopted the AMA for operational risk management and for cal- culating operational risk-weighted assets. It has been used for  calculating the capital adequacy ratio since March 31, 2008.   When using the AMA, regulations require that the internal  measurement system (hereinafter, the quantification model)  must use four data elements (hereinafter, the four elements):  namely, internal loss data, external loss data, Business  Environment and Internal Control Factors (BEICFs), and sce- narios analysis through risk control assessments. In addition,  the operational risk equivalent amount (hereinafter, required  capital) calculated under the AMA must cover the maximum loss  comparable to a one-year holding period and a 99.9 percentile  confidence interval.   The basic framework of the AMA quantification model of  SMFG and SMBC is outlined in the diagram below. Among the  four elements, collected internal loss data and the results of  scenarios analysis through risk control assessment are input  directly into the quantification model described later in this  section to calculate required capital and risk-weighted assets  (= required capital divided by 8%). In addition, external loss data  and BEICFs are used in verifying the assessment of scenarios,  along with internal loss data, to increase objectivity, accuracy,  and completeness.   The specific content and method of collection and use of the  four elements are described below. At present, 21 Group compa- nies have adopted the AMA, including SMFG and SMBC, and all  Group companies collect and make use of the four elements.  Basic Framework of Operational Risk Measurement  of SMFG and SMBC (6) Risk Mitigation Initiatives (1) Internal Loss Data (2) External Loss Data (3) BEICFs Verifi- cation Data input (4)  Scenario  Analysis through  Risk Control  Assessments (5)  Measurement  Using the  Quantification  Model  SMFG 2010 46 (1) Internal Loss Data Internal loss data are defined as the information on events in  which SMFG and SMBC incur losses resulting from the realization  of operational risk. At SMFG and SMBC, internal loss data are  collected for all cases where the gross loss amount is at least  one yen (the threshold amount), and seven years of internal loss  data are directly used in the quantification of required capital for  operational risk. (2) External Loss Data External loss data are defined as the information on events in  which other banks, etc., incur losses resulting from the realization  of operational risk. SMFG and other Group companies collect  external loss data where such losses may occur within the Group.  Please note that SMFG and SMBC have compiled external loss  data for more than 7,000 cases over the past nine years, which  are indirectly used in quantifying required capital for operational  risk. (3)  Business Environment and Internal Control Factors  (BEICFs) BEICFs are defined as indicators of operational risk profiles of  SMFG and SMBC that reflect underlying business risk factors and  an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control factors.  The Group periodically collects data relating to changes in laws  and regulations, changes in internal rules and processes, and  launch of new business and products pertinent to the Groups  business operations. (4)  Scenario Analysis through Risk Control Assessments Risk control assessment is defined as risk management method- ology to (a) identify material operational risks, and describe them  in terms of risk scenarios, (b) assess the risks and the effective- ness of controls, and (c) estimate the frequency and severity of  risk scenarios. SMFG and SMBC apply this methodology to their  principal business activities.   The purpose of risk control assessment is to identify material  and potential operational risks pertinent to business processes,  to measure them, and to develop and carry out a risk mitiga- tion plan to manage the risks. Another purpose of risk control  assessment is to estimate the frequency of low-frequency and  high-severity events for each scenario (which may be difficult to  estimate using internal loss data alone).   During the process of periodic risk control assessment,  operational risks inherent in various business processes are  recognized as scenarios. The risk and control conditions  for each scenario are assessed, and the frequency of occur- rence and amount of losses are estimated based on them. The  assessment process comprises three steps: (i) initial assess- ment, (ii) Operational Risk Management Department review, and  (iii) final assessment. Through the process, the frequency of  low-frequency and high-severity events for each scenario are  estimated in terms of four loss amounts (100 million, 1 billion,  5 billion, and 10 billion). Please note that SMFG and SMBC  have identified more than 10,000 risk scenarios for the Group on  a consolidated basis.   As an effective mechanism for mitigating operational risks,  the maximum loss occurring once in 100 years (hereinafter,  (i) Initial Assessment (iii) Final Assessment (ii) Operational Risk Management Department Review Calculation  of required  capital Implementation  of risk mitigation  measures Review  of scenario  assessment Verification of  magnitude rating Check magnitude  rating empirically  against each risk  scenario Develop risk  mitigation plans Develop risk  mitigation plans by  scenario, focusing on  those with higher  magnitude rating Assess the magnitude  of scenarios Calculate the  maximum loss once  in 100 years and  assess the magnitude  and classify into five  categories Estimate the frequency  of the low-frequency and  high-severity loss cases Estimate the frequency  of the low-frequency  and high-severity  loss cases that are  difficult to estimate  using internal loss  data alone Estimate the  frequency of losses  for scenarios Estimate the  frequency of losses  by scenario, taking  account of past  internal loss data Estimate the severity  of losses  for scenarios Estimate the severity  of losses by scenario,  taking account of the  amount of  transactions used in  various operations Deriving  scenarios Identify risk patterns  inherent in business  processes and  develop a  comprehensive set of  scenarios Conduct assessment  of risks and controls  by scenario Assessment of  scenarios Flowchart for Risk Control Assessment (Example)  SMFG 2010 47 scenario exposure) is calculated for each scenario derived  through the risk control assessment, and then a magnitude rating  is provided by classifying them into five categories according to  the severity of loss. Risk mitigation plans are developed by the  relevant business units for those scenarios with high-severity risk  identified through magnitude rating.   The principal features of this risk control assessment method  are (1) objectivity, which is realized by estimating the frequency  of losses based on historical internal loss experience and by esti- mating the severity of losses based on the transaction amounts  pertinent to the scenarios, and (2) an appropriate level of sen- sitivity, because changes in the business environment and the  implementation of risk mitigation measures can be reflected in  the frequency and severity of losses by changing the assessment  of risk and control as well as transactions amounts. (5) Measurement Using the Quantification Model SMFG, SMBC, and other Group companies using the AMA  measure the maximum operational loss with a 99.9 percentile  confidence interval and a holding period of one year (hereinafter  referred to as 99.9% VaR) by using the four elements. In addition,  99.9% VaR is measured on an SMFG consolidated basis, SMBC  consolidated basis, and SMBC nonconsolidated basis. The  operational risk is measured for each of seven event types  defined under Basel II, and then, by calculating the simple sum  for all event types, 99.9% VaR is measured for each company  applying the AMA. Meanwhile, the Basic Indicator Approach  (BIA) is applied to estimate maximum operational risk losses for  Group companies other than those applying the AMA. Then, the  required capital and risk-weighted assets for SMFG and SMBC  Group are measured by aggregating these figures.   The outline of the quantification model for SMBC is as follows.  First, we generate a loss frequency distribution (number of loss  incidents over a one-year period) based on the number of histori- cal internal losses. Then, we generate a loss severity distribution  (amount of loss per loss incident) based on internal losses and  frequency of low-frequency and high-severity events obtained  through the risk control assessment.   By using the loss frequency and loss severity distribu- tions, the aggregated loss severity distribution is generated by  conducting Monte Carlo simulations and by generating various  combinations of loss occurrence and loss amount which are  simulated by changing these two factors. 99.0% VaR is calcu- lated from the resulting aggregated loss severity distribution.    Finally, we multiply 99.0% VaR by a conversion factor  mentioned later in the section of Capital Ratio Information to  compute 99.9% VaR.   This quantification model takes into account not only empiri- cal internal loss data but also potential risk (scenarios) identified  in the risk control assessment. An important feature of this model  is that it enables us to measure and reflect the low-frequency  and high severity events of operational risk. Moreover, by intro- ducing a conversion factor, it is unnecessary to directly estimate  99.9% VaR, which tends to have a lower accuracy, and stable  estimation results can be obtained by estimating 99.0% VaR  which can be estimated with higher accuracy. Measurement Using the Quantification Model Distribution of Loss Frequency Sampling of the  number of losses  from the distribution  (e.g., 5 incidents) 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Number of incidents/year Aggregated Loss Distribution 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 Aggregated annual loss amount Distribution of Loss Severity 0.30 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 Loss per incident 99.0% 99.9% x conversion factor Calculate aggregated  annual loss amount  (e.g., 450) Repeat (e.g., 1 million times) Total Sampling of the amounts  of losses corresponding  to the above number of  losses from the distribution  of losses (e.g., 50, 100, 80,  150, 70) Frequency x Severity Probability of occurrence  (frequency) Probability of occurrence  (frequency) Probability of occurrence  (frequency)  SMFG 2010 48   Please note that the accuracy of quantification model outputs  described above is secured through the regular ex ante and ex  post facto verification processes.   The breakdown of risk-weighted assets by event type for the  Group on a consolidated basis, computed with the previously  described quantification method, is as follows.  Breakdown of Consolidated Risk-Weighted Assets  by Event Type (March 31, 2010) Event Type Percentage (1) Internal fraud 10% (2) External fraud 7% (3) Employment practices and workplace safety 1% (4) Clients, products, and business practices 20% (5) Damage to physical assets 16% (6) Business disruption and system failures 4% (7) Execution, delivery, and process management 42% Note: Only risk-weighted assets calculated under the AMA. (6) Risk Mitigation Initiatives To mitigate risk using the quantitative results of the AMA, SMFG  and SMBC implement risk mitigation measures to high-severity risk  scenarios identified in the previously mentioned magnitude rating.   In addition to the above, the operational risk-weighted assets  calculated using the quantification methods are allocated to the  business units of SMBC and other Group companies, as part of  initiatives to mitigate risk for the Group as a whole.   Specifically, (1) at the beginning of each fiscal year, the  operational risk-weighted assets calculated using the internal  loss data and the scenario exposure determined from the risk  control assessment are allocated to each business unit and  Group company, (2) during the fiscal year, each business unit  and Group company work to prevent the realization of opera- tional risk and improve scenario control by implementing risk  mitigation measures, (3) during the first and second halves of the  fiscal year, the measurements of risk-weighted assets of each  business unit and Group company and an analysis of factors  causing the change from the previous half-year period (including  the frequency and severity of scenario) are fed back to the busi- ness units and Group companies for revising their plans, and,  (4) finally, at the end of the fiscal year, by comparing the planned  versus actual results, we endeavor to enhance the awareness  of operational risk, improve the effectiveness of operational risk  management, and mitigate operational risk within the Group as a  whole. Management Process/Roles of Organizational Units Objectives Magnitude rating  assignment of risk  scenarios Mitigation of  high-impact  operational risk  within the Group as  a whole Autonomous risk  management by  business units  and Group  companies as a  whole Planning Preparation of plans for risk  mitigation for high-impact risk  scenarios based on risk control  assessments Decision to implement plans made by  the Operational Risk Committee Calculation of planned targets of  each business unit and Group  company under the AMA Decision to implement related  operating plans of each department  and Group company made by the  Management Committee and other  decision-making and related bodies Implementation Implementation by the department  responsible for the risk scenario Implementation of risk mitigation  measures Implementation by the responsible  department within each business unit  and Group company Prevention of internal loss occurrence,  and improvements in risk and control  of risk scenarios Assessment and Review Decision to implement plans, etc.,  made by the Operational Risk  Committee Reassessment of scenarios by taking  account of the implementation of risk  mitigation measures.

Processing Risk Processing risk is the possibility of losses arising from negligent  processing by employees, accidents, or unauthorized activities.    SMFG recognizes that all operations entail processing risk.  We are, therefore, working to raise the level of sophistication of  our management of processing risk across the whole Group by  ensuring that each branch conducts its own regular investiga- tions of processing risk; minimizing losses in the event of pro- cessing errors or negligence by drafting exhaustive contingency  plans; and carrying out thorough quantification of the risk under  management.    In the administrative regulations of SMBC, in line with SMFGs  Groupwide basic policies for risk management, the basic  administrative regulations are defined as comprehending the  risks and costs of administration and transaction processing, and  managing them accordingly, and seeking to raise the quality  of administration to deliver high-quality service to customers.  Adding new policies or making major revisions to existing ones  for processing risk management requires the approval of both  the Management Committee and the Board of Directors.   In the administrative regulations, SMBC has also defined  specific rules for processing risk management. The rules  allocate processing risk management tasks among six types  of departments: operations planning departments, compliance  departments, operations departments, transaction execution  departments (primarily front-office departments, branches, and  branch service offices), internal audit departments, and the cus- tomer support departments. In addition, there is a specialized  group within the Operations Planning Department to strengthen  administrative procedures throughout the Group. 5. System Risk System risk is the possibility of a loss arising from the failure,  malfunction, or unauthorized use of computer systems.    SMFG recognizes that reliable computer systems are essen- tial for the effective implementation of management strategy  in view of the IT revolution. We strive to minimize system risk  by drafting regulations and specific management standards,  including a security policy. We also have contingency plans with  the goal of minimizing losses in the event of a system failure.  The development of such a system risk management system  ensures that the Group as a whole is undertaking adequate risk  management.    At SMBC, safety measures are strengthened according to risk  assessment based on the Financial Services Agencys Financial  Inspection Manual, and the Security Guidelines published by the  Center for Financial Industry Information Systems (FISC).    Computer-related trouble at financial institutions now has  greater potential to impact society, with system risk diversifying  owing to the IT revolution, the resulting expansion of networks  and the rise in the number of personal computer users. To pre- vent any computer system breakdowns, we have taken numer- ous measures, including constant maintenance of our computer  system to ensure steady and uninterrupted operation, duplication  of various systems and infrastructures, and the establishment of  a disaster-prevention system consisting of computer centers in  eastern and western Japan. And to maintain the confidentiality  of customer information and prevent information leaks, sensi- tive information is encrypted, unauthorized external access is  blocked, and all known countermeasures to secure data are  implemented. There are also contingency plans and training  sessions held as necessary to ensure full preparedness in the  event of an emergency. To maintain security, countermeasures  are revised as new technologies and usage patterns emerge. Settlement Risk Settlement risk is the possibility of a loss arising from a trans- action that cannot be settled as planned. Because this risk  comprises elements of several types of risk, including credit,  liquidity, processing, and system risk, it requires interdisciplinary  management.   At SMBC, the Operations Planning Department is respon- sible for coordinating the management of settlement risk with the  Credit & Investment Planning Department, which oversees credit  risk, and the Corporate Risk Management Department, which  oversees liquidity risk.  SMFG 2010 50 Contributing to the Sustainable Development of Society SMFGs goal is to earn the highest trust of society by meeting  the publics expectations and fulfilling its social responsibilities.  Earning the highest level of trust requires the balanced provision  of value to our four constituencies: customers, shareholders  and the market, the environment and society, and employees.  Through this process, we aim to contribute to the sustainable  development of society as a whole, and to fulfill our corporate  social responsibility. Basic CSR Policies As a basis for implementing its CSR activities, SMFG has  formulated a definition of CSR and a set of business ethics that  articulate its basic principles for the Group. SMFGs Definition of CSR In the conduct of its business activities, SMFG fulfills its social responsibilities  by contributing to the sustainable development of society as a whole through  offering higher added value to (i) customers, (ii) shareholders and the market,  (iii) the environment and society, and (iv) employees. Common SMFG CSR Philosophy: Business Ethics I.  Satisfactory Customer Services    We intend to be a financial services group that has the complete trust and  support of our customers. For this purpose, we will always provide services  that meet the true needs of our customers to assure their satisfaction and  earn confidence in the Group. II.  Sound Management    We intend to be a financial services group that maintains fair, transparent,  and sound management based on the principle of self-responsibility. For  this purpose, along with earning the firm confidence of our shareholders,  our customers, and the general public, we take a long-term view of our  business and operate it efficiently, and actively disclose accurate business  information about the Group. Through these activities, we work to maintain  continued growth based on a sound financial position. III.  Contributing to Social Development    We intend to be a financial services group that contributes to the healthy  development of society. For this purpose, we recognize the importance of  our mission to serve as a crucial part of the public infrastructure and also  our social responsibilities. With such recognition, we undertake business  operations that contribute to the steady development of Japan and the rest  of the world, and endeavor, as a good corporate citizen, to make a positive  contribution to society. IV.  Free and Active Business Environment    We intend to be a financial services group for which all officers and  employees work with pride and commitment. For this purpose, we respect  people and develop employees with extensive professional knowledge and  capabilities, thereby creating a free and active business environment. V.  Compliance    We intend to be a financial services group that always keeps in mind the  importance of compliance. For this purpose, we reflect our awareness  of Business Ethics in our business activities at all times. In addition, we  respond promptly to directives from auditors and inspectors. Through  these actions, we observe all laws and regulations, and uphold moral  standards in our business practices. Key Points of CSR Activities The key points of our CSR activities are as follows. First of all,  we have created a solid management framework, including  corporate governance, internal auditing, compliance, and risk  management systems. Second, we offer higher added value to  our four major stakeholder groups in the following ways.     We endeavor to develop and prosper with our customers  by offering top-quality, high-value-added products and  services.     We maintain sound management through disclosing appro- priate information, designing and operating robust internal  control systems, and managing to increase shareholder  value.     We implement initiatives on a continuing and active basis to  contribute to society and preserve the natural environment.     We work to foster a free and active business environment  that emphasizes respect for individuals and allows employ- ees to realize their full potential.   Finally, we ultimately contribute to the sustainable develop- ment of society through all these activities. Implementing CSR Activities and Business Growth Strategies in Tandem SMFG and the Group companies position CSR activities as the  basis for the effective implementation of business growth strate- gies and conduct these activities in tandem with their strategies  to attain management objectives.   The proper conduct of CSR activities is clearly an integral  part of management itself, and commitment to serious  implementation of CSR initiatives is the shortest path to reaching  management objectives.

The  Quality Management Department is primarily responsible for  analyzing the VOC data. Reports of this department are then dis- cussed by the CS and Quality Improvement Committee, whose  members include the chairman and directors who are members  of the banks Management Committee, and these reports are  used proactively to enhance the satisfaction of our customers  and the quality of our services.    In parallel with these activities, we are undertaking a wide  range of initiatives for improving customer satisfaction and  quality. These include conducting questionnaire surveys to obtain  the opinions of a broader range of customers by interviewing  them at our branches and offices and via mail. Also, to provide  services that will meet with greater customer satisfaction, we are  conducting related training and educational programs. VOC Database We have also created a VOC database, a record of the opinions  that our customers have expressed, principally at our branches,  and are working to make this database widely available within the  bank. In addition, the data is analyzed and used by the Quality  Management Department to provide guidance to our branches  and to make improvement proposals to the Head Office  departments so they can establish bankwide CS enhancement  measures.    The Head Office departments also analyze the VOC data  themselves and employ the results to make improvements in  products and services. CS and Quality Improvement Committee CS and Quality Improvement Committee, which is chaired by  the president of SMBC, meets periodically to hear reports on the  specific opinions that customers have expressed and to review  the fluctuations in the number of opinions expressed from month  to month. The committee also receives reports on the results of  analyses of VOC and proposals for improvements, and members  of management represented on the committee listen to these  reports and consider appropriate courses of action.    In addition, to instill the awareness of making our activities  more customer centric, we prepare documents containing points  based on specific examples and distribute these throughout  the bank. We also arrange for study meetings and implement  other measures, and the content of these activities is reported to  members of management for their consideration.    Moreover, to enhance customer satisfaction and the quality of  our products and services from a broader point of view, we invite  specialists familiar with these and related areas to provide their  advice.  Initiatives for Enhancing Customer Satisfaction (CS) and Quality Working closely with Group companies, SMFG is taking initiatives to enhance customer satisfaction and the quality of Group services and  products. SMFG calls meetings of its Group Customer Satisfaction Committee periodically to review reports based on analyses of the  Voice of the Customers (VOC) and discuss measures to increase customer satisfaction.

To  implement the ideas contained in our Group philosophy, we  believe one of the issues with highest priority is strengthening  and improving our corporate governance system.  The SMFG Corporate Governance System SMFG employs the corporate auditor governance model in  which statutory auditors oversee the execution of business by  the directors. At SMFG, we have six corporate auditors, three of  whom are outside auditors. The auditors monitor the execution of  business operations of SMFG and its subsidiaries by attending  meetings of the Board of Directors and listen to reports on opera- tions from the directors and others. They also examine docu- ments relating to important decisions and receive reports from  the internal audit departments, representatives of subsidiaries of  SMFG, and the CPAs.    The chairman of SMFG serves as the chairman of the Board  of Directors of SMFG. This separates the role of the president,  whose responsibility is the overall supervision of business  activities of SMFG and other Group companies, from the role of  supervising management. To enhance the effectiveness of the  Board, we have appointed outside directors and formed four  governance committees: namely, the Auditing Committee, the  Risk Management Committee, the Compensation Committee,  and the Nominating Committee. Outside directors have been  appointed to all four of these committees to provide for corpo- rate governance from an objective perspective. As the need  for objectivity is particularly acute in the case of the Auditing  Committee and the Compensation Committee, outside directors  serve as the chairmen of these committees. To ensure that the  execution of the Groups business operations is in conformity  both with legal regulations and generally accepted practices, the  outside directors have been selected from among the ranks of  specialists (including CPAs, lawyers, and consultants).    SMFG has created the Management Committee to serve as  the top decision-making body, and it is under the direct super- vision of the Board of Directors and chaired by the president  of SMFG. This committee is composed of directors chosen by  the president. Its role is to consider important matters related to  the execution of business and to make decisions for or against  the execution of matters in accord with the basic policies of the  Board of Directors. SMFG also has a Group Strategy Committee  that serves as a forum for the top managers of SMFG and all  other Group companies to exchange opinions and information  on their respective business plans. To enable SMFG to monitor  the execution of day-to-day business operations at SMBC, 10  SMFG directors (including three outside directors) of the total of  11 SMFG directors (including three outside directors) also serve  as directors of SMBC. To monitor the conduct of operations at  three major Group companies, namely, SMFG Card & Credit,  Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing Co., Ltd., and The  Japan Research Institute, Limited, the SMFG director in charge  of each of these subsidiaries serves as a director (and can be an  outside director) of these companies.    Furthermore, to maintain the soundness of management,  SMFG has established internal control systems to ensure the  proper conduct of company operations following the Japanese  Company Law. Designing and implementing an internal control  system, to strengthen management systems, is regarded as a  major issue, and initiatives are under way to enhance such inter- nal control systems. The SMBC Corporate Governance System  SMBC employs the corporate auditor governance model. Of the  six statutory auditors appointed, three are from outside the bank.  To ensure sound and transparent management, SMBC separates  the two functions of management decision-making at the opera- tional level and the overall supervision of the conduct of duties by  the management of the bank. For this purpose, the bank employs  a system under which executive officers are responsible for  operational duties, while the supervisory functions are performed  principally by the Board.    The chairman of the bank serves as the chairman of the  Board of Directors, and, to clearly separate his functions from  those of the president of the bank, who is responsible for the  overall supervision of the banks activities, the chairman does  not simultaneously serve as an executive officer and is primar- ily responsible for supervising managements execution of their  duties. As at SMFG and to ensure a robust supervisory func- tion, outside directors are appointed to the Board of Directors.  At SMBC, three outside directors currently serve on the Board,  which has a total membership of sixteen.    Executive officers are appointed by the Board to manage  the operation of SMBCs businesses. As of June 30, 2010, SMBC  has 72 executive officers, including the president, and 12 serve  concurrently as directors. The Management Committee of SMBC  is the highest decision-making body at the operational level and  is under the direct supervision of the Board of Directors. The  president chairs this committee and selects its members from  the executive officers. The committee members consider impor- tant management issues based on policies set by the Board of  Directors, and the president has the authority to make the final  decision after considering the committees recommendations.    The president designates certain members of the  Management Committee to be Authorized Management  Committee members in charge of particular Head Office depart- ments or units. All of these designated individuals are in charge  of implementing the directives of the Management Committee  within the businesses they oversee.

The Internal Auditing Committee meets every quarter,  and its members discuss important matters related to internal  auditing based on reports prepared by the departments respon- sible for internal audits. There is also the Audit Department, which  is an internal auditing unit that is independent of the operational  departments of the Group.    The Audit Department conducts internal audits of the opera- tions of all the Groups units and departments to contribute to  optimal management and ensure the proper conduct of the  Groups operations and the soundness of its assets. These audits  also have the function of verifying that the Groups internal control  systems, including compliance and risk management, are oper- ating appropriately and effectively. The Audit Department is also  responsible for the overall supervision of the internal audit sys- tems of Group companies. It monitors the appropriateness and  effectiveness of the internal audit systems at Group companies  by verifying past data related to internal auditing and monitoring  activities, which include inspections and other activities based on  actual samples, and, when deemed necessary, by conducting  audits. Based on these activities, the Audit Department provides  recommendations and guidance to the business units and  departments as well as Group companies.    At SMBC, we have formed auditing departments that are  independent of bank units involved in marketing and other busi- ness activities. Within the Internal Audit Unit of SMBC, we have  formed two departments: the Internal Audit Department and the  Credit Review Department. As at SMFG, SMBC has an Internal  Auditing Committee which is a part of its Management Committee  and responsible for examining and conducting deliberations on  reports on important matters submitted by the Internal Audit Unit.    The Internal Audit Unit is responsible for auditing compliance  and risk management at SMBC - its head office departments,  domestic and overseas branches - and SMBC group companies.  Auditing of operations of head office departments is conducted  by assessing the appropriateness of all internal control systems  of each department. In addition, audits of head office depart- ments focus on material issues that arise in the management of  specific operations and categories of risk. These auditing activi- ties emphasize the verification of Targeted Audit Items across  the whole of the banks organization.    Moreover, audits of branches and offices are not limited just  to checking for control and other deficiencies but also include  pointing out compliance and risk management problems and  making recommendations for corrective action. In other Group  companies, internal audit departments have been formed suited  to the respective nature of each companys lines of business.  Initiatives to Enhance the Sophistication and  Efficiency of Internal Auditing The Audit Department has adopted methods following the stan- dards of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA)*, an international  organization. The Audit Department conducts risk-based audits  and works to apply best practices to Group companies.    To fulfill effectively its role as the department in overall charge  of internal auditing, the Audit Department is constantly endeavor- ing to advance the professional skills of personnel engaged in  internal auditing. Activities include collecting the latest informa- tion on internal auditing from inside and outside Japan and dis- seminating it to all Group companies. Also, the Audit Department  organizes training courses, led by outside experts, for the staff of  Group companies and encourages them to obtain international  qualifications to enhance their professional knowledge and skills in  internal auditing. To improve further the effectiveness of auditing,  we also take active measures on a Groupwide basis to assess the  quality of our internal auditing in the light of IIA standards. * The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) was founded in 1941 in the United States as an  organization dedicated to helping raise the level of specialization and professionalism  of internal auditing staff. In addition to conducting theoretical and practical research on  internal auditing, the IIA administers examinations for Certified Internal Auditor (CIA),  which is the internationally recognized qualification in this field. Internal Audit System  SMFG 2010 54 Basic Compliance Policies As a financial services group offering a multiplicity of products  and services, SMFG is intensifying its efforts to maintain high  standards of compliance to carry out its mission as an impor- tant part of the nations public infrastructure and fulfill its social  responsibilities. Through these efforts, SMFG is becoming a truly  outstanding global corporate group.    At SMFG, we have positioned compliance as one of the  principal supports of our Business Ethics (please refer to page  50), which serve as the basic principles for fulfilling our corporate  social responsibility (CSR). Accordingly, we regard strengthening  our compliance systems as one of our top management priorities. Group Management from a Compliance  Perspective As a financial holding company, SMFG seeks to maintain and  enhance systems for providing appropriate direction, guidance,  and monitoring for the compliance and related systems of Group  companies to ensure the sound and proper conduct of business  activities throughout the entire Group.    Specific activities include holding regular meetings that  are attended by representatives of Group companies, as well  as meetings with individual companies, with the objective of  overseeing the state of autonomously implemented compliance  functions at those companies. The priority areas for strengthen- ing oversight in fiscal 2010 include (a) guidance and oversight  of Group companies to deal with a changing regulatory envi- ronment, and (b) creation of an internal management structure  appropriate for a comprehensive financial services group. These  measures will enable us to strengthen compliance management  at the individual Group company level. Hotline for Reporting Improper Accounting and  Auditing Activities SMFG has established the SMFG Accounting and Auditing  Hotline to provide a channel for individuals within and outside  the Group to report improper activities. This hotline enables  us to quickly identify and take action against fraud and other  misconduct involving accounting and auditing at SMFG and its  consolidated subsidiaries.  Reports can be submitted by post or e-mail as follows. Post SMFG Accounting and Auditing Hotline Iwata Godo Attorneys and Counsellors at Law 10th floor, Marunouchi Building 2-4-1 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-6310 e-mail smfghotline@iwatagodo.com *  The hotline accepts alerts of improper activities concerning account- ing and auditing at SMFG and its consolidated subsidiaries. *  Anonymous reports are accepted, but, if possible, please provide  personal information such as your name and contact number. *  Please provide as much detail as you can regarding the activities.

General  Managers General Managers Area Compliance Officers Compliance Officers Compliance Officers Directions,  Monitoring and  Legal Support Front-Line Offices   (Corporate Business Offices, Branches) Strengthening Compliance Systems  Compliance with laws, regulations, and other social standards  is a basic requirement for corporations in general. Especially for  banks, compliance is a particularly important issue because of  their public mission and social responsibilities as key players in  the financial system and socioeconomic infrastructure.    SMBC, in line with the basic policy of SMFG, requires all its  management and staff to assign the highest value to maintaining  peoples trust, abiding by relevant laws and regulations, uphold- ing high ethical standards, and acting fairly and sincerely. SMBC,  therefore, positions maintenance of high standards of compli- ance as one of its most important management priorities, and  is committed to always abiding by the Banking Law, Financial  Instruments and Exchange Act and other legislation and taking  preventive measures against financial activities of anti-social  forces.  Management of the Compliance System  SMBC adopts a basic, two-tiered structure to ensure compliance.  First, each department and office is held individually responsible  for making before the fact decisions that ensure its conduct com- plies with laws and regulations. Second, an independent, Internal  Audit Unit conducts rigorous audits of department and branch  compliance.    To maintain this two-tiered structure and ensure it is operat- ing effectively, the Compliance Unit, which includes the General  Affairs Department and the Legal Department, plans and imple- ments systems and system improvements to secure compliance,  acting under directions from management. The Compliance  Unit also provides guidance and conducts monitoring activities  regarding the activities of all departments and branches, and  assists departments and branches make compliance decisions.    The framework of SMBCs compliance system is shown in  the diagram at the bottom of this page. To ensure that this frame- work functions effectively, SMBC also engages in the activities  described in the following paragraphs.    Issuance of a Compliance Manual To assist management and staff in choosing proper courses of  action, SMBC has prepared its Compliance Manual containing 60  principles for action that provide objectives and guidance. This  manual has been approved by the Board of Directors, and all  management and staff have been fully apprised of its contents. Preparation of Compliance Programs With the objectives of ensuring that compliance systems function  effectively and making necessary improvements in compliance  systems within SMBC and its consolidated subsidiaries, the  Board of Directors prepares a specific plan for compliance- related activities each fiscal year, including review of and  necessary revisions to regulations and training. In fiscal 2010,  measures focusing on better adapting our compliance posture  to social change are being implemented, including a review of  our marketing practices for derivative and other products which  entail risk, creating more effective mechanisms for resolving  complaints and conflict in anticipation of establishment of a new  Japanese financial-sector ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution)  mechanism, further measures to facilitate financing to SMEs and  mortgage borrowers, and taking further preventive measures  against financial activities of anti-social forces. Appointment of Compliance Officers In addition to the compliance officers appointed within the banks  departments and branches, we have appointed Area Compliance  Officers, who are independent from frontline departments,  within certain of our business units including the Middle Market  Banking Unit and the Consumer Banking Unit. These officers are  responsible for directing and overseeing compliance regarding  transactions carried out by the staff of our branches and other  frontline offices.  Formation of the Compliance Committee To ensure that compliance issues related to various operations  within the bank are reviewed and discussed comprehensively,  we have formed the Compliance Committee, which has members  drawn from across the organization. This committee is chaired  by the director responsible for compliance issues and includes  the heads of relevant departments. To enhance the fairness and  objectivity of the committees deliberations, outside members  also participate in the Compliance Committee meetings.  SMFG 2010 56 Environmental Preservation Initiatives The Group recognizes environmental preservation to be one of its most important management issues. Based  on our Group Environmental Policy, we are implementing initiatives to preserve and achieve harmony with the  natural environment in our corporate activities. SMFG is a signatory to the Statement by Financial Institutions on  the Environment and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The Group Environmental Policy Basic Concepts Recognizing the importance of realizing a sustainable society, SMFG is making continuous efforts to harmonize environmental preserva- tion and corporate activities, in order to support the economy and contribute to the general well-being of society as a whole.  Specific Environmental Policies   We provide environment-friendly financial products, information, and solutions that help our customers in their efforts to preserve the  eco-system.    We devise ways to reduce levels of environmental risk posed by our own activities and those of society at large.    We are determined to fulfill our social responsibilities through the conservation of resources, energy saving, and the reduction of  waste.    We enforce a policy of strict adherence to environment-related laws and regulations.    We practice a high level of disclosure of information relating to the Groups environmental activities, and make ceaseless efforts to  improve our contribution to environmental preservation, incorporating the views of our staff and concerned persons from outside the  Group.    We place a high priority on thoroughly educating our staff in our environmental principles, and in ensuring that they conform to these  principles in the performance of their work.    We actively and effectively conduct environmentally aware management, and make continuous efforts to improve our system for tack- ling environmental issues, including by setting targets for each business term and reviewing them when deemed advisable.    These policies are published on the Groups website, and are also available in printed form upon request. Three Pillars of Groups Activities  Environmental Action Plan and the PDCA Cycle The three pillars of our environmental action plan are to  reduce environmental impact, manage environmental  risk, and promote environmental businesses. We set  environmental objectives for various activities and follow  the PDCA (plan, do, check, and act) cycle in these envi- ronmental activities. SMFG and principal Group companies  have obtained ISO 14001 certification, the international  standard for environmental management systems (EMS).

SMBC has made its Head Office carbon neutral through  the procurement of green sources of energy and purchases of  carbon credits.* Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasings Tokyo  Head Office is also carbon neutral. *  Carbon credits are also referred to as Kyoto credits, emission allow- ances, and Certified Emission Reductions (CER). In this annual report,  we use carbon credits to refer to these and the other concepts recog- nized under the Kyoto Protocol.   Response to Amended Act on the Rational Use of Energy In April 2010, the amendments to the Act on the Rational Use  of Energy came into effect, and as a result, the standard unit  for evaluation of energy management was changed from the  individual factory or office building to the entire company.  Companies using 1,500kl or more of energy (crude oil equivalent)  per annum are now required to establish an energy consumption  management system and draw up medium- to long-term plans for  improving energy efficiency, with the aim of reducing the volume  of energy consumed by at least 1% per year. In response, the  Group is taking measures to reduce energy consumption at all  workplaces, and is also developing a consultancy business to  meet the needs of customers attempting to conserve energy and  reduce CO2 emissions.   Greening Bank Operations SMBC has been steadily applying green IT to its branch terminals  and ATMs. The new CUTE terminal for handling over-the-counter  transactions, which was jointly developed with NEC Corporation  and Oki Electric Industry Co., Ltd., uses highly functional image  processing to electronically store documents, mainly copies of  drivers license and other forms of IDs, for a reduction in paper  usage of 3 million A4 sheets per year. SMBC donated part of the  cost savings resulting from the introduction of this system to the  Tokyo Metropolitan Governments Green Tokyo Fund, specifically  for the Creating Umi-no-Mori (Sea Forest) project, one of the  funds four greening projects.   In April 2010, SMBC began storing ATM transaction data,  which had hitherto been printed out on paper (the ATM Journal),  in the CUTE operations processing server. This is expected to  save 28 million A4 sheets annually. Managing Environmental Risk   Dealing with Soil Contamination and Asbestos Risk To deal with the risk that land pledged as collateral by borrowers  may be contaminated, SMBC requires contamination risk assess- ment for land meeting certain criteria. When the risk is judged to  be high, the assessed value of the potential risk is deducted from  the value of the collateral.   In addition, similar measures are taken regarding asbestos  risk â€” risk assessments are conducted for asset collateral meet- ing certain criteria, and the assessed value of the potential risk is  deducted from the value of the collateral. SMBC also encourages  its customers to have structures surveyed more comprehensively  for asbestos pollution. Regarding its own premises, SMBC sur- veys and properly removes asbestos from structures.   Adoption of the Equator Principles SMBC has adopted the Equator Principles, a set of principles for  determining, assessing and managing social and environmental  risk in project financing. Its Environment Analysis Department  assesses the social and environmental risk of large-scale projects  in accordance with the Equator Principles.  Flow Chart of SMBCs Social and Environmental   Risk Assessment Promoting Environmental Businesses The Group pursues environmental business as an effective way  of contributing to society and the international community.   SMBC, in particular, formed the cross-organizational Eco- Biz Promotion Council in fiscal 2005 to discuss periodically the  development of sophisticated and efficient products and services  that contribute to environmental maintenance and improvement. Topics l SMBC Environmental Assessment Loan/Private  Placement Bond  SMBC wins 2009 Nikkei Veritas Superiority Award SMBC received the Nikkei Veritas Award for Superiority at  the 2009 Nikkei Superior Products and Services Awards for  its SMBC Environmental Assessment Loan/Private Placement  Bond, a financial product developed in collaboration with the  Japan Research Institute. In this product, the environmental  friendliness of the business operations of a corporate customer  seeking to raise funds is assessed using JRIs own assess- ment standards. The terms and conditions of the loan or bond  are then set in accordance with the results of the assessment.  SMBC has received high praise for  this product, which aims to support  companies that are helping to pre- serve the global environment. l New Bank Branch Terminal  â€” CUTE  Receives Special Award in Green IT AWARD 2009 The new CUTE terminal used in our branches, jointly devel- oped by SMBC with NEC Corporation and Oki Electric Industry  Co., Ltd., received a special award at the Green IT AWARD  2009, held by the Green IT Promotion Council. The award was  given for CUTEs significant contribution to reducing the envi- ronmental impact of bank operations by realizing paperless  processing using IT, as well as for being a good example of  how companies in different industries can collaborate to help  preserve the environment. This is the first time the award has  been received by a bank.

Loans extended: 100 billion to 30 companies (as of March 31, 2010) Eco-Products International Fair  At the fifth (March 2009) and sixth (March 2010) fair, SMFG president Teisuke Kitayama chaired the planning committees and  oversaw the booths, international conferences and other activities. Ministry of Environments interest-free  financing program The Ministry of the Environment operates a special interest-free financing program to support the attainment of the objectives  under the Kyoto Protocol. Companies receive loans from financial institutions with interest subsidized by the government to  finance capital investment, on condition that they set CO2 emission reduction targets and achieve them within a specified period.  As one of the financial institutions authorized to make loans under this program, SMBC provides support for companies tackling  environmental issues. Global ECOBIZ Assist This program supports the globalization of Japanese companies with environmental technologies by offering preferential fees  and interest rates on loans for international trade. It offers these to midsize and SME companies that develop and manufacture  equipment related to water, waste materials, new energy, the atmosphere, energy conservation and other areas (soil pollution  remediation, greening, recovery of natural areas, etc.). Assistance in using the domestic  carbon credit system SMBC and Group companies are working on a program for assisting CO2 emission reduction activities by using the domestic  carbon credit system that began in October 2008. Carbon-credit related business   activities (matching, advisory, trust and  consulting activities) SMBC serves customers with needs involving carbon credits by using overseas offices, trust functions and other resources to  offer products and services such as introduction of sellers in developing countries, advisory service to support transactions,  trust products, and financing. SMBC established a consulting company in Brazil to assist in development of Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM) projects. Carbon credit trading In June 2009, SMBC became a carbon credit dealer, the first Japanese bank to purchase and sell carbon credits directly with  customers. Matching Business SMBC utilizes its network of overseas offices to introduce valuable partners in developing countries for corporate customers  planning to set up or expand business operations overseas. Strengthening alliances with   international and financial institutions In March 2010, with the aim of providing financing for renewable energy projects and developing its carbon credits trading and  other businesses, SMBC signed a memorandum of understanding with International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Environmental  Cooperation-Asia (ECO-Asia), a regional program of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). SMBC has  been forging business alliances with local financial institutions and economic organizations in Malaysia, the Philippines, Brazil and  other countries as part of an effort to build a stronger global network. Climate & Children Supporters  SMBC and UNICEF started this program to target both the causes and results of climate change. When participating companies  buy carbon credits to fight global warming, monetary contributions to the program are also made to aid a developing country  (Mozambique) that is suffering from the effects of global warming.  Individuals SMBC Nikko World Bank Green Fund SMBC and Nikko Cordial Securities started marketing SMBC Nikko World Bank Green Fund, launched by Nikko Asset Management  Co., Ltd. in collaboration with the World Bank. The fund is the worlds first fund that invests in World Bank green bonds. DWS New Resource Technology Fund  To adapt to global shifts and growth in demand patterns, this fund invests mainly in stocks of companies worldwide with excellent  growth prospects involving businesses associated with three themes of infrastructure, food and clean energy. Environmental campaign using JGBs  for individuals SMBC has been conducting an environmental campaign for each issue of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) since June 2008.  Since June 2010, when SMBC began handling a new series of three-year JGBs for individuals, SMBC has used part of its earnings  from the sale of these bonds to purchase a 100kg carbon credit per customer, and transfers the credits gratis to the Japanese  government, thereby helping to reduce Japans volume of greenhouse gas emissions. SMBC SMFL*3 Individuals Corporate Leading the Tokyo Metropolitan  Governments Eco-Finance Project SMBC has been selected as a core financial institution in the Eco-Finance Project being implemented by the Tokyo Metropolitan  Government over a 5-year period starting in fiscal 2009. In this project, the fund deposited by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government  with SMBC is used to meet a wide range of needs, conditioned on satisfying certain environmental standards, from financing and  leasing for corporate clients to mortgage loans, automobile loans, and fixed-term deposits for individuals. Corporate eco japan cup  This is a contest for selecting companies that have practical environmental technologies and ideas. SMBC gives assistance to  those venture companies jointly with Japanese universities and thereby provides support for their R&D activities. SMFL Carbon-neutral leases  Started in August 2007, this is a new service that renders the greenhouse gases released by leased assets neutral through  the allocation of carbon credits to these assets. The goal is to provide more support to companies that protect the environment  through their own activities. Consulting business related to amended  Act on the Rational Use of Energy SMFL is enhancing environmental advisory services for companies in response to the amended Act on the Rational Use of Energy.  This includes comprehensive energy conservation proposals that utilize leases. JRI Environmental advisory business  This business is involved in many projects centered on waste treatment and energy. The objective is to combat global warming  and support the growth of environmental companies by creating new businesses.  JRI SMBC SMBCCN*4 JRIS*5 Consulting for construction of Tianjin  Eco-City, and attracting Japanese  companies Leveraging its environmental business expertise, JRI is creating a plan for the use of renewable energy at the Tianjin Eco-City,  Chinas first national project for an environmentally sustainable city. SMBC, SMBCCN and JRIS have signed a basic agreement  with the Tianjin Eco-City Administrative Committee on initiatives to attract Japanese companies to the Tianjin Eco-City project. SMCC*6 Individuals Web Registration Campaign SMCC is vigorously promoting the use of online account statements (the total bill amount is e-mailed and the details are posted on  its website) as a means of conserving paper and helping cut CO2 emissions. *1 Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation   *2 The Japan Research Institute Limited   *3 Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing Co., Ltd.   *4 Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (China) Limited    *5 The Japan Research Institute (Shanghai) Consulting Co., Ltd.   *6 Sumitomo Mitsui Card Company, Limited  SMFG 2010 59 SMFG Environmental Business Forum at  Eco-Products 2009 The Eco-Products exhibition, held each December, is one of Japans largest environ- mental exhibitions. Following on from last years event, SMFG once again held the  SMFG Environmental Business Forum, comprising different types of environmental  business events.    Targeting many different types of stakeholder, such as those seeking to newly  enter the environmental business field, those looking to expand their marketing  channels, and those examining their options regarding information gathering, SMFG   conducted business matching, set up booths with catalogs, and held lectures, semi- nars, and other programs. By these means, SMFG provided forums for representatives  of companies in the environmental field to meet and exchange information, thereby  giving rise to new business opportunities.   Over the three-day duration of the exhibition, we held 17 seminars on various  topics, as well as panel discussions. About 500 cases of business matching were  arranged, and 41 companies had booths showcasing their products and services.  In all, the SMFG Environmental Business Forum hosted a large number of business  negotiations on new environmental technologies,  products, and services. Eco-Products International Fair 2010 This international fair is held every year to promote the growth of environmental  businesses in the Asia-Pacific region and increase their global competitiveness by  making their supply chains more eco-friendly. SMBC was a member of the Preparatory  Committee in 2009 and 2010. The sixth Eco-Products International Fair, held in March  2010 in Jakarta, Indonesia, was the largest ever with 164 Asian companies and  organizations participating, and more than 90,000 visitors during the 4-day event.     At the international conference held parallel to the fair, lectures were given and  panel discussions by world leaders and specialists on environmental issues from many  countries were held. SMBC and JRI participated in a session on Eco Business and  Climate Change, and representatives of the two companies made presentations on  the outlook for and initiatives on carbon credits business in Asia. Advisory services for the Tianjin Eco-City  Project The Tianjin Eco-City project is a large-scale eco-friendly urban development project  being undertaken in China at the national government level, in line with the countrys  policy on the environment and energy. The development of the Eco-City is guided by  22 quantitative key performance indicators which are set at high levels, such as a  renewable energy utilization rate of 20% or higher and a green building* rate of 100%,  in order to harmonize human activities with the natural environment, conserve natural  resources, and efficiently recycle resources.    The Japan Research Institute (JRI) has drawn up the plan for achieving the  renewable energy utilization rate of 20% or higher, including the technologies and  their implementation methodology. SMBC, meanwhile, has signed a business alliance  agreement with Tianjin Eco-City Administrative Committee, together with Sumitomo  Mitsui Banking Corporation (China) Limited, JRI, and the Japan Research Institute  (Shanghai) Consulting Co., Ltd., to attract Japanese companies to the Tianjin Eco-City  project.   Moving forward, SMBC will further reinforce the services to Japanese companies  setting up operations in the area by enhancing the collaboration with both Tianjin  City and the Tianjin Eco-City project. JRI will actively promote initiatives for launching  environment-/energy-related projects not only in the Tianjin Eco-City, but in many other  parts of China, too. SMBC Begins Handling World Bank Green Fund On February 1, 2010, SMBC and Nikko Cordial Securities commenced handling of the  SMBC Nikko World Bank Green Fund, an investment trust launched by Nikko Asset  Management Co., Ltd.   This fund is the worlds first fund  developed in cooperation with the World  Bank that invests in World Bank green  bonds. The World Bank green bonds  support World Bank-funded projects in  developing countries to mitigate global  warming. A portion of the profits from this  green fund will be donated to UNICEF and  the Japanese Red Cross.

Donations to Organizations Assisting Senior Citizens SMBC Friend Securities has been donating part of the income  from a fund that invests in companies contributing to the bet- terment of the aging population to organizations that assist and  provide nursing care for the elderly. Fundamental approach to social contribution activities  SMFG and its Group companies, in consideration of the public service nature of the financial services industry, recognize the  importance of using business operations to contribute to the development of society. In addition to this contribution to society  through day-to-day business operations, we must also act as a responsible corporate citizen by engaging in activities that help lay  the foundations for a better society in the future. In the spirit of corporate citizenship, SMFG and its Group companies will fulfill their  social obligations through a broad range of activities.  Policy on social contribution activities  SMFG and its Group companies understand their role as responsible corporate citizens, and undertake activities that contribute  to the realization of a prosperous and sustainable society. We maintain an extensive social contribution program by planning and  executing social contribution activities at the corporate level, as well as encouraging employees to volunteer for worthwhile activities.  The central elements of our social contribution activities SMFG and its Group companies position the following four sectors as the core fields for social contributions: 1) social welfare;  2) local and international communities; 3) the environment; and 4) culture, the arts and education. Social Contribution Activities Topics l SMBC Receives Commendation from Tokyo Metropolitan  Governor for Contributions to Metropolitan Social  Welfare Initiative In January 2010 SMBC received a commendation from the  Governor of Tokyo for contributions to an initiative to make Tokyo  into a city with a high level of social welfare services. This was in  recognition of SMBCs various measures to promote the use of  universal design and provide universal service throughout Japan.  SMFG 2010 61 Contribution Activities for Local and Overseas  Communities Volunteer Fund SMBC has a system in which employees who volunteer have  100 deducted from their salaries each month to fund donations  to organizations that perform volunteer work.

Opening of Accounts for Donations to Disaster Victims When major natural disasters occur, SMBC opens special  accounts to collect donations for relief efforts without the usual  fund transfer charges. SMBC also solicits donations for such  causes from its own employees and those of other Group  companies including Nikko Cordial Securities. In fiscal 2009,  accounts were established for relief efforts for the victims of the  July torrential rains in the Chugoku and Northern Kyushu regions  and Typhoon No. 9 in August, both in Japan, as well as Typhoon  Ketsana in the Philippines, the 2009 Samoa earthquake, the  2009 Sumatra earthquake, the 2010 Chile earthquake, and the  2010 Haiti earthquake. Following the Haiti earthquake in January,  Sumitomo Mitsui Card collected donations made by customers  using its credit cards. Activities of YUI, SMBCs Volunteer Organization SMBC also provides active support for YUI, an in-house volunteer  organization that provides opportunities for SMBC employees to  plan and carry out volunteer activities. YUI activities conducted  on a regular basis include social events at schools for the  hearing-impaired, holding charity bazaars for items collected  from employees, and visits to facilities for the elderly. In addition  to the continued activities mentioned above, volunteers in Tokyo  and Osaka conducted  tree-planting activities  on the slopes of Mount  Fuji to mark the 10th  anniversary  of  the  establishment of YUI.  Contributing to  Local Communities SMBC has been promoting and carrying out activities planned  by its branches and other offices in Japan to contribute to local  communities, including branch tours, cleaning up the local envi- ronment, such as parks and other areas in the vicinity of SMBC  branches, participation in local festivals and events, exhibitions  of childrens art from around the world and concerts in the lob- bies of SMBC branches.   Nikko Cordial Securities also takes part in these activities at  all its branches nationwide. The company has organized tours  of its branches, including hands-on work experience, as well as  local cleanup activities. Nikko Cordial Securities employees clean up a  sidewalk near a branch.  SMFG 2010 62  Local Community Contribution by Overseas Offices SMBC overseas offices conducted the following activities in fiscal  2009.

Volunteer employees of SMBC and the Japan Research  Institute based in the  United States partici- pate in school beauti- fication programs. The  employees also give  donations, which are  matched by SMBC  Global Foundation. Support for UNICEF SMBC is a member corporation of the steering committee of  UNICEF Coin Aid and cooperates in the organizations fund- raising activities. To this end, SMBC places coin collection boxes  in its branches and offices in Japan and calls for donations from  the general public. The coins collected are sorted by currency  before being delivered to UNICEF.   SMBC also cooperates with UNICEF by implementing the  UNICEF Donation Account program. This program enables cus- tomers to donate their interest earnings after tax to UNICEF and  SMBC provides a matching donation.   Sumitomo Mitsui Card and VJA group companies collect  donations to UNICEF, UNESCO, the World Wide Fund for Nature  Japan, and the World Food Program from holders of their cards  through the World Present point service. Sumitomo Mitsui Card  also makes its own donations to UNICEF, matching those of the  cardholders.   In addition, Sumitomo Mitsui Card also issues cards that  automatically make donations to specific charities, such as the  UNICEF VISA Card and the Red Feather VISA Card (offered in  cooperation with the Central Community Chest of Japan), and  also makes its own donations to the working funds of all these  organizations from its card business revenues.  Participation in TABLE FOR TWO At SMBCs head office, we operate a system through the non- profit organization TABLE FOR TWO International of providing  donations to fund school meals in developing countries. The  price of a nutritiously balanced, low-calorie lunch plate offered  at the head-office employee cafeteria includes a 20 donation,  the price of one school meal. Vending machines have also been  installed selling health drinks whose price includes a donation to  TABLE FOR TWO International.  Social Contribution Activities of In-House Foundations Based in the United States,  SMBC Global Foundation  has distributed scholarships  to more than 5,000 university  students in Asian countries  since its establishment in  1994.   In the United States, it  supports study trips to Japan  organized by a high school in the Harlem area New York City.   Established in 1990, the SMBC Foundation for International  Cooperation aims to assist in developing the human resources  necessary to achieve sustainable growth in developing econo- mies as well as promote international exchange activities. Since  its inception, the foundation has provided financial support for  7-8 students from Asian countries each year, to enable them to  attend universities in Japan. The foundation also offers subsi- dies to research institutes and researchers undertaking projects  related to developing countries. Environmental Activities  Participation in Environmental Preservation Initiatives SMFG holds an SMFG Clean-up Day in which Group employ- ees volunteer to pick up litter on beaches. In 2009, some 130  employees participated in this activity at two sites in Kanagawa  and Hyogo prefectures.   SMBC Friend Securities held its own beach cleanup events  in Chiba and Hyogo prefectures. About 130 employees took part.  In addition, employees of Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing  and Japan Research Institute regularly participate in cleanup  activities near their offices.   SMBC employees volunteered in the Sea Forest (tree- planting) project organized by the Tokyo Metropolitan  Government, and also made donations to the project.  SMFG 2010 63  SMBC Environmental Program NPO C.C.C Furano  Field SMBC also provides support  to an environmental project  implemented by screenwriter  Soh Kuramoto in Furano,  Hokkaido. SMBC is providing  support for reafforestation of  a golf course belonging to a  country club that was shut  down in Furano. C.C.C Furano Field holds educational courses  on environment, in particular exploring nature fully using the five  senses. Employees and their families are invited to tour the proj- ect site to learn about and experience nature at first hand.  Biodiversity Courses Held In fiscal 2009, SMBC held courses in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya  that enabled employees and family members to learn about bio- diversity and become more closely involved in the tree-planting  movement by personally making acorn cubes (cubes of  earth and compost planted with an oak seedling). To teach the  courses, staff were invited from the Gobaimidori division of Annex  Co., Ltd., which was the recipi- ent of the SMBC Prize in the  ecological contest eco japan  cup 2007 (an open competition  for environmental business  ventures), of which SMBC was  one of the sponsors.

Student Internship Program The Japan Research Institute welcomes student interns every  year to learn about career opportunities. The interns deepen  their understanding of the work performed by JRI by studying  at offices where next-generation business ventures are being  created in the fields of the environment and energy. SMBC Friend  Securities also offers internships every year. In fiscal 2009, 22  interns studied financial products and the securities business.  SMFG 2010 64 SMFG and the Group companies strive to create a workplace  for their human resources where each and every employee can  take pride in and be highly motivated about his or her work. In  the following pages, we would like to introduce some of initiatives  in the human resources area taken by SMBC, as well as by other  Group companies including Sumitomo Mitsui Card, Sumitomo  Mitsui Finance and Leasing, the Japan Research Institute, SMBC  Friend Securities, and Nikko Cordial Securities. Five Goals of SMBCs Human Resource  Management 1.  Maintain and strengthen sound business management to  enable SMBC to compete in global markets 2.  Develop staff with specialized professional skills who can  provide customers with higher-value-added products and  services 3.  Motivate employees even more strongly by respecting  their individuality based on understanding of the inherent  value of diversity and encouraging them to seek personal  fulfillment 4.  Foster a corporate culture that encourages a forward- looking and creative attitude and places value on mutual  collaboration 5.  Be mindful of the social responsibilities of the Group,  and nurture a corporate culture that will contribute to the  healthy development of society Training Staff with Specialized Professional  Skills To provide a higher level of motivation for growth and develop- ment among younger personnel, SMBC provides basic practical  training programs in consumer banking, corporate banking, and  operations under separate programs known as the Retail Banking  College, Corporate Banking College, and Banking Operations  College. Employees acquire the necessary business knowledge  and skills through a combina- tion of on-the-job training and  classroom courses. SMBC  is currently reinforcing its  training system by assigning  mentors to new recruits at  the workplace and placing  regional and head-office men- tors at the Training Institute.   Following the amendment of the Money Lending Business  Law, Sumitomo Mitsui Card has been putting increased effort into  the development of staff with professional expertise in the credit  business. Measures taken include active support for employees  to become registered money lending officers, and regularly hold- ing in-house workshops on products and other topics.    Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing (SMFL) has estab- lished SMFL Standards, which sets forth a human resources  development plan and methods for realizing its human resources  goal for each year. This is targeted principally at sogoshoku  (management-track) staff up to their fifth year in the company.  SMFL has created Young Employees Growth Plan & Guide,  based on the SMFL Standards and has also opened an in-house  business school that will be used to supplement on-the-job train- ing from the current fiscal year onward.   The credo of Japan Research Institute (JRI) on human  resources is that its staff is the source of added value in its  solutions and proposals. In line with this, JRI has set up the  Staff Development Department within the Computer System  Division, and the Human Resources Incubation Center within the  Comprehensive Research Division for well-planned development  of human resources.    To improve young employees knowledge and raise their  skills so as to enable the company to cope effectively with the  diversification and increasing sophistication of the securities busi- ness, SMBC Friend Securities has started a course of classes for  acquisition of in-house skill accreditation. It has also introduced  a tutor system to raise the effectiveness of on-the-job training for  new employees.   As a full-line securities company which needs to nurture a  wide variety of financial professionals, Nikko Cordial Securities  is working to provide enhanced training to impart the necessary  knowledge and skills in each specialist area. It has designated  the first three years after entering the company as the crucial  training period for young staff members, and is putting its full  corporate resources into cre- ating an effective employee  development program.   In these ways, all Group  companies are taking mea- sures to reinforce their human  resources development systems. Creating a Corporate Culture that Derives  Strength from Diversity Human Resources Diversity The Group is implementing initiatives to create diversity (e.g.  gender, nationality) in the workplace. At SMBC, 40% of the new  university graduates hired for fiscal 2010 for sogoshoku and con- sumer services positions were women, and the number of women  holding managerial positions has been increasing. In fiscal 2008,  the Diversity and Inclusion Department was established within  the Human Resources Department and other initiatives were  launched for creating a corporate culture that derives strength  from diversity. Revision of Personnel System To enable motivated employees to take on the challenge of  performing more difficult work in a higher-level post, SMBC has  introduced a new workplace hierarchy system in which job rank- ings are more finely subdivided. This should make it easier for  talented individuals to be quickly promoted to mid-management  levels. We are also aiming to create a more seamless organiza- tional system in which an employees performance is evaluated  not simply in terms of a single years achievements on the job,  Human Resources Corporate Banking College Staff training at Nikko Cordial Securities  SMFG 2010 65 but also from the perspective of contribution to the company as  a whole. Creation of New Job Titles SMBC has launched a new title, Senior, for ippanshoku (general  work) employees on the Business Career Path working in front- office positions at the Middle Market Banking Unit. Sumitomo  Mitsui Card has likewise instituted a new ippanshoku employee  position using the term Leader. In this way, we are expanding  the playing field for ippanshoku staff so that they can be pro- moted to managerial positions. Developing Staff Needed for Global Operations As a result of the growth of SMBCs operations on the global  stage, proficiency in foreign languages is becoming increasingly  vital. To answer this need, SMBC is expanding its programs for  employees to study at language schools, and is assigning more  young employees to overseas offices.   SMBC is strongly committed to training national staff at its  overseas operations. The training facility established in Singapore  by the Asia Pacific Training Department covers a broad range  of subjects for employees in this region. Sessions are focused  primarily on business training and the development of capabilities  and skills. Furthermore, SMBC is taking steps to develop human  resources on a global scale by providing education in the his- tory of the bank and its management philosophy to newly-hired  national staff during their training courses. Employing Persons with Disabilities SMBC has established a special company called SMBC Green  Service Co., Ltd. that provides employment opportunities for  people with physical disabilities. In December 2008, the company  opened the Kobe Branch, and in February 2009 the Unagidani  Office in Osaka for the purpose of creating jobs not only for  physically but also for mentally impaired persons. In addition, to  upgrade their skills, SMBC encourages its employees to partici- pate actively in skill competitions for the disabled. Over the years,  a number of its employees have participated in the National Skill  Competition for the Disabled (known as the Abilympics), three  of whom were winners in the fiscal 2008 and 2009 competition.  As of March 2010, disabled people accounted for 1.90% of our  employees, above the legally mandatory level of 1.8%. Providing Support for a Good Work-Life Balance The Group has an employee support program that provides a  range of assistance for achieving a proper balance between work  and home. In fiscal 2008, Sumitomo Mitsui Card, SMFL, SMBC  Friend Securities, and JRI all drew up their own Work-Life Balance  Guidebook, based on actual experiences at SMBC. All Group  companies, including Nikko Cordial Securities, already operate  systems for parental leave, leave for taking care of sick children,  shorter working hours, restricted overtime work, and exemption  from late-night work. All these systems provide employee benefits  exceeding those mandated by law. In addition, SMBC, Sumitomo  Mitsui Card, and JRI provide child-care subsidies, while SMBC,  Sumitomo Mitsui Card, and SMFL operate a system for the rehir- ing of former employees. These systems all help realize a good  work-life balance for the Groups employees.   There are also annual Childrens Visitation Day and Family  Visitation Day to give employees family members a better under- standing of employees work at SMBC, Sumitomo Mitsui Card,  SMFL, JRI, and SMBC Friend Securities. JRI also holds Mama &  Papa Lunches as forums for information exchange between  employees who are raising children while working. SMBC has  instituted a Go Home Early to the Family Day, while SMFL is  pursuing a campaign to encourage employees to reduce the  amount of overtime work. Nikko Cordial Securities has introduced  an online support system for employees returning to work after  parental leave. SMBC, Sumitomo Mitsui Card, and JRI have all  received the Kurumin certification from the Japanese Ministry  of Health, Labour and Welfare in recognition of their activities in  support of child rearing.   All Group companies are  doing their utmost to create  systems that ensure a good  work-life balance, as well as  workplaces where employees  can fully demonstrate their  abilities. We plan to pursue  such measures still further in  the future. Heightening Awareness of Individual Rights At SMBC, we have included in our principles of action the con- cepts that we will respect the individual human dignity of our  customers and employees and we will not permit discrimina- tion of any kind. We are implementing the following initiatives  to heighten the awareness of all employees regarding individual  rights.   Conducting training meetings for manager-level staff (once a  year), and personnel newly appointed to management positions  and staff who have recently joined the bank   Holding study meetings to discuss individual rights issues, with  manager-level personnel leading these sessions (twice a year)   Soliciting slogans promoting individual rights from management  and staff (once a year) l SMBC Named as One of the Best 25 Companies in Japan in  the Great Place to Work Rankings In March 2010, SMBC was selected for the third year running  as one of the best companies in Japan as a place to work in  the survey conducted by Great Place to Work Institute Japan. * Great Place to Work Institute, Inc., a U.S. company, is a  survey organization that supplies data for the annual list of the  100 Best Places to Work published by Fortune magazine.  The survey has two major components: a survey of the internal  systems and corporate culture of respondent companies, and a  questionnaire survey of the employ- ees of these companies. The survey  of employees receives a weighting  of two-thirds in determining the final  results.

(Continued)  SMFG 2010 77 SMFG 1. Basis of Presentation Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) was established  on December 2, 2002 as a holding company for the SMFG group  through a statutory share transfer (kabushiki iten) of all of the out- standing equity securities of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation  (SMBC) in exchange for SMFGs newly issued securities. SMFG  is a joint stock corporation with limited liability (Kabushiki Kaisha)  incorporated under the Company Act of Japan. Upon formation of  SMFG and completion of the statutory share transfer, SMBC became  a direct wholly owned subsidiary of SMFG.  SMFG has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial  statements in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese  Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting  regulations, and in conformity with accounting principles gener- ally accepted in Japan (Japanese GAAP), which are different in  certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements from  International Financial Reporting Standards.  The accounts of overseas subsidiaries and affiliated companies  were based on accounting records maintained in conformity with  generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) prevailing in the  respective countries of their domicile. Effective as from the fiscal year  starting April 1, 2008, their accounting principles are in principle  integrated with those of SMFGs accounting policies for purposes of  consolidation unless they apply different accounting principles and  standards as required under U.S. GAAP or International Financial  Reporting Standards in which case a certain limited number of items  are adjusted based on their materiality. This change did not result in  significant differences or impact on the consolidated financial state- ments of SMFG.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been  restructured and translated into English from the consolidated  financial statements of SMFG prepared in accordance with Japanese  GAAP.  Some supplementary information included in the statutory  Japanese language consolidated financial statements, but not  necessarily required for fair presentation, is not presented in the  accompanying consolidated financial statements.  Amounts less than 1 million yen have been omitted. As a result,  the totals in Japanese yen shown in the financial statements do  not necessarily agree with the sum of the individual amounts. The  translation of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollars is included  solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan, using the prevail- ing exchange rate at March 31, 2010, which was 93.05 to US$1.  These translations should not be construed as representations that  the Japanese yen amounts have been, could have been, or could in the  future be, converted into U.S. dollars at that rate. 2. Significant Accounting Policies (1) Consolidation and equity method (a) Scope of consolidation Japanese accounting standards on consolidated financial  statements require a company to consolidate any subsidiary  when the company substantially controls the operations of  the enterprise, even if it is not a majority owned subsidiary.  Control is defined as the power to govern the decision- making body of an enterprise. (i) Consolidated subsidiaries The number of consolidated subsidiaries is as follows: March 31 2010 2009 Consolidated subsidiaries .............. 307 288 Principal companies:  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation  THE MINATO BANK, LTD.  Kansai Urban Banking Corporation  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Europe Limited  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (China) Limited  Manufacturers Bank  Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing Company, Limited  Sumitomo Mitsui Card Company, Limited  SMBC Finance Service Co., Ltd.  SMBC Friend Securities Co., Ltd.  Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  The Japan Research Institute, Limited  SMBC Capital Markets, Inc.  Changes in the consolidated subsidiaries in the fiscal  year ended March 31, 2010 are as follows:  62 companies including Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  were newly consolidated due mainly to acquisition of  shares.  35 companies including QUOQ Inc. were excluded from  the scope of consolidation because they were no longer  subsidiaries due to merger and other reasons.  Furthermore, 8 companies including Apricot Navigation  Co., Ltd. were excluded from the scope of consolidation  and became unconsolidated subsidiaries that are not  accounted for by the equity method because they became  operators of silent partnerships for lease transactions. (ii) Unconsolidated subsidiaries Principal company:  SBCS Co., Ltd.  214 subsidiaries including SMLC MAHOGANY CO.,  LTD. are operators of silent partnerships for lease transac- tions and their assets and profits/losses do not belong to  them substantially. Therefore, they have been excluded  from the scope of consolidation pursuant to Article 5,  Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Consolidated Financial  Statements Regulations.  Other unconsolidated subsidiaries are also excluded from  the scope of consolidation because their total amounts in  terms of total assets, ordinary income, net income and  retained earnings are immaterial, and as such, they do not  hinder a rational judgment of SMFGs financial position  and results of operations when excluded from the scope of  consolidation. (b) Application of the equity method Japanese accounting standards also require that any  unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates which SMFG is  able to exercise material influence over their financial and  operating policies be accounted for by the equity method. (i)  Unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for by the equity  method The number of unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for  by the equity method is as follows: March 31 2010 2009 Unconsolidated subsidiaries .......... 4 4 Principal company:  SBCS Co., Ltd. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009  SMFG 2010 78 SMFG Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (ii) Affiliates accounted for by the equity method The number of affiliates accounted for by the equity  method is as follows: March 31 2010 2009 Affiliates....................................... 54 75 Principal companies:  Sumitomo Mitsui Auto Service Company, Limited  Promise Co., Ltd.  Cedyna Financial Corporation  Daiwa SMBC Capital Co., Ltd.  Daiwa SB Investments Ltd.  Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Company, Limited  Changes in the affiliates accounted for by the equity method  in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 are as follows:  16 companies including P.T. Nikko Securities Indonesia  newly became affiliated companies accounted for by the  equity method due mainly to acquisition of shares.  2 companies including AJCC CORPORATION were  excluded from the scope of affiliated companies accounted  for by the equity method because they became consolidated  subsidiaries due to an increase in shareholding ratio.  35 companies including Daiwa Securities SMBC Co. Ltd.  were also excluded due to a sale of stocks and other reasons. (iii)  Unconsolidated subsidiaries that are not accounted for  by the equity method 214 subsidiaries including SMLC MAHOGANY CO.,  LTD. are operators of silent partnerships for lease transac- tions and their assets and profits/losses do not belong  to them substantially. Therefore, they have not been  accounted for by the equity method pursuant to Article  10, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Consolidated Financial  Statements Regulations. (iv)  Affiliates that are not accounted for by the equity  method Principal company:  Daiwa SB Investments (USA) Ltd.  Affiliates that are not accounted for by the equity  method are excluded from the scope of equity method  because the attributable portions to SMFG from their total  amounts in terms of net income and retained earnings  are immaterial, and as such, they do not hinder a rational  judgment of SMFGs financial position and results of  operations when excluded from the scope of equity method. (c) The balance sheet dates of consolidated subsidiaries (i)  The balance sheet dates of the consolidated subsidiaries  are as follows: March 31 2010 2009 May 31 ......................................... â€” 1 June 30 ........................................ 4 6 July 31 ......................................... 2 2 September 30 ............................... 5 5 October 31 ................................... 2 2 November 30 ............................... 5 4 December 31 ................................ 120 125 January 31 .................................... 18 15 February 28 .................................. 8 7 March 31 ...................................... 143 121 (ii) The financial statements of subsidiaries with balance  sheets dated May 31, June 30, July 31, September 30,  November 30 and January 31 are consolidated after  the accounts are provisionally closed as of March 31  for the purpose of consolidation. For subsidiaries with  balance sheets dated October 31, financial statements are  consolidated based on the provisional financial statements  closed as of January 31 or March 31. Other subsidiaries are  consolidated on the basis of their respective balance sheet  dates.  Overseas consolidated subsidiaries with balance sheets  dated December 31 were established in March 2010. Their  financial statements are consolidated after the accounts are  provisionally closed as of March 31.  Appropriate adjustments are made for material transac- tions during the periods between their respective balance  sheet dates and consolidated balance sheet dates. (d) Special purpose entities (i) Outline of special purpose entities and transactions SMBC provides loans, credit lines and liquidity lines to 12  special purpose entities (SPEs) for their funding needs  and issuing of commercial paper. The SPEs are engaged  in purchases of monetary claims such as receivables from  SMBC customers and incorporated under the laws of the  Cayman Islands or as intermediate corporations with  limited liabilities. SMBC has no voting rights in the SPEs  and sends no directors or employees. Accordingly, SMFG  does not consolidate these SPEs.  The combined assets and liabilities of the 12 SPEs as of  their most recent closing dates of 2010 were 2,261,647  million ($24,306 million) and 2,261,476 million  ($24,304 million), respectively. The respective amounts of  2009 were 3,140,527 million and 3,140,894 million. (ii) The amount of principal transactions with the SPEs as  of and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009  were as follows: Millions of yen Millions of U.S. dollars March 31 2010 2009 2010 Loans and bills   discounted .................. 1,630,152 1,851,401 $17,519 Credit lines ................... 670,385 824,149 7,205 Liquidity lines .............. 279,947 394,533 3,009 Millions of yen Millions of U.S. dollars Year ended March 31 2010 2009 2010 Interest on loans and   discounts .................... 17,520 26,092 $188 Fees and commissions ... 2,288 2,133 25 (2)  Trading assets/liabilities and trading income/losses Transactions for trading purposes (seeking gains arising from  short-term changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates,  or market prices of securities and other market related indices  or from variation among markets) are included in Trading  assets or Trading liabilities on the consolidated balance  sheet on a trade date basis. Income and losses on trading- purpose transactions are recognized on a trade date basis and  recorded as Trading income and Trading losses.  Securities and monetary claims purchased for trading   SMFG 2010 79 SMFG Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements purposes are stated at the fiscal year-end fair value, and  financial derivatives such as swaps, futures and options are  stated at amounts that would be settled if the transactions  were terminated on the consolidated balance sheet date.  Trading income and Trading losses include interest  received or paid during the fiscal year. The year-on-year  valuation differences of securities and monetary claims are  also recorded in the above-mentioned accounts. As for the  derivatives, assuming that the settlement will be made in  cash, the year-on-year valuation differences are also recorded in  the above-mentioned accounts. (3) Securities (a)  Other than securities classified for trading purposes, debt  securities that consolidated subsidiaries have the positive  intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held- to-maturity securities and are carried at amortized cost  (straight-line method) using the moving-average method.  Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates  that are not accounted for by the equity method are carried  at cost using the moving-average method.  Securities other than trading purpose securities, held- to-maturity securities and investments in unconsolidated  subsidiaries and affiliates are classified as other securities  (available-for-sale securities). Stocks (including foreign  stocks) in other securities that have market prices are car- ried at their average market prices during the final month  of the fiscal year, and bonds and others that have market  prices are carried at their fiscal year-end market prices (cost  of securities sold is calculated using primarily the moving- average method). Other securities, for which it is extremely  difficult to determine fair value, are carried at cost using  the moving-average method. Net unrealized gains (losses)  on other securities, net of income taxes, are included in  Net assets, after deducting the amount that is reflected  in the fiscal years earnings by applying fair value hedge  accounting. (b)  Securities included in money held in trust are carried using  the same method used for securities mentioned above. (4)  Derivative transactions Derivative transactions, other than those classified as trading  derivatives, are carried at fair value, with revaluation gain or  loss included in the income or loss, unless they are designated  as effective hedging instruments. (5) Depreciation (a) Tangible fixed assets Buildings owned by SMFG and SMBC are depreciated  using the straight-line method over the estimated useful  lives of the respective assets. Assets other than buildings  are depreciated using the declining-balance method. The  estimated useful lives of major items are as follows:     Buildings: 7 to 50 years     Others: 2 to 20 years  Other consolidated subsidiaries depreciate their tangible  fixed assets primarily using the straight-line method over  the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. (b) Intangible fixed assets Intangible fixed assets are depreciated using the straight- line method. Capitalized software for internal use owned  by SMFG and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries is  depreciated over its estimated useful life (basically 5 years). (c) Lease assets Lease assets with respect to non-transfer ownership finance  leases, which are recorded in Tangible fixed assets, are  depreciated using the straight-line method, assuming that  lease term is its expected lifetime and salvage value is 0. (6) Reserve for possible loan losses The reserve for possible loan losses of major consolidated  subsidiaries is provided for as described below in accordance  with the internal standards for write-offs and provisions.  For claims on borrowers that have entered into bankruptcy,  special liquidation proceedings or similar legal proceedings  (bankrupt borrowers) or borrowers that are not legally or  formally insolvent but are regarded as substantially in the  same situation (effectively bankrupt borrowers), a reserve is  provided for based on the amount of claims, after the write-off  stated below, net of the expected amount of recoveries from  collateral and guarantees.  For claims on borrowers that are not currently bankrupt but  are perceived to have a high risk of falling into bankruptcy  (potentially bankrupt borrowers), a reserve is provided for  in the amount deemed necessary based on an overall solvency  assessment of the claims, net of the expected amount of  recoveries from collateral and guarantees.  The discounted cash flows (DCF) method is used for  claims on borrowers whose cash flows from collection of  principal and interest can be rationally estimated, and SMBC  applies it to claims on large potentially bankrupt borrowers  and claims on large borrowers requiring close monitoring that  have been classified as Past due loans (3 months or more) or  Restructured loans, whose total loans from SMBC exceed  a certain amount. SMBC establishes a reserve for possible  loan losses using the DCF method for such claims in the  amount of the difference between the present value of the  future collection from principal and interest (calculated using  the rationally estimated cash flows discounted at the initial  contractual interest rate) and the book value.  For other claims, a reserve is provided for based on the  historical loan-loss ratio.  For claims originated in specific overseas countries, an addi- tional reserve is provided for in the amount deemed necessary  based on the assessment of political and economic conditions.  Branches and credit supervision departments assess all  claims in accordance with the internal rules for self-assessment  of assets, and the Credit Review Department, independent  from these operating sections, reviews their assessment. The  reserves are provided for based on the results of these  assessments.  The reserve for possible loan losses of other consolidated  subsidiaries for general claims is provided for in the amount  deemed necessary based on the historical loan-loss ratios, and  for doubtful claims in the amount deemed uncollectible based  on assessment of each claim.  For collateralized or guaranteed claims on bankrupt borrow- ers and effectively bankrupt borrowers, the amount exceeding  the estimated value of collateral and guarantees is deemed to  be uncollectible and written off against the total outstanding   SMFG 2010 80 SMFG Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements amount of the claims. The amount of write-off was 843,781  million ($9,068 million) and 717,010 million at March 31,  2010 and 2009, respectively. (7) Reserve for employee bonuses The reserve for employee bonuses is provided for payment of  bonuses to employees, in the amount of estimated bonuses,  which are attributable to the respective fiscal year. (8) Reserve for executive bonuses The reserve for executive bonuses is provided for payment of  bonuses to executives, in the amount of estimated bonuses,  which are attributable to the respective fiscal year. (9) Reserve for employee retirement benefits The reserve for employee retirement benefits is provided for  payment of retirement benefits to employees, in the amount  deemed accrued at the fiscal year-end, based on the projected  retirement benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets  at the fiscal year-end.  Unrecognized prior service cost is amortized using the  straight-line method, primarily over 9 years, over the employ- ees estimated average remaining service period from the fiscal  year of its incurrence.  Unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized using  the straight-line method, primarily over 9 years, over the  employees average remaining service period, commencing  from the next fiscal year of incurrence.  Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for  Retirement Benefits (Part3) (Accounting Standard Board of  Japan (ASBJ) Statement No. 19, issued on July 31, 2008)  became effective from the fiscal year beginning on and after  April 1, 2009. Accordingly, SMFG has applied them from the  fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. This accounting method  has no impact on the consolidated financial statements for the  fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. (10) Reserve for executive retirement benefits The reserve for executive retirement benefits is provided for  payment of retirement benefits to directors, corporate auditors  and other executive officers, in the amount deemed accrued at  the fiscal year-end based on the internal regulations.  (11) Reserve for reimbursement of deposits The reserve for reimbursement of deposits which were  derecognized as liabilities under certain conditions is provided  for the possible losses on the future claims of withdrawal based  on the historical reimbursements. (12) Reserve under the special laws The reserve under the special laws is a reserve for eventual  future operating losses from financial instruments transactions  pursuant to Article 46-5 of the Financial Instruments and  Exchange Act. (13) Translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities of SMFG and SMBC denominated in  foreign currencies and accounts of SMBC overseas branches are  translated into Japanese yen mainly at the exchange rates  prevailing at the consolidated balance sheet date, with the  exception of stocks of subsidiaries and affiliates translated at  rates prevailing at the time of acquisition.  Other consolidated subsidiaries assets and liabilities  denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese  yen at the exchange rates prevailing at their respective balance  sheet dates. (14) Lease transactions (a) Recognition of income on finance leases Interest income is allocated to each period. (b) Recognition of income on operating leases Primarily, lease-related income is recognized on a  straight-line basis over the term of the lease, based on the  contractual amount of lease fees per month. (c) Recognition of income and expenses on installment sales Primarily, installment-sales-related income and installment- sales-related expenses are recognized on a due-date accrual  basis over the period of the installment sales. (15) Hedge accounting (a) Hedging against interest rate changes  As for the hedge accounting method applied to hedging  transactions for interest rate risk arising from financial  assets and liabilities, SMBC applies deferred hedge  accounting.  SMBC applies deferred hedge accounting stipulated in  Treatment for Accounting and Auditing of Application  of Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments in  Banking Industry (Japanese Institute of Certified Public  Accountants (JICPA) Industry Audit Committee Report  No. 24) to portfolio hedges on groups of large-volume,  small-value monetary claims and debts.   As for the portfolio hedges to offset market fluctuation,  SMBC assesses the effectiveness of such hedges by clas- sifying the hedged items (such as deposits and loans) and  the hedging instruments (such as interest rate swaps) by  their maturity. As for the portfolio hedges to fix cash flows,  SMBC assesses the effectiveness of such hedges by verifying  the correlation between the hedged items and the hedging  instruments.   As for the individual hedges, SMBC assesses the  effectiveness of such individual hedges.  As a result of the application of JICPA Industry Audit  Committee Report No. 24, SMBC discontinued the  application of hedge accounting or applied fair value hedge  accounting to a portion of the hedging instruments using  macro hedge, which had been applied in order to manage  interest rate risk arising from large-volume transactions  in loans, deposits and other interest-earning assets and  interest-bearing liabilities as a whole using derivatives  pursuant to Temporary Treatment for Accounting and  Auditing of Application of Accounting Standard for  Financial Instruments in Banking Industry (JICPA  Industry Audit Committee Report No. 15). The deferred  hedge losses and gains related to such a portion of hedging  instruments are charged to Interest income or Interest  expenses over a 12-year period (maximum) according to  their maturity from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004.  Gross amounts of deferred hedge losses on macro hedge  (before deducting tax effect) at March 31, 2010 and 2009  were 2,470 million ($27 million) and 6,921 million,  respectively. Gross amounts of deferred hedge gains on  macro hedge (before deducting tax effect) at March 31,  2010 and 2009 were 2,416 million ($26 million) and  5,688 million, respectively.  SMFG 2010 81 SMFG Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (b) Hedging against currency fluctuations SMBC applies deferred hedge accounting stipulated in  Treatment of Accounting and Auditing Concerning  Accounting for Foreign Currency Transactions in Banking  Industry (JICPA Industry Audit Committee Report  No. 25) to currency swap and foreign exchange swap trans- actions executed for the purpose of lending or borrowing  funds in different currencies.  Pursuant to JICPA Industry Audit Committee Report  No. 25, SMBC assesses the effectiveness of currency swap  and foreign exchange swap transactions executed for  the purpose of offsetting the risk of changes in currency  exchange rates by verifying that there are foreign-currency  monetary claims and debts corresponding to the foreign- currency positions.  In order to hedge risk arising from volatility of exchange  rates for stocks of subsidiaries and affiliates and other  securities (excluding bonds) denominated in foreign  currencies, SMBC applies deferred hedge accounting or  fair value hedge accounting, on the conditions that the  hedged securities are designated in advance and that suf- ficient on-balance (actual) or off-balance (forward) liability  exposure exists to cover the cost of the hedged securities  denominated in the same foreign currencies. (c) Hedging against share price fluctuations SMBC applies fair value hedge accounting to individual  hedges offsetting the price fluctuation of the shares that are  classified under other securities, and that are held for the  purpose of strategic investment, and accordingly evaluates  the effectiveness of such individual hedges. (d) Transactions between consolidated subsidiaries As for derivative transactions between consolidated sub- sidiaries or internal transactions between trading accounts  and other accounts (or among internal sections), SMBC  manages the interest rate swaps and currency swaps that  are designated as hedging instruments in accordance with  the non-arbitrary and strict criteria for external transac- tions stipulated in JICPA Industry Audit Committee  Report No. 24 and No. 25. Therefore, SMBC accounts for  the gains or losses that arise from interest rate swaps and  currency swaps in its earnings or defers them, rather than  eliminating them.  Certain other consolidated subsidiaries apply the  deferred hedge accounting or fair value hedge account- ing or the special treatment for interest rate swaps. A  consolidated domestic subsidiary (a leasing company)  partly applies the accounting method that is permitted  by Temporary Treatment for Accounting and Auditing  of Application of Accounting Standard for Financial  Instruments in Leasing Industry (JICPA Industry Audit  Committee Report No. 19). (16) Consumption taxes National and local consumption taxes of SMFG and its  consolidated domestic subsidiaries are accounted for using the  tax-excluded method. (17) Valuation of consolidated subsidiaries assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities of consolidated subsidiaries including the  portion attributable to the minority stockholders are valued  for consolidation at fair value when SMFG acquires control. (18) Amortization of goodwill Goodwill on SMBC Friend Securities Co., Ltd., Sumitomo  Mitsui Finance and Leasing Company, Limited, Nikko Cordial  Securities Inc. and Kansai Urban Banking Corporation is  amortized using the straight-line method over 20 years.  Goodwill on other companies was charged or credited to  income directly when incurred or benefited. (19) Statements of cash flows For the purposes of presenting the consolidated statements of  cash flows, cash and cash equivalents represent cash and due  from banks. (20) Application of new accounting standards (a) Accounting standard for financial instruments Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments (ASBJ  Statement No. 10, partially revised on March 10, 2008)  and Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair  Value of Financial Instruments (ASBJ Guidance No. 19,  issued on March 10, 2008) became effective from the  fiscal year ending on and after March 31, 2010. SMFG  has applied them from the fiscal year ended March 31,  2010. Accordingly, this accounting change has the fol- lowing impact on the consolidated financial statements as  compared with the previous accounting method: Millions of yen Millions of U.S. dollars Monetary claims bought .............  8,710 $ 94 Securities .................................... 41,914 450 Net unrealized gains (losses)   on other securities ..................... 39,315 423 Deferred tax assets ...................... (27,056) (291) Reserve for possible loan losses ... (34,999) (376)  As a result, income before income taxes and minority  interests increased by 19,251 million ($207 million) as  compared with the former method. (b)  Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies  Applied to Foreign Subsidiaries for Consolidated Financial  Statements  Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies  Applied to Foreign Subsidiaries for Consolidated Financial  Statements (ASBJ Practical Issues Task Force No. 18,  issued on May 17, 2006) became effective from the fiscal  year beginning on and after April 1, 2008. Accordingly,  SMFG has applied it from the fiscal year ended March  31, 2009. This accounting method has decreased retained  earnings at April 1, 2008 by 3,132 million, but has no  material impact on the profit or loss for the fiscal year  ended March 31, 2009. (c)  Accounting Standard for Lease Transactions Non-transfer ownership finance leases had been accounted  for using the same method as for operating leases.  However, Accounting Standard for Lease Transactions  (ASBJ Statement No. 13, issued on March 30, 2007) and  Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for  Lease Transactions (ASBJ Guidance No. 16, issued on  March 30, 2007) became effective from the fiscal year begin- ning on and after April 1, 2008. Accordingly, SMFG has  applied them from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009.  The treatment of non-transfer ownership finance lease  transactions which commenced before April 1, 2008 was as  follows:  SMFG 2010 82 SMFG Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (i) Lessee side Future minimum lease payments, excluding the interest  portion, at March 31, 2008 are considered as acquisition  cost and recorded as lease assets in either Tangible fixed  assets or Intangible fixed assets, assuming they had been  acquired at the beginning of the fiscal year. (ii) Lessor side Appropriate book value, net of accumulated depreciation,  of lease assets at March 31, 2008 was recorded as the  beginning balance of Lease receivables and investment  assets.  Accordingly, this accounting change has the following  impact on the consolidated financial statements as of and  for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 as compared with  the previous accounting method: Millions of yen Lease receivables and investment assets ........ 1,968,347 Tangible fixed assets: Lease assets .............................................. 7,206 Intangible fixed assets: Lease assets .............................................. 480 Loans and bills discounted ........................... (138,788) Lease assets .................................................. (1,205,021) Other assets ................................................. (662,005) Other liabilities ........................................... (32,205) Interest income: Interest on lease transactions ....................    77,772 Interest on loans and discounts ................ (7,659) Interest expenses: Other interest expenses ............................ (639) Other operating income: Lease-related income ................................ (503,389) Installment-related income ...................... (242,763) Other ....................................................... (810) Other operating expenses: Lease-related expenses .............................. (472,005) Installment-related expenses .................... (206,456) General and administrative expenses ............ (178)  As a result, income before income taxes and minority  interests for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 increased  by 2,423 million. (21) Changes in presentation (a)  Lease assets related to operating leases on lessor side (March  31, 2009: 180,273 million) had been included in Lease  assets. From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, they  are included in the following items because they have been  immaterial: Millions of yen March 31 2009 Tangible fixed assets: Buildings ................................................. 52,681 Land ........................................................ 68,131 Other tangible fixed assets ....................... 59,460 Intangible fixed assets: Software ................................................... 0 (b)  Losses (gains) on sale of subsidiaries shares and gains on  change in equity of subsidiary which had been reported  in Net cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal  year ended March 31, 2008, were (5,622) million in the  fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. They are included in  Other from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 because  they have been immaterial. (22) Issuance of new shares On June 22, 2009, SMFG issued 219,700 thousand new  shares of common stock at 3,766 per share (issue price) for  final allocation by underwriters at 3,928 per share (offer  price). Furthermore, in connection with the over-allotment  of 15,300 thousand shares of common stock offered for sale  at 3,928 per share (sales price) in the public offering, SMFG  issued 8,931 thousand new shares of common stock at 3,766  per share (issue price) through third-party allocation to the  underwriter who conducted the over-allotment on July 27,  2009. The purchase agreement for the offering prescribes that  the total amount of issue price be treated as the total amount  of subscription price and no underwriting commission be  paid. Accordingly, other expenses do not include the amount  equivalent to the underwriting commission for the offering  in the amount of 37,038 million. Out of the issue price per  share, 1,883 is accounted for as capital stock and 1,883 as  capital surplus.  On January 27, 2010, SMFG issued 340,000 thousand new  shares of common stock at 2,702.81 per share (issue price)  for final allocation by underwriters at 2,804 per share (offer  price). Furthermore, in connection with the over-allotment  of 20,000 thousand shares of common stock offered for sale  at 2,804 per share (sales price) in the public offering, SMFG  issued 20,000 thousand new shares of common stock at  2,702.81 per share (issue price) through third-party alloca- tion to the underwriter who conducted the over-allotment on  February 10, 2010. The purchase agreement for the offering  prescribes that the total amount of issue price be treated as the  total amount of subscription price and no underwriting com- mission be paid. Accordingly, other expenses do not include  the amount equivalent to the underwriting commission for the  offering in the amount of 36,428 million. Out of the issue  price per share, 1,351.405 is accounted for as capital stock  and 1,351.405 as capital surplus.  Equity of 11,075 million attributable to SMFG, which  a consolidated subsidiary and an equity method affiliated  company of SMFG recorded as earnings under the purchase  agreement for the offering, was accounted for as Capital  surplus. (23) Change in method of valuation of certain securities Floating-rate Japanese government bonds which SMFG Group  held as Other securities â€” AFS securities had been carried  on the consolidated balance sheet at market values. From  the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, such bonds have been  carried at their reasonably estimated amounts in accordance  with the Practical Solution on Measurement of Fair Value for  Financial Assets (ASBJ Practical Issues Task Force No. 25,  issued on October 28, 2008). As a result of this accounting  change, compared with the former accounting method at  March 31, 2009, Securities, Net unrealized gains on other   SMFG 2010 83 SMFG Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements securities and Minority interests increased by 117,757  million, 67,741 million and 2,508 million, respectively,  and Deferred tax assets decreased by 47,508 million.  SMFG has rationally calculated the fair values of floating- rate Japanese government bonds by discounting future cash  flows estimated from their yields and other factors, using  discount rates determined based on their yields. Yield and  volatility are the main parameters for calculating the fair  value. (24) Transactions with related parties SMFG has applied Accounting Standard for Related Party  Disclosures (ASBJ Statement No. 11, issued on October 17,  2006) and Guidance on Accounting Standard for Related  Party Disclosures (ASBJ Guidance No. 13, issued on October  17, 2006) from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. There  are no material transactions with related parties to be reported  in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. 3. Trading Assets Trading assets at March 31, 2010 and 2009 consisted of the following: Millions of yen Millions of  U.S. dollars March 31 2010 2009 2010 Trading securities ................................................................................................ 2,779,725   293,956 $29,874 Derivatives of trading securities ........................................................................... 1,246 470 13 Derivatives of securities related to trading transactions ........................................ 6,931 13,428 75 Trading-related financial derivatives .................................................................... 3,642,477 4,052,928 39,145 Other trading assets ............................................................................................. 278,307 564,178 2,991 6,708,688 4,924,961 $72,098 4. Securities Securities at March 31, 2010 and 2009 consisted of the following: Millions of yen Millions of  U.S. dollars March 31 2010 2009 2010 Japanese government bonds*1 .............................................................................. 16,738,321 14,734,419 $179,885 Japanese local government bonds ......................................................................... 422,648 338,688 4,542 Japanese corporate bonds*2 .................................................................................. 3,548,359 3,899,189 38,134 Japanese stocks*1, 3, 4 ............................................................................................ 2,967,641 2,755,683 31,893 Other*1, 3, 4 .......................................................................................................... 4,946,997 6,970,184 53,165 28,623,968 28,698,164 $307,619 *1  Unsecured loaned securities for which borrowers have the right to sell or pledge in the amount of 41,826 million ($450 million) are included in Japanese government bonds in  Securities and in trading securities in Trading assets at March 31, 2010 and such securities in the amount of 33,312 million are included in Japanese government bonds and other in  Securities at March 31, 2009.

Loans and Bills Discounted (1) Loans and bills discounted at March 31, 2010 and 2009 consisted of the following: Millions of yen Millions of  U.S. dollars March 31 2010 2009 2010 Bills discounted ...............................................................................................    196,382    257,759 $  2,111 Loans on notes ................................................................................................. 2,324,520 2,852,998 24,981 Loans on deeds ................................................................................................. 52,839,032 53,489,947 567,856 Overdrafts ....................................................................................................... 7,341,097 8,534,613 78,894 62,701,033 65,135,319 $673,842  SMFG 2010 84 SMFG Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (2) Loans and bills discounted included the following Risk-monitored loans stipulated in the Banking Act: Millions of yen Millions of  U.S. dollars March 31 2010 2009 2010 Risk-monitored loans: Bankrupt loans*1..........................................................................................   165,131   292,088 $ 1,775 Non-accrual loans*2 ..................................................................................... 1,075,782 1,019,352 11,561 Past due loans (3 months or more)*3............................................................. 38,315 36,162 412 Restructured loans*4 .................................................................................... 250,256 238,713 2,689 1,529,484 1,586,317 $16,437 *1  Bankrupt loans are loans, after write-off, to legally bankrupt borrowers as defined in Articles 96-1-3 and 96-1-4 of the Enforcement Ordinance No. 97 of the Japanese Corporate  Tax Law (issued in 1965) and on which accrued interest income is not recognized as there is substantial doubt about the ultimate collectability of either principal or interest  because they are past due for a considerable period of time or for other reasons.  *2  Non-accrual loans are loans on which accrued interest income is not recognized, excluding Bankrupt loans and loans on which interest payments are deferred in order to  support the borrowers recovery from financial difficulties. *3  Past due loans (3 months or more) are loans on which the principal or interest is past due for 3 months or more, excluding Bankrupt loans and Non-accrual loans. *4  Restructured loans are loans on which terms and conditions have been amended in favor of the borrowers (e.g., reduction of the original interest rate, deferral of interest  payments, extension of principal repayments or debt forgiveness) in order to support the borrowers recovery from financial difficulties, excluding Bankrupt loans, Non-accrual  loans and Past due loans (3 months or more). (3)  Bills discounted are accounted for as financial transactions in accordance with JICPA Industry Audit Committee Report No. 24. SMFGs  banking subsidiaries have rights to sell or pledge bank acceptance bought, commercial bills discounted, documentary bills and foreign  exchanges bought without restrictions. The total face value at March 31, 2010 and 2009 was 617,381 million ($6,635 million) and  686,407 million, respectively. (4)  Commitment line contracts on overdrafts and loans are agreements to lend to customers, up to a prescribed amount, as long as there  is no violation of any condition established in the contracts. The amounts of unused commitments at March 31, 2010 and 2009 were  41,957,592 million ($450,914 million) and 39,983,526 million, respectively, and the amounts of unused commitments whose origi- nal contract terms are within 1 year or unconditionally cancelable at any time at March 31, 2010 and 2009 were 36,373,235 million  ($390,900 million) and 34,012,566 million, respectively.  Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount of unused commitments does  not necessarily represent actual future cash flow requirements.

Assets such as corporate headquarters facilities, training facilities, data and system centers,  and health and recreational facilities which do not produce cash flows that can be attributed to individual assets are treated as corporate assets.  As for idle assets, impairment loss is measured individually. At other consolidated subsidiaries, a branch or other group is the smallest asset  grouping unit as well.   SMBC and other subsidiaries reduced the carrying amounts of long-lived assets of which investments are not expected to be fully recovered  to their recoverable amounts, and recognized the losses as losses on impairment of fixed assets, which is included in Other expenses. SMBC  reduced the carrying amounts of corporate assets and idle assets, and other consolidated subsidiaries reduced the carrying amounts of long-lived  assets of their branches, corporate assets and idle assets. The recoverable amount is calculated using net realizable value which is basically  determined by subtracting the expected disposal cost from the appraisal value based on the Real Estate Appraisal Standard.

Employee Retirement Benefits (1) Outline of employee retirement benefits Consolidated subsidiaries in Japan have contributory funded defined benefit pension plans such as employee pension plans, qualified  pension plans and lump-sum severance indemnity plans. Consolidated subsidiaries in Japan have adopted the defined-contribution pen- sion plan. Certain domestic consolidated subsidiaries have a general type of employee pension plans. They may grant additional benefits  in cases where certain requirements are met when employees retire.   Some overseas consolidated subsidiaries adopt defined benefit pension plans and defined-contribution pension plans.

Financial Instruments (1) Status of financial instruments (a) Policies on financial instruments SMFG conducts banking and other financial services such  as leasing, securities, credit card, asset management and  venture capital. Its banking business includes deposit  taking, lending, securities trading and investment, remit- tance, foreign exchange, custody of funds and other assets  related to financial futures transactions, bond subscription  agent, trust business, over-the-counter sales of securities  investment trusts and insurance products, and securities  intermediation.  These services entail holding of financial assets such as  loans and bills discounted, bonds, and stocks. Meanwhile,  SMFG raises funds through deposit taking, borrowing,  bond offering, etc. Furthermore, it undertakes derivative  transactions to meet customers hedging needs, to control  market risk associated with deposit taking and lending  (ALM purposes), and to make profit on short-term  fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, etc.  (trading purposes). (b) Details of financial instruments and associated risks i) Financial assets The main financial assets held by SMFG include loans  to foreign and domestic companies and domestic  individuals, and securities such as bonds (government  and corporate bonds) and stocks (foreign and domestic  stocks), etc. Bonds such as government bonds are held  for both trading and ALM purposes, and certain bonds  are held as held-to-maturity securities. Stocks are held  mainly for strategic purposes. These assets expose  SMFG to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.  Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from nonperfor- mance of obligations by the borrower or issuer due to  factors such as deterioration in the borrowers/issuers  financial conditions. Market risk is the risk stemming  from fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates, or  share prices. Liquidity risk is the risk arising from  difficulty executing transactions in desired quantities  at appropriate prices due to low market liquidity. These  risks are properly monitored and managed based on  (c) Risk management framework for financial instru- ments below. ii) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities of SMFG include borrowed money  and bonds, etc. in addition to deposits. Deposits mainly  comprise deposits of domestic and foreign companies  and domestic individuals. Borrowed money and bonds  include subordinated borrowings and subordinated  bonds. Also, financial liabilities, like financial assets,  expose SMFG to not only market risk but also funding  liquidity risk: the risk of SMFG not being able to  raise funds due to market turmoil, deterioration in  its creditworthiness or other factors. These risks are  properly monitored and managed based on (c) Risk  management framework for financial instruments  below. iii) Derivative transactions Derivatives handled by SMFG include foreign exchange  futures; futures, forwards, swaps and options related to  interest rates, currencies, equities, bonds and commodi- ties; and credit and weather derivatives.  Major risks associated with derivatives include  market risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk arising  from nonperformance of contractual obligations due to  deterioration in the counterpartys financial conditions.  These risks are properly monitored and managed based  on (c) Risk management framework for financial  instruments below.  Hedge accounting is applied to derivative transac- tions executed for ALM purposes, as necessary. Hedging  instruments, hedged items, hedging policy and the  method to assess the effectiveness of hedging are  described in 2. Significant Accounting Policies,  (15) Hedge accounting. (c) Risk management framework for financial instruments The fundamental matters on risk management for  SMFG are set forth in Risk Management Regulations.  SMFGs Management Committee establishes the basic  risk management policy, based on the Regulations, which  is then approved by the Board of Directors. SMFG has a  risk management system based on the basic policy. The  Corporate Risk Management Department, which, together  with the Corporate Planning Department, controls risk  management across SMFG by monitoring the development  and implementation of SMFGs risk management system,  and gives appropriate guidance as needed. Under this  framework, SMFG comprehensively and systematically  manages risks. i) Management of credit risk SMFG conducts integrated management of credit risk  according to its operational characteristics, and the  credit risk inherent in its entire portfolio as well as the  risk in individual credits are managed quantitatively  and continuously. i. Credit risk management system At SMBC, basic policies on credit risk management  and other significant matters require the resolution of  the Management Committee and the approval of the  Board of Directors.  The Credit & Investment Planning Department  of the Risk Management Unit is responsible for the  comprehensive management of credit risk. This depart- ment establishes, revises or abolishes credit policies,  the internal rating system, credit authority regulations,  credit application regulations, and manages non- performing loans and other aspects of credit portfolio  management. The department also controls SMBCs  total credit risk by quantifying credit risk (i.e. calculat- ing risk capital and risk-weighted assets) in cooperation  with the Corporate Risk Management Department.  The department also monitors risk situations and  regularly reports to the Management Committee and  the Board of Directors.  SMFG 2010 100 SMFG Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Moreover, the Credit Portfolio Management  Department within the Credit & Investment Planning  Department works to stabilize SMBCs overall credit  portfolio through market transactions such as loan  securitization. In the Corporate Services Unit, the  Corporate Research Department analyzes industries  as well as investigates the borrowers business situ- ation to detect early signs of problems. The Credit  Administration Department is responsible for formu- lating and implementing measures to reduce SMBCs  exposures mainly to borrowers classified as potentially  bankrupt or lower.  The Credit Departments of Consumer Banking Unit,  Middle Market Banking Unit and other business units  play a central role in credit screening and managing  their units credit portfolios. Each business unit estab- lishes its credit limits based on the baseline amounts  for each borrower grading category. Borrowers or loans  perceived to have high credit risk undergo intensive  evaluation and administration by the units Credit  Department.  Moreover, the Credit Risk Committee, a consultative  body straddling the business units, rounds out SMBCs  oversight system for undertaking flexible and efficient  control of credit risk and ensuring the overall soundness  of the banks loan operations.  In addition to these, the Internal Audit Unit,  operating independently from the business units, audits  asset quality, grading accuracy, self-assessment, and  appropriateness of credit risk management system, and  reports the results directly to the Board of Directors  and the Management Committee. ii. Method of credit risk management SMBC properly manages the credit risk inherent in  individual loans and the entire portfolio by assessing  and quantifying the credit risk of each borrower/ loan using the internal rating system. In addition to  management of individual loans through credit screen- ing and monitoring, it manages the credit portfolio  as described below in order to secure and improve  the credit portfolios soundness and medium-term  profitability. â€” Appropriate risk-taking within the scope of capital  To limit credit risks to a permissible level relative to  capital, credit risk capital limit has been established  for internal control purposes. Under this limit, a  general guideline and designated guidelines for real  estate finance, investment in funds and securitization  products, etc. are set for each business unit. Regular  monitoring is conducted to ensure that these guidelines  are being followed. â€” Controlling concentration risk Concentration of risk in specific borrowers/industries/ countries could severely reduce a banks capital should  it materialize. SMBC therefore implements measures  to prevent concentration of credit risk in specific  industries, and control large exposures to individual  borrowers by setting guidelines for maximum loan  amounts and conducting thorough loan reviews. To  manage country risk, SMBC also has credit limit  guidelines based on each countrys creditworthiness. â€” Greater understanding of actual corporate condi- tions and balancing returns and risks SMBC runs credit operations on the basic principle of  thoroughly understanding actual corporate conditions  and gaining profit commensurate with the level of  credit risk entailed, and makes every effort to improve  profit at after-cost (credit cost, capital cost and  overhead) level. â€” Reduction and prevention of non-performing loans On non-performing loans and potential non-performing  loans, SMBC carries out loan reviews to clarify credit  policies and action plans, enabling it to swiftly imple- ment measures to prevent deterioration of borrowers  business situations, support business recoveries, collect  on loans, and enhance loan security. â€” Approaches to active portfolio management SMBC is committed to agile portfolio management,  such as using credit derivatives and selling loan claims,  to stabilize its credit portfolio.  In regards to financial instruments such as invest- ments in certain funds, securitized products and credit  derivatives that indirectly retain risks related to assets  such as corporate bonds and loan claims (underlying  assets), such instruments entail market and liquidity  risks in addition to credit risk, since such instruments  are traded on the market. Credit risk management for  these instruments involving detailed analysis and evalu- ation of characteristics of underlying assets is performed  while market risk is comprehensively managed within  the framework for managing market and liquidity  risks. Moreover, guidelines have been established based  on the characteristics of each type of risk.   In regards to credit risk of derivative transactions,  the potential exposure based on the market price is  regularly calculated and properly managed. When  the counterparty is a financial institution with whom  SMBC frequently conducts derivative transactions,  measures such as a close-out netting provision, which  provide that offsetting credit exposures between the  2 parties will be combined into a single net payment  from 1 party to the other in case of bankruptcy or other  default event, are implemented to reduce credit risk. ii) Management of market and liquidity risks SMFG manages market and liquidity risks by setting  allowable risk limits; ensuring the transparency of the  risk management process; and clearly separating front- office, middle-office, and back-office operations for a  highly efficient system of mutual checks and balances. i. Market and liquidity risk management systems At SMBC, important matters such as basic policies for  managing market and liquidity risks and risk manage- ment framework are determined by the Management  Committee and then approved by the Board of  Directors.   The aforementioned Corporate Risk Management  Department, which is independent from the business   SMFG 2010 101 SMFG Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements units that directly handle business transactions,  manages market and liquidity risks in an integrated  manner. The department also monitors market and  liquidity risk situations and regularly reports to the  Management Committee and the Board of Directors.  Furthermore, SMBCs cross-departmental ALM  Committee reports on the state of observance of  market risk capital and liquidity risk capital limits, and  deliberates on administration of ALM policies. SMBC  also has a system whereby front-office departments,  middle-office departments and back-office departments  check each others work in order to prevent clerical  errors, unauthorized transactions, etc.   In addition, SMBCs Internal Audit Unit, which  is independent from other departments, periodically  performs comprehensive internal audits to verify that  the risk management framework is properly function- ing and reports the audit results to the Management  Committee, the Board of Directors and other concerned  committees and departments. ii. Market and liquidity risk management methodology â€” Market risk management SMBC manages market risk by setting maximum loss  and VaR (value at risk: maximum potential loss for a  given probability) within the market risk capital limit  that is set taking into account stockholders equity  and other factors and in accordance with the market  transaction policies.   SMBC uses the historical simulation method (a  method for estimating the maximum loss by running  simulations of changes in profit and loss on market  fluctuation scenarios based on historical data) to  measure VaR.  Regarding risks associated with foreign exchange  rates, interest rates, equity risk, option prices and  other market risk factors, SMBC manages such risks by  setting a maximum limit on the indicator suited for  each market risk factor such as BPV (basis point value:  denotes the change in value of a financial instrument  resulting from a 0.01 percentage-point change in the  yield). â€” Liquidity risk management At SMBC, funding liquidity risk is managed based on  a framework consisting of setting funding gap limits  and guidelines, maintaining a system of highly liquid  supplementary funding sources, and establishing con- tingency plans. SMBC tries to avoid excessive reliance  on short-term funds by managing funding gap limits  and guidelines and has established a contingency plan  covering emergency action plans such as reducing fund- ing gap limits and guidelines. In addition, to ensure  smooth fulfillment of transactions in face of market  turmoil, SMBC holds assets such as U.S. treasuries that  can be sold immediately and emergency committed  lines as supplemental liquidity.  Moreover, to manage the liquidity risk of marketable  instruments, derivative transactions, etc., SMBC has  trading limits for each business office classified by  currency, instrument, transaction period, etc. As for  financial futures, etc., risks are managed by restricting  positions within a certain percentage of open interest in  the entire market. (d)  Supplementary explanations about matters concerning fair  value of financial instruments Fair values of financial instruments are based on their  market prices and, in cases where market prices are not  available, reasonably calculated prices. Such prices have  been calculated using certain assumptions, and may differ  if calculated based on different assumptions.

The reserves for possible losses on Cash and  due from banks, Call loans and bills bought, Monetary claims bought, Foreign exchanges, and Lease receivables and investment assets are deducted directly from  Consolidated balance sheet amount since they are immaterial. *2  The amounts collectively represent the derivative transactions which are recorded on Trading assets, Trading liabilities, Other assets and Other liabilities. Debts and  credits arising from derivative transactions are presented on a net basis. (b)  Fair value calculation methodology for financial  instruments Assets 1) Cash and due from banks, 2) Call loans and bills bought,  3) Receivables under resale agreements, 4) Receivables  under securities borrowing transactions, 9) Loans and  bills discounted, 10) Foreign exchanges, and 11) Lease  receivables and investment assets: Of these transactions, the book values of dues from banks  without maturity and overdrafts with no specified repay- ment dates are regarded to approximate their fair values;  thus, their fair values are their book values.  For short-term transactions with remaining life as of the  end of the fiscal year not exceeding 6 months, their fair  values are, in principle, their book value as book values are  regarded to approximate fair values.  The fair value of those with a remaining life of more  than 6 months is, in principle, the present value of  future cash flows (calculated by discounting estimated  future cash flows, taking into account factors such as the  borrowers internal rating and pledged collateral, using a  rate comprising of a risk-free interest rate and an overhead  ratio). Certain consolidated subsidiaries of SMFG calculate  the present value by discounting the estimated future cash  flows computed based on the contractual interest rate,  using a rate comprising a risk-free rate and a credit risk  premium.  Regarding claims on bankrupt borrowers, effectively   SMFG 2010 104 SMFG Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements bankrupt borrowers and potentially bankrupt borrowers,  expected losses on such claims are calculated based on  either the present value of expected future cash flows or the  expected recoverable amount from collateral or guarantees.  Since the claims balance sheet amounts at the closing  date minus the current expected amount of loan losses  approximate their fair values, such amounts are regarded as  their fair values. 5) Monetary claims bought: The fair values of monetary claims bought with market  prices, such as beneficial interests in commodities invest- ment trusts, are based on their market prices as of the end  of the fiscal year. The fair values of subordinated trust  beneficiary interests related to securitized housing loans  are based on the assessed value of underlying assets minus  the assessed value of senior beneficial interests, etc. The  fair values of other transactions are, in principle, based on  prices calculated using methods similar to the methods  applied to 9) Loans and bills discounted. 6) Trading assets: The fair values of bonds and other securities held for trad- ing purposes are, in principle, based on their market price  at the final date of the fiscal year. 7) Money held in trust: The fair values of money held in trust are, in principle,  based on the market prices of securities held in trust  calculated using methods similar to the methods applied to  8) Securities. 8) Securities: In principle, the fair values of stocks (including foreign  stocks) are based on the average market price during 1  month before the end of the fiscal year. The fair values of  bonds and securities with market prices other than stocks  are prices calculated based on their market prices on the  final date of the fiscal year.  In light of the Practical Solution on Measurement of  Fair Value for Financial Assets (ASBJ Practical Issue Task  Force No. 25), the fair values of floating-rate Japanese  government bonds are based on the present value of future  cash flows (the government bond yield is used to discount  and estimate future cash flows). Bond yield and yield  volatility are the main price parameters. The fair values  of those without market prices, such as private-placement  bonds, are based on the present value of future cash flows  calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows tak- ing into account the borrowers internal rating and pledged  collateral by a rate comprising a risk-free interest rate and  an overhead ratio. However, the fair values of bonds issued  by bankrupt borrowers, effectively bankrupt borrowers and  potentially bankrupt borrowers are based on the bonds face  value after the deduction of the expected amount of a loss  on the bond computed by using the same method applied  to the estimation of a loan loss. Meanwhile, the fair values  of publicly offered investment trusts are calculated based  on the published net asset value (NAV) per share, while  those of private placement investment trusts are calculated  based on the NAV published by securities firms and other  financial institutions. Liabilities 1) Deposits, 2) Negotiable certificates of deposit and  12) Due to trust account: The fair values of demand deposits and deposits without  maturity are based on their book values as at the end of the  fiscal year. The fair values of short-term transactions with  remaining life as of the end of the fiscal year not exceeding  6 months are also based on their book values, as their book  values are regarded to approximate their market values.  The fair values of transactions with a remaining life of  more than 6 months are, in principle, based on the present  value of future cash flows calculated using the rate applied  to the same type of deposits that are newly accepted until  the end of the remaining life. 3) Call money and bills sold, 4) Payables under repurchase  agreements, 5) Payables under securities lending transac- tions, 6) Commercial paper, 8) Borrowed money,  10) Short-term bonds and 11) Bonds: The fair values of short-term transactions with remaining  life as of the end of the fiscal year not exceeding 6 months  are based on their book values, as their book values are  regarded to approximate their fair values. For transactions  with a remaining life of more than 6 months, their fair  values are, in principle, based on the present value of future  cash flows calculated using the refinancing rate applied to  the same type of instruments for the remaining life. The  fair values of bonds are based on the present value of future  cash flows calculated using the rate derived from the data  on the yields of benchmark bonds and publicly-offered  subordinated bonds published by securities firms. 7) Trading liabilities: The fair values of bonds sold for short sales and other  securities for trading purposes are, in principle, based on  their market prices on the final date of the fiscal year. 9) Foreign exchanges: The fair values of foreign currency-denominated deposits  without maturity received from other banks are based on  their book values as at the end of the fiscal year.  The fair values of foreign exchange related short-term  borrowings are based on their book values, as their book  values are regarded to approximate their fair values. Derivatives transactions The fair values of exchange-traded derivatives are based on  their closing prices. With regard to OTC transactions, the  fair values of interest rate, currency, stock, bond and credit  derivatives are based on their settlement prices as at the  end of the fiscal year calculated based on the present value  of the expected future cash flows or using valuation tech- niques such as the option pricing model. The fair values  of commodity derivatives transactions are based on their  settlement prices as at the end of the fiscal year, calculated  based on the derivative instruments components, includ- ing price and contract term.

(g) Write-down of securities Securities (excluding stocks of subsidiaries and affiliates) with fair value are considered as impaired if the fair value declines materi- ally below the acquisition cost and such decline is not considered as recoverable. In such a case, the fair value is recognized as the  consolidated balance sheet amount and the amount of write-down is accounted for as valuation loss for the fiscal year. Valuation loss  for the fiscal year was 19,519 million ($210 million). The rule for determining material decline is as follows and is based on the  classification of issuers under self-assessment of assets. Bankrupt/Effectively bankrupt/Potentially bankrupt issuers:  Fair value is lower than acquisition cost. Issuers requiring caution:  Fair value is 30% or more lower than acquisition cost. Normal issuers:  Fair value is 50% or more lower than acquisition cost. Bankrupt issuers: Issuers that are legally bankrupt or formally declared bankrupt. Effectively bankrupt issuers: Issuers that are not legally bankrupt but regarded as substantially bankrupt. Potentially bankrupt issuers: Issuers that are not bankrupt now, but are perceived to have a high risk of falling into bankruptcy. Issuers requiring caution: Issuers that are identified for close monitoring. Normal issuers: Issuers other than the above 4 categories of issuers.

Consolidated balance sheet amount is calculated as follows:      Stocks (including foreign stocks): Average market prices during 1 month before the fiscal year-end      Bonds and other: Market prices at the fiscal year-end or fair value based on the DCF method on certain Japanese government bonds   2.  Other securities with fair value are considered as impaired if the fair value declines materially below the acquisition cost and such decline is not considered as recover- able. In such a case, the fair value is recognized as the consolidated balance sheet amount and the amount of write-down is accounted for as valuation loss for the fiscal  year. Valuation loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 was 156,721 million. The rule for determining material decline is as follows and is based on the  classification of issuers under self-assessment of assets.

The outline of the merger is as follows: 1. Outline of the business combination (1) Name of the acquired company and its business Biwako Bank (Banking business) (2) Reason for the business combination KUBC and Biwako Bank merged in order to become a  regional bank with top-level financial soundness and a broad  operating base in the Kansai area with a view to realizing a  more stable operation as a regional financial institution. (3) Date of the business combination March 1, 2010 (4) Legal form of business combination The merger was a merger by absorption with KUBC as the  surviving company.

Ltd. and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.,  respectively, as their financial advisors and requested  them to calculate the merger ratio of common stock.  After conducting negotiations and discussions taking into  account factors such as their financial conditions, asset  quality and future prospects, the analysis of the merger  ratio provided by each financial advisor and results of due  diligence they carried out on each other, the 2 banks agreed  and decided on the above merger ratio of common stock as  being appropriate. (b) Preferred stocks (Type 1 and Type 2) Market prices of preferred stocks (Type 1 and Type 2) issued  by Biwako Bank were not available (in contrast to common  stock which market price was available). KUBC therefore  decided to set the same conditions as those of Biwako Banks  preferred stocks on KUBCs newly-issued preferred stocks,  taking the merger ratio of common stock into account. (3) Number of shares delivered and value Number of shares delivered  Common stock of KUBC   103,532,913 shares  Preferred stock of KUBC (Type 1)   27,500,000 shares  Preferred stock of KUBC (Type 2)   23,125,000 shares Value   Common stock of     KUBC  12,803 million ($138 million)   Preferred stock    (Type 1) of KUBC   19,025 million ($204 million)   Preferred stock     (Type 2) of KUBC   16,500 million ($177 million) 5.

(QUOQ) and equity  method affiliates, Central Finance Co., Ltd. (CF) and OMC Card,  Inc. (OMC Card) merged on April 1, 2009. The new company was  named Cedyna Financial Corporation and became an equity method  affiliate of SMFG. The outline of the merger is as follows: 1. Outline of the business combination (1) Company profiles Surviving company: OMC Card (Credit card business) Merged company: CF (Shopping credit business   and general credit business) Merged company: QUOQ (Shopping credit business    and general credit business) (2) Reasons for the business combination The credit card market is growing steadily, propelled by the  expansion into new areas of settlement, such as for small  purchases, the growing popularity of reward point programs,  and other developments. Further substantial growth of the  industry is anticipated with the greater use of credit cards to  pay for public services charges and in other fields. At the same  time, the business environment surrounding the industry is  changing dramatically â€” development of new technologies  and new services, such as electronic money; investment  in systems that can respond to customers needs for more  in-depth, sophisticated and diverse services; enactment of  laws on money lending business; etc. â€” and the industry is  at a major turning point. In the shopping credit business,  the Installment Sales Act is being revised amid the trend to  strengthen consumer protection. Under these circumstances,  the companies need to restructure their operations in order to  establish new business models.  On April 1, 2009, CF, OMC Card and QUOQ merged to  create one of the largest consumer finance companies in Japan  with a high level of specialization and flexibility in its core  businesses of credit cards and shopping credit by combining  the customer bases, marketing capabilities, know-how and  other resources of the 3 companies. (3) Date of business combination April 1, 2009 (4) Legal form of the business combination The merger was a merger by absorption with OMC Card as  the surviving company. (Name of the new company: Cedyna  Financial Corporation) 2.

(SMFG)  and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in  net assets and cash flows for the years then ended, expressed in Japanese yen. These consolidated financial statements  are the responsibility of SMFGs management. Our responsibility is to independently express an opinion on these  consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Those standards require  that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of  material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures  in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates  made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits  provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the  consolidated financial position of SMFG and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated  results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles  generally accepted in Japan. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2010 have been translated into United  States dollars solely for convenience of the readers. We have recomputed the translation, and, in our opinion, the  consolidated financial statements expressed in Japanese yen have been translated into United States dollars on the  basis set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Statements of Trust Assets and Liabilities  SMFG 2010 171 SMFG Capital Ratio Information Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The consolidated capital ratio is calculated using the method stipulated in Standards for Bank Holding Company to Examine the Adequacy of  Its Capital Based on Assets, Etc. Held by It and Its Subsidiaries Pursuant to Article 52-25 of the Banking Law (Notification 20 issued by the  Japanese Financial Services Agency in 2006; hereinafter referred to as the Notification).   In addition to the method stipulated in the Notification to calculate the consolidated capital ratio (referred to as First Standard in the  Notification), SMFG has adopted the advanced internal ratings-based (IRB) approach for calculating credit risk-weighted asset amounts.  Further, SMFG has implemented market risk controls, and, in calculating the amount corresponding to operational risk, the Advanced  Measurement Approach (AMA).   Capital Ratio Information was prepared based on the Notification, and the terms and details in the section may differ from the terms and  details in other sections of this report.  Scope of Consolidation 1. Consolidated Capital Ratio Calculation   Number of consolidated subsidiaries:     307 Please refer to Principal Subsidiaries and Affiliates on page 210 for their names and business outline.   Scope of consolidated subsidiaries for calculation of the consolidated capital ratio is based on the scope of consolidated subsidiaries for  preparing consolidated financial statements.   There are no affiliates to which the proportionate consolidation method is applied.   There are no companies engaged exclusively in ancillary banking business or in developing new businesses as stipulated in Article 52-23  of the Banking Law. 2.

Regarding exposures to be deducted from capital, the deduction amount is added to the amount of required capital.   2. Portfolio classification is after CRM.   3. Securitization exposures includes such exposures based on the standardized approach.   4.  Other exposures includes estimated lease residual values, purchased receivables (including exposures to qualified corporate enterprises and others), long settlement  transactions and other assets.  Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach 1. Scope   SMFG and the following consolidated subsidiaries have adopted the advanced IRB approach for exposures as of March 31, 2009.   (1) Domestic Operations      Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Card Company, Limited and SMBC Guarantee Co., Ltd.   (2) Overseas Operations      Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Europe Limited, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (China) Limited, Sumitomo Mitsui  Banking Corporation of Canada, Banco Sumitomo Mitsui Brasileiro S.A., ZAO Sumitomo Mitsui Rus Bank, PT Bank Sumitomo Mitsui  Indonesia, SMBC Leasing and Finance, Inc., SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., SMBC Capital Markets Limited, SMBC Derivative Products  Limited and SMBC Capital Markets (Asia) Limited    THE MINATO BANK, LTD. and SMBC Finance Service Co., Ltd. have adopted the foundation IRB approach.     Among consolidated subsidiaries that have adopted the standardized approach for exposures as of March 31, 2010, Sumitomo Mitsui  Finance and Leasing Co., Ltd. is scheduled to adopt the foundation IRB approach from March 31, 2012, and Kansai Urban Banking  Corporation from March 31, 2013. Both companies reviewed their schedules for adoption of the approach which was originally planned.   Note:  Directly controlled SPCs and limited partnerships for investment of consolidated subsidiaries using the advanced IRB approach have also adopted the advanced IRB  approach. Further, the advanced IRB approach is applied to equity exposures on a group basis, including equity exposures of consolidated subsidiaries applying the  standardized approach.   SMFG 2010 174 SMFG Capital Ratio Information 2. Exposures by Asset Class (1) Corporate Exposures A. Corporate, Sovereign and Bank Exposures (A) Rating Procedures   Corporate, sovereign and bank exposures includes credits to domestic and overseas commercial/industrial (C&I) companies,  individuals for business purposes (domestic only), sovereigns, public sector entities, and financial institutions. Business loans  such as apartment construction loans, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) loans with standardized screening process  (hereinafter referred to as standardized SME loans) are, in principle, included in retail exposures. However, credits of more  than 100 million are treated as corporate exposures in accordance with the Notification.   An obligor is assigned an obligor grade by first assigning a financial grade using a financial strength grading model and data  obtained from the obligors financial statements. The financial grade is then adjusted taking into account the actual state of the  obligors balance sheet and qualitative factors to derive the obligor grade (for details, please refer to Credit Risk Assessment  and Quantification on page 37). Different rating series are used for domestic and overseas obligors â€” J1 ~ J10 for domestic  obligors and G1 ~ G10 for overseas obligors â€” as shown below due to differences in actual default rate levels and portfolios grade  distribution. Different Probability of Default (PD) values are applied also.   In addition to the above basic rating procedure which builds on the financial grade assigned at the beginning, in some cases, the  obligor grade is assigned based on the parent companys credit quality or credit ratings published by external rating agencies. The  Japanese government, local authorities and other public sector entities with special basis for existence and unconventional financial  statements are assigned obligor grades based on their attributes (for example, local municipal corporations), as the data on these  obligors are not suitable for conventional grading models. Further, credits to individuals for business purposes, business loans and  standardized SME loans are assigned obligor grades using grading models developed specifically for these exposures.   PDs used for calculating credit risk-weighted assets are estimated based on the default experience for each grade and taking into  account the possibility of estimation errors. In addition to internal data, external data are used to estimate and validate PDs. The  definition of default is the definition stipulated in the Notification (an event that would lead to an exposure being classified as  substandard loans, doubtful assets or bankrupt and quasi-bankrupt assets occurring to the obligor).   Loss given defaults (LGDs) used in the calculation of credit risk-weighted assets are estimated based on historical loss experience  of credits in default, taking into account the possibility of estimation errors.

Specialized Lending (SL) (A) Rating Procedures   Specialized lending is sub-classified into project finance, object finance, commodity finance, income-producing real  estate (IPRE) and high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) in accordance with the Notification. Project finance is  financing of a single project, such as a power plant or transportation infrastructure, and cash flows generated by the project are the  primary source of repayment. Object finance includes aircraft finance and ship finance, and IPRE and HVCRE include real estate  finance (a primary example is non-recourse real estate finance). There were no commodity finance exposures as of March 31, 2010.   Each SL product is classified as either a facility assigned a PD grade and LGD grade or a facility assigned a grade based primarily  on the expected loss ratio, both using grading models and qualitative assessment. The former has the same grading structure as  that of corporate, and the latter has ten grade levels as with obligor grades but the definition of each grade differs from that of the  obligor grade which is focused on PD.   For the credit risk-weighted asset amount for the SL category, the former facility is calculated in a manner similar to corporate  exposures, while the latter facility is calculated by mapping the expected loss-based facility grades to the below five categories  (hereinafter the slotting criteria) of the Notification because it does not satisfy the requirements for PD application specified in  the Notification.

SMFG 2010 180 SMFG Capital Ratio Information (3) Equity Exposures and Credit Risk-Weighted Assets under Article 145 of the Notification A. Equity Exposures (A) Rating Procedures When acquiring equities subject to the PD/LGD approach, issuers are assigned obligor grades using the same rules as those of  general credits to C&I companies, sovereigns and financial institutions. The obligors are monitored (for details, please refer to page  39) and their grades are revised if necessary (credit risk-weighted asset amount is set to 1.5 times when they are not monitored  individually). In the case there is no credit transaction with the issuer or it is difficult to obtain financial information, internal  grades are assigned using ratings of external rating agencies if it is a qualifying investment.

Credit Risk-Weighted Assets under Article 145 of the Notification (A) Outline of method for calculating credit risk assets Exposures under Article 145 of the Notification include credits to funds. In the case of such exposures, in principle, each underlying  asset of the fund is assigned an obligor grade to calculate the assets credit risk-weighted asset amount and the amounts are totaled  to derive the credit risk-weighted asset amount of the fund. When equity exposures account for more than half of the underlying  assets of the fund, or it is difficult to directly calculate the credit risk-weighted asset amount of individual underlying assets,  the credit risk-weighted asset amount of the fund is calculated using the simple majority adjustment method, in which credit  risk-weighted assets are calculated using a risk weight of 400% (when the risk-weighted average of individual assets underlying the  portfolio is less than 400%) or a risk weight of 1250% (in other cases).

Year-on-Year Comparison of Actual Losses SMFG recorded total credit costs (the total of the general provisions, non-performing loan write-offs, and gains on collection of  written-off claims) of 473.0 billion on a consolidated basis for fiscal 2009, a year-on-year decrease of 294.8 billion.   SMBC recorded 254.7 billion in total credit costs on a nonconsolidated basis in fiscal 2009, a year-on-year decrease of 295.4  billion. In terms of exposure category, the credit cost for corporate exposures decreased 194.8 billion year-on-year, to 216.6 billion.  The credit cost for bank exposures decreased 19.1 billion year-on-year, to 3.5 billion. These results are due primarily to the impact  of the governments economic stimulus measures; SMBCs measures to improve the business and financial situation of borrowers  that are tailored to each borrowers circumstances; and a reduction in credit cost related to non-Japanese corporates due to improved  overseas market conditions.

Securitization exposures have not been included.  Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques 1. Risk Management Policy and Procedures In calculating credit risk-weighted asset amounts, SMFG takes into account credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques. Specifically, amounts  are adjusted for eligible financial or real estate collateral, guarantees, and credit derivatives or by netting loans against the obligors deposits  with SMFG financial institutions. The methods and scope of these adjustments and methods of management are as follows. (1) Scope and Management A. Collateral (Eligible Financial or Real Estate Collateral) SMBC designates deposits and securities as eligible financial collateral, and land and buildings as eligible real estate collateral.    Real estate collateral is evaluated by taking into account its fair value, appraisal value, and current condition, as well as our lien  position. Real estate collateral must maintain sufficient collateral value in the event security rights must be exercised due to delinquency.  However, during the period from acquiring the rights to exercising the rights, the property may deteriorate or suffer damage from  earthquakes or other natural disasters, or there may be changes in the lien position due to, for example, attachment or establishment of  liens by a third party. Therefore, the regular monitoring of collateral is implemented according to the type of property and the type of  security interest. B. Guarantees and Credit Derivatives Guarantors are sovereigns, municipal corporations, credit guarantee corporations and other public entities, financial institutions, and  C&I companies. Counterparties to credit derivative transactions are mostly domestic and overseas banks and securities companies.   Credit risk-weighted asset amounts are calculated taking into account credit risk mitigation of guarantees and credit derivatives  acquired from entities with sufficient ability to provide protection such as sovereigns, municipal corporations and other public sector  entities of comparable credit quality, and financial institutions and C&I companies with sufficient credit ratings. C. Netting of Loans against Deposits SMBC verifies the legal effectiveness of netting arrangements for loans and deposits for each transaction. Specifically, lending  transactions subject to the netting of loans against deposits are stipulated in the Agreement on Bank Transactions, and fixed-term  deposits that have fixed maturity dates and cannot be transferred to third-party entities are subject to netting. Regarding deposits with  us submitted as collateral, their effect as credit risk mitigation is taken into account under the eligible financial collateral framework  described in A. above.   Further, maturity dates and balances (including the post-netting situation) are monitored for subject loans and deposits in  accordance with the Notification. When there is a maturity/currency mismatch, netting is executed after making adjustments as  stipulated in the Notification, and the credit risk-weighted asset amount is calculated after netting.   SMFG 2010 183 SMFG Capital Ratio Information (2) Concentration of Credit Risk and Market Risk Accompanying Application of Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques At SMBC, there is a framework in place for controlling concentration of risk in obligors with large exposures which includes credit limit  guidelines, risk concentration monitoring, and reporting to the Credit Risk Committee (please refer to page 36). Further, exposures to  these obligors are monitored on a group basis, taking into account risk concentration in their parent companies in cases of guaranteed  exposures.   When marketable financial products (for example, credit derivatives) are used as credit risk mitigants, market risk generated by these  products is controlled by setting upper limits. 2.

Risk Management Policy and Procedures (1) Policy on Collateral Security and Impact of Deterioration of Our Credit Quality Collateralized derivative is a CRM technique in which collateral is delivered or received regularly in accordance with replacement cost.  The Group conducts collateralized derivative transactions as necessary, thereby reducing credit risk. In the event our credit quality  deteriorates, however, the counterparty may demand additional collateral, but its impact is deemed to be insignificant. (2) Netting Netting is another CRM technique, and close-out netting is the main type of netting. In close-out netting, when a default event, such  as bankruptcy, occurs to the counterparty, all claims against, and obligations to, the counterparty, regardless of maturity and currency,  are netted out to create a single claim or obligation.    Close-out netting is applied to foreign exchange and swap transactions covered under a master agreement with a net-out clause or  other means of securing legal effectiveness, and the effect of CRM is taken into account only for such claims and obligations. 2.

Securitization Exposures 1. Risk Management Policy and Procedures Definition of securitization exposure has been clarified in order to properly identify, measure, evaluate and report risks, and a risk management  department, independent of business units, has been established to centrally manage risks from recognizing securitization exposures to  measuring, evaluating and reporting credit risk-weighted assets.   The Group takes one of the following positions in securitization transactions.   Originator (a direct or indirect originator of underlying assets or a sponsor of an ABCP conduit or a similar program that acquires  exposures from third-party entities)  Investor   Others (for example, provider of swap for preventing a mismatch between the dividend on trust beneficiary rights and cash flows  generated by underlying assets on which the rights are issued) 2. Credit Risk-Weighted Asset Calculation Methodology  There are three methods of calculating the credit risk-weighted asset amount of securitization exposures subject to the IRB approach:  the ratings-based approach, the supervisory formula, and the internal assessment approach. The methods are used as follows.   First, securitization exposures are examined and the ratings-based approach is applied to qualifying exposures.   The remaining exposures are examined and the supervisory formula is applied to qualifying exposures.   The remaining exposures are deducted from capital.   The credit risk-weighted asset amount for securitization exposures subject to the standardized approach is calculated mostly using ratings  published by qualifying rating agencies or based on weighted average risk weights of underlying assets as stipulated in the Notification. 3. Accounting Policy on Securitization Transactions Accounting treatment of securitization of financial assets is as follows. Extinguishment of financial assets is recognized when the contractual  rights over the financial assets are exercised, forfeited or control over the rights is transferred to a third-party, and the difference between the  book value of the financial assets and the amount received/paid is recorded as the terms gain/loss. When the control over the contractual  rights is not deemed to have been transferred, the securitization transaction is treated as a financial transaction such as a mortgage loan.   When a portion of financial assets satisfies the extinguishment condition, the extinguishment of the said portion is recognized and the  difference between the book value of the extinguished portion and the amount received/paid is recorded as the terms gain/loss. The book   SMFG 2010 185 SMFG Capital Ratio Information value of the extinguished portion is calculated by allocating the book value of the financial assets based on the proportion of the financial  assets fair value that the extinguished portion represents.    Further, the remaining portion whose fair value is available is measured at fair value, and the related valuation differences are reported as  a component of net assets. The impairments are measured and recorded as necessary. 4. Qualifying External Ratings Agencies When computing credit risk-weighted asset amounts for securitization exposures using the rating-based approach under the IRB approach  or standardized approach, the risk weights are determined by mapping the ratings of qualifying rating agencies to the risk weights  stipulated in the Notification. The qualifying rating agencies are Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), Japan Credit Rating  Agency, Ltd. (JCR), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P), and Fitch Ratings Ltd. (Fitch).  When more than one rating is available for an exposure, the second smallest risk weight is used, in accordance with the Notification. 5. Portfolio (1) Securitization Transactions as Originator A.

Default amount is the total of underlying assets which are past due three months or more and defaulted underlying assets.   3.  Default amount and Loss amount when acting as a sponsor of securitization of customer claims are estimated using the following methods and  alternative data, as in some cases it can be difficult to obtain relevant data in a timely manner because the underlying assets have been recovered by the  customer.   (1)  Default amount estimation method       For securitization transactions subject to the ratings-based approach, the amount is estimated based on information on underlying assets obtainable from  customers, etc.       For securitization transactions subject to the supervisory formula, the amount is estimated based on obtainable information on, or default rate of, each  obligor. Further, when it is difficult to estimate the amount using either method, it is conservatively estimated by assuming that the underlying asset is a  default asset.   (2) Loss amount estimation method       For securitization transactions subject to the ratings-based approach, the amount is the same amount as the default amount estimated conservatively in (1)  above.       For securitization transactions subject to the supervisory formula, when expected loss ratios of defaulted underlying assets can be determined, the amount  is estimated using the ratios. When it is difficult to determine the ratios, the amount is the same amount as the default amount estimated in (1) above.   4.  Other claims includes lease fees.   5.

Risk Management Policy and Procedures Securities in the banking book are properly managed, for example, by setting upper limits on the allowable amount of risk under the market  or credit risk management framework selected according to their holding purpose and risk characteristics.    For securities held as other securities, the upper limits are also set in terms of price fluctuation risk.   Regarding stocks of subsidiaries, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are managed on a consolidated basis, and risks related to stocks of  affiliates are recognized separately. Their risk as equity is not measured as upper limits on the allowable amount of risk are set for stocks  of subsidiaries and affiliates, and the limits are established within the risk capital limit of SMFG, taking into account the financial and  business situations of the subsidiaries and affiliates. 2. Valuation of Securities in Banking Book and Other Significant Accounting Policies Stocks of subsidiaries and affiliates are carried at amortized cost using the moving-average method. Other securities with market prices  (including foreign stocks) are carried at their average market prices during the final month of the fiscal year. Securities other than these  securities are carried at their fiscal year-end market prices (cost of securities sold is calculated using primarily the moving-average method)  and those with no available market prices are carried at cost using the moving-average method.   Net unrealized gains (losses) on other securities and net of income taxes are reported as a component of net assets. Derivative transactions  are carried at fair value. 3.

Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book Interest rate risk in the banking book fluctuates significantly depending on the method of recognizing maturity of demand deposits (such  as current accounts and ordinary deposits from which funds can be withdrawn on demand) and the method of predicting early withdrawal  from fixed-term deposits and prepayment of consumer loans. Key assumptions made by SMBC in measuring interest rate risk in the banking  book are as follows. 1. Method of Recognizing Maturity of Demand Deposits The total amount of demand deposits expected to remain with the bank for the long term (with 50% of the lowest balance during the past  5 years as the upper limit) is recognized as a core deposit amount and interest rate risk is measured for each maturity with 5 years as the  maximum term (the average is 2.5 years). 2. Method of Estimating Early Withdrawal from Fixed-term Deposits and Prepayment of Consumer Loans The rate of early withdrawal from fixed-term deposits and the rate of prepayment of consumer loans are estimated and the rates are used to  calculate cash flows used for measuring interest rate risk. 3.

As of March 31, 2010, the following  consolidated subsidiaries have also adopted the AMA, and the remaining consolidated subsidiaries have adopted the Basic Indicator  Approach (BIA).    Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Card Company, Limited, The Japan Research Institute, Limited, SMBC  Friend Securities Co., Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing Co., Ltd., Kansai Urban Banking Corporation, The Japan Net  Bank, Limited, SMBC Guarantee Co., Ltd., SMBC Finance Service Co., Ltd., THE MINATO BANK, LTD., SMBC Center Service Co.,  Ltd., SMBC Delivery Service Co., Ltd., SMBC Green Service Co., Ltd., SMBC International Business Co., Ltd., SMBC International  Operations Co., Ltd., SMBC Loan Business Service Co., Ltd., SMBC Market Service Co., Ltd., SMBC Loan Administration and  Operations Service Co., Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Europe Limited and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation  (China) Limited.

Among companies which have adopted the BIA, Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. is making preparations to adopt the AMA for exposures as  of September 30, 2011. 2. Outline of the AMA An outline of the AMA for operational risk management is described in the section on Risk Management. In this section, we would like to  present an explanation of the preparation of data that is input into the quantification model and the verification of scenario assessment using  internal loss data, external loss data, and Business Environment and Internal Control Factors (BEICFs). We will also give an outline of the  methodology for measuring the operational risk equivalent amount (required capital) using the quantification model. (1) Scenario Analysis through Risk Control Assessments A. Preparation of Data Input into the Quantification Model In order to estimate the frequency of occurrence of low-frequency and high-severity events, which is the purpose of risk control  assessment, we estimate the loss frequency in terms of four loss amounts (100 million, 1 billion, 5 billion, and 10 billion) for  each scenario, then input the total amount by loss event type for each entity, namely, SMFG (consolidated), SMBC (consolidated), and  SMBC (nonconsolidated), into the quantification model.   At SMFG and SMBC, by using a different assessment method according to loss event type and organizational classification, we  obtain a proper grasp of operational risk profile of the Group. The following section provides typical calculation examples for scenarios  of SMBC domestic business offices. Internal Loss Data External Loss Data B. Verification A. Data input Risk Mitigation Initiatives (1) Scenario Analysis through          Risk Control Assessments (2) Measurement         Using the        Quantification Model BEICFs  SMFG 2010 196 SMFG Capital Ratio Information (A) Deriving and Scoring Scenarios a. Deriving Scenarios In order to grasp all potential risks of a business/product, we first identify business processes & /products stipulated in the  Common Procedures of Operations. Then, we derive all possible scenarios for the generation of a loss event of prescribed  magnitude by breaking down the operation process of each business processes & /products into processing types.   We evaluate each individual scenario on an operation process basis. b. Scenario Assessment In order to assess scenarios, it is necessary to quantify loss frequency and amount for each scenario. At SMBC, in order to quantify  loss frequency for each scenario, we execute risk control assessments on each scenario.   In risk assessment, in order to measure the easiness of loss occurrence in each operation process before taking into account the  risk management (control) situation, we set standards for various assessment items â€” transaction volume, volatility of transaction  volume, time limits and so on â€” and the operation process is scored on how well the standards are met. (Example) Product Operation process (a) Explanation to customer (b) Request for preparation of application form (c) Presentation of conditions to customer,        conclusion of contract (d) Conclusion of the deal with Treasury Marketing         Department  (e) Entry of contract implementation form (f) Exchange of forward contract Explanation Receipt and check  Agreements and contracts Internal transfer System entries Issuance, notification and reporting (a) Explanation (b) Attribute confirmation (c) Receipt and check (d) Issuance, notification and reporting (e) Internal transfer (f) Application, decision and authorization (g) Agreements and contracts (h) Preparation of vouchers, etc. and making entries (i) System entries (j) Management during contract period (k) Safekeeping, depositing and withdrawal Business Classification of Business, Products and Processing Type (Example) Exchange forward contract Processing type Conclusion of exchange forward contract   1 0 2 1 0 0 0 Risk Scoring (Examples) Perspective Easiness of  making an error (a) Transaction volume (b) Volatility of transaction volumes (c) Time limits (d) Complexity of process (e) Complexity of products (f) Deal with outside party (g) Booking of business products Largeness of annual processing volume Degree of concentration of processing on specific dates Shortness of deadlines and degree of urgency Degree of processing complexity, processing volume per task Product complexity Easiness of an error leading to a clerical accident Risk Items What to Assess Score Easiness of error in transferring actual items/funds to customer/other bank leading to  loss accident Easiness of error in handling of, or in notifying actions to be taken on, products with  market risk leading to loss event  SMFG 2010 197 SMFG Capital Ratio Information (B) Quantifying Loss Frequency of Each Scenario a. Generation of Average Frequency Table for Domestic Business Offices To quantify loss frequency for domestic branches, we assume future loss frequency is similar to historical loss frequency. And we  generate an average frequency table, which is used to estimate future loss frequency. The average frequency table comprises rows  of total risk score and columns of total control score and the number of loss occurrences in a one-year period for each combination  of scores is given.    As risk and control assessment items are expected to have different loss occurrence contribution ratios, we analyze their loss  occurrence contribution ratios for each assessment item by executing a regression analysis and weight each assessment item.  b. Quantifying Loss Frequency of Each Scenario Total risk assessment score and total control assessment score are calculated for each scenario taking into account the weight of  each assessment item described above. Then, the loss frequency of each scenario (the number of times the loss event described in  the scenario occurs during a one-year period) is estimated using the average frequency table. (C) Quantifying Loss Amount for Each Scenario In order to quantify the loss amount for each scenario, we generate loss distribution for each business process & product by using  the historical transaction data of SMBC. Specifically, we assume that the historical transaction volume follows a log-normal  distribution (distribution in which the logarithm of a variable follows the normal distribution) for each business process & product  and generate the loss-severity distribution.    Control assessment is executed from the perspective of preventive control and detection & recovery control. We set standards  for various items â€” establishment of manuals and procedures, processing authority and pre-process check, post-process check,  and so on â€” and the operation process is scored on how well the standards are met.  1 0 1 0 0 Control Assessment (Examples) Design of procedures Authority and verification System situation (a) Establishment of manuals and procedures (b) Details of manuals and procedures (c) Processing authority and pre-process check (d) Post-process check (e) System processing Whether rules/ procedures/etc. have been documented or updated Assess processing authority, pre-process check Degree of system processing Perspective Risk Items What to Assess Score Whether there are rules for accurate processing execution without omissions and whether  they are effective (excluding those included in below three risk items) Assess post-process check and accident detection measures  (assess only preventive measures) 2.0 2.4 2.8 3.2 3.6 4.0 5.5 4.5 5.5 3.5 4.5 2.5 3.5 2.40 1.5 2.5 0.5 1.5 0.5 Average Frequency Table (Example) Total Score Control Risk (Times/Year)  SMFG 2010 198 SMFG Capital Ratio Information (D) Estimating the Frequency of Occurrence of the Low-Frequency and High-Severity Events In order to estimate the probability of occurrence in terms of four loss amounts (100 million, 1 billion, 5 billion, and 10  billion) for each scenario, we use a log-normal distribution function for each scenario.   Because we assume the log-normal distribution to each business process & product, in case one loss event occurs in a one-year  period, potential loss can be regarded as likewise arising from log-normal distribution. Therefore, in this case, we estimate the  probability of occurrence of four loss amounts by substituting each loss amount for the loss amount of log-normal distribution.   In case that one loss event occurs in a one-year period, the method described above is followed. However, in case that several  numbers of loss events occur in a one-year period, it is conceivable that the events occurred independently of each other. Therefore,  the probability of occurrence of several loss events can be calculated by the probability of one loss event raised to the power of its loss  frequency.   As we quantify the loss frequency for each scenario using the average frequency table for loss events over a one-year period, we  are able to estimate the probability of four loss amounts by the probability arising from the above log-normal distribution function,  raised to the power of loss frequency derived from the frequency table.   After estimating the loss frequency in terms of the four loss amounts for each scenario, we sum results for each loss event type  and input them into the quantification model for SMFG (consolidated), SMBC (consolidated), and SMBC (nonconsolidated). B. Verification of Scenarios Using Three Data Elements  At SMFG and SMBC, the verifications of the assessments of scenarios using internal loss data, external loss data, and BEICFs  (hereinafter, 3 data elements) are implemented periodically. Specifically, SMFG and SMBC use these data and information and use  them to determine, periodically, whether there are any scenarios that have been omitted and whether the assessments of the scenarios  are appropriate to ensure the completeness and appropriateness of the scenarios.  (A) Reassessment of Scenarios Using Internal Loss Data Both SMFG and SMBC, in principle, compile internal loss data on all gross loss amounts of at least one yen. From the data, internal  loss data which fulfill the established criteria are drawn, and the content of the related loss events is considered; then, a judgment  is made regarding whether or not to review the scenario in question. Specifically, we pose a number of issues to consider, such as  whether the scenario exists at SMBC, and, if so, whether the deviation between the actual loss and the assessed value of the scenario  is within the tolerance range. In considering these issues, we follow a set pattern of logical reasoning in making a decision on  whether the scenario should be revised.    When we decide it is necessary to revise the scenario, we make a reassessment based on the internal loss data. In this process, we  consider redeveloping and reassessing the scenario and other related matters to ensure that the internal loss data is properly reflected  in the scenario. (B) Reassessment of Scenarios Using External Loss Data At SMFG and SMBC, we have a database containing more than 7,000 cases of external losses that have been taken from the mass  media, including newspapers, and purchased from data vendors. A framework has been created to enable the sharing of this database  across the Group.   From this database, we draw external loss data which fulfill the established criteria, and the content of the related loss events is  considered; then, a judgment is made regarding whether or not to revise the scenario in question. Specifically, we pose a number  of issues to consider, such as whether the scenarios in question exist at SMBC, and, if so, whether the deviation between the actual  loss and the assessed value of the scenario is within the tolerance range. In considering these issues, we follow a set pattern of logical  reasoning in making a decision on whether the scenario should be reviewed.   When we decide it is necessary for the scenario to be reviewed, we make a reassessment based on the external loss data. In this  process, we consider deriving and reassessing the scenario and other related matters to ensure that the external loss data is properly  reflected in the scenario.  SMFG 2010 199 SMFG Capital Ratio Information (C) Reassessment of Scenarios Using BEICFs At SMFG and SMBC, we compile data related to changes in laws and regulations, changes in internal rules, policies and procedures,  and new business, products and process, all of which are business environment and internal control factors (BEICFs). We use this  information to consider periodically whether our scenarios should be reconsidered, and, even for events other than those listed  previously, when major changes occur in the business environment, our systems provide, as necessary, for the consideration of  whether scenarios should be revised.   When we decide it is necessary for the scenario to be reviewed, we make a reassessment based on the information related to  changes and other factors in BEICFs. In this process, we consider redeveloping and reassessing the scenario and other related matters  to ensure that the changes in BEICFs are properly reflected in our scenarios. (2) Measurement Using the Quantification Model When calculating operational risk using the quantification model, firstly, we input seven-year historical internal loss data (realized  risks) and the data on the frequency of low-frequency and high-severity events (potential risks) in terms of four loss amounts, which  have been estimated through risk control assessments, and generate a loss distribution. Secondly, we use this distribution to estimate  the maximum loss amount with a 99.0 percentile confidence interval (hereinafter referred to as 99.0% VaR).  Thirdly, we multiply this  maximum loss by a number, which we call the risk capital conversion factor, to estimate 99.9% VaR. Finally, we calculate required  capital by using a multiplier that has been determined based on the number of times in which actual losses have exceeded predicted  losses through the use of back testing. In estimation of the aggregated loss distribution, we need to estimate the loss severity and  frequency distribution.   In addition, we confirm whether the quantification model is functioning appropriately and conservatively in measuring operational  risk by implementing various types of sensitivity analysis and verification tests.   The following chart puts the main points of this quantification method in order and explains how the results of measurement are  verified. 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 99.0 99.9 A.

Measurement Using the Quantification Model (A) Estimation of Loss Severity Distribution a. Smoothed Bootstrap Method We employ the smoothed bootstrap method for generating the loss distribution. The smoothed bootstrap method is one of the  methods that connect the distribution, of the realized risk and the potential risk event, smoothly. Under this method, no  assumptions are made about the shape of the distribution as a whole, but assumptions are made on the individual distribution  related to realized individual losses. Therefore, this method takes advantage of the widely known parametric method (method  assuming a distribution) as well as the non-parametric one (method not assuming a distribution).   Under the non-parametric method, if we use historical internal loss data to generate the loss severity distribution, we are not  able to create the samples outside the actual observation points, and also it is particularly difficult to create a distribution with  a fat tail. However, through the use of the method that can combine such data (on actual observations) with data on potential  risks, it becomes possible to create large losses that occur rarely (with a potential impact) and that have not actually been found  in historical internal loss data. In generating the distribution, while high-frequency low-severity events are based on sufficient  historical internal loss data volume, for low-frequency high-severity events in the tail of the distribution, the historical internal  data volume is insufficient. This approach makes it possible to reflect the severity (frequency of occurrence) of potential risk that  has been assessed in the risk control assessments. In this way, using this model, realized risks and potential risks can be combined  with congruity.   In estimating the loss distribution under this method, the Kernell function (partially assumed function) is applied to the loss  data by the pile-up of functions. In particular, the log-normal distribution is applied as the Kernell function. b. Supplementing Results of Risk Control Assessments with Extreme Value Theory In order to capture potential risks, a statistical method known as Extreme Value Theory is used in addition to the results of risk  control assessments. Extreme Value Theory is the statistical assessment method by which risks that may occur in the future  accompanying larger losses than the actually observed ones in the internal loss data can be quantified, and fulfills the role of  supplementing the risk control assessments.  5,000,000 10,000,000 8,000,000 15,000,000 7,000,000 Gaining a grasp of realized risk Capturing potential risks Collection of internal loss data Statistical estimates from internal loss data (Extreme Value Theory) Estimates from risk control assessments Body part of the high-frequency low-severity loss severity distribution Tail part of the low-frequency high-severity loss severity distribution Combination of the loss severity distributions Smoothed bootstrap method Loss occurrence for the last 7   years (or period actually collected) Estimates of potential risk  that may emerge (Example) (Example) Period Amount of loss Frequency of occurrence  2003 / 1H 2004 / 1H 2005 / 1H 2005 / 1H 2005 / 2H 100 million or more 1 billion or more 5 billion or more 10 billion or more Once in 5 years Once in 10 years Once in 50 years Once in 100 years Amount of loss Smoothed bootstrap method Body part Amount of losses  Tail part Frequency of occurrence 100 million 1 billion 5 billion 10 billion  SMFG 2010 201 SMFG Capital Ratio Information (B) Estimation of Loss Frequency Distribution The Poisson distribution (probability distribution often used in estimating the number of occurrences of rare events) is used for  generating the loss frequency distribution. To estimate the Poisson distribution, it is necessary to estimate the average number of  annual losses, but in this model, we do not simply take the annual average of all cases of losses for the entire period (several fiscal  years) but instead, estimate the annual average number of loss cases for each fiscal year individually. Through this approach, we are  able to take account of the deviations in the historical incidence of losses for different periods and are able to estimate loss cases that  may occur in the future more appropriately. (C) Risk Capital Conversion Factor  We calculate 99.0% VaR from the estimated aggregated loss distribution, and then multiply the risk capital conversion factor     (gamma) in order to compute 99.9% VaR. By introducing  it is unnecessary to estimate 99.9% VaR directly which can be  estimated with lower accuracy, and it provides with stable estimation results by estimating 99.0% VaR which can be estimated with  higher accuracy.   The factor  means the ratio between 99.9% VaR and 99.0% VaR. In other words, it is the risk profile of the loss distribution  and an indicator for the characteristics of the tail part of the distribution. The risk profile of the loss distribution is different for each  loss event type, by which the calculation is performed. In addition, we have verified statistically that it could differ among SMFG  (consolidated), SMBC (consolidated), and SMBC (nonconsolidated). To reflect their characteristics, we set a different value of    for  each entity. There is a tendency for  to become smaller, etc., when there is a distribution of large expected losses or when the tail of  the distribution is highly dense.   When setting  initially, we conduct an analysis, taking into account the possibility of changes in the risk profiles of many types  of loss distributions, and set values that maintain the stability and the conservativeness of capital. In addition, we assess changes  in the risk profiles of the most recent loss distributions, including the present one, and, when changes are above a certain level,  we conduct a review of the  values. This makes it possible to keep values of  appropriate to changes in the risk profile of the loss  distribution and calculate stable values of required capital. (D) Calculation of Required Capital We calculate required capital by multiplying the 99.9% VaR calculated in the previous section by the multiplier for each loss  event type that has been determined based on the number of breaches in back testing. As will be mentioned later, back testing  is conducted periodically, and, when realized risk is found to be greater than the risks estimated with the quantification model (back  testing excess), we take necessary steps, such as multiplying by the multiplier determined through prior analysis, to maintain the  conservativeness of required capital estimates.   We then add the required capital amounts calculated for each loss event type to compute the required capital for SMFG  (consolidated), SMBC (consolidated), and SMBC (nonconsolidated).   Please note that in calculating required capital, we do not subtract expected losses. B. Verification of the Quantification Model We conduct a range of sensitivity and verification tests to ensure that the measurement results of the quantification model are  appropriate (quantification accuracy) and to confirm that our model is capable of measuring the amounts corresponding to the  maximum losses from operational risk that may be incurred for a one year holding period, with a one-sided 99.9 percentile confidence  interval. In the following paragraphs, we would like to explain the methods for assessing the quantification accuracy of our  measurements and the framework we have in place for regular verifications. (A) Verification of Quantification Accuracy We have confirmed the reliability of the quantification model through a verification process from various perspectives. Specifically,  we obtain a quantitative grasp of the possibilities for variation in measurement results that may arise from preconditions or  assumptions made at the time the models were designed. In particular, we assess the possibilities for underestimating required  capital and the possible magnitude of such underestimates. Then, in our periodic verification framework, which is described below,  we make analyses of how to compensate for such underestimates. We apply our understanding of the possibilities for  underestimation to the multiplier derived from back testing, and, if the accuracy of the quantification model deteriorates, we  introduce a framework for making adjustments in the multiplier to avoid underestimating the amount of required capital.  SMFG 2010 202 SMFG Capital Ratio Information (B) Implementation of Regular Verification Process To confirm the appropriateness of the quantification model on a continuing basis, we conduct a regular verification process.  Specifically, there are two types of verifications. One is back testing, which enables us to make a comprehensive judgment on the  appropriateness of measurement results, and the other is pre-testing, in which we verify the accuracy of the quantification model  prior to conducting actual measurements. In the following paragraphs, we present an explanation of these two test types.  a. Back Testing In conducting back tests, we compare the estimates made by the quantification model with the maximum loss arising from  business activities to verify on an ex post facto basis whether the measurement results obtained from the model are conservative  enough and appropriate. When actual losses become greater than the losses estimated by the model (actual losses exceed the  estimate when back tests are conducted), we apply the multiplier factor in accordance with the number of excesses in order to  ensure conservativeness of quantification results.   Back testing is a well-known method for verifying comprehensively the appropriateness of VaR (statistical) models. We  employ the test to obtain the maximum loss amount with the given confidence interval which the tests work effectively. By  comparing the test results with the losses that actually occur, we increase the effectiveness of back testing. b. Pre-testing Pre-testing is conducted periodically, prior to use of the model for actual measurements, to verify whether the possibility of  underestimation is increasing (model risk is rising), since it is possible that the multiplier used in back testing may lead to  underestimation. As a result of pre-test verifications, we are able to confirm, on a continuing basis, whether the multiplier used  in back testing is conservative enough or model risk is emerging. 3.
