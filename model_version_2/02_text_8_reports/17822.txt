Product Strategy Our product strategy is to replicate the natural grass   experience through performance-based product   development and extensive quality testing. Performance-Based Product  Development  We start by analyzing the biomechanical needs of the   athlete or recreational user. We then conduct extensive   research and development in our own factory and   laboratory to match the biomechanical needs with the  right combination of grass fiber, backing, turf coating,  New Product 5 Year Wear 10 Year Wear  Communication on Progress  infill, installation and maintenance methods. As a result,  our customer receives a highly engineered system that  replicates the natural grass experience. Proven Benefits and Quality As a result of our product strategy and quality focus,  our customer is assured of having the latest artificial  turf technology in the world. Once we engineer the right   artificial turf system for the athlete or recreational user,  we conduct up to 60 independent lab tests to make  sure we can prove the benefits and long-term quality.   These independent lab tests include biomechanical   and athletic testing in addition to torture and durability testing. As a result, we have also achieved numerous   certifications and reports. This includes 28 products   which pass FIFA lab tests, environmental testing   and also reports based upon various other   standards including ASTM, DIN, Norwegian, Dutch  and Chinese standards. ACT Global with cooperation from Labosport and Texas  A&M University, engaged the research to understand  the sport performance of the natural turf at Kyle Field  stadium and compare those to FIFAs international  synthetic turf standards. Kyle Field at Texas A&M was  selected as it is well-known for being one of the top  natural grass football stadiums in the United States. The on-site technical assessment was performed  to test shock absorption, vertical  deformation (foot  stability), rotational resistance (traction), energy res- titution (fatigue indicator) and various ball-to-surface  interaction measurements.  By conducting this study on the best natural grass  field, we see the results fall within the parameters set  by the FIFA Quality Concept. ACT Globals products  meet those standards.
