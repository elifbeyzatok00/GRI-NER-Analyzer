In the global market place, our business  dealings bring us into contact with different  social, political, financial, legal and economic  systems  as  well  as  different  cultures,  traditions and languages. It is therefore  essential for a company such as Sodexo,  working in regions throughout the world, to  have solid ethical foundations to ensure that  Human Rights are respected and business is  conducted with irreproachable integrity.     Our strong philosophy is the foundation  of our success, both in the past and for  our future. It is based on six pillars: who  we are, our business strategy – organic  growth, our mission, our vision, our core  values  and  our  ethical  principles.       Our ethical principles are loyalty, respect for  people, transparency and refusal to tolerate  corrupt practices.  All employees at every  level  are  expected  to  adhere  to  our  philosophy and the six pillars guide each of  us in our daily work.          Sodexo is a signatory of:   the UN Universal Declaration of  Human Rights,    the ILO Tripartite Declaration of  Principles concerning Multinational  Enterprises and Social Policy    the UN Global Compact.      Sodexos mission is to Improve the Quality of  Daily Life and we believe we have a  responsibility to promote Human Rights in  practical ways that relate directly to our  business activities and presence.     With more than 350,000 employees working in  80 countries, Sodexo also has a practical  interest in encouraging the respect of Human  Rights everywhere.  What we believe at Sodexo                     Respect Human Rights    4        Sodexo is committed to improving the quality  of daily life. In practical terms, this is  translated into action by:   addressing Human Rights issues in our  own operations and those with whom we  do business and,   contributing to the economic and social  development of the cities, regions and  countries where we operate.          A formalized policy concerning  respect for Human Rights      Since the time that Sodexo (1966) was  founded by Pierre Bellon, Sodexo lives its  strong philosophy, its core values and its  ethical principles through the daily actions  of our more than 350,000 employees.   In 2003, the Group adopted a formal  sustainable development policy committing  itself to attain the specific objectives we set  with respect to our stakeholders. Sodexos  senior management signed the Ethical  Principles and Sustainable Development  Contract  charter,  committing  to  disseminate  and  uphold  the  ethical  principles and our core values with our more  than 350,000 employees. The Contract has  been translated into 14 languages.                                         The Board of Directors adopted a Code of  Conduct for Senior Managers.    Sodexo joined the UN Global Compact,  committing to respect its ten principles and  recognize responsibility for Human Rights,  compliance with labor standards and non- tolerance of corruption (2003).   The Executive Committee of Sodexo  adopted a Code of Conduct called the  Sodexo Statement of Business Integrity  (available at sodexo.com). This code  enshrines Sodexos core beliefs and  practices with regard to business ethics, to  ensure that every employee understands  and shares the Groups commitment.  (2007)      Sodexo has issued a formal sustainable development strategy backed  by a strong commitment to attaining specific objectives set for our  stakeholders.  What we commit to at Sodexo                     Respect Human Rights    5      Respect for people  Since Sodexos founding, people have been at the  heart of our philosophy. Most of Sodexos  employees are in direct contact every day with our  clients and consumers, across 80 countries. Their  commitment, expertise, diversity and ability to  grow with the business are the foundation on  which Sodexos success has been built over the  last 40 years. The wealth of our employee talents  – and differences – is our main strength.       Our vision is to become the premier  global outsourcing expert in Quality  of Life services. Our Ambition  2015 is to double the size of our  company from its 2005 level.    To  achieve  our  vision,  meet  our  Ambition 2015 objective and to serve  100 millions of consumers, we need to  ensure that our human resources are a  genuine competitive advantage. We  must become a benchmark employer in  our ability to attract, develop, engage  and retain the best talent and in our  commitment to diversity and inclusion.      For Sodexo, a company with a worldwide  presence, it is important to listen to peoples  needs, to establish constructive dialogue in a spirit  of trust, and to give each person a sense of  dignity in the work place. Sodexos strategy and  values must be brought to life in a way that also  enhances individual goals and aspirations.  We allow each employee to broaden their skills  and responsibilities and foster their personal  development. We also attach great importance to  continually improving our employees satisfaction  with their job. Since its creation, Sodexo  recognizes and respects the rights of our  employees to unionize, or not to unionize, as they  choose.     With our employees                     Respect Human Rights    6  Encouraging personal growth  Since Sodexo was founded, it has provided a  springboard for personal growth. Internal  promotion is always favored where a suitable  candidate can be found. Each employee has the  opportunity  of  acquiring  new  skills  and  responsibilities and achieving personal growth,  irrespective of their level in the organization, their  qualifications on joining the company, their  workplace,  or  their  origin.  Satisfying  our  employees expectations is one of our main  aims.      The better we are at identifying what our  employees want, the better we can place them in  opportunities within the Group.  We believe in communicating with each other and  breaking down barriers. We encourage our people  to meet and interact, in a spirit of openness..                          Respecting international labor  standards  We carry on constructive, direct dialogue with  employee representatives, in accordance with  the relevant laws in each country. From the  outset, Sodexo has always recognized and  respected trade union rights.      In North America, Sodexo has positive  relationships with a large number of unions. We  have over 300 collective bargaining agreements  with 35 different unions. We respect our  employees right to organize or not to organize  as they may so choose. We continue to  negotiate contracts with labor unions in good  faith and have a longstanding record of  continuing operations without work stoppages.  We have engaged in constructive dialogue with  unions who have raised issues with the  company, and we believe those discussions  have  been  beneficial  in  dispelling  misconceptions  about  the  company,  strengthening our union relationships, and  enabling us to work constructively to resolve  outstanding issues.       In Europe, the European Works Council was  established in 1998, and then extended to the  new European Union member states in 2004  and again in 2007; it now includes 27  representatives from 22 countries in which  Sodexo has operations. Meetings of the  Council and of its officers have provided a  forum for responding to questions raised by  employee representatives about Sodexos  results and future prospects, and for the joint  development of a performance report covering  issues related to employment, safety at work  and gender equality.                     Respect Human Rights    7  Committed to Diversity  Sodexo has a policy covering the issues of  discrimination and respect for people. Our policy  is to ensure equal opportunity in all aspects of  employment regardless of race, color, religion,  sex,  pregnancy,  national  origin,  ancestry,  citizenship, age, marital status, disability, veteran  status, sexual orientation, or any other basis  protected by law.      We strive to employ and promote the best-qualified  person for each position while valuing and promoting  diversity within our workforce. We comply with all laws  regulating employment decisions. These include, but  are not limited to: advertising, recruiting, hiring,  placement,  promotion,  transfer,  demotion,  compensation,  training,  layoff  or  termination,  participation in social and recreational functions, and  use of employee facilities.    We have a zero tolerance policy for violations of our  discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation policies.  Our policies prohibit discrimination, harassment,  and/or retaliation against employees based on race,  color, religion, gender, gender identity, pregnancy,  national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, marital  status, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, or  any other basis protected by law.  Respect for others is at the heart of our business, and  diversity and inclusion are built into our mission, core  values and ethical principles.   More than simply compliance with basic legislation we  are committed to leveraging the diversity of our talent  as a competitive advantage to drive our Groups  growth.  We strive to be the benchmark in Diversity  and Inclusion, to deliver value to our employees,  clients and the communities we serve.   Commitment to diversity and inclusion   We expect our employees to have the cultural  competence to manage diverse teams and to  leverage diversity and inclusion in order to ensure  full potential at Sodexo.  Promoting cultural diversity   We are promoting cultural diversity not only  among employees but also among all our  stakeholders such as our suppliers, our clients,  our consumers and the communities we serve.  Advancing equal opportunities   We are advancing equal opportunities for all  our employees regardless of their background or  identity.    At the Group level we have articulated four  global areas of focus at this time:    Increase representation of women in senior  management.    Generations in the workplace   Ethnic minorities   People with disabilities.  Individual countries have identified areas of focus  that might be relevant to their experiences.                      Respect Human Rights    8  Interacting in a spirit of openness   At Sodexo, we are expanding opportunities to  listen to our employees, whose views and ideas  are building blocks, helping to ensure that Sodexo  remains  a  progress-oriented  company.  Complaints are handled fairly and with respect.  We believe in open communication and the  constant breaking down of barriers.   We encourage our employees to meet and  interact in a spirit of openness. At Sodexo, we  capitalize on the rich diversity of our employees  talent and cultures by encouraging the exchange  of experience and know-how. Cross-disciplinary  work groups, international project teams and  study trips are among the range of our initiatives  designed to generate synergies.                     Respect Human Rights    9              Promoting ethical sourcing and  partnering   To further strengthen our ethical partnerships  fostering respect for people and the environment,  we ask our suppliers to commit to working with us  to contribute to our progress.     Within our business activities, we work to develop  trusting, long-term relationships with each of our  suppliers to guarantee the quality of our products  throughout the supply chain. In addition, we  encourage our suppliers to adopt a policy of  cultural and social diversity towards their own  suppliers.    We issued our Group Supply Management  policy which aims to formalize a set of corporate  rules within which all Supply Management entities  should operate, at all levels and in all regions. We  also promote our Group Supplier Code of  Conduct based on ILO (International Labor  Organization) standards in every country. This  document sets forth Sodexos desire to work with  reliable partners who utilize sound, responsible,  ethical and social practices.                     We ask suppliers to abide by a code of  conduct covering areas including:    Child Labor,    Forced Labor,    Wages And Benefits,    Working Hours,   Health And Safety Guidelines,   Freedom Of Association,   Non-Discrimination,    Disciplinary Practices and Coercion,   Community Involvement,   Ethical Standards   Where our suppliers already have their own code,  we require that they comply with our minimum  standards.     With our suppliers                     Respect Human Rights    10        In a spirit of partnership   We work with our clients to enhance and ensure  the appeal, reputation and efficiency of their  organizations, with a view to offering consumers  high quality products and well-adapted solutions  in the areas of health and safety.          With integrity  We have a responsibility to maintain the very  highest standards in our business practices with  our stakeholders. The dissemination of our  Business Integrity Statement will help us live our  ethical principles and values wherever we are  doing business in the world.    With our clients                     Respect Human Rights    11        Promoting health and well-being  We affect the lives of people many times a day as  we serve them, so it's natural that we care about  their overall health and well-being, including  helping them win the battle with obesity. As one of  the leading food services companies, Sodexo  supplies a significant part of 50 million peoples  diet. Sodexo is committed to providing nutritional  food to our consumers, and to fostering balanced  and healthy eating habits through educational  efforts in the communities we serve. The different  population segments of the countries in which we  are present have different needs, depending upon  whether they are composed of young children,  adolescents or students, people at work, seniors,  patients in hospitals or people with disabilities.        Contributing to prisoners  rehabilitation and the welfare of  detainees  Sodexo works closely with correctional facility  authorities to design, to build and to manage  prisons, young offender institutions, detention  centers and post-release rehabilitation hostels.  Specialist services are designed to ensure fair  and respectful treatment of inmates, satisfactory  living conditions, and the provision of training and  assistance in finding jobs and housing upon  release.  Research has shown that these factors  can reduce the rate of re-offending by 50%.  Sodexos Correctional Services activity provides  services to Corrections departments in eight  countries and under stringent ethical principles,  operating only in countries that operate under  recognized democratic principles that do not have  the death penalty, in which our staff is not  required to carry firearms and where the ultimate  goal of incarceration is prisoner rehabilitation.   With our consumers                     Respect Human Rights    12        Contributing to local development   Globalization has enabled many companies to  grow through their operations in developing  countries; we believe that these companies have  a responsibility to ensure that local communities  benefit from development opportunities made  possible by their presence.     We are committed to supporting the development  of local economies by promoting local hiring, the  purchase of local products and, in the most  disadvantaged  countries,  local  initiatives  to  stimulate economic growth. We concentrate our  efforts on the challenges of supporting self- sustaining  opportunities,  workforce  and  employability development, and establishing long- lasting partnerships with local communities.      Working in countries with different cultures,  particularly in countries with emerging economies,  frequently presents several challenges, including  lack of necessary industries, infrastructure and  telecommunications.  Social  or  political  disturbances can occur in certain countries and  we work to encourage respect for religious beliefs,  traditions and diversity issues.            Our efforts include:   Promoting local recruitment and employee  development   Encouraging local procurement and the  creation of small businesses   Supporting local economic initiatives   Supporting humanitarian efforts in the event of  natural disasters, particularly those generating  food emergencies.     With communities                     Respect Human Rights    13  Operating in risk zones  In some areas of the world, formal legal and  ethical systems are still developing.  Attitudes and  practices with regard to Human Rights in what are  sometimes referred to as risk zones may be very  different from countries with mature democratic  systems where most of our operations are  located.    In risk zone countries where we operate, we work  with local stakeholders for the respect of Human  Rights.    We also seek to contribute to the evolution and  progression of the social environment in the local  communities through the positive effects of our  presence, our business operations and our  participation in local development initiatives.     We comply with any law that may be applicable to  our operations in risk zones and Sodexo operates  through ethical partnerships intended to develop  fair, harmonious relations with local indigenous  communities.  We are committed to increasing  aboriginal  employment,  assisting  business,  building individual capacity, enhancing community  relations and creating mutual opportunities for  aboriginal people and the business community.
