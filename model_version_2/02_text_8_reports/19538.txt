1  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011    Madrid, 25 October 2012    Dear Sirs / Madams:  Another year, and as part of the Global Compact Progress Report, it is a pleasure to be able to share the  most important milestones with you that have marked Gestamps performance in 2011.  The most significant event was undoubtedly the acquisition of ThyssenKrupp (TKMF), the metal automobile  components division. This represents a great leap forward, both quantitatively, as we have taken on 5,700  new employees, and qualitatively, due to the positioning in growing markets (China, Turkey) and new  product development.   To optimize synergies from this merger, we are carrying out an organizational change that will let us  provide better service to our customers, due to greater product specialization and by being closer to the  geographic needs of each region where we are present.   In December 2011, at Gestamp we had 25,000 employees, which represent a 40% year-on-year increase in  personnel. Moreover, our 2011 turnover was 4,775 million, 50% higher than that in 2010.  With respect to environmental matters, last year we pointed out our commitment to offering customers  more lightweight products, thus aiming to contribute to reducing automobile emissions via weight  reduction. We want to remain consistent to this idea and, thus, this year I would like to highlight our  commitment to controlling and reducing the emissions derived from our business. We have started an  ambitious project to quantify the emissions from our processes, by establishing indicators in order to take  on improvement projects in the future. We also want to be transparent with this commitment and, to this  end; we have fixed as an objective our participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2012.  Internally, the approval of our Code of Conduct merits mention. With the growth we have experienced in  recent years, we believe it is necessary to transfer the principles to our employees that define our  corporate culture and the standards of conduct resulting from this culture.  On 1st December 2011, we approved the Code, after consulting members of the Board of Directors about  its contents. It will be implemented during 2012 at all Group companies and we will make it available to our  main stakeholders.  Lastly, I would like to point out that we continue our commitment to the principles of the Global Compact.  They are a reference for us, and they are part of our Corporate Principles, which we disseminate and  promote wherever we are present.  Sincerely yours,      Francisco J.

UNITED NATIONS OBJECTIVES AND SUBJECTS  State if the entity has any collaboration projects and if it develops actions that support the United Nations  objectives and subjects (UNICEF, UNWOMEN, Millennium Development Goals, Global Compact initiatives,   No  etc.): FURTHER INFORMATION  Thursday, 15 November 2012  Report publication date:   Ren Gonzlez Castro; Maria Alonso Tuon  Party in charge:  A+B+C  Report type: The company has suppliers in developing countries.   The company has activities in developing countries.          5  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  METHODOLOGY  DIAGNOSIS  There is a need to know what exists in order to understand what needs the entity has. Diagnosis indicators  let us identify which policies, actions and monitoring are done for each Principle.  POLICIES  They are collected via qualitative indicators that define the framework of action in which the organizations  actions, control mechanisms and monitoring are structured.  ACTIONS  They are implemented to comply with the policies. They are described by means of qualitative and  quantitative indicators. Input: Needed to understand which types of actions must be carried out. If this  input is not employed, there is a risk of implementing useless or unnecessary actions.  MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  Evaluation and control of the results obtained from the implemented actions. They are reflected in the  qualitative indicators outlined. Output: Needed to publicize the results to be able to receive new ideas  about possible improvements that are required.      DIAGNOSIS  IMPACT  MONITORING AND  MEASUREMENT  POLICIES  ACTIONS     6  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  PRINCIPLE 1  The entities must support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human  rights, within their scope of influence    DIAGNOSIS  State if the entity has performed a diagnosis in which human rights risk factors are evaluated. If so, state  the risk and its impact (P1C2I1)  Example: The entity performed a human rights diagnosis and identified as a risk the lack of information and  training on Health and Safety for employees. The impact of this risk on the entity would be an increase in  occupational accidents.  Yes  Response:   We performed diagnoses of the fundamental factors on human rights that affect our  Implementation: company.  In past progress reports, we explained that child labor and forced labor were not risk factors, due to the  importance of the technological component and the high qualifications required for employees at all levels.  We do not believe that this situation has changed with the growth experienced in 2011.  We uphold a strict and objective selection and promotion policy that exclusively takes into account the  academic, personal and professional merits of people and the Groups needs. We make a great effort not to  discriminate against people for questions like race, religion, gender, age, nationality, sexual orientation,  civil status or disabilities. Moreover, we have opened centers and companies have joined the Group that  operates in countries where we did not operate before. Furthermore, some of these companies have their  own business principles and their own policies with regard to discriminatory treatment and equal  opportunities. The aim is that in all locations where the Group operates, this policy is understood and  applied as quickly as possible. The result of the diagnosis is that we must implement the Code of Conduct,  in which we define the corporate principles and standards of conduct for the entire Group. For this reason,  as explained in more detail in later questions, we have defined a Global Code that will be implemented  during 2012.  In terms of Health and Safety, we are aware of the risks involved in our activity. We have a policy that  assures that both our employees and employees from other companies working at our facilities have a safe  and healthy working environment.  According to this policy, we employ the same criteria when assessing  the performance of any company with regard to health and safety and no difference is established between  companies operating in developing countries and those that operate, for example, in Europe. By means of  an in-house indicator that we call GHSI (Gestamp Health and Safety Index), we monitor the status of  working conditions and the degree of implementation of management systems that put the policy into  practice.     7  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  The result of our diagnoses in the area of health and safety is that we must implement our policy at the  new companies that are joining the Group, as well as speeding up the implementation of the policy at  newly-established companies and strengthening the management of significant issues that have caused the  most serious accidents in recent years.  Training is essential in a Group that is experiencing such fast growth. We must assure that the people who  join the Group know our values and policies and acquire sufficient knowledge to perform their jobs safely  and efficiently.    POLICIES  Does the entity have written Human Rights policies that have been approved by senior management?  Describe to what degree they have been implemented in the comments field (P1C2I2)  Yes  Response:  On 1st December 2011, the Gestamp Code of Conduct was approved. It contains our  Implementation:  Vision, Corporate Principles and Standards of Conduct, thus becoming the backbone of our commitment to  integrity. It will be applicable in all organizational areas and affects all employees contractually connected  to Group companies. In the companies where Gestamp has a minority holding, the Group will propose that  the governing bodies approve a Code of Conduct with similar or identical content to the Gestamp Code. We  have also defined the processes to handle questions and notifications of breaches, as well as to guarantee  confidentiality, and we have created an Ethics Committee, which will be in charge of ensuring the correct  functioning of all processes and resolving the most serious and important cases.  The Code will be implemented in 2012.  In parallel to the elaboration of the Code of Conduct, and in line with the comments in the section on  diagnosis of the need to transfer our principles and policies to the new companies, we are working on  Corporate Welcome Handbook for all new employees, entitled Onboarding. This training tool has a global  scope (for the entire Group) and its implementation will not cancel out the different welcome handbooks  that may exist in each of the Group companies. The aim of this tool is to:    Integrate essential corporate information for employees: history, milestones and organization,  corporate mission, vision and principles, code of conduct, health and safety policy, environmental  policy, etc.    Guarantee similar training in all corporate, health and safety, environmental, etc. issues that are  essential to the Group.    Increase the feeling of belonging.    Transfer the reason behind the commitments and target that the Group maintains and the need for  employees to incorporate them into their daily behavior.  In addition to the Onboarding Program, all Group employees receive occupational training, attending to the  needs detected for each employee and for each post. In this way, professional capacity building is  promoted and the employability of all workers is increased. This work is done fairly and in all countries  where the Group operates, including developing countries. In this regard, the work done by support teams     8  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  is very important, when dealing with new companies that are established in countries and regions where  there is no industrial culture.   As regards Health & Safety, being aware of the danger involved in our line of business and as stated in the  diagnosis section, we have a very ambitious Health & Safety Policy and we allocate extensive resources to  ensure good working conditions and efficient risk management.  Moreover, in 2011 we decided to promote a specific action plan to prevent and control a series of risks that  we believe are important. The plan consists of all Group companies having to guarantee the training of  crane operators in accordance with the procedure defined by the Group. External companies must be  supervised, by taking into account a series of requirements established by the Group, and they must  implement a program to ensure that all facilities have a locking procedure available when repairs are being  carried out.    ACTIONS  Does the entity have a specific action regarding this principle that was carried out during the year? If so,  describe it (P1C1I1)  Yes  Response:  We finished drafting the global Code of Conduct that we started in 2010. The new Code,  Implementation:  which affects all employees and which will be made available to third parties with whom we have business  relations, was approved, as mentioned in the previous section, in December 2011.  With regard to Health & Safety, we have continued to implement our policy in 2011. In 2010, we  announced that we would assess performance based on our GHSI at 100% of the Gestamp production  companies where it is applicable, but the Edscha Group still needs to be integrated.  The current challenge is to implement the GHSI at Edscha, as they joined the Group in 2010, so that we can  measure performance at its companies with the same criterion used at Gestamp and so that we can  integrate them into our policy. To do so, we have carried out a specific task, given that Edschas business is  different and the section on working conditions that the GHSI currently contains does not cover its  particular features. We must also add the newly-established and recently-acquired companies to our policy.  Furthermore, like every year, we review the policy and the GHSI. In the 2011 review, we varied criteria,  making specific factors more demanding and paving the way for implementing new improvements and  solutions.  The GHSI has continued to be a reference for new facilities in 2011, in terms of working conditions,  regardless of the country.  With regard to training, in 2010 the Group gave a total of 301,428 hours of training, divided into 7,465  courses, which represented an investment of  3,093 million.  Investment in training per employee was very similar to last year, 162 in 2011, compared to 164 in 2010.     9  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  This task was even more intensive in regions where there is no industrial culture or a lack of professionals,  generally in developing countries. At these sites, we professionally train employees until they have attained  the level of qualification needed, with the teaching support of experienced teams from other Group  companies, who travel to teach and oversee training (support teams). In 2011, the support teams  represented an investment of  1.650 million and some 47,000 hours.    State if you use the results obtained from the monitoring mechanisms for human rights policies in the  entitys strategic planning (P1C2I5)  No  Response:  Gestamps strategic plans are focused on specific actions to expand and maintain business  Implementation:  according to the interests of the company and the situation of the markets at any given time. However, the  Groups action policy, which is based on the Corporate Principles that define our corporate culture, has  several solid ethical principles and if any factor for improvement is detected with regard to human rights,  the measures necessary to resolve it are taken.    State if the entity notifies its customers about the safety of its products and services. If the response is yes,  state how (P1C4I1)  Yes  Response:  All products that the Gestamp Group manufactures meet the technical and safety  Implementation:  specifications required by its clients. We fulfill all safety regulations required for the automobile industry  and the specific regulations for each country. All companies follow quality control processes (all companies  have ISO TS 16,949 and ISO 9001 certifications and the new Group companies are granted a one-year  period to be certified). The Group also requires its suppliers to comply with product safety. Given the  characteristics of the sector and how the Group operates, contact with suppliers and customers is  continuous and free-flowing, where our facilities are audited by customers regularly, which assures that our  product safety control is constant and effective.  During 2010, the Gestamp Group and many Group companies –as individual entities- have received  numerous prizes and recognitions that show their commitment to the quality and safety of their products  and services. The most noteworthy of these awards include:    General Motors Best Global Suppliers, recognition of the Gestamp Group's significant contribution  as part of helping a global company such as GM achieve its results. The variables to be awarded this  recognition were technological innovation, quality, cost and service.     Automobile Industry Prize, awarded by ACICAE (Basque Country Automobile Industry Cluster), in its  section for companies situated in the Basque Country, in recognition of our spectacular  development and quick international expansion, making us a strategic ally of the main vehicle  manufacturers.

(Shanghai) (EAT)    MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  State if the entity has mechanisms in place for monitoring its human rights policies. Describe them (P1C2I3)  Yes  Response:  With regard to Occupational Health and Safety, each company reports on the GHSI each  Implementation:  quarter with the improvements implemented and/or carried out during this period. Using an audit system,  we verify that these improvements comply with the criteria established in the standard, to be able to  guarantee their reliability and comparability between all companies. The results are published and, as a  whole, become part of managements balanced scorecard.   Evaluations are also done on the training sessions given from different points of view: employees assess the  training they received and the parties in charge of the training evaluate the employees attitudes. Lastly, an  evaluation is done on how the training received has improved each employee's professional skills with  regard to the post they hold in the company.    Percentage of employees out of the total who are notified and trained on the Human Rights Principles by  which the entity is governed (P1C3I1)  100 %  Response:  The different documents in force at different Group companies that contain the codes of  Implementation:  conduct are received by all employees as part of the Welcome Handbooks that are given to new employees,  via the intranet or via internal publications. We can therefore confirm that 99% of Group employees are  notified.  100% of employees are trained and notified about the Health & Safety Policy.  The same thing happens with training: each new employee is subject to an analysis to detect training needs  and each employee is then notified of the conclusions. They also receive information on all the training     11  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  options that the Group has available; therefore we believe that 100% of Group employees are also  informed in this area.  The Code of Conduct will be implemented in 2012 for all employees, following a global training process and  guaranteeing the training of new employees through the Onboarding Project, which was mentioned above.    State the number and type of: (P1C4I3)  2  * Noncompliance with regulations on clients health and safety:  * Claims ratified by official regulatory institutions or similar bodies for the supervision and regulation of  0  product and service health and safety:  1  * Noncompliance with regulations on information and labeling of products received:  There is a procedure to handle these situations. When a noncompliance is detected, the  Implementation:  party in question has a two-day period in which to take immediate actions, one week in which to carry out  corrective actions and one month in which to measure the effectiveness of the actions taken and to  establish preventive measures. In this way, we assure that all incidents are resolved and the possibility of  them happening again is prevented. For problems with delivery notes and EDI communications, the action  period is freely agreed between Gestamps logistics departments and the customer.  In all cases, these anomalies are resolved between the automobile manufacturers and the Group and do  not generate any inconvenience for the end customer.    Amount of money invested in the community (in kind, products or services) (thousands of euros) (P1C5I1)  Specific indicator for entities that have activities in developing countries.  169  Response:  The Group encourages its employees to participate in development initiatives and  Implementation:  activities in the local community.  62% of companies perform some type of social initiative and promote and facilitate the participation of  their employees, as individuals, in community actions. 32% of companies undertake some type of ongoing  sponsorship, patronage or social action with different organizations and/or foundations that work in  different social or environmental topics. The total amount of money allocated for these purposes during  2011 was 169,000.  This figure only includes the money invested and does not include contributions in kind or services, as it has  not been possible to quantify them.  It is worth mentioning that both training in local communities and improving employability, as mentioned  in previous sections, are the main contributions that the Group makes and on which it centers its greatest  efforts.       12  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  State if the entity performs an analysis of the projects it develops in the communities where it is present and  if its carries out educational campaigns or campaigns with other characteristics that are of public interest in  these communities (P1C5I2)  Specific indicator for entities that have activities in developing countries.  Yes  Response:   Our Group is committed to the social growth of the communities in which its companies  Implementation: are located through the creation of sources of stable employment and working with local agents on those  issues that could provide value.  63% of the Group offers training and professional capacity-building training opportunities to people in the  communities where the companies are located, through employment apprenticeship programs. In 2011,  515 people participated in some type of apprenticeship program at some Group company. They received a  total of 156,963 hours of training, of which approximately 65,000 were taught by our own employees  (including tutoring by employees at a company during a work experience period).    Number of initiatives undertaken by the entity in order to prevent the infringement of human rights by the  security forces hired in their scope of action. Describe them (P1C6I1)  Specific indicator for entities that have activities in developing countries.  0  Response:  Gestamp does not have security forces to protect its facilities. It only hires private janitors  Implementation:  and security guards who comply with the regulations applicable to this sector.         13  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  PRINCIPLE 2  Entities must assure that their companies are not involved in human rights abuses    DIAGNOSIS  State if the entity has performed a diagnosis in which human rights risk factors are evaluated for their  supply chain (suppliers, contractors, etc.) or their business partners. If so, state the risk and its impact  (P2C2I1)  Yes  Response:  Suppliers are classified, in accordance with the type of product or service that each one  Implementation:  provides. In this way, suppliers are broken down into four different types: raw materials, components,  machinery and tools and indirect purchases.  Suppliers pledge to comply with Gestamp values and principles. Any purchase that is made is obligatorily  done through the Supplier Portal, which is on each companys respective website. Each supplier has an  access code and a password, with which they access a private area. When a contract is concluded, all  suppliers accept a commitment to comply with the corporate terms and conditions.  At Gestamp, it is compulsory for suppliers of direct materials and suppliers of raw materials to hold either  ISO TS 16,949 or ISO 9001 certification.  With regard to external companies that perform jobs at our facilities, 100% of Group companies have  implemented a procedure for Business Activity Coordination to assure that the employees at these external  companies that visit the company work under optimal health and safety conditions that do not compromise  Gestamp employees health or safety.     POLICIES  Does the entity have written policies that regulate relations with suppliers that are based respecting human  rights? Describe to what degree they have been implemented in the comments field (P2C3I2)  Yes  Response:  The Group obliges all its suppliers to sign a commitment to comply with corporate  Implementation:  conditions, which includes respect of human rights. This is done through their respective Supplier Portals.  Furthermore, all Group companies are certified under ISO TS 16,049 and ISO 9002 standards and the  majority also have ISO 14,001. Thus, they have quality and environmental policies that require them to  strictly control the conditions of all suppliers.  Moreover, we also have procedures to guarantee Business Activity Coordination when external companies  come to carry out work at our centers. In these procedures, in addition to establishing training and     14  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  information requirements for all employees, there is verification that the employees at external companies  human rights are not abused, which include not employing child labor, an absence of forced labor and  legalized recruitment.    ACTIONS  Does the entity have a specific action with regard to this principle that was carried out this year? If so,  describe it (P2C1I1)  Yes  Response:  After the Supplier Portal is implemented at all Group companies, it is guaranteed that any  Implementation:  supplier, in order to finalize any purchase, must sign the commitment to comply with the corporate  conditions imposed by Gestamp, which include respecting human rights. A target for the next few years is  to implement this portal at new companies that have joined the Group.  During 2011, Gestamp continued to draft a procedure to evaluate suppliers. By filling out our  Questionnaire for Sustainability, an initial view is obtained about the suppliers situation with regard to  human rights, the environment, R&D, etc., and each supplier is given a score that reflects this condition.  The suppliers that obtain a low score or are considered in risk of breaching any of the minimum  requirements established by the Group may be audited or, depending on their circumstances, even  invalidated as Group suppliers. During 2012, this procedure should be started up and supplier evaluations  begun.    MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  State the percentage of suppliers that are certified out of the total (P2C2I2)  91 %  Response:  At Gestamp, we require that all raw material or component suppliers have ISO TS 16,949  Implementation:  or ISO 9001 certification. These two groups represent 70% of Gestamps total suppliers, although we know  that some of the suppliers from the other two groups also have this certification, so that the percentage of  certified suppliers would be somewhat higher than 91%. This represents a significant improvement from  last year, when only 70% of suppliers were certified.  At Edscha, an essential requirement is that all suppliers have ISO TS 16,949 or ISO 9,001 and ISO 14,001  certification. At present, they estimate that approximately 90% of its suppliers fulfill this requirement.    State the percentage of workshops in your supply chain that have been inspected, out of the total suppliers  and contractors at the entity (P2C3I1)  Specific indicator for entities that have suppliers in developing countries.  0 %  Response:     15  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  ISO TS 16,949, ISO 9001 and ISO 14,001 certifications, compulsory for all Group companies,  Implementation:  establish control over their suppliers as a requirement. Supplier audits, independent of these certifications  and carried out at the initiative of individual Group companies, are not systematized: they are only  performed when there is mistrust or suspicion that a given supplier could be breaching the terms and  conditions of their contract. The percentage of workshops audited during 2011 has not been taken into  account.  The Business Activity Coordination Procedure is implemented at 100% of the Groups production  companies, where it is established that a subcontractor can only work at our facilities if its meets certain  requirements. If a subcontractor does not accept them or breaches them, it loses its official approval.  As commented in a previous principle, in 2011 it was decided that an action plan should be promoted so  that all Group companies conduct better business coordination, among other actions. This plan must be  implemented by December 2012 and progress is monitored each quarter, when this information is  reported to the Groups senior management. The key aspect of this action plan is that companies, in  addition to performing correct administrative controls, as they currently do, also manage to achieve good  operating controls. With the aim of helping companies in this task, we will update a computer application,  which will allow us to help them their management.  We have analyzed how the companies acquired by the Group in 2010 are complying with this coordination  of activities. These companies are not included in the action plan and must therefore meet their own  commitments, taking their priorities into consideration, not only with respect to business activity  coordination.   Moreover, we must now analyze to what extent the TKMF companies are complying with this subject.    State the number of complaints and enquiries from / about suppliers (P2 C3 I3)  4  Response:  It is very difficult to estimate the number of enquiries made by suppliers, as contact  Implementation:  between personnel in Procurement and suppliers is continuous and no express records are kept of this  contact. The Supplier Portal is the communication platform between Groups suppliers. If there is any  question or technical problem, they are resolved through the technical support provided on the Portal. If  the query is related to the sales conditions or another type of problem after the purchase has been  awarded, the supplier then directly contacts the person in the Groups Procurement Department who has  been involved in the negotiation. In both cases, relations with suppliers are quick and free-flowing and all  incidents are resolved with the maximum speed.  With regard to complaints, there is knowledge of the existence of four processes filed during 2011 and the  Groups Legal Department had to be involved.           16  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  PRINCIPLE 3  Entities must support the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right  to collective bargaining  DIAGNOSIS  State if there are risk factors that endanger the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining  (P3C3I2)  Yes  Response:  90% of Group companies are located in countries that have a suitable legal framework,  Implementation:  established in their own laws, in which the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining are  guaranteed. For the remaining 10%, the Group ensures the existence of communication channels with  employees necessary to prevent any type of abusive practice. In these regions the Group is particularly  vigilant about the existence of channels where employees can express their opinions (suggestion boxes,  meetings with HR, etc.) and satisfaction surveys are carried out. In this way, the Group tries to achieve that,  even in these countries, there is direct and free-flowing communications between the company and its  employees and that all Group employees have the facilities needed to know and defend their rights.  In 2011, 94% of Group companies had formal communication channels, through which employees can  express their opinions about the different aspects of company management and make complaints and  suggestions for improvement. We can ensure that Group companies located in countries where freedom of  association is restricted and where there are no collective bargaining agreements, they have  communication channels of this type in operation.  In the rest of the countries, the legal framework acts as a support tool for the companys internal  communication policies which guarantees that employees are formally represented, thus 100% of the  Group employees have one way or another of expressing their opinions and participating in decision- making.    POLICIES  Does the entity have a policy to request information, make enquiries and negotiate with employees about  the changes in the operations with the organizations that provide information (for example, about the  restructuring of a company)? (P3C2I1)  Yes  Response:   In the majority of the countries where the Group operates, there is legal cover to  Implementation: guarantee employee representation in the organizations decision making. Employees, through their legal  representatives, are informed and consulted when significant changes take place in the operations of the  companies that belong to the Group. In addition their rights are protected by collective bargaining     17  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  agreements, which are negotiated periodically and detail their working conditions, rights and duties.  Communications and negotiations are carried out with employees in accordance with the law. In those  countries where there is no freedom of association or collective bargaining agreements, the Group has  internal communications policies that promote direct relations with all employees.    ACTIONS  Does the organization have a specific action with regard to this principle that was carried out this year? If so,  describe it (P3C1I1)   Yes  Response: During 2011, employee satisfaction surveys were carried out at all Group companies.  Implementation:  Because the frequency of these surveys is defined individually by each company and may be annual or  biannual, we cannot provide the Groups progress with regard to this action during 2011. However, we can  state that over the last two years, 85% of the companies have asked employees about different issues  related to company management.    MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  Does the entity have monitoring and measurement procedures that guarantee the formal representation of  employees in decision-making and management of the organization? If so, describe them (P3C2I2)  Yes  Response:  100% of Group companies are submitted to regular audits pursuant to the ISO TS 16,049,  Implementation:  ISO 9001 and ISO 14,001 standards, which consider HR issues and include internal communications with  employees.    Does the entity has mechanisms to listen to, evaluate and monitor the positions, concerns, suggestions and  criticisms of employees, for the purpose of learning from and acquiring new knowledge? If so, describe them  (P3C3I1)  Yes  Response:  Among the main official channels of communication implemented by the Group so that  Implementation:  employees can express their opinions are:    Suggestions box    Set schedules for offering attention to employees    Interdisciplinary work groups for continuous improvement    Departmental meetings    Satisfaction Surveys     18  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  PRINCIPLE 4  Entities must support the elimination of all forms of forced labor and coercion    DIAGNOSIS  State if forced labor is a risk factor at your entity, given the type of activity in which it works (P4C2I1)  No  Response:  Forced labor is not considered a risk factor at the Group. Employees handle and operate  Implementation:  machinery and technology that requires a high level of training and specialization, therefore forced labor is  not liable to take place at any of our work centers.  For suppliers and external companies, the conditions that they sign via the Suppliers Portal to start working  with any Group company, as well as administrative controls of all employees outside the Group who  provide services at our facilities, try to ensure that there is no possibility for cases of forced labor in our  business activities.    POLICIES  State if the entity has written policies that regulate the number of working hours established and the  remuneration that its employees receive. Describe them (P4C2I2)  Yes  Response:  The working hours established are detailed in the collective bargaining agreements and/or  Implementation:  in legislation in force, so that they may vary from one company to another, depending on the country in  which they are located. Employees are notified, via computer tools and/or printed documents, of the  working calendar in force for each year. Furthermore, in the majority of Group companies, employees  working hours and conditions in specific posts may end up changing due to individual agreements that  promote the reconciliation of work and family life.  With respect to employees remuneration, all Group companies have clear wage policies for the different  professional categories and classes that are established according to the collective bargaining agreements  and negotiations with employees, always respecting the legal framework. Wage policies never reflect  differences depending on age, gender, religion, etc.  In 2012, the implementation of the Global Code of Conduct is planned for the entire Group, with the  pertinent communication channels, to ensure that both employees and third parties or other parties in the  supply chain can communicate any possible breach or abuse of the behaviors detailed therein.       19  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  ACTIONS  Does the organization have a specific action with regard to this principle that was carried out this year? If so,  describe it (P4C1I1)  Yes  Response:  Many of the Group companies have specific actions with regard to work and family life  Implementation:  reconciliation that affect different groups of employees.  In countries where there is little social coverage in certain areas, the company provides aids that  compensate for this situation, for example health insurance, life/accident insurance, meal assistance  programs, nursery day care and schooling.    State if the entity carries out actions that let its principles and values be transferred to the supply chain,  with regard to good working conditions and the absence of forced labor (P4C3I2)  Specific indicator for entities that have suppliers in developing countries.  Yes  Response:   All suppliers that become part of the Groups panel of suppliers must accept the terms  Implementation: and conditions on Human Rights, Health and Safety, the Environment and Product and Service Quality that  are established as requirements for suppliers.  As mentioned in previous principles, special controls are carried out for external companies that are  operating inside the Group companies facilities, and they are monitored taking into account the Health &  Safety Policy.  After the Code of Conduct is implemented in the entire Group in 2012, the Ethics Committee will enter into  force to resolve cases where the conditions included in the Code are breached or abused.  To ensure the Ethics Committee receives these notifications on breaches, both employees and all parts of  the supply chain and third parties that may be directly or indirectly affected by these infringements shall  have communication channels available to notify these non-compliances.   In all cases, communications are handled with complete confidentiality.     MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  State if the entity verifies that its suppliers faithfully comply with a reasonable number of working hours for  their employees (P4C3I1)  Specific indicator for entities that have suppliers in developing countries.  Yes  Response:  At Gestamp, we do not perform specific audits on compliance with this indicator. However,  Implementation:  there are verification and/or audit mechanisms for evaluating suppliers, taking the requirements into     20  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  account that try to assure product quality and a supply guarantee. These requirements oblige the supplier  to have controls established for their processes and that their employees have sufficient qualification levels  that minimize the risk of violating factors related to human rights.  In the case of external companies, the Group directly watches over compliance with the working conditions  through administrative controls of the external companies that come to work at our facilities, as well as  WRP audits.    State if the entity controls and verifies abidance with labor laws and standards or has certified standards  that prohibit forced labor (i.e.  SA 8000) (P4C4I1)  Specific indicator for entities that have activities in developing countries.  Yes  Response:  We assure that all laws applicable to its operations are fulfilled. However, given that  Implementation:  forced labor is not considered a risk factor, the Group does not have any certification in this respect.         21  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  PRINCIPLE 5  Entities must support the eradication of child labor    DIAGNOSIS  State if child labor is a risk factor at your entity, given the type of activity in which it works (P5C2I1)  No  Response:  During the production process that is carried out at Group companies, employees handle  Implementation:  and operate machinery and technology that requires a high level of training and specialization, so that child  labor is not liable to take place at any of our work centers.    POLICIES  State if the entity has written policies on the prohibition of child labor (for normal jobs, employees younger  than 15 years of age, or 18, for dangerous jobs) that are openly communicated (P5C2I2)  No  Response:  Owing to the type of activity, child labor is not considered a risk factor at our companies;  Implementation:  therefore we have not deemed it necessary to write action directives to this end.  In the majority of countries where the Group operates, there is legislation in force that establishes the  prohibition of child labor or people work under collective bargaining agreements that set a regulatory age  limit. In all cases, the Group assures compliance with this regulation.    ACTIONS  Does the organization have a specific action with regard to this principle that was carried out this year? If so,  describe it (P5C1I1)  No  Response:  We have not executed any specific action on this principle, as there is no child labor at the  Implementation:  Group companies. The characteristics of the activity carried out by the Group make child labor  incompatible with the majority of jobs. Only duly qualified and trained personnel are allowed to operate  machinery.       22  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  State if the entity carries out actions that let its principles and values be transferred to the supply chain,  with regard to the absence of child labor (P5C3I2)  Specific indicator for entities that have suppliers in developing countries.  Yes  Response:  All suppliers that become part of the Groups panel of suppliers must accept the terms  Implementation:  and conditions on Human Rights, Health and Safety, the Environment and Product and Service Quality that  are established as requirements for suppliers. As mentioned above, special controls are carried out for  external companies and those suppliers that work inside the facilities of the Group companies, and the  monitoring takes into account the Health & Safety Policy.    State if the entity is certified for the standards that prohibit child labor (i.e.  SA 8000; ppo. 1) (P5C4I1)  Specific indicator for entities that have activities in developing countries.  No  Response:  Given the characteristics of the activities carried out at Group companies, we have not  Implementation:  deemed it necessary to obtain this certification.    MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  Number of satisfactory verifications done in the year to rule out the employment of child labor among its  suppliers (P5C3I1)  Specific indicator for entities that have suppliers in developing countries.  0  Response:  The number of verifications performed during 2011 has not been calculated.  Implementation:  In the case of suppliers, verifications are done when a possible case of noncompliance is detected with  regard to any of the conditions signed via the Supplier Portal.  They are not systematic verifications.   For the external companies that work at the Groups facilities, control is exercised over their employees via  a Business Activity Coordination procedure. We ensure that employees from external companies comply  with the minimum age established by using this control, thus ensuring the absence of child labor.    Number of employees under 15 years of age, or 18 in the case of dangerous jobs. In the comments field,  state the number of these employees that are associated with aid programs (P5C4I2)  Specific indicator for entities that have activities in developing countries.  0  Response:  Given the characteristics of the activities carried out by the Group, there is no employee  Implementation:  that meets these circumstances.     23  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011    Number of verifications done by the Department of Human Resources to detect cases of child labor (P5C4I3)  Specific indicator for entities that have activities in developing countries.  0  Response:  We have no records that any type of verification has been done.  Implementation:         24  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  PRINCIPLE 6  Entities must support the elimination of discrimination in relation to employment and  occupation    DIAGNOSIS  State if the entity has performed a diagnosis that evaluates the risk factors of discrimination in hiring,  training and promotion. If so, state the risk and its impact (P6C2I2)  Yes  Response:  Although the legislation of some countries where we operate does not establish the  Implementation:  obligation to implement a specific equality plan, we determine the need to take action in accordance with  the corporate principles in the Code of Conduct in relation to equal treatment and non-discrimination due  to race, religion, gender, nationality, age or disability.  Our type of activity conditions the presence of women at Gestamp. It is not easy to find female die casters,  welders, maintenance technicians or lathe operators. There is a clear imbalance in the selection processes  for certain jobs and, in order to increase the presence of women at the Group, we have to apply positive  discrimination measures. 35% of our companies have an equality plan implemented aimed at achieving  equal treatment and opportunities between men and women, and 100% of our companies have the same  basic salary for each professional category, regardless of whether they are men or women. The HR  Departments at each of the Group companies are responsible for performing detailed analyses on the  characteristics of all job vacancies that arise. They are also responsible for establishing the requirements  that each employee must comply with and providing them with training and an appropriate career planning,  looking exclusively at candidates academic, personal and professional merits and the needs of the Group.  All Group companies are subject to audits, which include HR issues and help ensure that there is no type of  occupational discrimination for reasons of gender, race, religion, etc.    POLICIES  Does the entity have a written anti-discrimination and/or equal opportunity policy? Describe it (P6C2I3)  Yes  Response:  The Global Code of Conduct approved in 2011 explicitly details that the Group Selection  Implementation:  and Promotion Policy shall only take candidates academic, personal and professional merits and the  Groups needs into consideration, without allowing issues such as race, religion, gender, age, nationality,  sexual orientation, gender identity, civil status or disabilities to have any influence on their decisions.     25  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  In addition to this document, which has been approved but pending implementation, the collective  bargaining agreements in force at the different Group companies establish clear directives with regard to  discrimination and equal opportunity. Furthermore, as described in previous sections, 83% of Group  companies have their own written codes of conduct or similar documents that establish their viewpoints on  this subject in writing.  Another fact that merits mention is that 35% of the Group companies have written and implemented their  own procedures to detect and handle cases of discrimination, harassment, abuse and intimidation; 35%  have an equality plan aimed at obtaining equal treatment and opportunities; and 48% have internal  professional development policies.  If a case of infringement of employees rights does take place, the party affected will be able to turn to the  Ethics Committee, which will be established when the Global Code of Conduct is implemented.     ACTIONS  Does the organization have a specific action with regard to this principle that was carried out this year? If so,  describe it (P6C1I1)  Yes  Response:  35% of the Group companies are developing an Equality Plan that will guarantee equal  Implementation:  opportunity between men and women. The actions detailed in this plan include:    Redefinition of the characteristics of the jobs, modifying the text to employ language that is non- discriminatory.    Information for all new employees on equality policies.    Improved processes to evaluate employees and improved access to the equal opportunity plan for  management posts.    Improved contact with employees during maternity / paternity leave and planning of activities for  their return, particularly useful in countries where these leaves can extend for several years.    Training directors and raising awareness of their responsibility during selection and evaluation tasks  48% of the Group companies have implemented internal policies on professional development. In this  regard, many of the other Group companies are working along these lines to obtain career plans for all  their employees: up to 85% of companies perform systematic personal performance evaluations and  periodic evaluations when handling employees wage reviews and promotion reviews to thus ensure  complete objectivity and impartiality during these processes.  In 2011, the percentage of employees with some type of disability was 1.2%. The integration of these  people at the companies is done in countries whose legal framework requires it as well as in those  countries where there is no legislation and the companies decide to undertake this initiative voluntarily.  Furthermore, 46% of the Group companies have specific actions in place as alternatives to hiring disabled  people, which are aimed at the disabled or other groups with risk of social exclusion. The majority of these  plans are related to agreements with special employment centers.     26  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011    MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  State the percentage composition of the management bodies for corporate governance (including the Board  of Directors) and all other employees by category, gender, age and other diversity indicators (P6C2I1)  3%  Directors versus employees:  17%  Female directors:  83%  Male directors:  17%  Women:  83%  Men:  24%  Employees over 45 years of age:  47%  Employees under 30 years of age:  0%  Foreign employees:  92 %  Employees with permanent contracts:  The HR Departments at each of the companies keep records on the composition ratios of  Implementation:  senior management and governing bodies, but this information is not made public.  In all the countries where the Group operates, there are foreign employees, but we do not keep records of  these data.  With regard to all other employees, the breakdown of personnel within the Group is the following,  according to indicators of age, gender, level of education and years worked:    Gender:  o 17% women  o 83% men    Age:  o 2% of employees are under 20 years of age  o 12% of employees are between 21 and 25 years of age  o 34% of employees are between 26 and 35 years of age  o 29% of employees are between 36 and 45 years of age  o 17% of employees are between 46 and 55 years of age  o The remaining 6% of employees are over 56 years of age    Years at company:  o Less than 1 year: 19%  o 1-5 years: 36%  o 6-10 years: 21%  o 11-15 years: 13%  o 16-20 years: 4%  o 21-25 years: 4%     27  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  o Over 25 years: 3%    State if the entity publishes the composition of governance bodies and the other employees. If so, state  where this information is published (P6C2I4)  No  Response:  The composition of senior management and governing bodies is not made public. With  Implementation:  regard to the ratios for the rest of the employees, they are available on the website, in the Global Compact  Progress Report and in specific company presentation reports.    Does the entity have a mechanism or a party in charge of handling and managing accusations of  discrimination, harassment, abuse and bullying? (P6C3I1)  Yes  Response:  At present and at all companies, the handling and management of possible cases is done  Implementation:  through the HR Department, always guaranteeing the confidentiality that is required in these situations. In  deciding how to act, the departments are guided by the in-house processes at their companies on  discrimination and abuse or by the terms related to these subjects that are established in the codes of  conduct or in the collective bargaining agreements in force at any given time.  Starting in 2012, there will be more comprehensive monitoring at a Group level, thanks to the creation of  the Ethics Committee, where cases of employees' human rights vulnerabilities may be presented to file  reports and/or notify.    Number of cases opened and resolved that are related to accusations of harassment, abuse or bullying in  the workplace (P6C3I2)  4  Response:  During 2011, four cases were opened and then resolved related to issues of harassment,  Implementation:  abuse or bullying. All of them were handled properly, following both the internal processes in force and  applicable pertinent regulations.  During 2012 and in connection with implementing the Code of Conduct and the creation of the Ethics  Committee, a Communications Channel will also be created to deal specifically with these cases.           28  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  PRINCIPLE 7  Entities should maintain a preventive approach that favors environment    ACTIONS  Does the organization have a specific action with regard to this principle that was carried out this year? If so,  describe it (P7C1I1)  Yes  Response:  We are continuing with the greenhouse gas emissions inventory that we started in 2008.  Implementation:  We have also continued to work on calculating the Groups carbon footprint. During 2011, we completed  the inventory of direct emissions into the atmosphere, by including calculations on emissions from leased  company vehicles, as well as emissions from using CO2 as a welding gas in our production processes. We  have added a sheet to the Environmental Indicator on which each of the Group companies can consult their  individual greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of promoting their supervision and control, and to  facilitate establishing environmental targets related to climate change. As a target for next year, the Group  wants to highlight all the work done to date by participating in the Carbon Disclosure Project initiative,  which includes the publication of a report with the Groups carbon footprint and the different initiatives on  climate change and energy efficiency that are carried out globally, following the principles of transparency  and commitment to the environment.  Furthermore, 20% of Group companies carry out promotional activities on good environmental practices  outside the company, among which we can cite:    Environmental talks, conferences and promotional trade fairs    Promotion of environmental certification among local companies    Participation in reforestation seminars    Participation in Environmental Weeks and visits to local schools    State if the entity has initiatives in place focused on reducing the consumption of energy, water,  atmospheric emissions, water discharges or initiatives focused on improving biodiversity (P7C2I2)  Yes  Response:  79% of Group companies were certified under the ISO 14,001 Standard to December 2011,  Implementation:  and 9% were also certified under EMAS II. The compliance with the initiatives mentioned in this question  are mandatory for these standards. Annually, each center establishes an Environmental Program, in which  reduction targets are set depending on their most significant environmental issues, including reducing the  amount of waste generated and decreasing raw material and energy consumption. The actions carried out  in 2011 included:       29  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011    1. REDUCTION OF WASTE GENERATION  a. By implementing recycling programs for paper, plastic and aluminum cans  b. By adopting best practices (improvement in sorting and separating wastes, use of reusable  absorbent pads instead of just absorbent ones, reusing washed cloths in operating areas,  reusing empty containers for the management of special wastes, etc.)      2. IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY  a. Transformation of facilities and buildings by installing high-efficiency lighting technologies,  fast doors and improved insulation in warehouses to reduce losses in temperature and the  installation of low-energy consumption lights.  b. Improvements in production equipment that represent energy savings via changing the  burners on painting lines and replacing compressors with ones that have frequency  converters.  c. Implementation of best practices: control of times that lights are turned on and pneumatic  saving projects (lower pressures, cutting off air to machines that arent in operation,  improvement to cylinders, etc.).    MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  Percentage of resources out of total gross revenues allocated to awareness raising and environmental  training campaigns in % (P7C2I1)  0%  Response:  There is no information available on the money employed in internal environmental  Implementation:  education campaigns. Nonetheless, in 2011 different amounts of money were allocated to the  environmental as investments (improvements at facilities that involved a reduction in the environmental  impact of the activities), environmental risk controls and improvements focused on increasing energy  efficiency at plants and in processes. The total invested in all three items in 2011 was approximately 4  million.         30  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  PRINCIPLE 8  Entities must undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility    DIAGNOSIS  State if the entity has identified its risks and responsibilities in environmental issues, taking its sector of  activity into account (P8C2I4)  Yes  Response:  One of the Groups directives obliges all companies to implement an Environmental  Implementation:  Management System. In December 2011, 79% of Group companies were certified under Standard ISO  14,001 and a further 9% were also certified under EMAS II, which represents a 4% year-on-year  improvement.  Newly constructed and recently added companies have a specific period of time in which to obtain  environmental certification. The Groups objective is for 100% of companies to be certified.  We ensure that all companies guarantee legislative compliance and the proper identification and  management of particular environmental risks typical of their locations and production characteristics  through environmental certification. However, the Group also establishes that it is mandatory for all  companies, including those still not certified, to fill out and send the Group an Environmental Indicator  detailing all monthly energy consumptions and waste generation, which are the most significant  environmental factors identified in Gestamps global operations. We therefore ensure that 100% of Group  companies identify and manage the environmental risks that are common to our business. In 2011, this  indicator was implemented at all Edscha companies.  The information required for this indicator is reviewed and improved each year, so that its results depict as  accurately as possible the situation at each of the companies with regard to environmental issues and, if  they exist, also their risks.  Each company creates and executes their own environmental reports on the scope that their  environmental impacts could have in order to comply with requirements on environmental certification. In  parallel and using the information from the Environmental Indicator, at corporate level global reports are  drawn up that show the change of the two environmental factors that –due to their characteristics– have  the greatest environmental impact in the Group: energy consumption and waste generation.  Using this information on energy consumption, work is being carried out to calculate the Groups carbon  footprint during its production activities.  These reports are made available to all Group companies on the Environmental and Prevention Portal. This  portal is a web platform for communication and it is where Environmental and Health and Safety  professionals can find documentation of interest (Management System, presentations on indicators, etc.),  they can express their uncertainties and share experiences that can be employed as support in the daily  running of each company.     31  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011    POLICIES  State if the entity has a written environmental policy, either independent or integrated into another series of  policies (P8C2I1)  Yes  Response:  It is compulsory to have an Environmental Policy in order to obtain environmental  Implementation:  certification. Each company has its own policy, but they all contain the following principles:    Compliance with legislation    Continuous improvement    Prevention of pollution and environmental impact    Reduction in consumptions and waste production  Furthermore and in the Global Code of Conduct approved in 2011, the directives below were established  with regard to the Groups environmental initiatives:  We want to minimize the environmental impact of our activities as much as possible. To this end, each  center has environmental management systems that ensure compliance with the law and the continuous  improvement of processes. We commit ourselves to adapting and to using the best available techniques for  our facilities, and to including the environment during their design  In turn, all employees:  Must know and follow the rules, instructions and procedures on the environment in force at their  workplace.  Within the scope of their responsibility and in accordance with the policies of the Group and of their  workplace, employees should strive to improve the facilities conditions with respect to the environment  and to implement the efficient management of environmental issues.    ACTIONS  Does the organization have a specific action with regard to this principle that was carried out this year? If so,  describe it (P8C1I1)  Yes  Response:  In 2011, we continued the environmental certification process at all companies, and ISO  Implementation:  14,001 was implemented at the Gestamp Mason, G. Kaluga, G. UK, G. Manufacturing Autochasis and G.  Alabama- Lapeer production centers.  We have also improved the Environmental Indicator with respect to 2010, with the aim of evaluating the  most significant environmental issues related to our activity in greater detail. With the information     32  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  collected via this indicator, we calculate the indexes below, which let us evaluate the performance of the  different companies on environmental issues:    EEI: Energy Efficiency Indicator, defined as the energy consumption in MWh for every 100 of  added value    WMI: Waste Management Indicator, defined as the cost of waste management for every 10,000  of added value    WPI: Waste Production Indicator, defined as the production of tonnes of waste for every 1,000 of  added value    CO2EI: CO2 Emissions Indicator, defined as tonnes of CO2 emissions for every 100,000 of added  value.  The Environmental Indicator also requests all companies to submit the amounts of waste produced each  quarter, breaking them down into hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and the main waste categories  that are produced during normal production activities in our sector. A 2012 objective is to establish a  control within the indicator on the consumption and management of water and raw materials used.  We are continuing with the greenhouse gas emissions inventory that we started in 2008. We have also  continued to work on calculating the Groups carbon footprint. During 2011, this calculation included  Edscha information and an objective for 2012 is to publish this information through participation in the  Carbon Disclosure Project.    MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  State if the entity has effective mechanisms in place for evaluating environmental issues (P8C2I2)  Yes  Response:  In 2011, all Group companies had at least one person responsible for environmental issues,  Implementation:  who are in charge of controlling and managing possible risks and identified issues. In turn and employing  the Environmental Indicator that is reported quarterly by every center, the Group monitors and evaluates  the environmental behavior of all companies.  Associated with the compliance of environmental certification requirements, all companies establish an  Environmental Management Program on an annual basis. Based on this program, each company establishes  a series of objectives and goals that are aimed at the continuous improvement of their environmental  behavior, they monitor to ensure their compliance and, in the event of deviations, the situations are  corrected.    Percentage of suppliers and contractors of goods and/or services with environmental management systems  implemented by type (e.g. ISO 14,001, EMAS, etc.) % (P8C3I1)  45%  Response:     33  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  Compared to the 38% of suppliers that were certified under ISO 14,001 at Gestamp in  Implementation:  2010, we can ensure that 45% of suppliers that are registered on the Gestamp Quality Platform have this  certification in force in 2011.         34  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  PRINCIPLE 9  Entities must encourage the development and dissemination of environmentally friendly  technologies    ACTIONS  Does the entity have a specific action with regard to this principle that was carried out this year? If so,  describe it (P9C1I1)  Yes  Response:  Respect for the environment is integrated into our business strategy, primarily through  Implementation:  R&D and energy efficiency. The mission of the Gestamp R&D Department is closely linked to safety and the  reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, offering the most suitable and innovative solution, adapted to  each specific need, obtaining the best results in weight reduction, safety and comfort. In this respect, we  actively participate in national and international projects to develop innovative solutions, jointly with other  companies in the sector, and we collaborate both with clients and suppliers.  R&D is an extremely important part of Gestamps business and the continual search for new products and  technologies is a Group requirement, working together with suppliers and clients to this end. We had  around 700 people working directly in the R&D Department to obtain safer and more lightweight products  during 2011. This means that 4% of our total number of employees works in the R&D Department,  comprised of 12 centers located in different countries and distributed throughout the world.  With regard to energy efficiency, the Group is continuously searching for new solutions to implement at the  different companies to make them more efficient, not only by adopting best practices, but also via  improvements to make processes more efficient. In this line of action we can also include, for example,  optimizations in company layouts, optimization in the use of raw materials and updating of machinery,  seeking improvements that enable us to reduce our energy consumption and reduce our emissions.  Moreover, when designing and constructing new plants, the Group ensures the use of the most efficient  technologies from an energy viewpoint.    MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  Number of studies, reports written and communications sent during the year to increase the dissemination  of environmentally-friendly technologies and to improve energy efficiency (P9C2I1)  500  Response:  We estimate that around 500 studies and reports have been carried out that are related  Implementation:  to developing environmentally-friendly technologies and to improving energy efficiency. However, it is  impossible for us to quantify the exact number.     35  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  Moreover, the different companies, attending to customers requirements, are committed to using  technologies that enable the production of lighter products that are consequently, more environmentally- friendly. The means of production are thus being renovated or exchanged for others that are more modern  and efficient, which in turn indirectly contributes to respecting the environment.  Therefore, the studies and actions carried out in this area in 2011 can be broken down into three broad  categories: product design, energy efficiency at facilities and energy efficiency in production processes.  1.    PRODUCT DESIGN The most noteworthy technology in this regard is hot stamping. It allows us to produce steel parts with  ultra-high strength, which leads to more lightweight products that are more resistant to impacts that take  place during hypothetical accidents. The use of high-resistance structural reinforcements enables up to a 10%  reduction in the weight of a 1,500 kg vehicle, which represents a subsequent emissions reduction of 10-20  g CO2/km, while maintaining the same level of safety. However, Gestamp does not only have this type of  technology, other noteworthy technologies include:    Roll forming technology:  This technology is based on the idea of deformation by progressive bending and the use of UHSS  (ultra-high-strength-steels), which permits:  o High flexibility in designing end sections and lengths  o Improved functionality (rigidity and dynamic behavior)  o Potential weight reduction in the end product  o Cost reduction by optimizing the use of raw materials and the integration of secondary  operations  o Reduction of tooling costs      Hydroforming technology:  Hydroforming lets complex geometric elements be obtained with high levels of deformation, using  wall thickness. This technology eliminates the need for welding points, making components with  extremely precise shapes and sizes in a single process. This leads to an enormous improvement in  their functionality and performance, allowing for:  o High flexibility in design  o Potential weight reduction  o Cost reductions (decrease in subsequent assembly and elimination of tooling)  It is employed in countless applications for automobile components such as axles, dashboard cross  beams, bumpers, supports, etc.    2. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AT FACILITIES      Modifications to roofs that allow for a better use of natural light    Installation of blinds to block sunlight in excessively exposed windows    Change of artificial lighting for low consumption lights with greater efficiency       36  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011    3. ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN PRODUCTION PROCESSES      Optimization of processes to reduce energy consumption    Replacement of obsolete machinery with new more efficiency equipment    Improvements to the existing equipment by using devices that enable start-up consumptions to be  reduced  In addition to the improvements that are being carried out due to the typical dynamic of this business, 47%  of the companies have made significant improvements by implementing best practices, which include:    Savings derived from lighting and air conditioning controls in buildings    Disconnection of equipment (compressors) at night and weekends when the production process is  not operating    Use of hot air from compressors to heat the facilities    Financial investment, out of the total gross revenues, in the current year for the development and  dissemination of technologies that are environmentally-friendly (P9C2I2)  3  Response:   3% is the percentage invested in development and dissemination of technologies that  Implementation: reduce the environmental impact of our products and processes, out of total gross revenues. However,  R&D investments represent 25% of the total investments made by the Group in 2011, which provides an  idea of the importance of this activity within our policies.  All technologies entail a greater or lesser degree of environmental impact, so we understand this indicator  to mean the investments allocated to improving products and processes from the viewpoint of  environmental impact, and expenses earmarked to control the environmental impact of processes. We can  thus quantify:    R&D investments: as explained in a previous indicator, the mission of the R&D Department is  closely related to emissions reductions by means of reducing the weight of parts    Investments in the implementation of new technologies that enable us to provide more lightweight  products with respect to the sectors traditional products, which contribute to reducing emissions  by reducing vehicle consumptions    Investment in the measures that have been carried out for energy efficiency at existing facilities  and that were detailed above    Expenses stemming from the control of environmental issues and protecting and improving the  environment         37  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  PRINCIPLE 10  Entities should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery    DIAGNOSIS  State if the entity has performed a diagnosis to find out the areas of greatest internal risk within the  organization and in its sector of activity and identify what these risks are and their impacts (P10C3I1)  Yes  Response:  The Group does not participate in any political activity or make financial donations of a  Implementation:  political nature in any country of the world, so any risk of corruption that could hypothetically arise would  have to be related to the acceptance of gifts from suppliers, favoritism to them or unfair competition with  customers.  However, all these situations are strictly controlled through different mechanisms  implemented, such as, for example, account audits and the Suppliers Portal. Next year, they will also be  regulated by the Global Code of Conduct approved in 2011, so we can conclude that the risk of corruption  within the Group is low.  At Gestamp, managing procurement through the Suppliers Portal follows the directives established in the  UNECWA 15896 Standards, which establish traceability and transparency in management as ways to  prevent corruption. Furthermore, the Suppliers Portal is managed through a specialized external consultant,  which provides additional controls against any possible types of corruption.    POLICIES  State if the entity has a written policy defined against corruption, extortion and money laundering (P10C2I2)  Yes  Response:  During 2011, the Group approved the Global Code of Conduct, which explicitly makes  Implementation:  reference to bribery and corruption, with a primary focus on dealings with public administrations and the  control of gifts, invitations and business expenses, the text is quoted below:  Most of the countries where Gestamp operates have laws that prohibit corruption and bribery, even if  committed outside the borders of the country in question. Any violation of these laws is a serious offense  that can result in fines for companies and jail for individuals.   Therefore:  No one from Gestamp is allowed to engage any government official or political party in negotiations to offer  or deliver a bribe, gratuity, gift or social invitation that favors decision-making for their own benefit or that  of the company. We must be extremely honest and upright in all our dealings with Public Administrations.     38  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011    The implementation of the Code of Conduct at all Group companies is an objective for next year.  Meanwhile, we know that 83% of the companies have their own individual codes of conduct or procedures  that define the companys values and the basic rules of conduct, which consider anti-corruption issues.  With regard to relations with suppliers, Gestamp has drawn up a Corporate Procurement Model that  defines how the entire process is managed, from the time a need is detected until the purchase is awarded,  including regulations on dealings and relations with suppliers.    Does the entitys policy include controls and procedures with respect to gifts, invitations and business  expenses, including their limits and information channels? (P10C5I1)  Yes  Response:   The Global Code of Conduct approved in 2011 contains the directives below, with respect  Implementation: to gifts, invitations and business expenses:  Demanding and accepting gifts and tokens of appreciation  The exchange of gifts and tokens of appreciation is a sign of good will in trade relations, but some gifts may  be seen as bribe, they could tarnish Gestamp's reputation and even violate the existing legal framework.   Offering and granting gifts and tokens of appreciation  Our clients appreciate the differentiating value Gestamp provides them as a result of, among other things,  the honest relationships we seek to establish and maintain. Moreover, any intention to influence people  with decision-making by offering gifts or tokens of appreciation can lead to heavy penalties for the  company.     In addition to these general considerations, the Code of Conduct provides specific instructions about how  specific groups of employees must act who, due to the characteristics of their jobs, must work directly with  suppliers and clients, or whose work is done in countries where gifts and tokens of appreciation may be  common custom or courtesy. We thus ensure the control of any risk of corruption, favoritism or unfair  competition.    ACTIONS  Does the organization have a specific action with regard to this principle that was carried out this year? If so,  describe it (P10C1I1)  Yes  Response:  Annual account audits represent additional support to the control systems against  Implementation:  fraudulent practices within the organization. The different Group companies consolidate their earnings  annually, so that there is additional supervision of cash and banks at a corporate level, making the  existence or possibility of fraudulent practices extremely difficult.     39  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011    MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  State the percentage of the total, broken down by each stakeholder that knows the codes of conduct and  policies to fight corruption and bribery at the entity (P10C2I1)  100  Clients:   91  Employees:  100  Suppliers: Relations with clients are continuous, free-flowing and direct; therefore the knowledge of  Implementation:  the Groups internal directives is conveyed directly and effectively to them.  91% of Group employees know the codes of conduct and similar documents in force at the different  companies that contain directives on corruption.  With regard to suppliers, in 2011 100% of them had to carry out all the management through the Suppliers  Portal, therefore they were always notified of operating conditions.    Are all donations to charities and sponsorships transparent and done in accordance with pertinent laws?  (P10C4I1)  Yes  Response:  The donations and sponsorships made by the Group are managed and documented in  Implementation:  accordance with the applicable legislation in each country. Account audits ensure that no irregularity takes  place in these actions.    State if the entity has mechanisms in place to manage anti-corruption incidents (P10C6I1)  Yes  Response:  At present, the mechanisms for managing anti-corruption incidents are established by the  Implementation:  respective procedures and individual codes of conduct that are currently in force at the different  companies.  The Group has an objective to create an Ethics Committee, associated with the Code of Conduct, which will  be responsible in the future for managing anti-corruption incidents, as well as other tasks mentioned above.         40  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2011  TABLE OF CONTENTS  This table of contents details the connation of the indicators from the United Nations Spanish Network  Progress Report to GRI indicators.
