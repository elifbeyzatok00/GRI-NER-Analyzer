Woolworths Limited is the 20th largest global retailer, with 3,241 retail stores in Australia and  New Zealand, sales revenue of AUD 54.1 billion, 190,723 employees and 27 million  customers per week.

Woolworths direct economic benefit is AUD 6.3 billion  through wages and AUD 2 billion through taxes.  Woolworths indirect economic contribution  to the Australian economy was AUD 101 billion.    Woolworths direct operations are only based in OECD nations, and the companys only  exposure to developing nations and emerging economies is in the sourcing of Private Label  products.    Our ethical and sustainable sourcing policies provide clear direction for the business, and our  suppliers, and set high standards for the areas covered by the principles of the Global  Compact.    This Communication on Progress details the commitments, systems, actions and progress  Woolworths has made against the ten (10) principles of the Global Compact.  Most of the  commentary and data in this report is drawn directly from the Companys Corporate  Responsibility Report 2011, which underwent independent assurance and received an A+  rating in the GRI application level check.

Human Rights    Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed  human rights    Woolworths Limited declares, in its Ethical Sourcing Policy, that it is committed to upholding  human rights, fair working conditions and environmental protection.  Woolworths have made  public commitments on protecting human rights throughout its business, whether its the  rights of our employees or the employees of vendors in our supply chain.    Woolworths Sustainability Strategy 2007-2015 acknowledged the well-established ethical  compliance and quality management policies, practices and audits used by our global  sourcing office in Hong Kong.    Our Ethical Sourcing Policy addresses key areas of bribery and corruption, labour rights,  working conditions and environmental compliance and has been issued to all suppliers of  Woolworths own brand products and to all Buyers in our business.  This Policy is based on  the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO)  conventions and the principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.    All Woolworths suppliers are required to comply with the requirements of the Policy and this  expectation is complemented by a compliance audit program for suppliers of our own  branded products.  The auditing program is managed by Woolworths Quality Assurance  (WQA) team and involves an ongoing program of auditing existing and new suppliers.    The rights of Woolworths own employees are protected through a multitude of policies and  practices, including:      Inclusive workplace – A public commitment to a diversity policy which applies to the  Board of Directors, all employees of Woolworths Limited and its subsidiaries.    Gender balance – Woolworths has committed to being an early adopter of the new  Australian Securities Exchange Corporate Governance guidelines for diversity, as  part of this commitment we aim to have a 33% representation of women at Board  level and within our senior executive group by 2015.

Training on human rights policies and practices is ongoing for all existing and new employees  of Woolworths.  Annual training figures are recorded and reported in our Corporate  Responsibility Report.    As Woolworths direct operations are based in low risk countries, Woolworths do not employ  security personnel which would fulfil roles that could contribute to the risk of human rights  violations.  This requirement is reported as not applicable in the relevant GRI indicator.    Most of Woolworths operations are based in Australia and New Zealand, which are  considered a low risk for human rights abuse.  Woolworths has prioritised suppliers and  factories in high risk regions and emerging economies.

Woolworths had made a number  of significant targets and commitments on sustainability, and reports its progress annually  through the Corporate Responsibility Report.  Woolworths has not made a specific statement  in regards to using a precautionary approach to environmental impacts and issues.      Woolworths commitments have been supported by investment in capital in areas of energy  efficiency, low carbon technologies, water efficiency, fleet design and efficiency, waste  diversion and recycling and staff engagement.    Woolworths brands itself as The Fresh Food People and prides itself on the fact that 97.3%  (by weight) of the fresh fruit and vegetables, and 100% of the fresh meat, sold in our  supermarkets is produced by Australian farmers.  With growing global populations there is a  need to provide food security and to increase the productivity of existing agricultural land.   Woolworths has funded, and continues to fund, projects through the Fresh Food Future  program, which have focussed on advancing agricultural sustainability and building  leadership capacity in the sector.    Woolworths is an active member of The Consumer Goods Forum, and is a signatory to the  Board resolution to achieve zero net deforestation through the consumer goods supply chain  by 2020, through the sourcing of commodities like palm oil, soya, beef, paper and board in a  sustainable fashion.    Progress is also occurring in areas of sourcing sustainable palm oil, forestry and timber  products and seafood.  Woolworths Sustainable Palm Oil Policy involves membership in the  Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), on-pack labelling of palm oil as an ingredient in  private label products, and only sourcing RSPO certified sustainable palm oil for private label  products by 2015.

Our seafood range is  undergoing independent sustainability assessment and we will use the resultant information  to engage our customers on their seafood choices.  As a retailer of fresh food Woolworths  understands the value of creating a sustainable and secure supply of seafood.    Woolworths also seeks advice and new perspectives on corporate responsibility from an  advisory panel of Australian and New Zealand leaders in this field.  The CEO and senior  management have engaged with the Corporate Responsibility Panel and have obtained fresh  insights into key strategies.  Key issues discussed during 2011 include the responsible  service of gaming, greening the supply chain, sustainable supply chain certifications, cost of  living and our Reconciliation Action Plan.    Woolworths is a growing business and continues to build and open new stores in Australia  and New Zealand.  There were 104 property development projects in planning, under  construction or completed in 2011, with only 12 of these projects requiring biodiversity  assessments.  Seven Vegetation Management Plans were prepared for minimising impacts to  species and habitats.    Highlights  $55.7 million invested in energy efficiency since 2007, which will deliver approximately $93  million in savings by 2015  $6.5 million invested in over 150 projects focussing on the adoption of sustainable  agriculture practices  Introduced MSC certified tinned tuna and salmon range, and MSC certified frozen fish     range in private label  46% of private label products that have palm oil as an ingredient, are labelled as palm oil  instead of vegetable oil  GRI Indicators  EC 2; Environment (EN) 18, 26, 30; SO 5      Environment    Principle 8: Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental  responsibility    As mentioned in Principle 7, Woolworths Sustainability Strategy outlines the companys  public commitments for improving the sustainability of the business and reduce our impact on  the environment.

Woolworths has a specialised Group  Engineering Team, which identifies, tests and implements energy efficient and low carbon  technology.  Since 2007 this team has overseen $55.7 million in investment, which will deliver  $93 million in savings in energy costs by 2015 and has enabled the company to cease  increasing its carbon emissions, and start reducing them, despite the business continuing to  grow.    The Group Engineering Team has implemented innovation in refrigeration (both plant  equipment and customer facing cases), air conditioning, lighting and general power.   Woolworths has set itself as a global leader in the use of low carbon, non-synthetic  refrigerants, which have reduced carbon emissions associated with refrigerants by more than  266,000 tonnes per year.    Woolworths has also made investments in renewable technology, despite it still being an  expensive option for energy production.  Two trial sites were set up in our Petrol division,  where two types of photovoltaic solar panels were installed.  The energy production from  these sites, and measured return on investments will enable detailed analysis on whether  future investment in this technology is financially viable.  Feasibility assessments have also  been conducted on a large-scale wind turbine at a distribution centre.    Woolworths also trialled and implemented the use of bio-diesel, made from waste tallow and  oil, in Woolworths-owned logistics fleet.  As a food retailer, the company has been conscious  of not using first generation bio-fuels which may be produced from food crops, starches or  oils.  Following a successful trial, almost 3 million litres of this bio-diesel was used in 2011.    Woolworths sustainable sourcing policies are helping to make sustainably sourcing paper  and timber products more mainstream and are also introducing more sustainable options in  palm oil and seafood.

Woolworths Ethical Sourcing Policy and compliance audit program follows requirements  set in the ETI and ILO conventions.    The specific requirement in the Ethical Sourcing Policy is:      Suppliers shall not engage in acts of bribery and corruption and shall not falsify  documents and records    Woolworths continues to conduct quality assurance and ethical sourcing audits on its private  label suppliers and there is zero tolerance to incidents of bribery and corruption.    Woolworths Code of Conduct is the cornerstone for how we expect our employees to work and  represent the company.  The Code of Conduct provides guidance on our commitment to the  highest legal, moral and ethical standards in our dealings with customers, suppliers, employees  and local communities.    The Code of Conduct clearly details expected behaviours in how we engage with vendors and  also employees responsibility in declaring conflicts of interest.  The Code of Conduct was  updated to formally include content on the Speak Up whistle-blower program.  In 2010, more  than 134,000 employees had been trained on the Code of Conduct, and this increased to more  than 172,000 employees trained by 2011.    The Code of Conduct is further supported by processes that include our vendor dispute  resolution and incident escalation process, which is communicated through our vendor website  and Vendor Guide.

In 2011, $140,000 was invested in this program.    Woolworths funded $38,000 for one participant in the Investing in Youth Studentship  program, run by RIRDC.  Undergraduates receive financial support, mentoring and relevant  industry placement in their chosen field.    PICSE promotes agricultural sciences as a part of the secondary school curriculum, and  Woolworths supported this in 2011 with a $68,000 investment.
