As  a given we act in accordance with the principles we  advise clients to apply. We believe that the  internationally agreed principles for sustainable  development add needed quality to the field. The  Principles-Based Approach to CSR enables us to address  our impact on essential areas for sustainable social,  environmental and economic development. Also it  enables cost-efficient approaches to best manage such  impact. We intend to maintain our leadership position in  the field ensuring that fulfilling our purpose is also  profitable for our business      It is my pleasure to present our first Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR) report describing examples of our internal  and external efforts with regard to CSR during 2010. GLOBAL  CSR was established as a consultancy almost 15 years ago. As  one of the first professional advisors on CSR worldwide we  have always optimised the social, environmental and economic  impact of our business. That is a matter of integrity. The report  describes our top priorities for action and provides information  on our performance in 2010; a snapshot. Also our objectives  for the future are described.  It is important for GLOBAL CSR that we continuously  contribute, while avoiding becoming a barrier, to sustainable  social, environmental and economic development. We continue  to support the UN Global Compact which provides for a  consistent and transparent framework for our CSR efforts and  reporting. We acknowledge the important role that the initiative  has in mainstreaming the concept and practice of CSR based on  internationally agreed principles.      To put the principles into practice, we rely on the enthusiasm,  creativity and inspiration of our employees in inspiring  businesses to adopt profitable sustainability strategies. We look  forward to continuing our work on CSR in 2011, and aim to  improve our performance in areas of key importance to the  future of our planet.                        Sune Skadegaard Thorsen, CEO     4    ABOUT GLOBAL CSR  GLOBAL CSR is a privately owned consultancy firm located in  Copenhagen, Denmark.  As a leading Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR) consultancy firm, we specialise in creating  sustainable solutions for private companies, public authorities  and organisations in a range of countries and industries. Since  1996, GLOBAL CSR has carried out assignments in all parts of  the world.  Our key asset is knowledge. In an effort to contribute to  sustainable development, we share our knowledge by advising  organisations and initiatives that are key players in the  continued development of CSR. These efforts include both paid  and pro bono work for organisations such as The Danish  Government Centre for CSR, United Nations Global Compact  (UNGC), the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights, the  Institute for Business & Human Rights, the UN Special  Representative of the Secretary General on business & human  rights, the European Bars and Lawyers Association, the Danish  Industrialisation Fund for Developing Countries and a range of  civil society organisations. Integrity is integral to the way we do  business. We provide advice that leads to long term sustainable  solutions for our customers and we only support CSR activities,  which we  genuinely  believe  contribute  to  sustainable  development.   OUR WORK    GLOBAL CSR assists and advises corporations in developing  and implementing strategies in line with the triple bottom line  concept and internationally recognised principles. We call this  the Principles-Based Approach to CSR. With more than 15  years of experience in CSR and an extensive network of  domestic and international partners, we are able to provide the  most qualified, up-to-date and experienced consultancy.   Our goal is to develop innovative models to address  sustainability,  enabling  differentiation  and  cost-efficiency  thereby increasing the value of the organisation for the client.   GLOBAL  CSR  is  experienced  in the  full  cycle  of  CSR  implementation from pre-assessment, risk & opportunity  analyses, vision statements, strategies, policies, over training  to action planning, project design, implementation and  evaluation. In addition, our team has vast experience  in evaluating both corporate and public programmes and in  performing social impact assessments.   A deep understanding of the needs and wishes of business as  such as well as each individual organisation that we assist,  enables  us  to create  socially,  environmentally,  and  economically sustainable CSR strategies.   5    OUR VISION  We envision a world of diverse social, environmental and  economic abundance and sustainability, in which all human  beings enjoy the full realisation of their human rights. A world  where businesses live by principles essential for becoming key  players in the co-creation of a brighter future for our planet,  humanity – and not least for doing business.   GLOBAL CSR is a catalyst for such development. We  are recognised as a preferred partner advising corporations,  governments, multilateral organisations and non-governmental  organisations on how to make the international principles of  CSR operational and profitable.     OUR MISSION  GLOBAL CSR will run a profitable business by:                                            Promoting  the  work  on  sustainable  development    through a focus on the Triple  Bottom Line (people, planet and profit)       Inspiring  and  assisting  corporations,  governments and organisations in developing  and implementing CSR activities and thereby  creating value      Delivering innovative and simple solutions,  which create value for corporations. We apply  the  principles  from  the  UNGC  as  our  framework for strategic CSR       Maintaining our high professional integrity       Making the "business case for CSR essential  for the way we run our business        6    THE 10 GLOBAL COMPACT  PRINCIPLES   The UN Global Compact Principles cover all three bottom lines:  The first six principles (human rights, including core labour  rights) are key to social sustainability, the following three to  environmental sustainability, and the tenth principle to  economic sustainability (anti-corruption).        HUMAN RIGHTS  PRINCIPLE 1: Businesses should support and respect  the protection of internationally  proclaimed human rights; and  PRINCIPLE 2: make sure that they are not complicit  in human rights abuses.      LABOUR STANDARDS  PRINCIPLE 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of  association and the effective recognition  of the right to collective bargaining;  PRINCIPLE 4: the elimination of all forms of forced  and compulsory labour;  PRINCIPLE 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and  PRINCIPLE 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of                      employment and occupation.                          ENVIRONMENT  PRINCIPLE 7: Businesses should support a precautionary  approach to environmental challenges;  PRINCIPLE 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater  environmental responsibility; and  PRINCIPLE 9: encourage the development and diffusion  of environmentally friendly technologies.      ANTI-CORRUPTION  PRINCIPLE 10: Businesses should work against corruption   in all its forms, including extortion   and bribery.       7    SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY   PRINCIPLES 1-6  Our primary social sustainability impact is through the  actions of the clients we advise     In all of our activities, GLOBAL CSR respects and is committed  to support human rights including the core labour rights, which  form the heart of social sustainability; human dignity. The basic  human rights principles are essential for the wellbeing and  development of all people. They cover all basic needs for  enhancing human dignity. We continue to sharpen our unique  skills and expertise in this area, as it is through our consulting  services that our main contribution to sustainable social  development lies.     Our impact  As a consultancy firm we assist corporations that are both  experienced and leading within the field of CSR as well as  corporations that have only just begun working with the area.  Our services also span across borders, both when we provide  services to international corporations and when we advise  clients to address CSR in all their relations; both in supply  chains and downstream. By assisting our clients to contribute,  while  complying  with  the  agreed  principles  for  social  sustainability, we ensure that CSR efforts both serve society  and our clients.  Using the principles for sustainable  development we are experts in identifying both challenges and  opportunities in CSR.    GLOBAL CSR consultants are recognised as leading experts on  the application of the International Bill of Human Rights as the  basis of CSR activities in relation to social sustainability. CEO,  Sune Skadegaard Thorsen is an active member of several  international professional bodies developing CSR.                             UN Special Representative of the Secretary General on  business & human rights  GLOBAL CSR has since the appointment of the UN Special  Representative on business and human rights, Prof. John Ruggie,  supported his work. We are impressed with the thoroughness and  diligence of the work and, even more so, with the results.   In 2008 the unanimously adopted Policy Framework resting on the  three pillars of State Duty to Protect, Corporate Responsibility to  Respect and Access to Remedy created an unprecedented basis for  advancing social sustainability. Most stakeholders supported the  Framework.   In 2010 the Draft Guiding Principles for making the Framework  operational  pragmatically  outline  key  processes  that  both  governments and businesses need to implement. We await with great  expectations the Final Guiding Principles and their adoption in the UN                 8    GLOBAL CSR regularly participates in the public debate on  business and human rights and the Principles-Based Approach  to CSR. We regularly publish articles and participate in national  and international working groups related to the 10 UNGC  principles and CSR. We devote time to engage in the debate  because we can see the added value of this approach to our  clients  and  to  society.  Continuing  to  promote  social  sustainability is therefore an ongoing objective for GLOBAL CSR  and an area where we can make a difference.    Organisational knowledge  We recognise that knowledge is our primary resource. The  success of our business depends on our knowledge and  competencies and our abilities to communicate this knowledge.  It is important for GLOBAL CSR to continuously improve our  competencies on CSR and sustainable development in theory  as well as in practice because it is a key factor in the long-term  success of our firm. It is also important for us to share our  knowledge supporting the development of the CSR field to find  better, more cost-efficient and innovative ways to address  global challenges in relation to social sustainability. Two key  principles for social sustainability, where our competences and  products can make a big difference are: Freedom of  Information and Right to Education.   In 2010 GLOBAL CSR gave presentations at several national as  well as international seminars, workshops and debates on CSR.  As examples:       GLOBAL CSR joined leading panelists at the UN Global  Compact Asia Pacific Conclave in India to discuss how  enterprise value can be enhanced using the UN Global  Compact.      GLOBAL CSR conducted seminars at the Danida Fellowship  Centre  and  Mannaz  about  strategic  CSR  and  implementation. Also GLOBAL CSR spoke in Denmark, Egypt  and India  about the launch of Prof. Ruggies UN Guiding  Principles (draft) outlining the basic UN expectations to  businesses  regarding  processes  to  handle  corporate  responsibilities on human rights.     In total our CEO gave public presentations (not including  corporation specific trainings or presentations) for more than  60 hours in 2010 up from 20 hrs. in 2008 and 30 hrs. in 2009.  We also publish educational material, academic and non- academic articles and are often interviewed by the media. In  2010 our CEO Sune Skadegaard Thorsen accepted to function  as external examiner at Roskilde University Centre, Global  Studies, and as external lecturer at the Copenhagen Law  Faculty teaching CSR under Corporate Governance.    9    GLOBAL CSRs most valuable assets are the knowledge of our  people and the know-how we manage to convert to actual  tools.  We seek to provide the best opportunities for  development. Unlike traditional consultancies we keep the  minimum for required billable hours relatively low and we take  pride in enabling our employees to leave the office after official  working hours. In this way we enable our employees to  maintain focus during working hours, develop skills and  innovate. The success of our team - and hence the firms  success - depends on the professional development of all  employees.   In 2010 we managed to engage four interns and four students.  They were all trained to understand and apply the Principles- Based Approach to CSR.    We encourage our people to improve their performance and  invest in their knowledge and skills, by coaching and mentoring  on an ongoing basis to ensure their long-term employability,  growth and personal development.  Employee satisfaction and productivity  We acknowledge that our responsibility extends to providing  our people with safe, healthy, and stimulating working  conditions in full respect of all their human rights. GLOBAL CSR  strives to create an attractive working environment and  establish a team spirit that is based on mutual appreciation and  partnership, stimulating our employees to achieve their full  potential.     Diversity in the workforce is an essential topic in GLOBAL CSR.  We believe that diversity enables the organisation to improve  its ability to innovate. 70 per cent of our knowledge is tacit, i.e.  resting with our employees. 70 per cent of an individuals  knowledge lies with her network. In sum the more diversity we  manage to establish, the more knowledge we can access and  the better decisions we able to make.    We also appreciate that all people suffer from the need to  reduce complexity, establish stereotypes and thus occasionally  will act with prejudice. Working in Denmark represents an  increased challenge in this respect as the Danish education  system has very little focus on creating competences in this  area. GLOBAL CSR will in 2011 carry out training for our  employees to understand and counter both individual and  structural discrimination.      10              In addition a business that actively supports diversity can  improve employee satisfaction, productivity, and retention.  Also a diverse workforce is better equipped to understand the  global marketplace which we serve.    Employee turnover among employees on fixed contracts was  28 per cent in 2010. This is higher than expected and it is a  priority to improve retention moving forward.   Handling stress is a known challenge in consultancy firms.  Insecurity about the next assignment, the need for optimal  performance every day and the need to stay on top of the  subject make the work as consultant challenging. GLOBAL CSR  is very much aware of our challenges and in 2010 we improved  our focus on the causes for stress and will continue to seek to  minimize stress factors in 2011.  In general, GLOBAL CSR strives to keep working hours at the  agreed 37 hours a week. We also allow for flexible hours and  occasionally that employees can work from home when needed  and appropriate.   In addition our employees health is important and we ensure  access to healthy food, exercise and fresh air thereby  energising and motivating our employees. GLOBAL CSR  provides a healthy lunch and fresh fruit every day. GLOBAL  CSR takes a proactive approach to ergonomics as we spend  many hours behind a computer. Proper ergonomic design is  necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries. Ergonomic  chairs, tables and office equipment along with a yoga pillow for  backaches improve the right to a safe and healthy working  environment. Employees can take a run or go for a walk during  working hours and are encouraged and advised to take internal  meetings during a stroll in the neighbourhood when possible.                       We recognise the importance of complying with all  basic human rights, and we seek to contribute to  the human rights principles well beyond  compliance.       We endeavour to minimise our environmental  impact and where possible enhance our positive  environmental impact.      We apply a zero tolerance approach to corruption,  while seeking to enhance our positive economic  impact.    Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in  this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race,  colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national  or social origin, property, birth or other status...()     11    ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY  PRINCIPLES 7-9  We endeavour to minimise our negative environmental  impact and where possible enhance our positive impact    GLOBAL  CSR  supports  and  strives  to  demonstrate  environmental responsibility through our work, as well as  internally in our business. Our external contribution to  environmental sustainability stems from assisting businesses in  minimising their negative environmental impact on the planet.     Our impact  GLOBAL CSR works to promote environmental protection and  efficiency policies with our clients. In 2010, GLOBAL CSR  assessed and advised Danish and international clients on  incorporating principles 7-9 of the UNGC into their core  business operations. These three principles serve to support  precautionary approaches to environmental challenges, to  undertake new initiatives on environmental responsibility and  to encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally  friendly technologies.     In 2010, we assisted our clients in meeting the growing  environmental challenges and requirements that they face  today. We work in cooperation with our strategic partners that  are leading experts on environmental sustainability. We have,  advised clients to perform environmental impact assessments,  carbon  and  water  footprint  assessments  and  establish  sustainable supply chain solutions. Also, as part of raising  public awareness and meeting the growing need for education  on CSR and the business case for being environmentally  responsible, we have participated in seminars and workshops,  as well as facilitated and held several seminars and workshops  on, say, the cradle  to cradle concept.       It is our goal for 2011 to contribute positively to the  development of corporate environmentally responsible profiles  and practices for businesses as an integrated and strategic way  of doing business.    Our efforts   At GLOBAL CSR, we continuously seek to reduce our  environmental impact by promoting and always seeking to use  the best forms of transportation when possible, such as  bicycling, using public transportation and carpooling. In 2010  GLOBAL CSR reduced the companys CO2 emission by moving  our offices to central Copenhagen, thereby significantly  reducing emissions from employees commuting back and forth.  Our new location has also decreased travel time to clients  offices. Where clients are not located nearby, employees  commute by train making travel time faster as well as more   12        environmentally friendly and productive, since employees can  use the travel time for preparation.        To minimize our use of air travel we seek to hold meetings  through video and teleconferences when possible. During 2010  we held several meetings through teleconferences with clients  both in Asia, South America and Scandinavia. Using online  technology to meet with clients serves both as an economic  and environmental enhancement as well as a positive  contribution to our employees work-life balance.     However, being a consultancy that serves clients around the  world, we cannot eliminate air travel. The personal presence is  often needed as part of our work. Ensuring high quality and  service in our work often requires that we perform onsite  assessments in all operations and branches of a client. Change  management  and  capacity  development  are  essential  components of our work and requires interpersonal skills and  presence. Furthermore, we seek to maintain our position as  frontrunners in the field of CSR. This requires that we take part  in the debate on the development of the field which often  involves speaking at international conferences and meetings.  The bulk of our CO2 emissions therefore mainly stems from  international air travel.                  GLOBAL CSR will allocate funds to offset all 2010 emissions.  This will support principle 8 of the UNGC in a pragmatic manner  until the technological development and our financial capacity  enables us to eliminate our negative impact. In the long run, it  is GLOBAL CSRs goal to become CO2 neutral and increasingly  generate a positive impact on the environment beyond our  indirect contributions through the actions of our clients.    In 2010, GLOBAL CSR began developing and implementing an  environmental action plan, which promotes green purchasing  options e.g. new energy efficient office supplies and an  improved waste disposal/recycling system. As an example we  use recycled paper, reusable printer cartridges and strive to  print only when strictly necessary. GLOBAL CSR will continue to  further develop and implement our environmental action plan  in 2011.          TOTAL CO2 EMISSIONS FROM AIR TRAVEL IN 2010:  21.26 tons     13    ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY    PRINCIPLE 10  Our mission is to run a profitable business through  promoting sustainable development     GLOBAL CSR applies a zero tolerance policy in relation to  corruption. In line with principal 10, we work against corruption  in all its forms, including extortion and bribery, and we are  committed  to  compliance  with  international  recognised  principles, such as the UN Global Compact, as well as local  anti-corruption and bribery laws. Whereas corporate economic  responsibility initiatives need to address the international  principles on anti-corruption, we also advise our clients in  relation to financial gearing, good corporate governance and  tax payments. In 2010 GLOBAL CSR started exploring ways of  addressing  anti-corruption  in  India  through  innovative  partnerships.     Our impact   Through our work we contribute to the elimination of  corruption, as we advise clients on corporate economic  responsibilities and opportunities. In cooperation with our  strategic partners we help our clients implement the 10th  principle of the UNGC strategically into their businesses.     Our efforts   In  2010  we  advised  several  businesses  on  economic  sustainability. Examples include the establishment of whistle- blowing mechanisms in more than 14 countries and identifying  opportunities  for  turning  anti-corruption  challenges  into  opportunities.      In an economic sense 2010 was a significant year for GLOBAL  CSR and our CSR work – internally as well as externally. As  consultants we were still confronted with the realities of the  economic downturn that made most corporations very hesitant  to spend resources on external consultants. Nevertheless  GLOBAL CSR managed to create a 30 percent increase in  turnover in 2010 compared to 2009. Furthermore, from 2009  to 2010 our client base increased with 33 percent. Our  development is an indication of our improved performance, as  well as a reflection of the growing demand for CSR  professionals. We experience that businesses, governments  and organisations increasingly realise the importance of and  opportunities in addressing CSR diligently. The increase of CSR  initiatives in the private and the public sector will hopefully  amplify in 2011 leading to greater results for our business as  well as for society, the environment and the economy. By every  hours advice sold, GLOBAL CSR made a contribution to  sustainable development through the impressive actions of our  clients.    14    CHALLENGES AND FUTURE CSR  WORK       People   Being a consultancy and working with multiple clients around  the world, it can be a challenge to find the right work-life  balance to be successful both in and outside of work. In 2011  we will continue to strive for finding ways to better handle and  balance the stressful aspects of our working environment, in  order to promote a physically and psychologically healthy  workplace. Improved general appreciation and understanding  of both open and hidden structures of discrimination is  intended to support the creation of a working environment,  where everybody enjoy enhancement of their dignity.     Planet   In 2010, GLOBAL CSR improved its environmental impact.  However, we will continue this development in 2011 by  offsetting our emissions and finding alternatives to travelling by  air when possible. In 2011, GLOBAL CSR will also work toward  more comprehensively measuring its environmental impact  beyond commuting and business travel.  Profit   An ongoing challenge for GLOBAL CSR and for our line of  business  is  the  aspect  of  integrity.  NGOs  and  other  stakeholders may ask; how can you legitimise working for  companies who are major polluters or have been found to  violate human rights?  However, the core of GLOBAL CSRs  vision is to advise businesses and organisations to work toward  achieving a sustainable world and we believe that by assisting  our clients, we contribute to the progression and development  of more socially, environmentally and economically sustainable  businesses. This is coherent with our vision of a brighter future  for our planet, humanity – and not least for doing business.  Our role vis--vis business is not to act as watch dogs, but to  assist  them  in  improving  performances.  Nonetheless,  maintaining a high level of integrity is paramount to GLOBAL  CSR and we will continue to apply our integrity measures when  evaluating clients, the specific tasks and the advice we give  them.    Making a difference: Cross-cutting projects   During 2010, GLOBAL CSR launched its new supplementary  approach to traditional responsible supply chain management  (RSCM). The approach is called Responsible Supply Chain  Management 3.0. A report revisiting traditional approaches to   15    RSCM was prepared in 2010 and published January 2011. The  study has been co-financed by the Danish Ministry of Foreign  Affairs and was carried out in cooperation with Copenhagen  Business School. We plan to further develop and pilot test the  new supplementary approach to RSCM in 2011. The report can  be downloaded at http://www.global-csr.com/publications.html     GLOBAL CSR has in 2010 prepared a learning- and advisory  process for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) that  will give participants a unique opportunity to fully exploit the  benefits of CSR, in addition to creating a forum to promote                     their efforts and share experiences. The initiative supports the  Danish Government's goal (from the action plan, 2008 and the  objectives from 2010) to promote CSR among SMEs. The  process will be offered in 2011.    In addition our focus on right to education has resulted in two  projects that were also developed in 2010 for launch in 2011.  We expect to publish a book for managers describing the what,  why and how of the Principled-Based Approach to CSR. In  addition we expect to finalise and launch an innovative project  to improve CSR in-house training on a larger scale.
