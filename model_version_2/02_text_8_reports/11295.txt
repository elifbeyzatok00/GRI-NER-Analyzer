Crude oil, or the black gold, is the  wellspring of the entire oil and petrochemical industry. Natural gas development prevails in clean fuel development  and plays an import part in power generation, town gas and chemical production. However, the hydrocarbon  resources deep underground are non-renewable and their distribution is highly uneven. Thus we are faced with  grim challenges in developing resources, such as limited resources access, quality degradation, harsh operating  conditions and rising lifting cost.  As an integrated energy and petrochemical company, Sinopec relies on technological innovation and the concerted  efforts of all employees to overcome difficulties one after another. We aim to continuously explore and develop  valuable energy resources underground and contribute to sustained energy supply.  Sinopec Corp. 16 1.1 A Solid Resources Base In order to source safe and stable energy supply at best cost,  Sinopec forged ahead in both production and trading activities.  We actively invest in the exploration and development of oil and  gas resources while making full use of the global trade channels.  Hence the Company enjoys strong resource base and ever- improving capability to secure energy supply.  Tide over difficulties to maintain stable production  growth  Sinopec relies on technological advancements and precise  management to attain stable oil production growth as well as  rapid ramp-up in natural gas output. In 2010, crude oil production  was 46.18 million tons. The crude production in eastern mature  oilfields maintained steadily at 34.5 million tons per annum.  Production in western frontier oilfields has risen by 70% in 5  consecutive years to reach 8.01 million tons. Natural gas output in  2010 hit 12.5 billion cubic meters, doubling the output five years  ago. Five major natural gas production sites are set up in Sichuan,  Ordos, South Songliao, Tarim and Bohai Bay. Liquids and gas gushing out of wells witnesses the valuable  miracles created by Sinopec in the remote areas and under  harsh conditions. Those are the results of our technologies,  perseverance and hard toils. Our Story Overcome the Impact of Natural Disasters  and Properly Handel Crude Production At the beginning of 2010, strong winds, icy storms and blizzards severely  hit Shengli oilfield. In early summer of the year, serious thunderstorms and  flood hit Zhongyan oilfield and Henan oilfield. During autumn and winter,  some oilfields were affected by limitation in power supply and consumption.  Amid the grim circumstances, Sinopec subsidiaries did all they could to  fight natural disasters and restore production. Production in the eastern  mature oilfields remained steady thanks to rational production management  and advanced technologies. In the western areas, we have maintained  production momentum based on ramp-ups in frontier areas. Our cartoon Youdi (oil drop) will unveil the story of oil.

Every production  subsidiary has its own HSE department with HSE engineers  stationed in every key facility. We have developed safe production  responsibility system and corresponding performance check  throughout the company. We keep improving our HSE management system, which  has distinguishing Sinopec features. There is a norm for  each operation. No direct operations can be conducted  without operation permit and safety verification. As to newly- built, revamping and expansion projects, we strictly observe  governments regulation and ensure that HSE facilities and the  main project are synchronized in terms of design, construction  and commissioning. We also set up an HSE inspection network  system. In 2010, we developed and improved 26 regulations concerning  HSE observation card, HSE signs, hidden perils control, oil and  gas pipeline safety, well control and offshore operation safety. HSE  management was adjusted and optimized. 3.2  I Safe Safe production is the basic requirement of company  development. In 2010, faced with potential safety threats that  might be caused by heavy E&P workload, big pressure of well  control and H2S prevention, highly utilized refining and chemical  facilities and higher percentage of low-grade crude processed,  we continued to carry out I Safe activities. Safety responsibility  system was strictly executed with 11 accidents reported, 25%  less than last year, and 3 deaths, down by 53.8%. Our Story To Compare and Compete Competitions themed safe production, environmental protection,  occupational health, public safety, hidden peril control and I Safe were  organized in order to motivate staff to do better than others and than before  in HSE. Safe Construction Site competition was specially organized  pertinent to repeated accidents among contractors. Our Story Annual HSE examination and Ad-hoc  Inspection Annual HSE examinations and ad-hoc inspections are aimed to increase  safety awareness among employees. Of all annual HSE examinations, the  2010 examination had the highest standards, covered the largest number  of companies, lasted for the longest time and achieved the best results.  The inspected included 90 tier-1 companies, 634 tier-2 companies and  1,477 grassroots units. 39 lessons were drawn and 121 pieces of advice  were put forward. HSE management level was improved due to meticulous  inspection and in-depth amendment. We organized ad-hoc inspections and risk assessments on well control,  offshore operation, liquefied hydrocarbon tank farms, light oil tanks,  crude oil depots, jetty and transportation facilities, dangerous chemicals  and underground pipeline, covering 59 oil tank farms and 632 spherical  hydrocarbon tanks of 10 subsidiaries. We also developed Spherical  Hydrocarbon Tank Farm Safety Technology Management Regulation and  Spherical Hydrocarbon Tank Farm Safety Technology Inspection Form,  establishing a long-term mechanism to detect and eliminate potential  dangers.  For safety, you can never be too careful  Sustainable Development Report 33 Our Story To Detect Potential Hazards and Eliminate  Them From last winter, Sinopec Northwest Oilfield has regularly made thorough  inspections of oil and gas equipments, pipelines, safety signs and all  operation norms and procedures. There were both self-inspections and  random inspections. Focus was put on both detection and elimination.  Deadline was imposed on problematic unit and person in charge to address  the problems. Our Story One-Day HSE Monitor  Since one-day HSE monitor activity was launched, Sinopec Jinling  Company has advanced HSE management level. Jobsite workers serve  as HSE monitors in rotation on a daily basis. By making inspection rounds,  searching and correcting operation errors, the workers find themselves with  a growing sense of responsibility.  Inspiring safety initiative and increase safety  awareness The key to safe production lies in workers, who are the performers  of production. Only by inspiring safe production initiative among  workers can we achieve safe production. What is central to safe production is to establish a safety culture,  in which one take the initiative to work safely instead of being  asked to do so. In 2010, we continued to carry out I Safe activities. We  implemented a more detailed Donts in Safe Production,  developed Provisional Regulation on HSE Observation Card and  Provisional Regulation on Near-Miss Incident Management, and  organized multi-level training programs.   High attention paid to potential hazard control and  safety level of facilities raised Potential hazards can be stings in the heart of safe production.  Should they be eliminated in advance, accidents can be avoided.  Therefore, potential hazard control is one of our principal ways to  lower accident rate. The focus of potential hazard control is put on monitoring major  sources of dangers like key facilities and vital parts of production. To ensure a successful potential hazard control project, we finalize  four defining determinants, namely, overall plan, source of funds,  responsible person and deadline for improvement in advance.  Potential hazard control is always on the list of top priorities  in annual budget planning. With enormous manpower and  investment devoted over the years, the inherent safety level of the  Company has greatly improved.  In 2010, we invested a total of RMB 1.554 billion to run 544  potential hazard control projects.  Sinopec Corp. 34  Improving emergency response system and abilities Sinopec emergency response system Petroleum and chemical industry is highly dangerous with  potential risks in every link of production chain. In case of  accidents, a matured and efficient emergency response system is  the last resort to reduce losses. We have established such an emergency response system, which  has played an important leading role in time of emergencies.

Therefore, we put great efforts in monitoring  of direct operations, focusing on suppliers, contractors and  temporary staff. Concrete measures include risk prevention from  the source, rule of joint liability, strict access control to production  sites and improved labor management.  Public security substantially advanced In 2010, we motivated all staff to learn the Law on Petroleum and  Natural Gas Pipeline Protection. Based on the Law, we advanced  safety management of oil and gas fields and transmission pipeline.  Oil and gas transportation management system was worked out  and improved, ability of accident prevention and control further  strengthened, and long-distance transmission pipeline operation  safety and anti-sabotage technologies greatly improved.  Meanwhile, we further improved overseas safety management  mechanism with strict safety risk assessment, intensified  training programs and careful inspections. Continuing the good  performance last year, there were no overseas incidents that  caused human casualties in 2010. To make China more capable of dealing with chemical accidents and  controlling the harm of chemical accidents,  National Dedicated Phone  Line for Chemical Accidents (0532-83889090) was set up the in Sinopec  Qingdao Safety Engineering Institute, which provides emergency  consultancy services around the clock nationwide. Since the line was put into operation, we have answered 26,280 phone  calls, including 820 calls about chemical accidents and 3,780 calls  relating to  chemicals information. In emergency response and rescue to  many major chemical accidents in recent years, we, together with State  Administration of Work Safety, Fire Department of Ministry of Public Security  and National Marine Safety Administration, provided contingency plans  via this dedicated phone line, and helped to reduce the impact and losses  caused by variuos accidents. Sinopec Yangzi Companys safety management personnel are checking  contractors qualifications and operation formalities on an ethylene production  site under overhaul. New measures were taken to manage contractors,  including contract safety clause review and visual management. High HSE  standards were adopted for contractors.

To  protect the environment is to protect ourselves. As a responsible energy and petrochemical mega company, we  always attach great importance to environmental protection.  Our production is clean and so are our products. Three wastes  treatment continues to improve. Strenuous efforts have been put  to develop circular economy, build up an environmental- friendly  enterprise and achieve green growth.  In 2010, following the principle of he who is in charge is  responsible, we put stress on project environmental protection  (EP) and key EP technology R&D. We intensified pollution control,  further promoted comprehensive utilization of three wastes, took  water-saving and emission-cutting measures, and strengthened  risk prevention of water bodies. There were no accidents that  caused major pollution to the environment and damage to the  ecology throughout the year. 96% of discharged effluent met the  EP standards and COD content was reduced by 2.1% year-on- year. Sulfur dioxide discharge went down by 6.9% over the last  year. We fulfilled the national the 11th Five-Year Plan objectives in  advance in terms of major pollutant discharge reduction.  Whole process clean management intensified and  less pollutants discharged We adopt the whole process clean management covering the  entire industrial chain from production to consumption. We strive  to control and reduce discharge of pollutants in every link of the  chain, and to be part of the efforts to keep an environment that  features blue sky, crystal waters and luxuriant vegetation on land. Byproducts Clean products Three wastes Consumption Production Emission of NOx,  CO, hydrocarbon  and particles in  auto exhaust  greatly reduced Technologies and green processes  adopted for no or little formation of  pollutants Hydro-desulfurization and hydro- dearomatics technologies used to  produce clean refined products Flue gas from coal boilers desulfurized for less CO2 emission  and flare gas recovered Waste water treated and recycled Industrial residue made harmless, reduced and reused as a  resource Comprehensive utilization Circular economy  Sustainable Development Report 37  Clean production and pollutant discharge reduced  from the source Sinopec lays particular emphasis on clean production in the whole  process and strives to check formation of pollutants from the  source. We continued to tighten control of potential environmental  hazards. In 2010, Sinopec deployed RMB 1.483 billion in  environmental protection(excluding new projects). 103 potential  hazard control projects were carried out and investment of RMB  354 million in control projects concluded. Key projects include  those for air pollution control, wastewater discharge standard  control and procurement of monitoring devices and apparatus.  We intensified project environment management. In 2010, we  further rectified the way to synchronize design, construction and  commissioning of both HSE facilities and the main project. The  rule of sign and countersign was strictly observed. Online monitoring program was implemented with pollutant  discharge real-time online monitoring system already set up in  some companies. We continued to organize clean production enterprise activities.  In 2010, we amended Sinopec Clean Production Standards for  Refining and Chemical Companies. Evaluation was made against  harsher parameters set in the Standards. Three companies  passed the evaluation. By the end of 2010, 21 refining and  chemical subsidiaries have passed the clean production check- up, accounting for 52.5% of all Sinopec refining and chemical  companies.  An operator from Sinopec Henan Oilfield is connecting workover fluid  recovering pipeline. It was very difficult to recover workover fluids, which  will pollute the well site if not recovered.

Upgrading of gasoline and diesel quality is typically  one of our efforts in this direction. In spite of the adverse business environment in recent years, we  spared no efforts to upgrade quality of refined products. From  2005 to 2010, RMB 49.2 billion was invested for that purpose.  GB III gasoline upgrading project was completed and GB III diesel  upgrading is accelerating.  From 2009 to 2010, Sinopec refining subsidiaries sped up  development of gasoline upgrading plans and revamping of  production facilities. By 1st May 2010, all automobile gasoline  produced has met GB III standards or even higher. Given  Sinopecs gasoline output in 2010, SO2 emission in consumption  can be cut by 25,000 metric tons.  The total investment in diesel upgrading project is expected to be  completed and put on stream in December 2012. Given Sinopecs  diesel output in 2010, SO2 emission in consumption can be cut by  23,000 metric tons.   Sinopec Corp. 38 A technician from Sinopec Yanshan Company is checking pressure swing  tail gas adsorption facility with a PP recovering capacity of 1,630 tpa  Developing circular economy and turning waste to  worth Sinopec is keen on developing circular economy, increasing  resource efficiency and recycling, and promoting comprehensive  utilization of byproducts, with the goal of low energy consumption,  low emission and high efficiency. For example, flare gas recovering  technology was applied. All flares were extinguished and more  than 800,000 metric tons of gas can be recovered every year. From 2005 to 2010, Sinopec created RMB 22.4 billion output  value from comprehensive utilization of resources. A worker from Sinopec Zhongyuan Oilfield is maintaining an oil well.  There are environment-friendly toilets and dustbins for different garbage  for all drilling teams with no discharge of waste water and castoff. On all  construction sites, ecological protection standards were met and 100% of  pollutants recovered  Three wastes treatment improved and emission/ discharge standards met Waste generation is inevitable in our industry. We attach great  importance to the treatment of waste gas, waste water and  industrial residue (three wastes), try our best to meet emission/ discharge standards and mitigate their impact upon the  environment to the minimum. We laid particular emphasis on sulfur dioxide emission reduction.  By the end of 2010, we have completed desulfurization revamping  of all 19 in-house power stations and 107 coal boilers. During the  11th Five-Year Plan period, we reduced SO2 emission by 204,000  metric tons, down by 35.7%. We also made efforts to solve outstanding environmental  problems. Odorous gases from waste water facilities in some  plants, which posed potential threats to residents nearby, were  brought under control. Wastewater treatment systems in some  plants were revamped for better compliance with discharge  standards.  Installing a new funnel in Sinopec Cangzhou Refinery, which was revamped  during the overhaul for better tail gas treatment. Environment protection  units were added or replaced to the existing sulfur recovering facilities.  All H2S can be recovered and reused, which brings both economic and  environmental benefits  More efforts to protect and restore ecological  environment Production activities like oil and gas E&P and pipeline construction  may cause damage to ecological environment. Sinopec pays  high attention to eco-environment restoration in areas around  abandoned wells and along the pipeline, and tries to lower impact  upon the environment to the least possible degree.  Sustainable Development Report 39 Safe production and environmental protection awareness  have been deeply rooted in all Sinopec employees and  reflected in everything they do. Safe and environment-friendly production is our mission,  responsibility and the cornerstone of a balanced and  sustainable development.  Many years of experience show that it is sound safety and  environment management that can guide our value and  secure a sustainable development for us in a complex and  changing world.  Sinopec Corp. 40 Making Every Drop Count LOW-CARBON  DEVELOPMENT  Sustainable Development Report 41 Climate change is a major global issue for all humankind. As a responsible energy and  petrochemical company, Sinopec regards it as a due responsibility to address climate change. We  embrace low-carbon development by finding and using more low-carbon energy resources and  promoting energy saving and consumption reduction. We are quickening study on commercial  test of CO2 recovering facilities, make efforts to reduce GHG emission, and increase the ability to  cope with the climate change.  Sinopec Corp. 42 4.1 Saving Energy Resources and Increasing  Energy Efficiency We continue to optimize and upgrade industrial structure with  focus on increasing efficiency and reducing consumption. Great  efforts were made to form a development mode featuring low  input, low consumption, low emission and high efficiency. Given  energy consumption structure unchanged, to lower energy  consumption per unit output and raise efficiency means less CO2  emission.  Industrial restructuring  We stick to industrial restructuring with integrated production  capacities and operations. Energy and material consumption was  considerably slashed and less CO2 was sent out. On the one hand, we increased and integrated the production  capacities by building up new facilities, expansion and technical  upgrading of existing ones. In 2010, we completed two 1-mmt  ethylene projects, one in Tianjin and the other in Zhenhai. So far,  we have thirteen 10-mmt refineries and eight 1-mmt ethylene  production bases. On the other hand, we increased average production capacities  and cut down consumption by phasing out small and inefficient  ones. From 2005 to 2010, we shut down and phased out small  and less environment-friendly refining capacities by 17 mmt/ year. Dozens of small chemical facilities and oil-fired boilers were  closed. Optimization and volume adjustment were made to more  than 500 oil tank farms. With the above parallel actions, average capacities of our  refineries rose by 49.3% and that of ethylene facilities went up by  37.0% from 2005 to 2010. Energy efficiency greatly increased during the 11th Five-Year Plan metric tons of standard coal metric tons of carbon dioxide Saving Equal to a cut of   Saving as much energy as possible Saving energy is the most immediate and effective way to reduce  CO2 emission today. Attaching great importance to energy saving,  we try to develop into a resource-saving enterprise. During the 11th Five-Year Plan period, while the production  capacities kept growing, Sinopec achieved good results in energy  saving and consumption cut with more effective management,  new technologies and equipments and special emphasis on  energy saving in production process. In 2010, energy intensity of  refining and ethylene production went down by 3.8% and 0.8%  respectively. Our Story Achieve Energy and Consumption  Effectiveness through Better Technology  and Equipment  Despite of a tight budget, Sinopec invested RMB 29.1 billion on 1,110  energy-saving, consumption-cutting, technical reconstruction and  innovation projects during the 11th Five-Year Plan period. A number of  advanced, applicable technologies and equipments were applied to a wide  range of production links and generated good results. In our oilfields, there were less production losses and energy consumption.  System loss and system power consumption were greatly reduced. In  refining and chemical subsidiaries, average thermal efficiency of heating  furnaces grew by 4 percentage points, a remarkable increase of energy  efficiency. In refined products marketing subsidiaries, operation, storage  and transportation losses went down substantially. 12.20 million 29.97 million   Sustainable Development Report 43 4.2 Developing low-carbon Energy and  Optimizing Energy Structure Sinopec is active in developing low-carbon energy and improving  energy structure. A comprehensive low-carbon energy business  chain covering R&D, production and marketing has taken shape.  Our plan is to build up low-carbon energy capacities that can  supplement main business operations and contribute to the  Companys long-term and sustainable development. We strive to increase natural gas production and facilitate LNG  import. In 2010, Sichuan to East China Gas Transmission Project  with a capacity of 12 billion cubic meters per year was completed  and commissioned. Shangdong LNG project started construction.  Given the planned capacity of the gas project, we can provide  14.57 mmt standard coal of clean energy and cut CO2 emission  by 16.97 mmt. Our Story Efficient Procurement of Green Production  Facilities In active response to the governments requirements for energy saving and  emission cut, Sinopec quickened its steps in diesel upgrading projects.  The number of reactors, heater exchanges and high pressure air coolers  we bought in 2010 for hydrogenation facilities was 1.5 times of the total  purchased from 2005 to 2009. In order to speed up equipment procurement and of project commissioning,  we immediately start technical and commercial negotiation once we get  the data of equipments to be purchased, and conclude the procurement  agreement as soon as the project is approved. Giving full play to the  strategic cooperation with China First Heavy Industries, China Second  Heavy Industries and Shenyang Blower Works Group, Sinopec secures  sources of supply and shortens the supply cycle. We are active in developing and using coal-bed methane (CBM)  and shale gas. Since 2009, we have continually obtained  commercial streams of shale gas and begun building up demo  shale gas production capacity. In 2010, we made breakthroughs  in CBM production. Bio-ethanol consumption are expanding. In 2010, 930,000 tons of  modified fuel ethanol was used and 9.1 mmt of ethanol gasoline  was sold.  Push forward bio-diesel project. With the 50,000-mt/year bio- diesel demo project in Guizhou, we have begun construction of  feedstock base and will start up the project in due time.  We plan to build up a filling and recharging service station network  in 13 provinces and cities. In 2010, two recharging stations were  set up respectively in Beijing and Shenzhen.  Sinopec Corp. 44 4.4 Shifting to low-carbon-oriented  Production, Existence and Consumption For many years, we have kept planting trees to increase carbon  sink. That is one major way to fulfill our social responsibility to  preserve and ameliorate ecological environment, and to improve  production and living conditions for our employees. Aiming to  build up a garden-like energy company, we motivate our staff to  take active part in activities for public good like compulsory tree  planting. We also spread information about climate change among  employees, consumers, suppliers, contractors and other  stakeholders, calling for changes in mode of production, way of  life and habit of consumption, and for stronger sense of social  responsibility and keener awareness to protect the environment. Our Story IT Support to Low-carbon Production Our Story CO2 Technology Drives Enhanced Oil Recovery Sinopec lays great emphasis on R&D and application of CO2 flooding and  sequestration, one of the core low-carbon technologies. Based on lab  studies, we are carrying out pilot tests of CO2-driven oil displacement. By far, we have performed pilot tests in four oilfields with satisfactory  outcome. The tests in three oilfields have entered the phase of oilfield  implementation and the test in the remaining one is now under preparation.  In Gao 89 block  in Sinopec Shengli Oilfield, an accumulated amount of  43,000 tons of carbon dioxide was injected and 7,967 tons more crude  produced.  Co-existence of a beam pumping unit and the nature 4.3 Developing low-carbon Technologies  and Increasing Low-carbon Development  Ability We hope to increase our low-carbon development ability by  solidifying mid- and long-term low-carbon technology reserve. We  plan to focus on development of technologies that can slow down  GHG emission. They include energy-saving and efficiency-raising  technologies, alternative and new energy technologies, GHG  emission control, disposal and utilization technologies, biological  and engineering carbon sequestration technologies, clean and  efficient development and utilization technologies of coal, oil  and natural gas, CCS technologies, CO2 flooding technologies,  comprehensive utilization technologies of high purity CO2, and  microalgae absorption of CO2 for oil production technologies, etc. Since the lab information management system (LIMS) went online, Sinopec  Zhongyuan Oilfield has gradually realized automatic test operation,  automatic collection and quick distribution of data, information sharing and  paper-free analysis reports  Sustainable Development Report 45 Climate change is posing huge threats to human  existence.
