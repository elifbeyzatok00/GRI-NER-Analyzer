As in the first report, a practice of regular dialogue, engagement  and interaction with the various stakeholders provided the basis  for a complex and challenging work. During the year an effort was made to adapt and adjust the  sustainability actions and targets to be implemented in the 2012- - 2014 period in accordance with said Strategic Plan to each of  Riofortes subsidiaries. The subsidiaries Focal Points, supported by their senior  management and by Rioforte, made an internal diagnosis to  assess whether the practices already promoted were aligned to  the Sustainability Plans strategic objectives. This work resulted  in strategic sustainability plans for the companys entire universe. The practices already developed in 2009, 2010 and 2011, together  with those diagnosed and implemented by Riofortes subsidiaries,  which reflect both the strategic objectives and the Sustainability  Principles, also gave an important contribution to the drawing up  of this second reporting exercise. In view of the various companies strong adhesion to and  involvement in Sustainability, we assume that next year Rioforte  will be able to report on the actions undertaken to meet the  objectives presented in the Sustainability Strategy chapter of  this report. We remind that Riofortes Sustainability Principles embody its  approach to Sustainability, and we believe that it is based on  these principles that lies the right path to building a sustainable  portfolio at economic, environmental and social level. It should be referred that this report was developed in accordance  with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) directives, G3.1,  at application level B, a progress on last years application level  C. The qualitative and quantitative indicators were determined  from a materiality analysis to Riofortes activity and the current  composition of its portfolio of companies. The report is organised into seven chapters, and as happened  last year, it is illustrated by case studies of actual management  practices of relevant social, environmental and economic issues  for Riofortes subsidiaries. Being supported by the different interactions with the Rioforte  units, the report also factors in external analyses prepared within  the scope of the development of the Sustainability Strategic  Plan, as well as the expectations of expert analysts who influence  investors perceptions of sustainability performance. The stakeholders identified as relevant in this report were selected  taking into account the activity of Rioforte as an investment  company, the impact of this activity on said stakeholders and the  importance of their activity for Rioforte. This report addresses in  particular the Shareholder, the Investors and the Subsidiaries. This document should be read together with Riofortes 2011  Annual Report, and with the Communication on Progress,  Riofortes formal reporting on its effort to promote and adhere  to the United Nations 10 Global Compact Principles, which it  signed up to in 2010.

Rioforte 2011 Sustainability Report 37 Chairmans Message We are very proud to present to you our second Sustainability  Report, which deals with the work developed during 2011, a  year in which the Group companies unequivocally reinforced  their commitment to the challenge of sustainable management,  and above all a year marked by the formal adoption of Riofortes  Sustainability Strategic Plan. From the start Rioforte has assumed the commitment of taking  a structured approach to stimulating the adoption of sustainable  management best practices within the universe of its subsidiaries.  The objective was to produce a document adjusted to the needs  of an investment company, the sustainability commitments of the  Esprito Santo Group, and the business specificities of each of the  companies in Riofortes portfolio. Such document would permit  to define, organise and implement the management strategy and  business practices in the area of Sustainability. Today we have that  mainstay in place, which materialises our ambition into pillars,  strategic objectives, actions and performance indicators for the  period of 2012 to 2014, applying to Rioforte in a general manner  and to each of its subsidiaries in a specific manner. Having been developed based on the strong belief that the  reinforced integration of best management practices in Riofortes  management model is decisive for solid shareholder value creation  in the medium and long term, the Plan will, in my opinion, give  a crucial contribution to strengthen the business of each company  and that of Rioforte as a whole. This philosophy of action is  increasingly valued by all the stakeholders that engage with  Rioforte, notably investors and business partners, both national  and international, who have shown their strong appreciation for  Riofortes consistent assimilation of responsible management  practices. This objective was achieved in partnership with the subsidiaries  employees and heads of Sustainability management, who,  actively supported by their senior officers and in the most natural  manner, took it upon themselves to take the necessary action  and implement the pillars and strategic objectives proposed by  Rioforte for their businesses and market context, thus assuming  their share part within a consistent structure of commitment to  Sustainability. We believe that the execution of the Plan will give  structure to and guarantee a legacy that will forever endure in the  capital of the companies.  The 2011 Sustainability Report marks another important  conquest. The report was developed for compliance with the  GRI reporting guidelines, application level B, presenting a  series of 20 environmental, social and economic indicators. The  advance made relative to the 2010 report, which was prepared for  compliance with level C (10 indicators), represents an additional  effort to communicate to the market the indicators and practices  implemented, which illustrate the portfolios performance in  the management of the most relevant environmental, social and  economic issues. Manuel Fernando Moniz Galvo Esprito Santo Silva To Riofortes Stakeholders, Manuel Fernando Moniz Galvo Esprito Santo Silva  Chairman  The information reported also demonstrates our commitment to  disclose the practices that conform to Riofortes 9 Sustainability  Principles and the 10 principles of the United Nations Global  Compact. Furthermore, the Report attests to our commitment to achieving  the objectives we set out to reach, and should be seen as a  commitment to share the results of the implementation of the  Sustainability Strategic Plan. I take this opportunity to thank all the managers within Riofortes  universe for their contribution and commitment to the challenge  of Sustainability, as well as the teams of Rioforte and its subsidiaries  which were involved in the development and reporting of  Sustainability practices. This effort was, and will continue to be,  indispensable in order to meet our commitment of developing a  portfolio increasingly aligned to best sustainability practices.

Sustainability Governance and Strategy Rioforte 1.1 A consistent approach For Rioforte, Sustainability means creating value by investing in  companies that engage their relevant stakeholders in management,  with the aim of guaranteeing levels of return capable of  maintaining these companies in good economic and financial  health while minimising the negative environmental, social or  economic impacts from their activity. The need to develop a consistent approach to the management of  environmental, social and economic issues derives from Riofortes  investment model, which is based upon a proactive archetype  where the management team actively engages with the business  units to guarantee that environmental, social and economic risks  and opportunities are managed in such a way as to ensure the  valorisation of the Companys assets throughout the whole cycle  of prospecting for businesses, their management and sale. In 2010 Rioforte approved its 9 Sustainability Principles,  which materialise the companys commitment to sustainable  development. In 2011 the Executive Committee, supported by  the Communication Division, presented the 9 Principles to the  management of all the subsidiaries to whom it conveyed the  aim of developing a Sustainability Strategic Plan permitting to  translate this approach into specific actions. In order to draw up the Plan, benchmark analyses were performed  to peer companies of Rioforte and its subsidiaries, as well as trend  analyses aimed at identifying the main developments taking  place at environmental, social and economic level. The results of  these analyses were crossed with the results of consultations to  sustainability analysts made within the scope of the development  of the Sustainability Principles. Subsequently, a joint work was undertaken involving all Riofortes  subsidiaries, represented by their Focal Points, with the aim of  defining the practices permitting to enhance the management of  the  environmental, social and economic issues with the highest  financial and reputational impact on these companies. As a result of these works, Rioforte developed and approved a  course of action, materialised in the Sustainability Strategic Plan  for the period of 2012 to 2014.

The Board of Directors sets strategic priorities  concerning the implementation of ethical, environmental,  social and economic actions in the various geographies, sectors  and companies. In 2011 the Board of Directors approved the  Sustainability Strategic Plan and all the performance objectives  and indicators for the period of 2012 to 2014. Upon its approval, Riofortes Executive Committee led the  implementation of the Sustainability Strategic Plan, supported by  the Communication Division, which was in charge of putting it  into practice in the Company and its subsidiaries. In the course of 2011 Riofortes management met often with the  heads of the subsidiaries in order to drive forward the adoption  and implementation of the Sustainability Strategic Plan. These works aimed to adjust the Plan to the context, maturity stage  and specific business characteristics of each unit, and allow each  one to draw up its own Sustainability Plan. In 2012 these plans  will be formally set out and approved by the senior management  of each subsidiary.

The companies in the tourism sector have formally adopted   strategic plans setting clear objectives for the period of 2012    to 2014. This will permit the consistent evolution of practices    across all Tivoli Hotels & Resorts units and ES Viagens various    companies.  Reflecting the current social and economic context, the   construction sector has focused on the restructuring of the    companies in order to guarantee their future viability.

Implementation of the Plan in the Subsidiaries Implementation of the Strategic Sustainability  Rioforte 2011 Sustainability Report  44 2. Responsible Investment Rioforte Riofortes investment approval process is clearly defined and is aligned to its governance model. All the significant investments made by the  Company and its subsidiaries are previously validated by the Investment Committee, upon the recommendation of Riofortes Executive  Committee. Riofortes investment criteria permit to prioritise opportunities at Company and portfolio level, taking into account, among others, the  main risks inherent to the business, including environmental, social and reputational risks. The assumptions formally adopted in the  Sustainability Principles, namely respect for human rights, are taken into consideration for the approval of investment operations. All the  investments materially relevant for Rioforte approved in 2010 and 2011 safeguard these aspects. 2.1 Responsible Investment within Rioforte Pavicentro Brasil – Investment in new plant in Brazil Pavicentro Brasil, which is part of OPWAYs group of manufacturing companies, initiated in 2011 an investment project in a new  prefabricated concrete plant targeting the high demand felt in the Brazilian construction sector. Prefabricated concrete presents an  attractive construction option on account of the adverse weather conditions in the region, strict technical requirements and aggressive  timetables for the conclusion of works.  The projects strong points:  Privileged location close to potential clients;  Recognised technical capabilities, including the introduction in the market of new manufacturing techniques and strict production    quality control;  Technology pioneering – the fact that it possesses its own technical laboratory gives it added quality and efficiency. The project was designed to minimize waste production - the main environmental impact from the construction sector - and to control  noise and dust levels. Due to the reduction of these impacts, it provides a viable alternative to traditional construction methods, with  higher impacts in terms of waste, noise and dust. Within the scope of this project, the company committed itself before the local city council to preferably contract local workers and  service providers, thus contributing to promote the regions economy. In Paraguay, all new agriculture investment projects take into  account relevant economic, financial and environmental criteria,  such as:   The environmental impacts of the production processes,      according to their nature and magnitude;   The conditions of the impacted environment, and the      mitigation measures to be implemented, according to the       importance, magnitude, risk and duration of the impacts;  Follow-up and monitoring procedures.  In addition to these elements, the new investment project  initiated in 2011 – the Fazenda Lomas agricultural and livestock  development – also involved an assessment of the social and  cultural level of the local community, the positive and negative  impacts of the operations after installation, and the identification  of specific actions to benefit the natural values of the local  environment and the population. Ganadera Corina Campos y Haciendas  Investment in the Fazenda de San Lomas estate  Rioforte 2011 Sustainability Report 45 2.2 Implementation of the Compliance Programme Rioforte has assumed the commitment of defining and  implementing a Compliance Programme capable of supporting  the exercise of its business activity in accordance with transparency,  integrity and ethical standards, guaranteeing compliance with  laws and regulations and meeting the demands of the markets for  an increasingly transparent and strict operational management. In 2011 Rioforte initiated and concluded the implementation  of the Code of Conduct in its subsidiaries in Southeast Europe,  successfuly obtaining the involvement of all the companies and  guaranteeing the significant adhesion of their employees, which  represented an important step towards the execution of the  Compliance Programme. To facilitate the implementation of the Code of Conduct a  Follow-up Manual was drawn up. Being adapted to each of the  subsidiaries and including functional contents accessible to all  employees, the Manual aimed to enhance knowledge about the  applicability of the Code to the reality of the various companies. To  give an example the companies in the hotel sector, which employ  the largest number of people in Southeast Europe, provided  specific training to their employees on the Code of Conduct, thus  making it easier to understand and endorse it. The implementation of the Code of Conduct and Compliance  Programme permits to reduce the risk of corruption or of  violation of laws or regulations across the universe of subsidiary  companies, not only through the enforcement of internal control  mechanisms but also by raising awareness to all employees  and senior management about the alignment of behaviours to  Riofortes Principles and Values. It should be stressed that no cases of corruption were known or  detected in 2011 within Rioforte or its subsidiaries.

Responsible Innovation Rioforte Rioforte aims to foster a culture of innovation permitting to  stimulate business differentiation within each subsidiary in terms  of their business model, systems, management practices and offer  of products and services. The real estate developments under way in Portugal and Brazil are  carried out, as from the project phase, in accordance with good  practices that permit to minimise the environmental impacts over  the developments life cycle while enhancing the comfort and  wellbeing of their future users. Such practices will be organised and  systematised within the respective  sustainability strategic plans, and  put into practice as soon as this is  economically viable. The companies in the tourism  business sector have focused on  the diversification of their offer of  products and services with the aim  of meeting demand in different  market contexts. Investment in  this strategic pillar will focus on  such differentiation, allowing the various units to keep pace with  market trends. The construction sector in Portugal turned innovation into  a systematic process, the result of the implementation of the  Management Research, Development and Innovation System.  This process permits to organise, preserve and make available to the  employees the existing know-how in the organisation. In addition,  it fosters creativity in project design, through a systematic search  for new technical, organisational and process approaches which  add value to the clients and to the organisation itself. In the energy sector, characterised by high technical complexity,  the companies providing geoservices make a systematic investment  in research and development leading to service differentiation.  The energy producing company has focused on innovation in its  business model, offering its clients a disruptive change in energy  consumption in the form of a clean and renewable source of  energy. Having in place mature innovation  practices permits to attain higher  quality levels in products and  services and, consequently, higher  levels of customer satisfaction.  All business segments have their  own practices to assess customer  satisfaction. In the real estate  sector, ESPART compiled a  satisfaction  index  concerning  the finishes of the houses and  the endogenous attributes of the Oeiras Golf & Residence  development, which were rated 3.7 and 3.4, respectively, in  a scale of 1 to 5. In Tourism, both the travel agencies and the  hotels seek to obtain feedback from their clients, analysing their  satisfaction levels as well as their complaints and suggestions.  The implementation of quality management systems reinforced  the assessment of clients opinions. This is clearly exemplified  by Sociedad Agrcola Golondrina and Georadar, whose quality  management systems are certified under ISO 9001. Located in Sorocaba, a Brazilian city in the State of So Paulo,  the Arte de Viver Lago da Boavista development, whose name  means the Boavista Lake Art of Living, focuses on the concept  of sustainability and life quality. Promoted by ESPB, this development was specifically designed  to offer its residents a life based on sustainability principles,  not only through the preservation of the natural resources but  also by encouraging conscientious attitudes, such as responsible  consumption and correct disposal of waste. Among other characteristics, the development was built with  low environmental impact building materials, its lighting  fixtures include motion detectors and low consumption bulbs,  and the houses have natural ventilation and lighting, and are  equipped with water saving taps. It also includes an 88,000 m2 condominium featuring a  community vegetable garden, an orchard, and equipment for  open air physical activity, all intended to provide comfort and  safety to all users. 14%  Very Satisfied 11%  Reasonably  Satisfied 4%  Unsatisfied   Satisfied Clients 71% Satisfied Clients satisfaction index 2011 2010 2009 83,7% 88,4% 70% Clients satisfaction index 2011 2010 2009 +0,6% +0,3% Esprito Santo Property Brasil (ESPB) – The Art of Living Satisfaction Index 2011 was 3,56 (scale 1 to 4)  Rioforte 2011 Sustainability Report 47 ESPART – LNEC Quality Mark SERIES is a company of the ESPART Group whose main  activities are Project Coordination and Works Supervision.

This award gives SERIES a differentiated positioning in the  market, while providing both ESPART and its clients the  assurance that all the projects established requirements are  complied with. ERB – Business model innovation  ERB develops projects permitting to replace fossil fuels for  biomass (a clean and renewable energy source) in energy  production units. These power plants are located in the  clients industrial premises, an important factor in building a  relationship of confidence with the clients. From the plantation of forests to the electricity and steam  cogeneration industrial processes, ERB takes into account all  the legal requirements and necessary environmental licences,  and uses technologies that reduce environmental impacts.

Business Partners Rioforte The establishment of long-term partnerships with clients, suppliers  or investors may positively influence the entire value chain as well  as put pressure on the adoption of practices leading to a reduction  of the negative environmental and social impacts of the products  and services provided. In the real estate sector in Portugal, the construction firms  subcontracted are subject to training actions on hygiene and  safety in the workplace. In Brazil, strict compliance with building  specifications is required from all subcontracted firms, namely with  respect to energy intensity and the procurement of firms capable  of supplying efficient solutions for the real estate developments.  Hotels, in turn, enter partnerships with local suppliers with the  aim of offering differentiated products in their various units. The  travel agencies screen all their partners in the value chain to make  sure they offer a value proposition to all their clients. Health and Safety - OPWAY OPWAYs hygiene, health and safety system covers all the  partners engaged in construction works, and specifically the  employees of contractors and subcontractors. In 2011 the  system scored the best results ever in safety and health indicators.  The accident indicators, namely the Frequency Rate and the  Severity Rate, which measure, respectively, the number of  accidents and sick leave days in relation to the number of hours  of exposure to risk, show a reduction compared to previous  years and are below the average for the sector, translating:   A reduction in the absolute number of accidents; Indicator 2010 2011 Frequency 13,03 11,01 Severity Rate 0,18 0,15 Botucatu and Agriways – consistent partnerships for the  medium and long term  Companhia Agrcola Botucatu and Agriways are companies in  the agriculture sector operating in Brazil. The farming estates (fazendas) are dedicated to the production  of citrus fruits and the plantation of eucalyptus. Both are  explored and managed under joint ventures with specialised  companies, namely Louis Dreyfus Commodities (LCD) for the  lemon production and Duratex and Eucatex for the eucalyptus  operation. All the partners with responsibilities in the farming operation  have entered commitments and follow policies, programmes  and processes that seek to offset the social and environmental  impacts of their activities. From the various risks incurred within the value chain of general  works contractors and subcontractors, social risk is quite relevant  in the construction sector. To minimise this risk, the construction  firms in Portugal and Spain have in place hygiene, health and  safety systems certified under the OHSAS 18001 standard. In Brazil, the agricultural undertakings have established long-term  partnerships to explore the business, these partners having adopted  good practices that permit to minimise the environmental and  social risks inherent to farming activities. The subsidiaries in the energy sector entered partnerships with  suppliers to guarantee the supply of raw materials and products in  the short, medium and long term, while also promoting frequent  dialogue with the local authorities and fostering innovation in  their products and services viewing the establishment of long-  -standing relationships with their clients. LCD, through its code of conduct, undertakes to support the  preservation of the environment, foster environmental education,  and guarantee compliance with all applicable regulations. This organisation includes within its operations initiatives that  focus on the exercise of citizenship and local, regional and  national development, namely promoting the improvement of  living standards within the communities where it operates, and  it forbids child labour outside the scope of apprenticeship, as  well as slave labour within its sphere of influence. The forestry management practices and systems of both Eucatex  and Duratex are recognised and certified in accordance with  the criteria of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). These  companies have in place environmental management systems  permitting to minimise the environmental impact of their  activities.

Rioforte 2011 Sustainability Report 49 Tivoli Hotels & Resorts – Differentiation of the offer  through an involvement with the suppliers and the local  community Tivoli Hotels & Resorts manage 14 hotels and resorts in Portugal  and Brazil. In all these units there is a clear commitment to  develop partnerships leading to the sophistication of the offer  and an increasingly better service to the client. To this end Tivoli Hotels & Resorts enters partnerships with key  suppliers which support its drive towards service differentiation,  namely with Banyan Tree hotels & resorts for the Angsana and  Elements Spas. These spas only use natural products in their  treatments, many of them sourced locally, such as honey, sea salt,  wine, almonds, citrus fruits and strawberries from the Algarve.  While setting a difference through the use of products from the  region, the Spas also obtain the recognition of local residents  and suppliers. The local communities in the vicinity of the hotel units are  fundamental partners that contribute to influence the clients  perception of the hotels quality, and thus enhance the region  as a tourism destination. Tivoli Hotels & Resorts promote  local typical products in their hotels, such as Algarve wine  and matured meat produced in Portugal and offer their clients  programmes to explore the surrounding region. This partnership with the local community also involves hiring  and training hotel employees from the areas where the hotels  are located. Georadar – Partnerships of success Being aware of the potential impact of the sectors value chain,  namely on the local communities, Georadar has entered into  multiple partnerships aimed at maximising the effectiveness and  performance of its business model. In  what  concerns  the  local  communities,  Georadar  has  developed  projects  under  partnerships with SENAI, an  industrial training institute, and the  City Council of Rosrio do Catete,  with the objective of training  local young people and adults  and facilitate their integration in  the labour market. This allows  Georadar to hire locally, and the  company  specifically  allocates  vacancies to these people. To its clients, Georadar offers the  so called Operation Monitoring  System, which allows them to monitor in real time the evolution  and development of the services contracted. The partnerships established by  Georadar with its suppliers aim  to improve the efficiency of their  interactions, namely concerning  the supply of products. Suppliers  thus benefit from lower seasonality  in their sales and can plan for  the future with greater certainty.  For Georadar, these partnerships  permit to reduce delivery waiting  times, reduce logistics costs,  increase the proximity of supplies  and reduce the chances of non  availability of products.

Management of Employee Training  and Wellbeing Rioforte Talent training and management are fundamental for the  companies success in the long run. Rioforte is set on driving the  acquisition and sharing of knowledge across its entire portfolio  leading to the construction of a competitive and enterprising  workforce. Riofortes Sustainability Strategic Plan and the specific Plans of  the various units foresee the adoption of continuous training  practices,  consistent  and  competitive  hiring  practices,  practices that foster employee  engagement and motivation, and  practices aimed at minimising  safety and hygiene hazards in the  workplace, in agreement with the  activity of each subsidiary. The companies in the real estate  sector in Portugal have in place  well established practices for employee training, performance  assessment and the management of hygiene, health and safety at  work. When there in an interest by both parties, retiring employees  are encouraged to cooperate, either circumstantially or on a  part-time basis. In Brazil these practices are being standardised  viewing the consistency and systematisation of human resources  management. The tourism sector has seen continuous investment in the  sophistication of its human capital management, through the  implementation of practices such as:  Organisational climate analyses;   Health, hygiene and safety management systems;   Training plans;   Career management systems, supported by employee      performance assessment. In construction, human resources management practices are  adapted to the reality of each company. Given the current context  of the construction sector in Portugal, the challenge faced by these  companies is focused on restructuring and securing operational  viability in the short term so as to guarantee economic and  financial sustainability in the medium and long term. Even  so, they maintain their commitment to their hygiene, health  and safety management systems viewing the minimisation of  occupational hazards.    Health and safety in the workplace are equally important for the  companies in the agriculture sector, given the risks inherent to  their activities. The training programmes implemented by the  farming estates in Paraguay comprise diseases such as dengue,  yellow fever and certain chronic diseases. All the employees of Riofortes subsidiaries in Paraguay are covered  by social insurance, thus benefiting from healthcare and assistance  in case of occupational accidents. The farming estates in Brazil have the same concerns about the  health and safety of their employees, having implemented an  extensive programme on the use, control and disposal of pesticides  and pesticides packaging. This programme is of vital importance  in so far as the inadequate handling of pesticides is one of the main  causes of health problems among farming workers, and these are  subject to regular medical exams. Any occupational accidents are  reported to the competent authorities. The companies in the energy  sector have made an effort to  train and adapt their employees  to the new challenges they face.  In geoservices, there are well  established practices for employee  training and health and safety  management, which have resulted  in a reduction in the number of  occupational accidents despite an  increase in the number of hours of exposure to risk. 100% Employees subject  to performance  assessment in the  Real Estate  sector 64%* Employees  subject to  performance  assessment in the  Construction sector Indigenous populations - Sociedad Agrcola Golondrina Sociedad Agrcola Golondrina spans a total area of 23,911 ha,  of which 13,592 ha are occupied by the Ypeti Natural Reserve.  The reserve, which is inhabited by indigenous populations,  benefits from a management plan that guarantees respect  for all its inhabitants rights. Golondrina has invested in the  construction of schools that provide access to education to the  indigenous populations. Partnerships – Cobrape Cobrape has established a partnership with the Bradesco  Foundation and the local city council to increase the literacy  and schooling rates of both adults and children of the  companys employees or of neighbouring producers.   The school, located inside the estate, is attended by 54 pupils.  It is also used to provide training on accident prevention and  fire fighting, in cooperation with external entities, as well as  specialisation courses in industrial areas. COBRAPE * notwithstanding the realignment process the majority  of the employees received performance reviews  Rioforte 2011 Sustainability Report 51 OPWAY  – Reorganisation of the Organisational  Structure  Background The economic crisis affecting Portugal over the last decade has  led to a sharp fall in the construction industrys production  levels, which was further aggravated in the last three years by the  global economic crisis. The measures implemented   In this context, OPWAY, along with its peer companies, felt  the need to streamline global costs and maximise the existing  resources. To this end the company drew up a Modernisation  Plan with the main objective of securing its economic and  financial equilibrium. According to this plan, a number of  efficiency boosting measures were implemented, including the  extinction of several activities and the reduction in the number  of hierarchical levels and functions, leading to a downsizing of  the companys workforce. This process was undertaken in three  phases during 2011, involving the collective dismissal of 316  employees. The decision to opt for the collective termination procedure was  taken not only due to the number of employees involved but  also to guarantee a transparent process ensuring the same terms  to all functional groups involved and safeguarding the rights  of all employees, namely the entitlement to unemployment  benefit. OPWAY was assisted in this process by a law firm  specialising in this kind of processes, thus ensuring full  respect for the employees rights. The process was supported  Tivoli Hotels & Resorts implemented in 2011 a Performance Management System for its employees viewing the establishment of clear  quantified objectives in the four dimensions of organisational performance, namely:   Strategic dimension, linked to a balanced scorecard and the companys strategic objectives;  Operational dimension, directly linked to the operational results of each team;    Functional dimension, linked to the employees skills in terms of know how to be;   Skills dimension, linked to the Employees know how and know how to be capabilities.  The System also defines the role of the manager as a guide and mentor of the employees under his responsibility, thus establishing a real  chain of commitment within the company viewing the fulfilment of its objectives. by a communication plan involving the companys Board of  Directors, aimed at providing all necessary clarifications to the  employees regarding the reasons for taking this decision, their  rights, the phases of the process and the resolution of future  issues. Individual meetings were held will all the employees to  explain their personal cases. Support to change and results obtained The redundant employees benefited in a first stage from an  outplacement service to support their departure from the  organisation and subsequent reintegration in the labour market.  A team of experienced consultants assisted the employees in  looking for a new job or creating their own business, taking  into account their former functions, qualifications and age. This  outplacement service also comprised individual programmes and  collective workshops to, among others, prepare the employees  for job interviews, help them contact Job Centres, and assist  them in drawing up their curriculum vitae. The compiled information about all individual processes shows  that 97% of the employees subject to collective dismissal accepted  the severance payment offered and released the company from  any further obligations regarding any amounts owed at the time  of dismissal. As far as is known, no legal appeals have been filed. 1. Planning Scheduling  the assessments 2. Interview  preparation 3. Definition of  Commitments 4. Interim  assessment 5.

Environmental Preservation Rioforte The growing pressure exerted by consumption on scarce or limited  natural resources resulting from the subsidiaries operational  activities has led to the definition of strategic objectives viewing  the preservation, lower consumption and efficient use of these  resources. These aims are contemplated in the Sustainability  Strategic Plan. The main environmental impacts of the companies in the real estate  sector occur when the developments are already in use, however  it is during the design phase that the chances of minimising such  impacts are greater. The main environmental impacts of the companies in the  real estate sector occur when the developments are already in  use, however it is during the design phase that the chances of  minimising such impacts are greater. Despite the fact that the  subsidiaries in this sector already follow good practices, their  Sustainability Strategic Plans aim to systematise their application  so as to allow the management teams to reinforce the measures  intended to minimise the environmental impacts of buildings  over their life cycle. The hotel units have invested in the implementation of  environmental management systems permitting to minimise  their impacts on the environment. Three hotel units have their  management systems certified under the ISO 14001 standard. The  hotels have also put into practice programmes to raise awareness  among employees, suppliers and clients and engage them in the  initiatives implemented. In their search for efficiency, the travel agencies select their  equipment and materials having in mind the reduction of  consumptions. This includes the installation of more effective  HVAC devices and energy saving bulbs and optimising lighting  in their counters light panels. By monitoring water and energy  consumption and waste production in their facilities these  agencies seek to minimise their environmental impacts. The companies in the construction sector in Portugal manage  their main environmental impacts through an environmental  management system certified under the ISO 14001 standard,  which guarantees high consistency in works management and  execution processes.   This system allows for the correct monitoring of the main  environmental impacts, such as water and energy consumption,  and to dispose of and recycle the waste produced during the  construction process. The main concerns of the agricultural sector at global level are  the sustainability of the soils, the preservation of biodiversity  and the correct management of water resources. In Brazil, two  of Riofortes subsidiaries in this sector rent their land to partners  which are committed to respect natural values and preserve the  businesss sustainability in the long term. The only estate fully managed by Rioforte in Brazil (Cobrape)  has identified all the environmental impacts of its activities and  processes. This survey was conducted by the State regulator  itself, which subsequently recommended the implementation of  programmes to monitor, manage and minimise the environmental  impacts. All these programmes are deployed under a holistic  approach aimed at guaranteeing the operations sustainability in  the long run.                    The farming estates in Paraguay also conducted environmental  impact surveys to determine the main risks for biodiversity arising  from their activity. Such risks are managed in accordance with  environmental plans - namely the Forcerpa Forestry Management  Plan, the Estancia Golondrina Integrated Production Plan, or the  Ypeti Natural Reserve Management Plan – which are adjusted  to the activities developed – cattle breeding and forestry – and  subject to regular assessments. In this respect, the following facts  are worth mentioning:  The quality management system for seed production (soy, wheat     and cotton) is certified under ISO 9001;  Forestry production and management is certified in accordance     with the criteria of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC);  Soy production is currently in the process of certification in     accordance with the International Sustainability and Carbon      Certification (ISCC) standards, which validates carbon credits      generated through the production of all types of biomass. Tivoli Hotels & Resorts - Ecoresort Praia do Forte The Hotel Tivoli Ecoresort Praia do Forte is located in an  area rich in biodiversity. In addition to complying with all  applicable environmental legislation, the hotel also promotes  the following initiatives:  Environmental education programmes;   Waste management, shredding and composting of pruning      waste, water quality monitoring;  Revegetation of mangrove areas. These practices have permitted to preserve the natural  characteristics of a protected areas spanning  2,411 km2,  despite the affluence of clients to the hotel and their  participation in its activities. 100.370 Gj Total energy  consumption by the  construction sector in  2011, a 19% reduction  relative to 2010  Rioforte 2011 Sustainability Report 53 In the energy sector, the company that performs geoservices has in place an environmental management system that complies with ISO  14001, which covers the management of solid waste and liquid effluents, and controls water and energy consumption. 5 Million m3 Water consumption by the  agriculture sector in Brazil  20% increase in 2011  relative to 2010 241.141 litres Fuel consumption  (diesel and gasoline) by the  agriculture sector in Brazil 16,7% reduction in 2011  relative to 2010.  Comporta – Environmental preservation in the  conception of tourism developments Herdade da Comporta, which mainly operates in the tourism  sector, occupies an area of 12,500 hectares along the Portuguese  Atlantic coast, south of the Tria peninsula. Comportas Global  Development Plan foresees the development of two very low  density tourism development areas with plans for the construction  of hotels, apartment hotels, tourism villages and residences, golf  courses and all the respective support infrastructures. Herdade da Comporta is set on implementing environmental,  cultural and historical differentiation practices, with the  assistance of various partners. These will include:   Measures  to  minimize  environmental  impacts,  and     environmental management plans for construction works,      namely for Hotel Amandunas and the Comporta Dunes Golf      course.  Environmental management systems to benefit and preserve     the Comporta and Pego beaches, certified under ISO 14001      standard. These systems permit to preserve the beaches natural      values, even at times of great affluence of visitors. The tourism development project also comprises a General  Programme of impact compensation and minimisation at  Herdade da Comporta, covering the following areas:   Measures viewing the conservation of protected species and      habitats;   Forest management measures;   Environmental management measures;   Measures included in the programme for access control to      natural and forested areas;   Measures for environmental education and awareness raising. This approach will permit to establish Herdade da Comporta  as a tourism development that simultaneously serves the local  community without harming the surrounding environment. ES Viagens – Good environmental practices in the con- struction of new branches The company always seeks to introduce good practices in the  construction of new branches. TopAtlntico, a subsidiary of ES  Viagens, opened two new branches in 2011 – Braga Parque and  Forum Algarve – where there was a clear concern regarding the  installation of equipment to reduce energy consumption. Hence these new branches use energy saving light bulbs, which  permit to cut energy consumption by ca. 50%, low consumption  LEDs, and inverter air conditioning equipment using  R 410 or  R 407 gas, which consume approximately 30% less energy than  conventional equipment. Acrylic displays on these branches shop windows were  significantly reduced, and promotions are made using LEDs,  thus considerably reducing paper consumption and consequently  the production of waste.  Rioforte 2011 Sustainability Report  54 7. Engagement with Analysts      and the Community Rioforte The involvement with the various stakeholders contributes to form  a corporate identity based on rigour, trust and transparency, while  fostering the development of the local communities through the  local hiring of employees and suppliers and the support provided  to the population and to civil society organisations. The companies in the tourism sector, namely Herdade da  Comporta, develop social solidarity initiatives. Due to the need  to preserve cultural and historical values, tourism projects must  blend harmoniously with the local populations. This is encouraged  by the Herdade da Comporta Foundation, whose mission is to  promote and support social assistance, cultural, educational and  scientific initiatives to improve the living standards and cultural  level of the populations residing within the propertys boundaries. Likewise, and as far as possible, Tivoli Hotels & Resorts includes  within its offer local products from suppliers in the vicinity of its  hotels. The companies in the construction sector use practices that  safeguard the safety and health of the communities in the areas  of construction works, while getting involved with the local  community and taking social responsibility initiatives on a case- -by-case basis. The Brazil and Paraguay operations – which include important  agro companies – have regularly and consistently implemented  practices in favour of the local populations. The large majority  of the employees is recruited from the local communities and  the companies provide effective support to local producers in  the vicinity of their estates. The estates have in place microcredit  programmes for the local farmers, provide and support the  creation of better healthcare and sports facilities in the region,  and in particular create schools within the properties themselves  not only for their employees, but also for their children and the  surrounding community. Such practices contribute to reduce  the rural exodus and to improve the living standards of the local  populations.  The companies in the energy sector also implement local hiring  plans, while seeking to train and raise awareness among the  local populations about the impacts of prospecting and forest  exploration and management works. These companies also  perform specific operations to improve infrastructures within  their area of influence.

Since its creation, the Foundation  has supported a great number of associations and entities that  work daily and effectively to the benefit of the population. In 2010 the Foundation decided to take an even more active role  as the companys arm for social responsibility and engagement  with the local community. To this end it appointed a team to  make a comprehensive assessment of the needs of the population  living in the seven villages comprised within the estate, and to  draw up its own social agenda. As a result, in 2011 the Foundation launched a Social Project  based on three key pillars:   Isabel Theodora Project – its purpose is to restore, maintain     and regulate the situation of various houses owned by Herdade      da Comporta which are currently inhabited free of charge by   Sociedad Agricola Golondrina –  Support to and involvement with the local community The setting of Sociedad Agrcola Golondrina is eminently rural,  and its populations main economic activities are agriculture and  cattle breeding. Golondrina takes an active role in projects to support the local  community, and in particular in health and education projects.  The company has supported the construction and improvement  of health centres, endorsed vaccination initiatives, sponsored  school sports and educational activities, and provided donations  of various kinds. Golondrina seeks to use its operational activity to engage with  the community, and to this end participates in three production  committees, namely of sugarcane, manioc and cotton, in which  57 families from the surrounding community are involved.  The company supports the activities of the sugarcane and  cotton committees throughout their various phases, namely  preparation of the soil (in which its own machines are used),  sowing and cultivation. The Social Cooperative Project, resulting from a partnership  between various private entities and multilateral organisations,  should also be highlighted. Its main mission is to promote the  sustainable development of Paraguay through market strategies  and capacity building and innovation targeting the rural  communities, leading to shared value creation.    needy families and former employees of the estate and their      families.   Socio-cultural and socio-educational animation – the purpose     is to support young people in their school and academic career,      develop creative activities and promote cultural initiatives     in the region. These initiatives are taken at three levels: those      targeting children and young people from the villages; cultural      and recreational animation in the region; and education for      adults;   Programme for the Prevention of Risk Situations, acting on     two levels: children, young people and families, on the one      hand, and senior citizens on the other. Both programmes are      developed in close cooperation with various entities on the      ground. The Herdade da Comporta Foundation thus seeks to bring  together various entities around its Social Project, leveraging the  cooperation among institutions as the projects driving force. The Social Cooperative Project proposes to achieve the following  results:  Access to knowledge and technology concerning sustainable     production systems;   Access to financial solutions for production development     (support to mechanisation, agricultural services);   Implementation of communication strategies viewing an     integrated social and economic development;   Setting aside areas viewing the generation of productive     innovation management and organisation;   Structured philanthropic activities to support the community     in the areas of education and health.   The project will be implemented and deployed over a 4-year  period (2012-2016) and involve a total investment of USD 4  million by the sponsor companies. In terms of its social impact,  it is expected to double the income of the targeted families as  well as enhance the populations sense of belonging to their  community, thus reducing the rural exodus.
