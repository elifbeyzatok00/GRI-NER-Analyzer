Throughout the last two years we have made great effort to develop a culture of  corporate responsibility among our stakeholders.     2012 had been a very tough year both for the businesses and for people all around  the world. Political instability in the Middle East, natural disasters and global  economic recession made the lives of people very difficult than previous decades.  Against all these challenges, it has become very difficult to maintain business in  traditional terms. We are now aware that the return of business practices on  environment is becoming more dramatic than ever.     In 2012, despite we did not manage to complete all the projects we have started in  2011; we had achieved a considerable degree of progress. We are optimistic to  fulfill our goals in 2013. Especially for ensuring NMTs compliance to international  environmental and occupational safety norms are very important for us.     On behalf of NMT team I wish 2013 will be a more rewarding and peaceful year for  the world and I proudly declare NMTs support and commitment to global compact  principles will continuously increase in the upcoming year.    Didem Esen        Managing Director-CMC  NMT Consultancy and Training Center         3      ABOUT NMT    NMT Consultancy and Training Center had been founded in 1996 in order to  maintain direct and tangible management solutions for small and medium sized  enterprises in manufacturing industry. During this initial period, NMTs consultants  have serviced over 100 companies and directly supported their clients in  developing their industrial capabilities.     In 1998, NMT Consultancy becomes the member of association of management  consultants (YDD).     In 1998, on demand of its clients NMT Human Resources group had been  established to support clients in their search and selection processes.    In 1999, NMT Training Center had been established so as to provide professional  training programs on quality management.    In 2000, NMT had been added into the UNIDO database.    In 2001, NMT started its institutionalization projects for family owned businesses.    In 2002, NMT undertook the consultancy project of EU Business Centers in Turkey.    In 2004, NMT Training Group developed various new programs in strategic  management, business continuity management and personal development.    In 2005, NMT divided its activities into two corporate bodies as NMT Consultancy  and Training Center and NMT Human Resources.    In 2007, NMT adopted the vision of internationalization and thus NMT Human  Resources signed the partnership contract with Feige Business Advisors GmbH.

On March 2012, NMT Management Consultant, Mrs. Angela Teresi gave a  seminar on improving management skills to LSEV employees.            According to our vision of supporting SMEs for business continuity issues,  NMT Managing Partner Mrs. Didem Esen will realize a general training and  seminar on corporate risk management to the members of DOSABSAD  (Association of Demirtas Organized Industrial Zone Industrialists and  Businessmen) in Bursa             9                NMTS ACTIONS FOR GLOBAL COMPACT PRINCIPLES IN 2012  In the first two years of our membership, we tried to improve NMT teams  general level of awareness on global compact principles.  Simultaneously we  aim to internalize and adopt common values in our daily business operations  and corporate principles.   Within NMT we have established issue-oriented work groups among the  employees. These employees are acting as informative agents for their  colleagues on the issues of environment and human rights. Throughout 2012  these groups kept on realizing regular meetings and this year we have observed  a considerable increase in employees contributions to these meetings. By this  way, a culture of democracy is also developing as well as mutual understanding  of differences between people is also flourishing.                         10          1-HUMAN RIGHTS  NMT supports and protects internationally proclaimed principles of human  rights and works to eliminate actions or practices that might give way to human  rights abuses from its business practices.   In the previous two years NMT focused on eliminating practices which might  give way to human right abuses. For this, NMT Human Rights Awareness Group  had been established with the participation of 3 consultants. This group has  two roles. Firstly, they are responsible for raising employees general level of  awareness on human rights issues. Secondly, they would review all internal  business processes of NMT.  As a result of their activities recruitment process had been reviewed and  format of vacancy advertisements and application forms had been revised.  Recruiters also trained about human rights issues.  Human rights principles had  been incorporated into human resources hand book of NMT. A brief  presentation on Human Rights and Business had been added into the  corporate orientation program.  At the beginning employees were quite reluctant about contributing to the  meetings. However, we have observed that every year their contributions to  these meetings are increasing slowly. Last year on the basis of our employees  demands we have celebrated human rights day.  Against all global human  rights abuses, we decided to celebrate it every year. By placing posters in our  office places and on our website we manage to develop a considerable degree  of awareness among our stakeholders.                11          Table 1.0    GLOBAL COMPACT  PRINCIPLES    NMTS COMMITTMENT  AND ACTIONS TAKEN    RESULTS      Businesses should  support and respect the  protection of  internationally  proclaimed human rights        *NMT Human Rights  Awareness Group  organized quarterly  meetings      *Continuous feedbacks  on best practices are  given in regular meetings    * NMT will celebrate  Human Rights Day on 10  December 2012 second  time.      *Total degree of  awareness on human  rights issues developed  among the NMT Team.       *General level of  awareness about the  relationship between   human rights and  business life started to  increase among our  clients and suppliers.

NMT is against all forms of compulsory labor and supports all civil initiatives for  abolition of child labor.   We are eager to put forward all the necessary measures that would foster the  application of ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.   NMT is fully aware of its obligation in developing the standards of working life  within its sphere of influence. Vast majority of NMTs employees are women.  We believe that supporting women in business life is very crucial for developing  countries. By encouraging women engagement into workforce, initial problems  of welfare and social development would be resolved. Thats why we are  presenting our full support for this issue and we are trying to establish an  employee friendly working place.  For this we are trying to maintain a working culture based on democracy and  inclusion. As part of our efforts to maintain compliance to human rights  framework of global compact, we are avoiding to create discriminative climate  during the recruitment process. In order to preserve these principles, during  the interviews questions about candidates race, religion or socio-political  views are not allowed to be asked. In addition to these, in vacancy  advertisements only necessary competencies are being listed. Discriminative  clauses referring to gender, age or physical condition of the candidates are not  permitted.  In NMT, all activities are being carried out according to Turkish labor Law and  NMT management fulfills all obligations arising from law. NMT is applying equal  pay for equal job principle to all of its employees and providing maternity  protection for the personnel who have children.   NMT is encouraging its personnel to stand against maltreatment and/or  mobbing. Managers are obliged to take necessary actions within 2 days after  they have received written or oral complaint of an employee. Of course we are  aware of the fact that there are further measures to minimize these instances.  We are devoting our sincere efforts to adopt these contemporary measures  into our business practices to overcome this problem.       13    In terms of occupational health and safety applications; NMT guarantees to  provide right tools and working conditions to all of its employees. In 2012 in  order to certify our full commitment on occupational health and safety, we  have started necessary preparations to get OHSAS18001 certification. We  established our rules and procedures according to the international  occupational health and safety standards. However we still need to work on  legal requirements. We are expecting to complete these efforts in 2013.                                           14    Table 1.1  GLOBAL COMPACT  PRINCIPLES  NMTS COMMITTMENT  AND ACTIONS TAKEN  RESULTS      Businesses should  uphold the freedom of  association and the  effective recognition of  the right to collective  bargaining      *NMT adhere to  principle of association  and right of collective  bargaining  *NMT is against all forms  of compulsory labor  *NMT is against child  labor  *Anti discriminatory  clauses are  being  detached from vacancy  ads and recruitment  processes    *Encouraging women  engagement to  economic life     *Promote Equal Pay For  Equal Job    *Corporate policy  against mobbing is  applied    *Employees enjoyed  working within a safe  and democratic  environment that  respect and promotes  human dignity and  individuality   * NMT, established  corporate rules and  procedures according to  the international health  and safety standards   *NMT will get  OHSAS18001  certification in 2013.

NMT, NMT supports all the corporate social responsibility activities which  endorse fighting against soil erosion and promotes animals rights initiatives.   We work to promote greater environmental responsibility in our business  practices and promoting green office applications internally. NMT is supporting  projects that would maintain the use of environment friendly technologies.  During the last two years we have realized efficient projects to maintain our  adherence to above mentioned principles. In 2010 NMT established a green  office project team and managed to decrease %2 of electricity consumption  and reduced our office wastes by 10%. In 2011, implementation of enterprise  resource planning (ERP) program had been completed. We managed to  transfer all documentation into electronic database and use of paper in our  daily operations had been diminished by %76.   In 2012 we revised our procedures according to ISO14001:2004 Environmental  Management System requirements.  We are expecting to complete the  certification in 2013.         16    Table 1.2    GLOBAL COMPACT   PRINCIPLES    NMTS COMMITTMENT  AND ACTIONS TAKEN  RESULTS    Business should support  a precautionary  approach to  environmental  challenges        *NMT staff had been  trained on  transformation to green  office applications    *Enterprise Resource  Planning program had  been implemented.      *Whole corporate  documentation had  been transferred into  electronic platform           *Use of paper in the  daily  operations  had  been diminished by %76.    *NMT  will  get  ISO14001:2004  Environmental  Management  System  certification in 2013.         *External stakeholders  of NMT adopted a wider  vision on environmental  social responsibility    Undertake initiatives to  promote greater  environmental  responsibility      Encourage the  development and  diffusion of  environmentally friendly  technologies           17    4- ANTI CORRUPTION    NMT is aware of the fact that corruption has played a major part in  undermining the world's social, economic and environmental development  which leads ultimately to the improper and unfair allocation of resources and  prevents development of societies. NMT supports all the national and  international efforts to fight against corruption and declares its full  commitment to the anti-corruption principle of Global Compact.  NMT reaffirms that; fighting against corruption in our business operations is a  prerequisite for good governance. By supporting development of good  governance practices within our sphere of influence, we believe that fair  business practices among our external and internal stakeholders would  flourish.  NMT promotes the idea of transparency and tries to develop a democracy  culture among its staff and within the organizations of its clients. Consultants  who are working for the institutionalization of family businesses projects are  obliged to inform their clients on the necessity of adopting anti-corruption  principles into their corporate practices.   In addition to these, in 2012 new clauses against bribery had been added into  the NMTs code of conduct. The rules and policies of gifts, celebrations and  donations are being described strictly and shared with all employees.        18    Table 1.3    GLOBAL COMPACT   PRINCIPLES    NMTS COMMITTMENT  AND ACTIONS TAKEN  RESULTS          Business should work  against corruption in all  its forms including  extortion and bribery    *NMT supports  all the  national and international  efforts  to fight against  corruption and declares its  full commitment to the  anti-corruption principle of  Global Compact.  *Consultants  who  are  working  for  the  institutionalization of family  businesses  projects  are  informing the clients on  necessity of adopting anti- corruption principles into  their corporate practices.  *Corporate code of conduct  revised to include clauses  against bribery              *Corporate  culture  against  anti- corruption had been  developed                   19            NMTS PLANS FOR 2013    In 2013, NMT will continue its support for the global compact principles and we  are planning to develop our corporate policies and practices in compliance with  these principles. Through applying the standards of ISO 14001:2004  Environmental Management System and OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health  and Safety Management System we are expecting to achieve an advanced level  of commitment to environmental protection and good working conditions.    2012 had been a year of severe natural disasters both globally and locally.  Floods in Turkey damaged majority of cultivated areas and led to the death of  many people. With sandy hurricane experience, we have witnessed how  natural disasters could affect global business. These facts made us all think  about sustainability and business continuity in the framework of environmental  corporate responsibility.     Business continuity management became a key issue for all companies. Big  companies have enough resources to establish efficient programs for managing  business continuity. However SMEs are lacking critical financial and  technological resources; maintaining business continuity in these hard times is  a very difficult task for them.      In Turkey SMEs comprised a very important part of the economic life. We are  considering them as a key for sustainable social and economic welfare in our  country. For this reason, we have concentrated our efforts to support SMEs in  developing suitable business continuity models in 2013.
