1 | P a g e           United Nations   Advanced Communication on Progress        A message from the chairman – Zola Tsotsi        Our mandate is to provide sustainable electricity solutions to grow the economy and improve the  quality of life of the people of South Africa and the region.     At a time when global economic uncertainty is forcing many companies to curtail operations and  limit growth, Eskom is hard at work on one of the largest capital expansion programmes in South  Africas history. This R340 billion programme, which commenced in 2005, will have added 17GW of  much-needed electricity-generating capacity to the national grid by 2018/19.     Eskom faces several challenges during the transition to increased generating capacity. The first  new generating unit – unit 6 at Medupi power station in Limpopo – is expected to come online in  2013. Until then, the supply/demand balance will remain tight. If we want to ensure a stable power  system, all of us – households and businesses – will have to reduce demand and use energy  efficiently. To keep the lights on, Eskom counts on the support of all South Africans.    Eskoms objectives are not limited to commercial concerns. We are a state owned company and  our performance is also measured by the overall value we add to the lives of the public. Our  developmental responsibilities range from building and maintaining power plants and networks, to  supplying households, schools and factories with electricity, supporting local industries, and  stimulating skills and job creation.      2 | P a g e     Our mandate, as outlined by the Department of Public Enterprises, to which we are accountable, is  to provide sustainable electricity solutions to grow the economy and improve the quality of life of  the people of South Africa and the region.    We are working to reduce our environmental footprint, diversify our energy mix and lower carbon  emissions, as endorsed by President Jacob Zuma at COP 17 in Durban in 2011. In addition to  reducing our carbon emissions in a manner consistent with South Africas economic growth  objectives, we are also committed to planning for the impact of climate change.    In the months ahead, several critical policy decisions need to be taken that will shape the future of  the electricity industry. The government has adopted the Integrated Resource Plan 2010, which  represents a major step forward in identifying South Africas energy options. Urgent decisions are  required concerning how the plan will be implemented, how it will be funded and what role Eskom,  as the countrys primary electricity utility, will play. Delays in key decisions can have negative  consequences for the planning of capital expenditure, construction and engineering.      Zola Tsotsi  Chairperson          A message from the chief executive – Brian Dames        At all major turning points in the life of an economy, companies face a difficult choice: how to meet  present demand while ensuring that they are investing to safeguard the future. Eskom is achieving  this balance. We are keeping the lights on and we are building the power stations and transmission  infrastructure needed to power South African businesses and households well into the 21st century.     Doing so has not been easy and, as this report describes, the road ahead is strewn with obstacles.  But we are confident that we are setting the utility up for success; that our organisation is becoming  financially sustainable; and that as a result of initiatives now under way, we will in time become the  high-performance organisation that South Africa needs to grow its economy and create jobs.    Our goal is to provide South Africa with secure, affordable, accessible and cleaner power in the  decades to come. This report charts our progress along this path. It sets out, in a concise manner,  the range of material concerns affecting our business.     3 | P a g e     Beyond our financial bottom line, it addresses issues of governance, remuneration, risk and  sustainability, and explains how these factors interact and affect our ability to create and maintain  value. Eskom has been a leader in integrated reporting for a number of years. This report is the first  in a new, more focused format, in response to new international initiatives that are leading the way  towards improved reporting. We welcome your comments and suggestions on both the content and  the format of this report.     The global challenges of energy supply South Africa is not alone, particularly among developing  countries, in facing the challenges of energy supply. Around the world, electricity utilities are  grappling with how to provide energy to growing populations and economies in a safe and  sustainable way. Doing so requires long term planning that takes into account the complex interplay  of economic growth, demographic shifts, a finite supply of primary energy resources (and countries  specific allocation of those resources), transmission requirements, protection of the environment,  and cost recovery.     In Eskoms case, these challenges are underlined by the companys developmental mandate.  Providing reliable and affordable electricity is not only a commercial undertaking; it is also about  creating a foundation on which South Africa can grow, helping to transform the lives of the large  percentage of the population that lives in poverty.     As a state-owned company, Eskom is an enabler of the governments vision and a supporter of  economic growth in our country and the southern African region.  Eskom buys and sells electricity in  the countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Eskom is investigating  additional opportunities in SADC that have a direct impact on ensuring a secure supply of electricity  for South Africa.    Beyond our financial bottom line, it addresses issues of governance, remuneration, risk and  sustainability, and explains how these factors interact and affect our ability to create and maintain  value.     The business case for sustainability is getting stronger and we are committed to embedding  sustainability into our business culture and operations. We remain committed to supporting the UN  Global Compact, including the associated LEAD initiative – which aims to improve sustainability  performance – as well as the CEO Water Mandate1 and Caring for Climate. The UN has declared  2012 the international year of sustainable energy for all. The UN secretary-general launched the  Sustainable Energy for All initiative in September 2011 and I am personally involved in the high- level advisory group for this project.    We strengthened our commitments to environmental protection and mitigating the effects of climate  change. Eskom supported the government in hosting the successful COP 17 meeting in Durban.  We expect construction of the Sere renewable energy wind project in the Western Cape to begin  during 2012. We installed solar panels at Kendal and Lethabo power stations to supplement  auxiliary power consumption at these stations – the start of a programme that will be rolled out  across our fleet of coal-fired stations. We have improved performances regarding relative  particulate emissions, water usage and contraventions of legislation, compared to 2010/11.    We have expanded our social investment commitments, including taking responsibility for the way  operations affect the environment and promoting the objectives of the governments New Growth  Path. Eskom believes its social responsibility goes beyond allocating funds to development projects  through corporate social Investment. It is also about incorporating an ethic of social responsibility  into its business model, taking into account the ways its decisions will affect all its stakeholders.    Brian Dames  Chief executive                                                    1 United National Global Compacts CEO Water Mandate is a unique public-private initiative  designed to assist companies in the development, implementation and disclosure of water  sustainability policies and practices.   4 | P a g e     ESKOM HOLDINGS SOC LIMITED: REPORTING ON PROGRESS  – UNITED NATIONS ADVANCED COMMUNICATION ON  PROGRESS    Eskom has been signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2000 and has continued to  communicate on progress.  Since then, Eskom has been committed to the ten principles of the UN  Global Compact.  This has led to Eskom being invited in 2010 to be one of the few Global Compact  LEAD members. This is a call to recognize Eskom for its extraordinary leadership in issues of the  Global Compact.    Eskom is currently an Active Member of the UN Global Compact and strives towards being a  Global Compact Advanced Member as part of our role as a LEAD member.  In March 2012 Eskom  became a member of the LEAD Steering Committee for 2012.     In September 2011 the UN secretary-general launched the Sustainable Energy for All initiative.   Eskoms chief executive is personally involved in the high-level advisory group for this project.    The Global Compact Advanced level aims to create a higher standard for corporate sustainability  performance and disclosure.  Eskom therefore sets out to demonstrate that it has adopted and  report a range of Global Compact strategy, governance and management practices.     Eskom has combined sustainability and financial reporting for a number of years, but this year that  an integrated report (see www.eskom.co.za/ir2012/) has been produced that aligns with the  principles contained in discussion papers published by the International Integrated Report  Committee and the Integrated Reporting Committee of South Africa. Integrated reporting is a new  international initiative that has emerged in response to the shortcomings of traditional reporting,  which emphasises financial results without taking account of the broader context in which  companies operate, and fails to weave together different reporting strands.     Integrated reporting allows for reporting on financial results, governance, sustainability and other  material factors in an interdependent manner. It addresses the challenges that companies face, the  advantages they enjoy, the external factors that influence them and the way they in turn influence  the external environment.     To support this new approach to reporting, Eskom formed an integrated reporting steering  committee2 to ensure alignment with other reporting processes. This demonstrates that the  management of the business and internal reporting is closely aligned to the requirements for the  year end integrated report.    The integrated reporting pilot programme  Eskom is a member of the International Integrated Report Committees pilot programme  (http://www.theiirc.org/). All annual reports published by the more than 60 programme members  worldwide in the period October 2011 to September 2012 (including this report) will be reviewed and  analysed for their strengths and weaknesses. Lessons learnt during this cycle will contribute to a global  standard for integrated reporting.    Eskom has applied the principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness in compiling its  Integrated Report. These principles ensure that the company incorporates the views of its  stakeholders, as well as internal planning reporting and risk-management processes.       Eskom has declared a B+ report in terms of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The list of relevant  GRI indicators is available online at (www.eskom.co.za/ir2012/). KPMG has provided assurance on  selected sustainability information in that report.  Eskom follows a combined assurance approach.                                                      2 The steering committee is a subcommittee of Eskoms executive management committee, and is responsible for the  coordination of the integrated report for Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.   5 | P a g e     Eskoms reports are also prepared with due consideration of the King Report on Corporate  Governance (King III). This Advanced Communication on Progress is based on extract from  Eskoms integrated report.    1. ESKOMS COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS IN RELATION  TO UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT ADVANCED  LEVEL      Eskom is committed to entrenching sustainability principles into the essence of our business culture  and operations and working with its stakeholders through advancing the Global Compact principles.     The then United Nations (UN) General Secretary General Kofi Annan met with leaders in business,  civil society and key UN agencies to measure progress and plan the next steps of the Global  Compact.  This followed the 1999 Davos World Economic Forum – Kofi Annan called business  leaders to join a Global Compact with the UN.    Published in our 2000 Annual Reports Chief Executives Report we stated: At the launch of the  United Nations Compact in July 2000, Eskom's Chief Executive, at the invitation of the Secretary- General, Kofi Annan, became a participant in the Global Compact. The Compact is a voluntary  initiative that seeks to provide a global framework to promote sustainable growth and good  citizenship through committed and creative corporate leadership. The Global Compact brings  companies together with the United Nations, international labour and human rights organisations,  together with NGOs to foster partnerships and to build a more inclusive and equitable global  marketplace. Business is being called on to support and enact the nine principles in the areas of  labour standards, human rights and environmental practice.                                                                 6 | P a g e     Below is Eskoms Communication on Progress (COP) how it is striving to meet the 24 Global  Compact Advanced Criteria:      Strategy, Governance and Engagement     1. Criterion 1: The COP describes key aspects of the companys high-level sustainability  strategy in line with Global Compact principles     Eskoms purpose, values and strategic objectives:          2. Criterion 2: The COP describes effective decision-making processes and systems of  governance for corporate sustainability     Eskoms corporate governance focuses on effective ethical leadership to integrate strategy,  governance and sustainability. Eskom takes its strategic direction from its board of directors.    The executive management committee is responsible for putting decisions made at board level into  effect and overseeing the companys day-to-day operations.       7 | P a g e     Corporate governance Board of directors    Eskom has a unitary board structure with a majority of independent non-executive directors. The  companys memorandum of incorporation stipulates that the shareholder will appoint a chairperson,  chief executive, finance director and non-executive directors after consulting the board.    The directors are drawn from diverse backgrounds and bring a wide range of experience and  professional skills to the board, supplemented at committee level by external members.    The performance of the board and individual directors is evaluated each year. The term of office of  non-executive directors is three years, subject to review at the annual general meeting. Retiring  directors are eligible for reappointment. The shareholder reconstituted the board in June 2011.    Delegation of authority    The board has the authority to delegate its power to executive structures and board committees. A  delegation-of-authority framework is in place to facilitate this delegation without diluting the boards  accountability. This framework is undergoing an extensive review process.     Board committees exercise their delegated authority in accordance with board approved policies.  Each board committee comprises a majority of independent nonexecutive directors and each is  chaired by an independent non-executive director. The board delegates management of day-to-day  operations to the chief executive.    The chief executive is assisted by the executive management committee and its subcommittees.      Corporate citizenship and sustainability   The board and its committees guide the strategy and set performance targets for Eskoms broad  approach to corporate citizenship. This includes the following:      A social, ethics and sustainability committee that focuses on sustainability and corporate  citizenship.      A tender committee that ensures that transformation, including skills development and  empowerment, is encouraged through Eskoms procurement activities.      An executive management committee assesses occupational health, safety and  environmental performance and reviews major incidents to ensure that corrective action is  taken.      The Eskom Development Foundation runs development programmes for disadvantaged  communities.      8 | P a g e       The board works to align its decision making with the governments New Growth Path.    A subsidiary governance framework is in place to facilitate the flow of information between  the holding company and its subsidiary companies, which ensures that sustainability goals  are aligned across the organisation.    3. Criterion 3: The COP describes engagement with all important stakeholders       Eskoms stakeholders include employees and unions; the government and Parliament; lenders,  analysts and investors; customers and regulators; industry experts, academics and the media;  business groups, civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs); and suppliers and  contractors.    Eskoms stakeholder engagement is based on the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard3.  Eskom is committed to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of inclusivity, materiality and  responsiveness. The process is also influenced by Eskoms commitment to the United Nations  Global Compact and King III.    Operational highlights    Promoted public safety and the dangers of electricity by holding 645 engagements in five  regions (Visited about 800 000 people during public safety-awareness campaigns in Cape  Town, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State.)    During electricity Safety Week there were 217 school visits and 174 community events    The quarterly state of the system address allowed Eskom to share information and  increase its voice in the media.     Secured 32 supporter partnerships through the 49M campaign.    Highlighted energy efficiency and promoted science, innovation and technology through  Eskoms Expo for Young Scientists and the eta Awards.    Successfully hosted 49M Charity Golf Day, raising R1 million for eight charities.    Operational challenges    Continued negative media coverage regarding the countrys reliance on coal and future  tariff increases.    Sustaining a behavioural and attitudinal change towards energy efficiency.    Future focus areas    Focus on safety communication and awareness with employees and the public.    Implement a permanent nerve centre (see emergency communication and nerve centre  below).     Continue the momentum of the 49M campaign.    Further enhance stakeholder relations governance by developing stakeholder relations  policy and standards as well as the supporting tools.    Focus on leading and coordinating integrated, well-researched and effective solutions.                                                       3 AA1000 Accountability Stakeholder Engagement standard is an international standard that guides a  companys approach to stakeholder engagement through the application of principles and best practice  guidelines.   9 | P a g e           UN Goals and Issues     4. Criterion 4: The COP describes actions taken in support of broader UN goals and  issues     The business case for sustainability is getting stronger and Eskom acknowledges its role in taking  action and demonstrating business leadership. As such we have signed the Global Compact since  2000, with specific focus on:      Global Compact LEAD (signed in June 2010)    At a global level, we are participating in the Caring for Climate Initiative and the CEO Water  Mandate issues specific working groups and task forces on Measuring Sustainability, Water and  Peace, and Environmental and Social Governance Investor Briefings (including principles of  responsible investment).  We are also working with organisations such as the International  Chamber of Commerce, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the  Business Action for Sustainable Development to further the principles and action on sustainable  development.    At a local level, we are actively involved in local business associations such as Business  Leadership South Africa (BLSA), the National Business Initiative (NBI) and Business Unity South  Africa. We are also involved in specific initiatives such as the Industry Task Team on Climate  Change, the Industry Water Task Team of South Africa, the NBIs Energy Efficiency Technical  Committee and its Advisory Committee on Climate Change.      At a regional level, we participate in the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) whose aim is to  provide reliable and economical electricity supply to the consumers of each of the members the  SAPP, consistent with the reasonable utilisation of natural resources and the effect on the  environment.  Our participation includes sharing experiences, providing technical expertise and  assisting in developing regional capacity through capacity building and training interventions  especially in the areas of environmental management and energy efficiency.        CEO Water Mandate (signed in February 2011)      10 | P a g e     We are in the process of finalising our input into a specific document to be submitted by CEOs to  Government heads attending Rio+20 and are actively involved in relevant working groups including  the CEO Water Mandates Collective Engagement Working Group.    Caring for Climate Initiative (C4C)    We are actively involved in the C4C Steering Committee and are currently engaging on potential  secondment opportunities of mutual benefit to both the company and the UN.

All these are already key priorities in Eskom.    Being a signatory to the Global Compacts Women Empowerment principles        Human Rights Implementation     5. Criterion 5: The COP describes robust commitments, strategies or policies in the area  of human rights       Eskom implemented an employment-equity plan supported by a long-term target-setting strategy  (Equity 2020) to drive its transformational agenda for the three financial years leading up to  2012/13. The employment-equity plan seeks to create a workplace and workforce profile that is  diverse and inclusive, and to ensure that diversity becomes the Eskom way.    In November 2010 Eskom participated in the Department of Labours director-general review  process. In February 2012 the department confirmed that Eskom has the necessary transformation  interventions in place and the key indicators show that there has been a generally positive trend in  racial and gender equity representation at every level.      6. Criterion 6: The COP describes effective management systems to integrate the human  rights principles     Eskoms integrated health and wellness programme promotes a safe and healthy working  environment to ensure its employees are healthy, productive, resilient and engaged throughout their  time at Eskom.    Eskom chief executive Mr Brian Dames launched the Road to a Safe and Healthy Lifestyle  campaign as part of expanding the scope to other diseases impacting on the business. The  campaign is a move from our traditional workplace programmes that focused on raising awareness  and prevention of HIV infection and access to treatment care and support. The focus is now on  addressing other disease conditions, as well as workplace related factors that put employees at risk  of ill health.    Eskom as a company is committed to forge strategic partnerships that are aimed at enhancing  effectiveness in the handling of community issues. It is in this respect that Eskom pledged to  support government to achieve its HCT campaign objectives to test 15 million South Africans.    Eskoms HIV counselling and testing campaign has been nominated as a finalist in GBC Healths  Business Action on Health Awards, to be held in New York in May 2012.   11 | P a g e       On 10 – 12 October 2011, the Department of Health in partnership (Collective Action) with Eskom  launched the HCT at Komati power station, Mpumalanga province, where 1 600 workers were  tested.    During March 2012, Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe and Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi  encouraged 5 000 workers at Eskoms Kusile power station in Mpumalanga to test for HIV. An  esimated 77% of Eskom permanent employees now know their  HIV status.       7. Criterion 7: The COP describes effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms of  human rights integration       Human resources sustainability  Human resources (HR) is responsible for measuring and monitoring critical factors relating to the  sustainability of Eskoms human resources. A human resources sustainability index is used to  measure the following key aspects: employee satisfaction, employee competence, and employee  health and wellness. The measurements and criteria are reviewed annually to make sure they stay  applicable.    The HR Sustainability index (HRSI) has also reflected positively in terms of overall HR  performance, achieving a year-to-date HRSI score of 82.4% (2010/11: 88.3%) against target of 80.   The index weighting of fatalities was increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 4.5% in 2012 and the increase  in the turnover of core staff during 2012, influenced the reduction of the total index score.      Training and development costs as a percentage of the wage bill  Eskoms R1 361 million (2010/11: R998 million) investment in training and development is 6.3% of  the wage bill. This puts Eskom well within the 75th percentile of United States utility companies  (which average 3.3%) and United Kingdom/European utility companies (which average 3.5%)  according to a 2010 PriceWaterhouseCoopers report.     Employer of choice  Young engineering professionals rated Eskom the employer of choice out of 60 engineering and  technology companies in South Africa for five years running (Ideal Employer Ranking, Magnet  Survey, 2011).    Overall staff turnover  Eskoms overall staff turnover was 3.7% for the period 2011/12. This places Eskom favourably  below the 25th percentile of South African companies (9.5%).  The average turnover in Eskom has  been 6.2% per annum over the last two decades.  This is beneficial to Eskom as the average cost  of separation and replacing scarce and critical skills ranges from 30% to 100% of an incumbents  annual salary.    Turnover due to retirement  Turnover due to retirements is 1.03%. This places Eskom midway between the 50th percentile  (0.6%) and 75th percentile (1.2%) of South African companies.  Twenty-seven percent of Eskoms  staff are 50 years and above and could be considered a retirement risk within the next decade.      8. Criterion 8: The COP describes key outcomes of human rights integration     Eskoms Academy of Learnings mandate is to close Eskoms competency gap by addressing,  coordinating and integrating all learning needs of employees; as well as enhancing performance  throughout Eskom; by focusing on business needs, and catering for all facets of the learning value  chain and learning operations    12 | P a g e       Highlights  During 2011/2012 the EAL devoted a large proportion of its energy to supporting the SAP  reimplementation project called Back2Basics (B2B) with the rollout of Classroom–based training  and e-learning courses for the B2B processes and systems. More than 1200 Eskom employees  were trained as B2B facilitators and a total of 106 556 course attendees underwent the B2B training  courses.    The EAL did not allow the focus on B2B to subvert it from addressing the normal training demands  of the business and even managed to initiate a number of new training programmes. In March 2012  the EAL, in partnership with Group Technology launched the Welding School of Excellence. Forty  welding apprentices were developed during 2011/12 as part of the pilot programme that preceded  the launch.    The Engineering Centre of Excellence commissioned a state of the art training facility that includes  a power plant steam turbine simulator to train power plant engineers.     A new Government Certificate of Competency Programme was implemented to prepare candidates  to become certified engineers.  In addition, the Engineering Centre of Excellence implemented the  Distribution Clerk of Works training curriculum to improve the quality of workmanship on the  construction of overhead lines.    An ETAPro training programme is being launched to train power station engineers to optimise  Power Station performance.    In January 2012 the Eskom Power Plant Engineering Institute (EPPEI) was launched as a  partnership with South African Universities to:   Increase the number of Power Plant MSC and PhD graduates;   Ensure South African universities participate fully in the localisation of new technologies  currently being offered to Eskom by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs);   Ensure South African universities play an active role in transferring and establishing these  new technologies in the country;   Ensure South African universities are actively involved in solving Eskom specific  engineering problems; and   Leverage the expertise and experience of international universities and utilities    The Project Management Training Centre of Excellence built up relationships with Academic  Institutions for the development and improved professionalism of Project Management staff  through-out Eskom. A Project and Construction Management School will be launched in the next  year to ensure that an adequate pipeline of skills are available for the continued Eskom built  environment.    The EAL, in partnership with Group Customer Services set-out to establish a School of Customer  Services within the Professional Services Centre of Excellence. This School will become fully  operational in the next financial year.

Criterion 9: The COP describes robust commitments, strategies or policies in the area  of labour     Eskoms employee-engagement model builds employee participation and involves employees and  executives in conversations around strategy, performance and people. Eskom has also built more  productive and sustainable relationships with organised labour through a partnering model to guide  these interactions.    Eskom maintains direct lines of communication with recognised trade unions. The wage  negotiations during the year deadlocked, resulting in threats of (illegal) strike action by certain of the  trade unions representing employees in the Eskom bargaining unit.    However, the dispute was resolved by arbitration and a two-year salary and conditions-of-service  agreement was concluded with trade unions.    10. Criterion 10: The COP describes effective management systems to integrate the  labour principles     Some examples are given below:    Remuneration philosophy     Eskoms approach to remuneration and benefits is designed to position the company as a preferred  employer. Eskom aims to attract and retain skilled, high-performing employees. To achieve this,  Eskom has established the following remuneration principles:      Ensure that business requirements determine market positioning. Provide market-related  remuneration structures, benefits and conditions of service.    Maintain external competitiveness to attract and retain key skills.    Ensure internal equity through defensible differentials in pay and benefits.    Remunerate employees in accordance with their job grade and at least at the minimum of  the applicable salary scale    Follow a lead-lag market approach.    Eskoms remuneration structures fall into three categories, set out below.    Bargaining unit  Bargaining-unit employees (all those below middle management) receive a basic salary and  benefits. Major benefits include membership of the pension and provident fund, medical aid and an  annual bonus (13th cheque). Basic salaries and conditions of service are reviewed annually through  a collective bargaining process. Bargaining unit employees also participate in the annual short- incentive scheme.    Managerial level  Managerial-level employees are remunerated on a cost-to-company/package basis. The package  includes pensionable earnings, compulsory benefits and a residual cash component. Managerial  employees also participate in the annual short-term incentive scheme.    Executive remuneration  Executive remuneration links remuneration to the performance of the organisation and the  individuals contribution. Basic salary is augmented by short- and long-term incentives. International  and local benchmarks are considered in determining remuneration. The remuneration strategy is  aligned with the shareholder guidelines.     Non-executive directors: remuneration is paid in accordance with the approval of the shareholder  and consists of a fixed monthly fee. Executives are reimbursed for company-related expenses.    Executive management committee members: the board approves the remuneration of the chief  executive and group executives. The chief executives remuneration is approved by the   14 | P a g e     shareholder. Factors taken into account include level of skill, experience, contribution to  organisational performance and success of the group.    The balance between fixed and variable remuneration and short- and long-term incentives is  reviewed annually.     The chief executive, finance director and group executives have permanent employment contracts  based on Eskoms standard conditions of service.    11. Criterion 11: The COP describes effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms of  labour principles integration     The board committees held the following number of meetings during the year:    Audit and risk committee: five    Investment and finance committee: four    Tender committee: nine    Social ethics and sustainability    committee: five    People and governance committee: four.    Employment equity: Eskom implemented an employment-equity plan supported by a long-term  target-setting strategy (Equity 2020) to drive its transformational agenda for the three financial years  leading up to 2012/13. The employment-equity plan seeks to create a workplace and workforce  profile that is diverse and inclusive, and to ensure that diversity becomes the Eskom way.    In November 2010 Eskom participated in the Department of Labours director-general review  process. In February 2012 the department confirmed that Eskom has the necessary transformation  interventions in place.    12. Criterion 12: The COP describes key outcomes of integration of the labour principles     Industrial action has the potential to cause employee safety incidents through vandalism or  intimidation. Industrial action at Eskoms capacity expansion projects during the year was  addressed through project labour agreements (at Medupi and Kusile) and strong industrial relations  policies (Ingula).    The wage negotiations during the year deadlocked, resulting in threats of (illegal) strike action by  certain of the trade unions representing employees in the Eskom bargaining unit. However, the  dispute was resolved by arbitration and a two-year salary and conditions-of-service agreement was  concluded with trade unions.    Being the custodian of people management within Eskom, Human Resources is mandated to  partner and empower line to recruit, develop, and retain a skilled, committed, engaged and  accountable staff base across Eskom. HR is committed to the building of skills not only internally to  Eskom but also for the communities in which Eskom operates. This is done in support of Eskoms  aspiration and duty to grow the economy and improve the quality of life of people in South Africa  and in the region, as outlined in the New Growth Path.      Operational highlights       Establishment of the Welding School of Excellence and the Eskom Power Plant Engineering  Institute (EPPEI) launched in partnership with South African Universities.

Criterion 13: The COP describes robust commitments, strategies or policies in the area  of environmental stewardship     Zero harm to the environment is entrenched in the Eskom value chain. In 2011/12 there has been  improvement in environmental management compared to previous years performance with relative  particulate emissions, water usage improving and a reduction in the number of legal contraventions.  Several businesses achieved ISO 14001 certification.

Avoid harming the natural environment and so minimise financial and legal liabilities; this will  be achieved through skills development, awareness programmes, achieving ISO 14001  certification, carrying out effective environmental impact assessments and various  improvement programmes  2. Reduce the carbon footprint through  3. Reduce the carbon footprint through efficient energy production and by diversifying the  energy mix  4. Reduce particulate and gaseous emissions to minimise the impact on human health and  comply with regulated emission standards  5. Reduce freshwater usage by using mining water and eliminate liquid effluent discharge to  avoid damaging water resources  6. Reduce, reuse and recycle resources Comply with environmental legislation as a minimum  requirement in all activities  7. Minimise the impact of Eskoms activities on ecosystems and enhance the value added by  natural ecosystems to business by responsible land-management practices.      The material issues and risks covered in this report are those that, in the view of both Eskoms  stakeholders and management, have the potential to significantly affect the companys achievement  of its strategic objectives.    Reducing the carbon footprint and pursuing low-carbon growth  The way in which Eskom generates, transmits and distributes electricity unavoidably has an impact  on the environment. This is particularly true in the case of Kusile and Medupi power stations which,  when complete in 2018, will produce 4 800MW and 4 764MW of extra power, making them some of  the largest coal-fired power stations in the world. Kusile and Medupi, power stations being built in  Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces respectively, have been the target of some protests because  they will be coal-burning facilities. While the protests have not seriously disrupted construction, they  have had a negative reputational effect. Although Kusile and Medupi power stations will increase  the total carbon footprint, the design and technology of these power stations is more efficient  compared with existing coal-fired plants, resulting in a reduction in water usage and carbon dioxide  emitted per unit of electricity generated.    Eskom is aware of its impact on the environment and strives to embed a culture of environmentally  responsible behaviour and decision making across the business. Eskom works hard to ensure that  it operates as a responsible corporate citizen and takes its commitment to environmental  responsibility seriously.    The Eskom/Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) strategic partnership is in place to avoid or mitigate  wildlife interaction with electrical infrastructure. The partnership continues to ensure that Eskom  reduces its impact on biodiversity.      Water scarcity  Eskoms power stations depend on a steady, adequate supply of water of a certain quality.  Competing resource needs, drought in catchment areas, pollution and poor water supply  infrastructure all have the potential to hinder Eskoms access to affordable water.    Involvement in COP 17  Eskom and the South African government demonstrated their commitment to reducing carbon  emissions at the COP 17 conference in November and December 2011. Government policy is  already in place to determine national carbon budgets to curb South Africas emissions.     18 | P a g e     Eskom is working with the government to determine what carbon savings are possible from its side  and what resources will be needed to achieve them.     Renewable-energy projects and independent power producers   Eskom is finalising plans for a wind farm at Sere, due for completion in December 2013, and a pilot  concentrating solar thermal power plant near Upington, due to start construction in December 2015.  Together, these will add 200MW of power to the grid when completed.    Eskom is in the process of installing solar panels at 13 coal-fired power stations, four peaking  stations and Megawatt Park to supplement auxiliary electricity consumption. The installations at  Kendal and Lethabo power stations have been completed, and the remaining 15 sites will be  operational in 2013.    Eskom actively supported the Department of Energy in finalising the request for proposals and  power-purchase agreement for the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer (IPP)  programme, formally launched in August 2011. The request for proposals calls for 3 725MW of  renewable energy technologies to be in commercial operation between mid-2014 and the end of  2016. Proposals have been received from 28 preferred bidders so far, with the combined potential  to provide 1 416MW of power. Eskom is working with government to connect successful IPPs to the  grid.    Carbon tax discussions  The National Treasury plans to introduce a carbon tax in 2013/14. Eskom has participated in  discussions with the Treasury to identify ways to enhance the effectiveness of the tax and limit any  unintended consequences for electricity tariffs and the economy.    Gaseous emissions, water pollution and other environmental issues  Gaseous emissions have increased marginally across the fleet of power stations. The existing fleet  does not have technology to reduce gaseous emissions. However Kusile will be commissioned with  flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) and plans are in place to retrofit Medupi during the first general  overhaul. FGD will remove at least 90% of sulphur emissions. Both power stations will be  commissioned with technology to reduce nitrogen oxides. They will also have the most efficient  fabric filter technology in Eskoms fleet of power stations, for the removal of particulate emissions.    In future Eskom will not only report on these emissions, but targets will be determined once Medupi  and Kusile power stations are online and abatement technologies are retrofitted to existing power  stations. Lessons learnt from past environmental legal contraventions were shared with employees  and contractors, contributing to a significant decrease in the number of environmental  contraventions, from 634 in 2010/11 to 50 in 2011/12.    Eskom formed a task team during the reporting period to reduce particulate emissions and is  implementing improvement plans.    A technical plan to eliminate liquid effluent discharge by recycling polluted water for reuse by power  plants was developed and projects are under way to improve the water use performance at several  power stations. Projects have been initiated to investigate the use of mine water and reduce the  reliance on fresh water in the longer term. While Eskom does not utilise groundwater, its activities  have the potential to result in groundwater pollution. Monitoring programmes are in place to detect  potential pollution and mitigation measures implemented if pollution is detected.    A programme to achieve ISO 14001 certification progressed well this year with several power  stations and construction sites achieving certification for the first time.    Compact fluorescent lamp programme                                                    4 One environmental legal contravention was registered in March 2011 and, following an  investigation, was reclassified as an event. This has resulted in the reported number of environmental  legal contraventions for 2010/11 changing from 64 to 63.   19 | P a g e     Eskom has distributed more than 47 million compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) throughout South  Africa since the inception of the CFL programme in December 2003.    Engagement with civil society  Eskom facilitated a number of meetings with environmental NGOs in the period under review. In  particular, a technical workshop was held to share information on Eskoms water strategy and  provide an opportunity for NGOs to present their water-related initiatives and views on water  management.      Environmental contraventions  Due to the constrained system, there is less opportunity to maintain pollution control technology at  power stations. This gives rise to an increased risk of environmental contraventions. Eskom plants  could at some stage incur heavy penalties or even lose their operating licences and may have to be  decommissioned if there is not an appropriate intervention. This would have a negative effect on  Eskoms ability to keep the lights on and on Eskoms reputation, which in turn would influence its  ability to raise funding and secure land, servitude and permits for future power stations – all of  which would impact its long-term ability to keep the lights on.    Accordingly, Eskom is committed to addressing its environmental impacts. The company is  executing a technical plan to eliminate liquid effluent discharges by recycling polluted water for  reuse. Groundwater is also monitored for pollution and recommended mitigations are implemented.  In addition, in terms of the impact on air quality, Eskom formed a task team during the reporting  period to improve particulate emissions performance and is implementing improvement plans.       14. Criterion 14: The COP describes effective management systems to integrate the  environmental principles     Progress has been made towards achieving Eskoms set objective of achieving certification to the  ISO 14001 environmental management system standard by March 2014. During this reporting  period certification was awarded to the major build projects Medupi, Kusile and Ingula as well as the  power delivery projects (construction of transmission power lines) and the Group Capital head  office. In addition, certification was achieved at nine operational coal-fired power stations, Koeberg  nuclear power station and the peaking power stations.      Table 1: Eskoms environmental indicators      Footnotes:   20 | P a g e     1.  Calculated figures based on coal characteristics and the power station design parameters. Sulphur dioxide and  carbon dioxide emissions are based on coal analysis and using coal burnt tonnages. Figures include coal-fired  and gas turbine power stations, as well as oil consumed during power station start-ups and, for carbon dioxide  emissions, the underground coal gasification pilot.  2.  Eskoms continued aspiration is for zero environmental violations. Targets have been set in the business plan to  achieve this.  3.  One environmental legal contravention was registered in March 2011 and, following an investigation, was  reclassified as an event. This has resulted in the reported number of environmental legal contraventions for  2010/11 changing from 64 to 63.      15. Criterion 15: The COP describes effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for  environmental stewardship     The board and its committees guide the strategy and set performance targets for Eskoms broad  approach to corporate citizenship. This includes the following:      A social, ethics and sustainability committee that focuses on sustainability and corporate  citizenship.      A tender committee that ensures that transformation, including skills development and  empowerment, is encouraged through Eskoms procurement activities.      An executive management committee assesses occupational health, safety and  environmental performance and reviews major incidents to ensure that corrective action is  taken.    Compliance    Through focused attention to the Eskom drive to achieve zero environmental incidents,  environmental legal contraventions have reduced from last year, with the majority of contraventions  still related to emissions and water-management challenges on site.    There were 50 environmental legal violations during the current year, down from 63 1 in 2010/11.  There were two project specific activities that commenced before receiving the required  environmental authorisation, resulting in administrative fines of R1.1 million (2011: R0.4 million).    An analysis of environmental legal contraventions over the past 11 years shows that legal  contraventions related to water (40%), atmospheric emissions (18%) and authorisations/records of  decision (19%) account for about 80% of Eskoms environmental contraventions. Water-related  contraventions, in most cases, are a result of unauthorised releases of water from power stations.  The contamination of water with silt or sewage has been the most common incident at construction  sites. Air-quality legal contraventions relate to exceeding the particulate matter limits as specified in  the air emissions licences.       Relative particulate emissions  Relative particulate emissions improved from 0.33 kg/MWhSO in 2010/11 to 0.31 kg/MWhSO in  2011/12, but the target of 0.30 kg/MWhSO was still not achieved.    A particulate emissions recovery team, chaired by the executive director of Generation, was formed  to facilitate implementing solutions for improving emissions performance. Unfortunately, the  implementation of the recommendations of the recovery team has been hampered by system  constraints. Outages needed for repairs and maintenance are frequently postponed, sometimes by  many months. In addition, reducing production of electricity in order to reduce particulate emissions  is not always possible, given the high demand for electricity. At some stations, particularly Tutuka  and Matla, particulate emissions have been made worse by episodes of poor or variable coal  quality.     21 | P a g e     Nevertheless, several stations – including Matimba, Majuba, Arnot, Hendrina and Camden – have  achieved consistent particulate emissions performance in 2011/12.    Eskom aims to reduce particulate and gaseous emissions to minimise the impact on human health  and comply with regulated emission standards. The future key performance indicator targets  progressively reduce to 0.21kg/MWh by 2017.    Ambient air quality monitoring    Extensive regional air quality monitoring has been undertaken since the late 1970's and has formed  part of Eskom's ambient air quality management programme. This extensive ambient air quality  network provides key information for future strategic planning processes, compliance with  standards and as a guide for research activities.     Monitoring is currently undertaken at 14 ambient air quality monitoring sites measuring a range of  pollutants including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, fine particulate matter, and ozone amongst  others. Meteorological parameters like wind direction, wind speed, wind velocity and temperature  are also monitored. Although these sites are influenced by many sources, the majority are located  strategically to monitor the level of pollutants at ground level resulting from power station emissions.  The sites are therefore located close to power stations, in residential areas and some in remote  areas (to measure regional air quality) – depending on the specific objectives of each site.    Ambient air quality is impacted by emissions from a number of sources, including Eskom, and the  combined results from all these sources are reflected in the concentrations measured by the  network. Our monitoring equipment is calibrated against National Meteorological Laboratory  standards in a laboratory accredited by the South African National Accreditation System.      16. Criterion 16: The COP describes key outcomes of integration of the environmental  principles     Zero harm to the environment is entrenched in the Eskom value chain. In 2011/12 there has been  improvement in environmental management compared to previous years performance with relative  particulate emissions, water usage improving and a reduction in the number of legal contraventions.  Several businesses achieved ISO 14001 certification.    Operational highlights    Installed gaseous-emission monitoring systems on one unit of each coal-fired power station  to improve Generations monitoring capability    Improved particulate emissions from 0.33 kilograms per megawatt hours sent out  (kg/MWhSO) in 2010/11 to 0.31 kg/MWhSO in 2011/12.

Water usage    Eskom aims to reduce freshwater usage and eliminate liquid effluent discharge. This is achieved  through effective water management processes, water conservation and water-demand practices,  and the treatment and potential use of mine water. The future key performance indicator targets  progressively reduce to 1.20 L/kWh by 2017.    Eskom continued to facilitate meetings with environmental NGOs. In particular, a technical  workshop was held to share information on Eskoms water strategy and to provide an opportunity  for NGOs to present their water-related initiatives and views on water management.    The total Eskom water usage (all power stations, including return to service stations (RTS)) was  319 772ML (2011: 327 252ML). Improved water-management systems contributed to reducing  water from 1.35 litres per kilowatt hour (L/kWh sent out) in 2010/11 to 1.34 L/kWh sent out  (2011/12). The best performing power stations are obviously the dry-cooled stations, Matimba,  Kendal and Majuba, (3 of the 6 units) and Koeberg (sea water cooled).    Listed below is a table of water sources affected by withdrawal of water for Eskoms power stations.

Eskom has set out to meet the water-quality objectives in different catchment areas; manage the  impact of future water price increases; actively influence policy, planning, legislation and regulation;  and work with stakeholders to develop solutions. The water conservation and demand management   24 | P a g e     strategy is intended to meet some of the requirements of new and existing power stations by  reducing fresh-water intake and reusing effluent water.     During the financial year , Eskom submitted inputs into the Energy Chapter of the National Water  Resources Strategy 2 Draft to the Department of Water Affairs in order to secure Eskoms current  and future water supplies for power generation and related needs.     Further comments will be provided during the consultation process leading up to the gazetting of  the National Water Resources Strategy for public comments. At Eskoms request, the Department  of Water Affairs is investigating potential infrastructure bottlenecks in the Vaal River water supply  system. Eskom has also worked closely with the Department of Water Affairs to address the  backlog of water use licence applications for its power stations, capacity expansion projects and  coal suppliers.     The main water-supply infrastructure projects under way that affect Eskom operations are:    The Mokolo and Crocodile Water Augmentation Project (MCWAP) Phase 1, which will  provide sufficient capacity for Medupis water requirements and associated developments,  excluding the planned flue gas desulphurisation process. In the interim, there is adequate  water from Matimba power stations water allocation to support Medupis first three units.  The first phase of the MCWAP is on track to be completed by September 2013.    The Komati Water Scheme Augmentation Project will provide water for Kusile power station  and the return to service of Komati power station. The project is on track to be completed by  December 2012.    The CEO Water Mandate    United National Global Compacts CEO Water Mandate is a unique public-private initiative designed  to assist companies in the development, implementation and disclosure of water sustainability  policies and practices. As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, Eskom endorses the CEO Water  Mandate and pledged its commitment to the principles and annually reports on progress in  supporting and promoting compliance with the principles. Eskom is committed to, and reliant on,  water as a primary input and, therefore, has a vested interest in securing control over water sources  and services.    Biodiversity    The 2011–2020 United Nations Decade on Biodiversity (UNDB) was launched in December 2011,  the ultimate target being to ensure that by 2020 all the people of the world will be aware of  biodiversity and its value. Such awareness in Eskom was increased this year when leadership  endorsed the Biodiversity Policy and Standard which affirms that Eskom shall ensure that in the  planning, construction, operation and decommissioning of its activities mitigation measures are in  place to limit the impact of its infrastructure, land-use and other resource uses on biodiversity and  shall comply with all applicable legislation.    Complementary strategic partnerships are also mechanisms that Eskom supports to achieve the  sustainability priority of Zero environmental incidents. The long standing Eskom-Endangered  Wildlife Trust (EWT) partnership focuses on the management and monitoring of wildlife interactions.  Detailed information on wildlife interactions statistics and management fact sheet can be found at  www.eskom.co.za/IR2012/048.html.     The Ingula Partnership with conservation Non-Government  Organisations (NGOs), BirdLife South Africa and Middelpunt Wetlands Trust, has proved invaluable  towards the conservation of a very important biome ensuring the protection of the critically  endangered White-winged Flufftail, Southern Bald ibis, other endangered species and the habitat in  which they exist. The Ingula Partnership has also resulted in Eskom leadership endorsing research  funding to the Birdlife International Species Champion Programme, whereby Eskom will fulfil the  Species Champion role for both the White-winged Flufftail and the Southern Bald Ibis. This initiative  promotes the overall protection and conservation of these two bird species.   25 | P a g e       Environmental expenditure  In 2011/12, R0.6 billion was allocated to environmental capital projects (2010/11: R0.3 billion) and  R0.9 billion to environmental operational projects (2010/11: R1.1 billion).    The majority of capital expenditure can be attributed to air quality related projects, as well as other  capacity expenditure related to the capacity expansion programme. Similarly, the operational  expenditure can also be attributed to the capital expansion programme, as well as specific  expenditure related to air quality, water management, water treatment and rehabilitation associated  with coal mines.      Anti-Corruption Implementation       17. Criterion 17: The COP describes robust commitments, strategies or policies in the  area of anti-corruption     Eskoms corporate governance focuses on effective ethical leadership to integrate strategy,  governance and sustainability. Eskom takes its strategic direction from its board of directors.    The executive management committee is responsible for putting decisions made at board level into  effect and overseeing the companys day-to-day operations.    18. Criterion 18: The COP describes effective management systems to integrate the anti- corruption principle     Ethical business conduct: Eskoms board is accountable for the groups ethics-management  programme, which is run on an operational level by the executive management committee, assisted  by the ethics office. The programme includes the following:      Assessing the organisational risks and opportunities       Fostering ethical standards in the form of a code of ethics, conflict of interest policy,  including business courtesies and private work      Raising awareness regarding ethics (training, reporting, advices)       The ethics helpdesk and whistleblowing hotline.      Quarterly ethics status reports are used to monitor the progress of this programme.    Eskom is also a signatory to the UN Global Compact, which includes an anticorruption clause, as  well as the World Economic Forums Partnership Against Corruption Initiative.    19. Criterion 19: The COP describes effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for  the integration of anti-corruption     Internal control: The board is responsible for ensuring that internal controls at all levels are effective  and has approved the implementation of an integrated framework to systematically evaluate and  improve controls across the company.     The internal audit department reviews internal control systems and reports its findings to  management and the audit and risk committee. The audit and risk committee monitors and  evaluates the responsibilities of management and of internal and external audit to ensure that all  major issues reported have been satisfactorily resolved. It reports any unresolved important matters  to the board.   26 | P a g e         20. Criterion 20: The COP describes key outcomes of integration of the anti-corruption  principle     The assurance and forensic department provides independent and objective assurance, consulting  and investigative services to improve the organisations operations. The department has  unrestricted access to all functions, records, property and personnel. The general manager – audit  and forensics attends executive management committee meetings.    Eskoms internal forensic capacity will be strengthened through a partnership with the Special  Investigating Unit (SIU). A proclamation by the President in the current year formalised the SIUs  mandate following an agreement in February 2011.    Value Chain Implementation     21. Criterion 21: The COP describes implementation of the Global Compact principles in  the value chain       Eskoms spending programmes support the governments economic objectives, including local  development, the competitive supplier-development programme, job creation and encouraging the  growth of small businesses. During the reporting period, total investment spend in plant by suppliers  was R646 million (2011: R608 million). Improvements to the supplier development and localisation  functions have better aligned Eskom to deliver on government policy requirements.    The supplier development and localisation function supports the governments socio-economic  development objectives, including Broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE), by  maximising local supplier development in a manner that supports Eskoms business plan. The main  achievement in the period under review is the organisational adoption of a consistent new tender  evaluation criteria that places emphasis on both BEE equity holding and local jobs and skills  development and the board adoption of the Competitive Supplier Development Plan 2 to drive  Eskoms contribution towards national industrialisation for the next five years.      Transparency and Verification     22. Criterion 22: The COP provides information on the company's profile and context of  operation     Eskom is South Africas primary electricity supplier. The company, which is wholly owned by the  South African government, generates, transmits and distributes electricity to industrial, mining,  commercial, agricultural and residential customers, and to municipalities, which in turn redistribute  electricity to businesses and households.    Figure 1: Eskoms value chain   27 | P a g e         Eskom sells electricity directly to about 3 000 industrial customers, 1 000 mining customers, 50 000  commercial customers and 84 000 agricultural customers. It also supplies electricity to more than  4.7 million residential customers – many of whom are in rural areas – who account for about 40% of  all residential customers in the country.     Eskom in Africa  While most of Eskoms business is within South Africa, the company also buys and sells electricity  in the SADC region. Eskoms involvement in African markets beyond South Africa is currently  limited to projects that have a direct impact on ensuring a secure supply of electricity for South  Africa itself. Eskom is investigating additional opportunities in the SADC region.    Eskom Enterprises SOC Ltd has two subsidiaries, Rotek Industries SOC Ltd and Roshcon SOC  Ltd, with an interest in electricity operations and maintenance concessions in Mali, Senegal,  Mauritania and Uganda.     28 | P a g e       Figure 2: Eskom line, service and strategic functions                                    Eskom has its head office in Johannesburg, with satellite operations across South Africa. It  maintains a small office in London, primarily for quality control of the equipment being manufactured  for the capital expansion programme. Eskom has several subsidiaries:      The Eskom Enterprises group provides life-cycle support and plant maintenance, network  protection and support for the capital expansion programme for all Eskom Holdings SOC  Limited divisions.       Escap SOC Limited, Eskoms wholly owned captive insurance company, manages and  insures Eskoms business risk.      Eskom Finance Company SOC Limited grants home loans to Eskom employees.      The Eskom Development Foundation NPC is a wholly owned non-profit company that  manages Eskoms corporate social investment.       Values and strategic objectives  The companys operations are underpinned by six values:     zero harm    integrity    innovation    sinobuntu (caring)  Eskoms new structure  Eskom has restructured its divisions as follows:    Line functions operate the business and focus on creating value    Service functions safeguard Eskoms assets, provide expertise on day-to-day standardised  services and optimise functions that cut across all aspects of the business    Strategic staff functions develop the enterprise, bringing about step changes in  performance and providing broader strategic support to the group.    The office of the chief executive, which incorporates the delivery unit and the assurance and  forensic department, has been expanded.       29 | P a g e       customer satisfaction    excellence     In September 2011 the Eskom Board, informed by an extensive strategic review process, approved  a six-year corporate plan that identified eight strategic objectives (identified in the figure below as  the three building blocks and the five numbered blocks).     Figure 3: Eskoms purpose, values and strategic objectives            23. Criterion 23: The COP incorporates high standards of transparency and disclosure     Eskom has combined sustainability and financial reporting for a number of years, but this is the first  integrated report that aligns with the principles contained in discussion papers published by the  International Integrated Report Committee and the Integrated Reporting Committee of South Africa.      Integrated reporting is a new international initiative that has emerged in response to the  shortcomings of traditional reporting, which emphasises financial results without taking account of  the broader context in which companies operate, and fails to weave together different reporting  strands. Integrated reporting allows for reporting on financial results, governance, sustainability and  other material factors in an interdependent manner. It addresses the challenges that companies  face, the advantages they enjoy, the external factors that influence them and the way they in turn  influence the external environment.    To support this new approach to reporting, Eskom formed an integrated reporting steering  committee to ensure alignment with other reporting processes. This demonstrates that the  management of the business and internal reporting is closely aligned to the requirement for the  year-end integrated report Eskom has applied the principles of inclusivity, materiality and   30 | P a g e     responsiveness in compiling this report. These principles ensure that the company incorporates the  views of its stakeholders, as well as internal planning reporting and risk-management processes.    Eskom has declared a B+ report in terms of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The list of relevant  GRI indicators is available online at: www.eskom.co.za/IR2012/      Eskom wins top sustainability award  Eskoms Integrated Report 2011 was recognised and awarded 2nd place in the Ernst and Young:   Sustainability Reporting Awards event for 2011 held at the Johannesburg Securities Exchange on  19 October 2011. The winner in the 1st place was the Bidvest Group and Anglo Gold Ashanti took  the 3rd place. This follows the award for excellent Corporate Reporting received by Eskom on 12  September 2011, also from Ernst and Young of which Eskom was one of only 10 companies  regarded as Excellent.    This award distinguishes Eskom as an organisation committed to sustainable development by  integrating the financial aspects of its business with open disclosure of sustainability challenges,  progress and prioritising Zero Harm for people and the environment.      24. Criterion 24: The COP is independently verified by a credible third-party    The information contained in this communication on progress is based on Eskoms 2012 Integrated  Report and Divisional Report.  Eskom has applied the principles of inclusivity, materiality and  responsiveness in compiling those reports. These principles ensure that the company incorporates  the views of its stakeholders, as well as internal planning reporting and risk-management  processes.       Eskom has declared a B+ report in terms of the 2012 Integrated Report and Divisional Report in  terms of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The list of relevant GRI indicators is available online  at (www.eskom.co.za/ir2012/). KPMG has provided assurance on selected sustainability  information in the 2012 Integrated Report and Divisional Report, from which this communication on  progress is made.  Eskom follows a combined assurance approach.        UNITED NATIONS CARING FOR CLIMATE REPORTING    As a signatory to the United Nation Caring for Climate we commit to communicate on an annual  basis on progress made in implementing the five areas of commitments as outlined in the Caring for  Climate Statement as set out below:    1. Taking further practical actions to improve continuously the  efficiency of energy usage and to reduce the carbon footprint of our  products, services and processes, to set voluntary targets for doing  so, and to report publicly and annually on the achievement of those  targets in our Communication on Progress-Climate.    Reductions in energy demand achieved:     Eskom runs several demand-reduction programmes to encourage industrial customers,  municipalities and households to reduce their energy consumption. This makes more capacity  available on the electricity supply system, creating opportunities for maintenance work and reducing  the likelihood of load-shedding in the future. These programmes include:     Power buy-back agreements with industrial customers.   31 | P a g e       The Energy Conservation Scheme, which sets energy allocations for the countrys 500  largest electricity users. This voluntary scheme may become mandatory in future. To date  96 of Eskoms 135 key industrial customers (using 100GWh per year) have signed up.     Residential power-reduction initiatives (installing low-flow shower heads, LED lights, pool  timers, geyser blankets and subsidising solar water-heating systems).    The Power Alert system, broadcast on television between the hours of 5pm and 9pm,  indicates the status of the load on the grid and urges viewers to turn off non-essential  appliances in times of excessively high demand.    The 49M campaign, which aims to encourage energy-efficient attitudes and habits in all  consumers, particularly residential users.    Since 2004, when demand-side management projects were initiated and measured, the demand  savings in the evening peak (18:00 to 20:00) have risen in line with the growing requirement for  demand reduction.     The accumulated verified demand savings for the combined financial years 2005 to 2012, is  3 064 MW. A single power stations generator unit contributes about 600 MW to the national grid.  Therefore demand-side management has freed up more than five generators (a typical power  station has six) in the past four years.     The total evening peak demand savings achieved for the 2011/12 period was 347 MW  (2011: 354.1 MW) against the Eskom target of 313 MW.

Large customers have responded favourably in terms of the demand  market participation and already contribute to the stability of the national power system by reducing  load through power buy-back agreements and demand-side management initiatives.    Eskoms demand market participation programme is to be extended to small industrial and  commercial undertakings through a programme called demand response aggregation. This  programme will be piloted for customers consuming more than 500MW.    The proposed Energy Conservation Scheme, if passed into law, will see energy-reduction targets  being set for the countrys 500 largest electricity users and charges imposed for non-compliance.  Eskom has already implemented a voluntary energy conservation scheme and is engaging with the  South African Local Government Association and municipalities to help their customers implement  energy-conservation measures.    Power Buy-Back initiative  As part of the efforts to create the necessary space to perform essential and critical generation  plant maintenance, Eskom has entered into power buy back agreements with certain of its large  industrial customers. The power buy back period is typically for 30 days or longer with all current  agreements terminating by 31 May 2012. The requirement is that customers reduce their base load  demand and this reduction is purchased by Eskom at a rate negotiated with customers. The rate  takes into account the customers fixed costs, contractual obligations and various other  requirements including the requirement of no permanent job losses.     This initiative has proved to be beneficial in creating the additional space on the power system  through base load demand reduction. During this power buy back period, lower than usual  commodity prices and surplus stock levels would have had a significant negative impact on the  economy, jobs and our customers business operations.  Eskom believes that through the power                                                    5  This includes the 1.4MW of internal energy efficiency demand savings.   33 | P a g e     buy back scheme, customers are in a slightly more favourable position than they would have  otherwise been in creating a win-win situation for both parties.    Residential initiatives  A residential mass rollout programme has recently been approved to make households more  efficient by installing low-flow shower heads, LED lamps, pool timers and geyser blankets.     There has been a significant increase in solar water-heating system installations, with 158 175  claims (27 149 for high-pressure systems and 131 026 for low-pressure systems) received during  the financial year.     Eskoms Power Alert and 5pm to 9pm evening campaigns aim to reduce power demand during the  evening peak. The total evening peak demand savings achieved are:         Eskom initiatives  Eskom aims to improve the energy efficiency of plants and offices by conducting energy audits and  undertaking efficiency programmes that focus on lighting, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning.  The demand savings of 1.4MW RA achieved in 2011/12 translates to energy savings of 45.0GWh RA  (2011: 26.2GWh RA) for the year, against a target of 25.5GWh.      Energy Losses Management  Energy losses reflect the difference between the quantity of energy sent out from the power stations  and the quantity sold to the various customers at the end of the value chain.     There are two broad categories of energy losses:    Technical energy losses naturally occur when electrical energy is transferred from one point to  another. The medium through which electrical energy is transferred imposes a resistance to the  flow and some of the energy is dissipated as heat.    Non-technical energy losses can be calculated as the difference between total energy losses  and technical losses. They are typically caused by theft (illegal connections, meter tampering),  errors in data and billing, among others.  In 2011/12, total Distribution energy losses were 6.32%RA, of which non-technical losses are  estimated to be between 1.90% and 4.42%. Compared to other utilities globally, Eskom continues  to perform well on energy loss management. Distribution has participated in a 2007 benchmarking  study, conducted by an independent international consulting group, mainly with South American  utilities. The 2007 benchmarking parameters for total distribution losses were 5.60% to 12.07%.  Eskom is currently in the first quartile of the top performing distribution utilities.     Even though Eskom compares favourably with other utilities, energy losses management remains a  key focus area for the utility. Eskom will therefore continue to research and implement loss  reduction initiatives.      34 | P a g e                   Energy losses  Target   2011/12  Actual  2011/12   GWh  Actual  2010/11   GWh  Actual  2009/10   GWh    Total Eskom energy flow    254 300  253 084  246 705    Total distribution network energy  flow1    226 424  224 328  218 663    Actual loss – distribution    14 312  12 734  12 839    Actual loss – transmission    7 686  8 157  8 009    Total actual loss    21 998  20 891  20 848    NERSA MYPD allowance    22 533  22 535  21 131    Energy loss (%) (12MMA)      %              %     %     %    Total distribution loss   6.07  6.32  5.68RA  5.87    Total transmission loss  3.40  3.08  3.27RA  3.27    Total Eskom loss  8.75  8.65  8.25     8.45   RA – Reasonable assurance provided by the independent assurance provider  1. Inclusive of energy flows to key customers.    The performance as at end of March 2012 shows an increase in the distribution losses (6.32%) and  a decrease in the transmission losses (3.08%) when compared to the performance at the end of  March 2011. The actual Eskom total losses results achieved (8.65%) are within the target energy  losses (8.75%) allowed by the regulator. Energy Losses Management Programme activities will be  intensified going forward to drive the losses downwards.    For internal evaluation purposes the estimated technical losses range between 60% and 75% of  total losses in Distribution, while 100% is estimated for the Transmission networks. The actual  percentage in Distribution is influenced by factors such as network design, network topology, load  distribution on the network and network operations.      Operation Khanyisa  The energy losses management programme has stabilised distribution energy losses at around 6%  through audits and corrective measures, conducting energy-balancing of ring-fenced areas,  implementing tested technologies and a public awareness campaign called Operation Khanyisa.    Operation Khanyisa, launched in October 2010, promotes legal power usage in South Africa.  Although the focus of the campaign is electricity theft, it integrates related issues such as safety,  non-payment, energy efficiency and infrastructure theft.    The theme of the campaign is sustainability for economic growth. Electricity theft contributes to  power outages, rising prices, the slowing down of the economy, job losses and fatalities and injuries  due to electrocutions. It also affects governments universal access programme.    The core partners of Operation Khanyisa are Proudly South African, Business Against Crime,  Business Unity South Africa, the South African Local Government Association and Primedia Crime  Line. The campaign is currently active only in Eskom areas of supply, but the intention is to expand  into areas serviced by municipalities, hence the partnership with the South African Local  Government Association.      35 | P a g e     Operation Khanyisa is now in full operation and the South African citizens continue to heed the call  to report electricity theft and illegal electricity sales.    Thermal energy-efficiency programme    Eskoms planned thermal energy-efficiency programme aims to increase generation efficiency by at  least 150MW by the end of 2015. This will equate to about 400kt less coal being used across all  coal-fired power stations per year, which translates to a reduction of 1.5Mt of carbon-dioxide  emissions a year.    Energy savings for the year under review, based on steps taken at 10 coal-fired stations, amounted  to between 31MW and 35MW.     Monthly heat-rate trends – that is, coal energy in megajoules (MJ) consumed per electric energy  produced (in kWh) – at the pilot at Majuba power station showed that the station was able to  perform better than the agreed 11.3MJ/kWh target for eight months of the year. The thermal  energy-efficiency programme was extended to another five coal-fired stations, yielding positive  results. The full energy-efficiency programme will be rolled out to the remaining coal-fired stations  during 2012/13.          Figure 8: Demand-side management demand savings (cumulative)              2. Building significant capacity within our organizations to understand  fully the implications of climate change for our business and to  develop a coherent business strategy for minimizing risks and  identifying opportunities.    One key material issue Eskom faces is reducing the environmental footprint and pursuing low- carbon growth.  This is based on the view of both Eskoms stakeholders and management and the  potential to significantly affect the companys achievement of its strategic objectives.   36 | P a g e       The way in which Eskom generates, transmits and distributes electricity unavoidably has an impact  on the environment. This is particularly true in the case of Kusile and Medupi power stations which,  when complete in 2019, will produce 4 800MW and 4 764MW of extra power, making them some of  the largest coal-fired power stations in the world. Kusile and Medupi, power stations being built in  Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces respectively, have been the target of some protests because  they will be coal-burning facilities. While the protests have not seriously disrupted construction, they  have had a negative reputational effect. While Kusile and Medupi power stations will increase the  total carbon footprint, the design and technology of these power stations is more efficient compared  with existing coal-fired plants, resulting in a reduction in the water use and carbon dioxide per unit  of electricity generated.    Eskom has a comprehensive climate change strategy which is based on six pillars:    1. Diversification of the generation mix to lower carbon emitting technologies  2. Energy efficiency measures to reduce demand and greenhouse gas and other emissions  3. Adaptation to the negative impacts of climate change  4. Innovation through research, demonstration and development  5. Investment through carbon market mechanisms  6. Progress through advocacy, partnerships and collaboration.    Eskoms aspiration is to pursue a more diverse energy mix with the objective of reducing the utilitys  relative emissions until 2025 and subsequently reducing absolute emissions. Eskom continuously  models electricity options for achieving the conflicting goals of affordability and protection of the  environment in the most optimum manner. In doing this work Eskom recognises that there is no  single technology option that is the panacea for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Eskom is  therefore committed to the principle of an assessment of all options for reducing its emissions.    Renewable energy plays an important role in meeting Eskoms diversification aspirations. Eskoms  Renewables Unit has been set up to focus on large power-generation technologies, namely wind,  photovoltaic and concentrating solar power. This will play an extremely important role in reducing  both the relative (emissions intensity) and absolute emissions.    Government policy on renewable energy    South Africas white paper on renewable energy policy (2004) sets out governments principles,  goals and objectives for renewable energy. It also commits government to a number of enabling  actions to ensure that renewable energy becomes a significant part of its energy portfolio.    South Africa is in a strong position to harness vast renewable energy resources. The country has  an average solar radiation of about 2 500kWh per square metre per year and large areas along the  coast have average wind speeds of more than six metres per second.    Governments target is to contribute 10 000GWh of renewable energy to final energy consumption  by 2013, produced mainly from biomass, wind, solar and small-scale hydro.    A large portion of the Integrated Resource Plan has been allocated to renewables and a renewable- energy purchase programme has been introduced (IPP procurement programme).     37 | P a g e           This year a photovoltaic installation was erected at Lethabo Power Station as part of Eskoms  commitment to renewable energy    Eskoms renewable-energy projects    Sere wind farm    Construction of 100MW wind farm in Western Cape    50 turbines of 2MW each    Commissioning in 2013    ~220 000 tons of carbon saved per year (based on 0.9 tons of carbon per MWh).    Concentrating solar power pilot plant  Eskom is researching the possibility of a 4km2 100MW concentrating solar thermal power  station in the Northern Cape by building a 100MW plant near Upington.     The assessment focuses on environmental eligibility, technical feasibility and commercial  competitiveness     450 000 tons of carbon saved per year    Vital to Eskoms carbon footprint reduction/low-carbon growth strategy.    Photovoltaic installations at power stations    Installation of two photovoltaic pilot plants at Eskom sites    Initial installation of one hectare per site adding 1.2MW of capacity    Photovoltaic produces zero emissions during operation and does not need water    Photovoltaic is a well-established, safe technology that can be installed quickly at plant site.    Ocean energy  In 2002, Eskom completed a study that concluded that South Africa has a sufficient ocean resource  to explore this renewable-energy option. A techno-economic study and technology evaluation are  being performed to assess ocean energy conversion technologies to determine which should be  researched further for possible application in South Africa.    Biomass  Biomass is a renewable-energy source derived from biological material from living or recently living  organisms. It is plant based material used directly or converted into other energy products such as  torrefied pellets (moisture removed), biofuel and so on.    As part of Eskoms biomass research programme, a System Johannsen Gasifier was constructed  and installed at a rural sawmill in Melalani in the Eastern Cape in conjunction with the University of  Fort Hare. It uses wood and other biomass as a fuel source to produce a virtually tar-free gas,  which powers an electricity generator.    Eskom is also evaluating other biomass options, such as the use of municipal solid waste as a  feedstock for power generation. Municipal solid waste not only represents a continuous source of   38 | P a g e     energy that can be harnessed for generation, but its use will also significantly decrease the burden  on landfill sites and processing facilities.    To reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from its coal-fired power stations, Eskom is exploring the co- firing of biomass fuel. It aims to co-fire biomass to replace 10% of coal usage by weight in coal-fired  power stations by 2026. To achieve this goal, a project within Eskoms primary energy division is  sourcing suitable biomass within South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.    The project is divided into phases, namely:    1. Co-firing technology selection – selecting technology between separate milling and co- milling of biomass with coal, and between co-firing white biomass pellets and torrefied  biomass pellets (also known as black pellets). Test burns will be conducted at Arnot and  Kriel power stations to determine the most suitable technology and biomass fuel. Primary  Energy is sourcing the biomass fuel for the test burns and an order has been placed for 2  000 tons of torrefied biomass pellets.    2. Biomass fuel sourcing – sourcing biomass fuel for sustainable application. A contract has  been placed with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to conduct a biomass  fuel supply study. The study addresses the availability of biomass fuel in South Africa and  neighbouring countries, including transport, beneficiation, quality, environment      Water    Eskoms water strategy addresses the risks of water scarcity, security and pollution, and the impact  of climate change. The strategys goals are to:    Ensure long-term water planning    Develop and implement conservation strategies    Meet the water requirements of new and existing power stations    Meet the water-quality objectives of the various catchment areas    Efficiently manage water costs Influence policy, strategy, planning, legislative and regulatory  issues related to water    Work with stakeholders on water challenges and solutions    Offer water management assurance, advisory service and support.    Eskoms water supply strategy addresses key risks of water scarcity, water security, pollution of  water resources, and climate change impacts.    Eskom has set out to meet the water-quality objectives in different catchment areas; manage the  impact of future water price increases; actively influence policy, planning, legislation and regulation;  and work with stakeholders to develop solutions. The water conservation and demand management  strategy is intended to meet some of the requirements of new and existing power stations by  reducing fresh-water intake and reusing effluent water.     During the financial year, Eskom submitted inputs into the Energy Chapter of the National Water  Resources Strategy 2 Draft to the Department of Water Affairs in order to secure Eskoms current  and future water supplies for power generation and related needs.    Further comments will be provided during the consultation process leading up to the gazetting of  the National Water Resources Strategy for public comments. At Eskoms request, the Department  of Water Affairs is investigating potential infrastructure bottlenecks in the Vaal River water supply  system. Eskom has also worked closely with the Department of Water Affairs to address the  backlog of water use licence applications for its power stations, capital expansion projects and coal  suppliers.       39 | P a g e     3. Engaging more actively with our own national governments, inter- governmental organizations and civil society to develop policies  and measures to provide an enabling framework for business to  contribute effectively to building a low-carbon and climate-resilient  economy.    Eskom facilitated a number of meetings with environmental NGOs in the period under review. In  particular, a technical workshop was held to share information on Eskoms water strategy and  provide an opportunity for NGOs to present their water-related initiatives and views on water  management.    The United Nations Global Compact and Rio+20    Rio+20 will take place in June 2012 to secure renewed political commitment for sustainable  development, assess progress to date and the remaining gaps in the implementation of the  outcomes of major summits on sustainable development, and address new and emerging  challenges.    Eskoms desired outcomes from Rio+20 include clear action plans for energy access and  electrification, obtaining financing for energy access, energy-efficiency and renewable-energy  initiatives. Eskom will participate in Rio+20 through its continued engagement in United Nations  activities, including the Global Compact LEAD, Caring for Climate, CEO Water Mandate and  Sustainable Energy For All. Eskom will engage and support government and liaise with international  business through Business Action for Sustainable Development.    4. Continuing to work collaboratively with other enterprises both  nationally and sectorally, and along our value-chains, to set  standards and take joint initiatives aimed at reducing climate risks,  assisting with adaptation to climate change and enhancing climate- related opportunities.    Corporate Affairs successfully managed the COP17 communications and stakeholder management  programme, which showcased Eskoms commitment to climate change, renewable energy and  energy efficiency.     A robust internal communication programme included employees committing to changing their  personal behaviour towards climate change and an art competition for employees children, which  educated hundreds of children about climate change, energy efficiency and renewable energy.    Eskom participated in various debates, and increased its voice in the media in the run-up to and  during COP17. During the event, reporting on renewable energy created favourable coverage and  input by Eskom amounted to 16% of total commentary. An interactive exhibition by Eskom and 49M  was well received by the public and delegates at COP17.    Corporate Affairs supported Eskoms involvement in the COP17 conference by running campaigns  to promote renewable energy in the run-up to the conference (the Green Line television  programme,  featuring  Eskoms  good-news  stories  and  energy-saving  tips  –  see  www.thegreenlinetv.com  for more information) and providing support during the conference itself.      The Department of Environmental Affairs issued a white paper on the national climate change  response in November 2011. This document outlines a process, to be concluded within a two-year  period, for developing (in consultation) sectoral and company carbon budgets that align with South  Africas pledge at Copenhagen.   40 | P a g e         The National Treasury continues to engage stakeholders on its carbon tax proposal and a revised  policy/proposal is expected to be published in the near future. Eskom and the National Treasury  have discussed ways to enhance the effectiveness and limit the unintended negative consequences  that such a tax could have on electricity tariff increases and the economy.    Eskom manages the national CFL clean development mechanism project within the terms of the  emissions reduction purchase agreement signed with BNP Paribas in September 2010.        Climate change and renewable energy    Eskom has an active research programme investigating South Africas renewable energy sources  for power generation. Until now, Eskoms history of renewable power generation has focused  mainly on hydro power, complemented by an additional push to reduce demand through energy  efficiency.         Figure 1: Research investment areas    Some large-scale renewable-energy projects are under way. Eskom is also retrofitting existing  facilities with renewable energy sources to ensure energy efficiency and reduce relative carbon  emissions.     41 | P a g e       5. Becoming an active business champion for rapid and extensive  climate action, working with our peers, employees, customers,  investors and the broader public.        The Global Electricity Utilities Initiative    Eskom successfully spearheaded an initiative called The Global Electricity Utilities Initiative (GEI).  This initiative saw us bring 25 global utilities together to work towards a common purpose to reduce  emissions, develop cleaner technologies and promote the introduction of renewables to embed  global best practice. Eskoms involvement and leadership was positively received. The report  shows that significant progress has been made in developed and developing countries in creating  sustainable solutions towards clean electricity through progressive decarbonisation of the energy  mix, more efficiency throughout the electricity value chain and the promotion of the more efficient  end use of electricity. GEI utilities have also made substantial progress in increasing stakeholder  engagement, investing in climate change-related projects, conducting research and development  into new and advanced technologies and investing in adaptation measures.      COP 17    Eskom was integrally involved in assisting South Africa in hosting an excellent Conference of the  Parties in Durban in December 2011. The country outlined its aspiration to move towards a low  carbon future and to prepare South Africa for the impacts of climate change. Eskom demonstrated  its holistic approach to climate change by discussing both mitigation and adaptation strategies From  a domestic policy and regulation point of view, the Department of Environmental Affairs issued a  White paper on the National Climate Change Response in November 2011. This document outlines  a process, to be concluded within a two year period, for developing (in consultation) sectoral (and  even company) carbon budgets that align with South Africas pledge at Copenhagen.    National Treasury have also continued to engage stakeholders on their carbon tax proposal and a  revised policy/proposal is expected to be published later this year. Eskom has engaged with  National Treasury in order to identify ways to enhance the effectiveness and limit the unintended  negative consequences that such a tax could have on electricity tariff increases and the South  African economy. These engagements have included discussions on how the Integrated Resource  Plan internalises the cost of carbon through capping carbon dioxide emissions in a certain  timeframe and the pursuit of a lower carbon emitting electricity mix.    Power generation from renewable-energy sources was a focus at COP17. The Minister of Energy  announced that 28 successful IPPs will contribute about 1 400MW of solar and wind power, to the  national grid. Eskom continues to catalyse private-sector participation in the electricity market  beyond the conference. The Minister of Public Enterprises, also officially launched Eskoms Sere  wind project at a COP17 function. The aim is to commission Sere in 2013 to add 100MW of green  power to the grid.    The COP created enhanced awareness among South Africans of energy and climate change  issues. Eskom is determined to use this momentum to continue to communicate on its efforts to  meet both the mitigation and adaptation challenges and especially to further entrench energy  efficiency messages.    Eskom will continue to pursue renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. This includes a  proposed photovoltaic expansion – 2MW at Megawatt Park by end 2012 and rollout of renewables  at power stations. Eskom will build supportive and cooperative relationships with local municipalities  to speedily address incidents and emergencies and ensure security of supply.     42 | P a g e     South Africa is not legally bound to reduce emissions, but will be expected to discuss enforced  reductions from 2020. The government has put in place a process to determine carbon budgets to  curb the countrys emissions. Eskom is engaging the government on the carbon budget based on  the 2010 Integrated Resource Plan, including discussions about what is possible and where  additional resources are required.    The outcome of COP 17 presents many opportunities. Eskom can:    Submit robust investment plans to the government to access funding from the Green  Climate Fund when it becomes available    Provide input to the technology mechanism, which is intended to support mitigation and  adaptation to climate change, based on Eskoms experience in innovation, research and  development, through the Department of Science and Technology    Provide input to the development of the national adaptation plan through the Department of  Environmental Affairs and Department of Energy     Access additional sources of revenue for new technologies and energy-efficiency  programmes through the carbon markets.    Eskom will use the momentum from COP 17 to further entrench its energy efficiency messages and  discuss the effort and resources required to diversify the electricity mix.      Renewable-energy projects and independent power producers    Eskom is finalising plans for a wind farm at Sere, due for completion in December 2013, and a  concentrating solar thermal power pilot plant near Upington, due to start construction in December  2015. Together, these will add 200MW of power to the grid when completed.    Eskom is in the process of installing solar panels at 13 coal-fired power stations and four peaking  stations to supplement their auxiliary electricity consumption. The installations at Kendal and  Lethabo power stations have been completed, and the remaining 15 sites will be operational in  2013.     Eskom actively supported the Department of Energy in finalising the request for proposals and  power-purchase agreement for the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer (IPP)  programme, formally launched in August 2011. The request for proposals calls for 3 725MW of  renewable-energy technologies to be in commercial operation between mid-2014 and the end of  2016. Proposals have been received from 28 preferred bidders, with the combined potential to  provide 1 416MW of power. Eskom is examining the cost of connecting these IPPs to the existing  grid.    Carbon tax discussions    The National Treasury plans to introduce a carbon tax in 2013/14. Eskom has participated in  discussions with the Treasury to identify ways to enhance the effectiveness of the tax and limit any  unintended consequences for electricity tariffs and the economy.            THE CEO WATER MANDATE REPORT 2011/12    As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, Eskom endorses the CEO Water Mandate and pledge its  commitment to the principles and annually report on progress in supporting and promoting  compliance with the principles. Eskom is committed to, and reliant on, water as a primary input to  electricity production and, therefore, has a vested interest in securing and managing water  resources and services.     43 | P a g e       1. Direct Operations  Conducting comprehensive water-use assessment to understand the extent to which the company  uses water in the direct production of goods and services    Water management reviews were conducted and action plans agreed with the power  stations to address the gapsWater use license audits were conducted at power stations and  action plans agreed with the power stations to address the findings.    Blue and Green Drop assessments were conducted at power stations in compliance with the  Water Services Act to ensure highest standard of water and sanitation provision to  neighbouring towns and communities.  Setting targets for our operations related to water conservation and waste-water treatment, framed  in a corporate cleaner production and consumption strategy.     Annual water targets were  set for all power stations and the water use performance was  measured, monitored and report on a monthly basis     Eskom achieved the Water Use Performance Target set for Financial Year 2011/12    The Water Accounting Framework was implemented across all power stations to  monitor and account for water usage in a more detailed and frequent manner  Raising awareness of water sustainability within corporate culture    Progress Report of Eskoms Water Strategy, was presented to the Board    Eskoms Water Management Policy was revised and widely consulted with a key focus  on Corporate Water Stewardship    As part of Eskoms Water Conservation and Water Demand Management Programme,  communication and awareness campaigns were launched to make employees aware of  water issues facing South Africa and Eskom    Eskoms Water Conservation and Water Demand Management Programme was initiated  with a number of desktop studies concluded and projects in pre-feasibility stage    2. Supply Chain and Watershed Management   Encouraging suppliers to improve their water conservation, quality monitoring, waste-water  treatment, and recycling practices.    Major environmental and water related risks for all Eskoms coal suppliers were  monitored and addressed.     Eskom maintains strict compliance to its Environmental Requirements for Coal  Contracting Purposes Procedure.     Progress was made in the implementation of the Defunct Mines Liability Management  Plans  Encouraging and facilitating suppliers in conducting assessments of water usage and impacts.    Eskoms Cost-plus mines quantified their environmental closure liabilities, with attention  to liabilities associated with water management aspects    Address catchment and national water challenges through water stewardship and collective action.    An Environmental Requirements for Coal Contracting Purposes Procedure has been  developed and implemented to ensure that all coal mines supplying Eskom meet the  necessary environmental and water legislative requirements.      Two water supply agreements were concluded between Eskom and the Department of  Water Affairs for the construction of water augmentation schemes to supply Eskoms  power stations and associated developments. The projects under construction are   44 | P a g e     theMokolo Crocodile Water Augmentation Project Phase 1 and the Komati Water  Scheme Augmentation Project    Eskom has worked closely with the Department of Water Affairs to ensure water use  licences for its power stations, projects and coal suppliers are expedited and awarded.     A high level study into the potential for mine water resources and re-use in the Olifants  Catchment was initiated as part of the Joint Initiative Agreement between Eskom and the  major coal mines. Two major mine water reclamation projects were identified and in the  pre-feasibility stage.     3. Collective Action  Building closer ties with civil society organizations, especially at the regional and local levels    Eskom has convened workshops with environmental NGOs to address concerns and  issues of mutual benefit including water. Eskom had preliminary discussions with  environmental NGOs on potential collaborative efforts to address catchment  management challenges and risks.  Working with national, regional and local governments and public authorities to address water  sustainability issues and policies, as well as with relevant international institutions    Eskom entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Water Research Commission  on water and waste related research and development. A list of priority areas were  identified for joint research.    Eskom through its Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Water Affairs  is implementing its Water Conservation and Water Demand Management programme to  reduce its freshwater footprint through various studies, projects and awareness  campaigns.    Eskom through the Joint Initiative Agreement with its coal suppliers has initiated a  number of studies and projects to utilize mine water as an alternative to freshwater use  for industries, power generation, mining and municipalities.     Eskom together with Business and Industry has made good progress in the  establishment of the Industry Water Task Team of South Africa to coordinate business  efforts to shared water risks and challenges    Eskom joined the South African Strategic Water Partners Network formed by the  Department of Water Affairs and the Water Resources Group to develop public-private  support structures in the water sector. Eskom is leading the Effluent Partnerships  Working Group.    Eskom has partnered with the Mpumalanga Provincial Government to assist with water  related challenges and identify opportunities for water supply to communities. Studies  are underway to investigate water supply options to communities adjacent to Eskoms  operations in Mpumalanga    Eskom continues to be a member of the Water Sector Leadership Group which is the  highest multi-stakeholder forum that promotes dialogue, collaboration and partnership in  the Water Sector. Eskom has participated in a number of national task teams such as  the National Water Resources Task Team, the Institutional Re-alignment Task Team  and the Water Conservation and Water Demand Management Task Team.    4.

Eskoms power grid  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 06 Highlights of 2011/12 September 2011 Sustainability award Eskoms 2010/11 Integrated Report won second place in  the Ernst & Young Sustainability Reporting Awards. Eskom  also received an Ernst & Young award for excellent  corporate reporting in September 2011. Consumer  awareness Eskoms Power  Alert system,  which uses  television to inform the  public about the load on the  electricity grid, contributed to  the saving of 261MW during  evening peaks in  2011/12.   Four million   homes  electrified   The 4.2 million  households  mark was reached in the  electrification programme,  since 1991. No load shedding   Despite supply-demand  challenges, Eskom  continued to avoid load  shedding in 2011/12,   as it has since April 2008. For the year March 2011 49M campaign launched Eskom initiated the 49M campaign, which calls for a  partnership with all South Africans to keep the lights on   by calling on them to use energy efficiently. October 2011 Preparations for independent system and market  operator started The System and Market Operator division, operating under  the Eskom board, was established on 1 October 2011. This  is the first step towards establishing an independent system  and market operator (ISMO), a separate state-owned  company.  JSE Spire Awards 2011 Eskom Holdings awarded Best  Issuer This award goes to the issuer that is most committed to  transparency, as demonstrated by regular and consistent  sharing of information with investors and other market  participants. It has clearly shown innovation and  responsiveness to market conditions and investor needs. All  market participants must feel they can trade the borrowers  debt with confidence. With South Africa experiencing energy challenges and 2012 poised to be an especially dif cult year, we hereby invite you to partner in saving  electricity and achieving an energy ef cient South Africa. Luckily, the new user-friendly Power Alert programme has been developed to enable  you to do just that. Already a familiar presence on your TV screens (SABC, eTV and now extended to DStv: Mnet, Action, Series, Supersport, VUZU, Kyknet  and Mzansi Magic), the Power Alert system is a critical source of real time information about what is happening on the national grid on any  particular night throughout the seasons.  Late afternoon to mid-evening between 5pm and 9pm is the period of peak electricity demand in South Africa. People arrive home from work  and start their evening routines by taking a bath and switching on everything; the lights, climate control systems, televisions, microwave ovens,  stoves, dishwashers and tumble dryers. Working quietly out of sight are the two hungriest appliances in the home; the hot water geyser and  the swimming pool pump. These two notorious energy-guzzlers add greatly to the huge demand for electricity during the big evening switch-on  and should be used sparingly.  The Power Alert message boards will use colour-coded messages to clearly communicate the electricity status as well as remind you of the  steps to take whenever a message appears on your TV. So be Power Alert and remember to switch off, this includes every member of the family – mom, dad, the children, grandma and grandpa.  Together let us keep SA powered up. For more information and regular updates go to www.poweralert.co.za GREEN - A green Power Alert message with full electricity status bars, means  electricity usage is stable but increasing. Please switch off lights in unoccupied rooms. ORANGE - An orange Power Alert message with only three full electricity status  bars means electricity usage is increasing rapidly. Please switch off lights, the geyser  as well as the swimming pool pump. RED - A red Power Alert message with just one full electricity status bar  warns that electricity usage is too high. Please switch off lights, the geyser,  the swimming pool pump and all non-essential appliances.  BLACK - A black Power Alert message means the situation is critical as demand exceeds supply. Switch off everything, except the TV and one light.

Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 08 About this report Determining materiality in  partnership with our stakeholders This report focuses on qualitative and  quantitative issues arising in 2011/12 that  are material to Eskoms business operations  and strategic objectives. The question   of what is material has been determined  in extensive consultation with the  companys stakeholders, while taking into  consideration its core objectives and the  way in which its value chain operates.  Eskoms stakeholders include employees  and  unions;  the  government  and  Parliament;lenders, analysts and investors;  customers  and  regulators;  industry  experts,academics and the media; business  groups, civil society and non-governmental  organisations (NGOs); and suppliers  and contractors (see the stakeholder  engagement matrix on page 152.)  The report includes information about  Eskoms shareholder compact and its  summarised financial statements. The  statutory annual financial statements and a  more detailed divisional performance  report,  are  available  online  at   www.eskom.co.za/IR2012/001.html. An integrated report Eskom has combined sustainability and  financial reporting for a number of years,  but this is the first integrated report   that aligns with the principles contained   in discussion papers published by   the International Integrated Report  Council and the Integrated Reporting  Committee of South Africa. Integrated  reporting is a new international initiative  that has emerged in response to the  shortcomings of traditional reporting,  which emphasises financial results without  taking account of the broader context in  which companies operate, and fails to  weave together different reporting strands.  Integrated reporting allows for reporting  on  financial  results,  governance,  sustainability and other material factors in  an interdependent manner. It addresses  the challenges that companies face, the  advantages they enjoy, the external factors  that influence them and the way they in  turn influence the external environment.  To support this new approach to reporting,  Eskom formed an integrated reporting  steering committee1 to ensure alignment  with other reporting processes. This  demonstrates that the management of the  business and internal reporting is closely  aligned to the requirement for the year- end integrated report. Eskoms 2011/12 annual report is an integrated report that  sets out an in-depth, contextual review of the companys  overall performance for the year 1 April 2011 to   31 March 2012. It outlines business operations as they stand  now, reviews challenges the company has faced over the past  year and how it has overcome them or plans to do so, and  presents Eskoms assessment of the period ahead. 1.  The steering committee is a subcommittee of Eskoms executive management committee, and is  responsible for the co-ordination of the integrated report for Eskom Holdings SOC Limited. Eskoms material issues discussed  09 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Eskom has applied Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI) principles in compiling this  report. These principles ensure that the  company incorporates the views of its  stakeholders, as well as internal planning  reporting and risk-management processes.  Eskom has declared a B+ application level in  terms of the GRI.  Refer to the assurance  providers report on page 157 which  confirms this declaration. The list of relevant  GRI indicators is available online at:  www.eskom.co.za/IR2012/002.html.  KPMG has provided assurance on selected  sustainability information in this report  (see page 157). Eskom follows a combined  assurance approach (refer to page 33 for  more details). Eskoms reports are also prepared with  due consideration of the King Report on  Corporate Governance (King III). Refer  to www.eskom.co.za/IR2012/003.html for  more information on King III. Structure of the report This new global reporting platform takes  cognisance of the need to present  information succinctly. Consequently, this  report is structured in a concise and  accessible manner:  1.  Leadership overview sets out Eskoms  view of the environment in which it  operates, the central achievements of  the reporting period, priorities for the  year ahead, strategic objectives and  long-term challenges for the business.  The integrated reporting pilot programme Eskom is a member of the International Integrated Reporting Councils pilot  programme (http://www.theiirc.org/). All annual reports published by the more  than 60 programme members worldwide in the period October 2011 to  September 2012 (including this report) will be reviewed and analysed for their  strengths and weaknesses. Lessons learnt during this cycle will contribute to a global  standard for integrated reporting.

We are a state- owned company and our performance is  also measured by the overall value we  add to the lives of the public. Our  developmental responsibilities range from  building and maintaining power plants and  networks, to supplying households, schools  and factories with electricity, supporting  local industries, and stimulating skills and  job creation.  Our mandate, as outlined by the  Department of Public Enterprises, to  which we are accountable, is to provide  sustainable electricity solutions to grow the  economy and improve the quality of life of  the people of South Africa and the region.  We  are  working  to  reduce  our  environmental footprint, diversify our  energy mix and lower carbon emissions, as  endorsed by President Jacob Zuma at  At a time when global economic  uncertainty is forcing many companies to  curtail operations and limit growth, Eskom  is hard at work on one of the largest  capital expansion programmes in South  Africas  history. This  R340  billion  programme,  which commenced in 2005,  will have added 17GW of much-needed  electricity-generating capacity to the  national grid by 2018/19. Eskom faces several challenges during the  transition to increased generating capacity.  The first new generating unit – unit 6 at  Medupi power station in Limpopo – is  expected to come online in 2013. Until  then, the supply/demand balance will  remain tight. If we want to ensure a stable  power system, all of us – households and  businesses – will have to reduce demand  and use energy efficiently. To keepthe lights  on, Eskom counts on the support of all  South Africans. Our mandate is to provide sustainable electricity solutions  to grow the economy and improve the quality of life of the  people of South Africa and the region.

In addition to  reducing our carbon emissions in a manner  consistent with South Africas economic  growth objectives, we are also committed  to planning for the impact of climate  change.  In the months ahead, several critical policy  decisions need to be taken that will shape  the future of the electricity industry. The  government has adopted the Integrated  Resource Plan 2010, which represents a  major step forward in identifying South  Africas energy options. Urgent decisions  are required concerning how the plan will  be implemented, how it will be funded and  what role Eskom, as the countrys primary  electricity utility, will play. Delays in key  decisions can have negative consequences  for the planning of capital expenditure,  construction and engineering.  In 2013 we will be celebrating our 90th  anniversary. For nine decades, Eskom has  been adding quality to the lives of South  Africans and enabling the countrys  economic growth. My colleagues on the  board and I are privileged to be given the  opportunity to build on these excellent  foundations. With our very capable  executive management committee, under  the direction of Brian Dames, I am  confident that our leadership team is  prepared for the year ahead.  Eskoms progress equates to that of  SouthAfricas advancement. In this regard,  Eskoms success is crucial.

Eskom has been a leader in  integrated reporting for a number of years.  This report is the first in a new, more  focused  format,  in  response  to  new international initiatives that are  leading the way towards improved  reporting. We welcome your comments  and suggestions on both the content and  the format of this report.  The global challenges of energy  supply South Africa is not alone, particularly  among developing countries, in facing the  challenges of energy supply. Around the  world, electricity utilities are grappling with  how to provide energy to growing  populations and economies in a safe and  sustainable way. Doing so requires long- term planning that takes into account the  complex interplay of economic growth,  demographic shifts, a finite supply of  primary energy resources (and countries  specific allocation of those resources),  transmission requirements, protection of  the environment, and cost recovery.  In Eskoms case, these challenges are  underlined by the companys develop- mental mandate. Providing reliable and  affordable electricity is not only a  commercial undertaking; it is also about  creating a foundation on which South  An integrated view of our  business At all major turning points in the life of an  economy, companies face a difficult choice:  how to meet present demand while  ensuring that they are investing to  safeguard the future.  As this integrated report shows, Eskom is  achieving this balance. We are keeping the  lights on and we are building the power  stations and transmission infrastructure  needed to power South African businesses  and households well into the 21st century.  Doing so has not been easy and, as this  report describes, the road ahead is strewn  with obstacles. But we are confident that  we are setting the utility up for success;  that our organisation is becoming financially  sustainable; and that as a result of initiatives  now under way, we will in time become  the high-performance organisation that  South Africa needs to grow its economy  and create jobs.  Our goal is to provide South Africa with  secure, affordable, accessible and cleaner  power in the decades to come. This report  charts our progress along this path. It sets  out, in a concise manner, the range of  material concerns affecting our business.  Beyond our financial bottom line, it  addresses  issues  of  governance,  remuneration, risk and sustainability, and  We kept South Africas lights on, as we have now done  consistently since April 2008. This achievement is the result  of a focused approach by Eskom to managing the challenge  of a tight power system, as well as expanded partnerships  with businesses and households that aim to manage demand  and raise awareness of the need to use electricity more  efficiently.  Report of the chief executive Eskoms material issues discussed  15 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Africa can grow, helping to transform the  lives of the large percentage of the  population that lives in poverty.  As a state-owned company, Eskom is an  enabler of the governments vision and a  supporter of economic growth in our  country and the southern African region.  Eskom buys and sells electricity in the  countries of the Southern African  Development Community (SADC). Eskom  is investigating additional opportunities in  SADC that have a direct impact on  ensuring a secure supply of electricity for  South Africa.   Over the past year, the global economy  registered  a  weaker-than-expected  performance, marked by slow growth in  most developed countries. These trends  have been partially offset by strong growth  in leading emerging markets – particularly  China – which has helped to keep  commodity prices at high levels. Slower  growth in South Africa has softened  electricity demand and, while this is  certainly not a desirable outcome for the  economy, it has coincided with a period of  constrained electricity supply, reducing  demand on an overloaded system. As  economic growth gathers pace in the  period ahead, and mines and factories  increase their output, the margin between  electricity supply and demand will narrow  to uncomfortable levels.  The only solution to this dilemma is  to build generating capacity while  encouraging  energy  efficiency  and  managing demand – and this is just what  we are doing. Eskoms capacity expansion  programme is fully under way, with   5.8GW of the planned 17GW already  commissioned. At the same time, we are  working with the national government and  municipalities, businesses and households  to increase energy efficiency, and to raise  Chief executive Brian Dames The system average  interruption frequency  index improved to   23.73 from 25.31 in the  previous year The maintenance backlog  decreased to 26 as at   31 March 2012 from 36 as   at 31 March 2011  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 16 First and foremost, we kept South Africas  lights on, as we have now done  consistently since April 2008. This  achievement is the result of a focused  approach by Eskom to manage the  challenge of a tight power system, as well  as expanded partnerships with businesses  and households that aim to manage  demand and raise awareness of the need  to use electricity more efficiently. At the  same time, we reached a milestone in the  electrification programme: more than   4.2 million additional households have  been provided with electricity since the  programme began in 1991. We took major steps forward in our  capital expansion programme. Minister  Gigaba launched the construction of the  first boiler at Kusile power station in  Mpumalanga, which is due to start  generating power from the end of 2014,  and we are on track for Medupi power  station to deliver first power to the grid in  2013. We completed the return to service  of the Grootvlei power station, along with  three units at Komati power station. We  commissioned a new 2 000 megavolt  ampere (MVA), 765/400 kilovolt (kV)  transformer at Perseus substation as part  of the strengthening of the transmission  system to the Western Cape. The capital  expansion programme met its key  performance targets during the period,  considerably exceeding the targets for the  amount of generation and transmission  capacity commissioned. Significant progress has been made  towards securing water supplies for  Medupi power station in Limpopo  province, and for Komati and Kusile power  stations in Mpumalanga. awareness of the need to manage demand  so that we can keep the lights on.  The business case for sustainability is  getting stronger and we are committed to  embedding sustainability into our business  culture and operations. We remain  committed to supporting the UN Global  Compact, including the associated LEAD  initiative – which aims to improve  sustainability performance – as well as the  CEO Water Mandate1 and Caring for  Climate. The UN has declared 2012 the  international year of sustainable energy for  all. The UN secretary-general launched  theSustainable Energy for All initiative in  September 2011 and I am personally  involved in the high-level advisory group  for this project.   Eskom has extensive, on-going stakeholder  engagements across the whole spectrum  of Eskoms stakeholders, ranging from  Government departments (including the  Department  of  Public  Enterprises,  Department of Energy, Department of  Water Affairs and National Treasury) local  government and trade unions. In addition,  Eskom has regular interactions with Eskom  customer groupings, including the quarterly  State of the System briefings, meetings  with industry forums, community groups,  etc. Refer to page 152 for more details of  these interactions. 2011/12 accomplishments  Shortly after I became chief executive in  the autumn of 2010, we conducted a  strategic review of Eskoms operations.  During 2011/12, with the support of our  shareholder, we have started to deliver on  the strategic initiatives we put in place to  improve our long-term performance.

We  expect construction of the Sere renewable- energy wind project in the Western Cape  to begin during 2012. We installed solar  panels at Kendal and Lethabo power  stations to supplement auxiliary power  consumption at these stations – the start  of a programme that will be rolled out  across our fleet of coal-fired stations. We  have improved performances regarding  relative particulate emissions, water usage  and contraventions of legislation, compared  to 2010/11. We have expanded our social investment  commitments, including taking respon- sibility for the way operations affect the  environment and promoting the objectives  of the governments New Growth Path.  Eskom believes its social responsibility goes  beyond allocating funds to development  projects  through  corporate  social  investment. It is also about incorporating  an ethic of social responsibility into its  business model, taking into account the  ways its decisions will affect all its  stakeholders.  Eskom is building its human capital and  contributing to the national skills base.   A significant number of engineering/ technical learners received training over  the past five years. In 2011/12, 5 715  (2010/11: 4 240) learners with three- to  four-year learning/bursary contracts were  in the pipeline, with a focus on engineers,  technologists, technicians and artisans. This  number will increase to 6 100 learners in  2015/16. We also train existing staff on a  continuing basis.  These accomplishments notwithstanding,  Eskom faces some tough challenges that  must be addressed in the year ahead and  beyond.  We took steps to strengthen financial  sustainability, earning a surplus which will  be re-invested to fund capital expansion  over the next six years and to reduce debt.  Group net profit for the year to 31 March  2012  was  R13.2 billion  (2010/11:  R8.4 billion). The 25.8% tariff increase  (including the environmental levy) granted  by NERSA during 2011 contributed to a  24.8% increase in revenue per kWh  compared with the previous financial year.  This was offset by a 25.9% increase in  operating costs, mainly as a result of  increases in primary energy costs (including  the environmental levy). Given our  improved financial health and operational  performance and the support of our  shareholder, we asked NERSA to reduce  the electricity tariff increase granted for the  year beginning 1April 2012 from 25.9% to  16%. Eskom maintains healthy cash reserves  and funding progress remains positive. By  31March 2012, Eskom had secured more  than 77% of the funding required for the  capital expansion programme. We registered some progress in improving  the efficiency of our operations. We  completed the first phase of our  Back2Basics programme in October 2011,  rolling out an enhanced single-instance  SAP system on schedule and within  budget. The Back2Basics programme is  an internal performance-improvement  initiative aimed at standardising, simplifying  and optimising our processes and systems.  We also launched the Eskom Leadership  Institute to build and strengthen leadership  capacity and to intensify the development  outcomes of leadership assessments.  We strengthened our commitments to  environmental protection and mitigating  the effects of climate change. Eskom  supported the government in hosting the   Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 18 Operational challenges facing our  business Safety Safety is a business imperative. Power  plants and transmission and distribution  infrastructure must be run in a way that  protects surrounding communities and  ensures that our employees are safe   and healthy. During the year we   recorded a total of 13 Eskom fatalities and  12 contractor fatalities. This is not  acceptable. Strong action is being taken to  enforce our principles of zero harm and  zero tolerance for unsafe practices. Our  thoughts and prayers go to the families,  friends and colleagues of the employees  and contractors who died in the line of  duty over the past year.

The  existing generation maintenance plan and  system outlook underline the constraints  on the system, with growing risks for  plant and environmental performance  andsafety. The deterioration in generating  performance over the past several years is  the result of delayed maintenance and  burning of poor-quality coal. During the  reporting period, these conditions were  complicated in the summer months by  high temperatures that affected the  operation of dry-cooled power stations  and inconsistent imports of electricity  from Mozambiques Cahora Bassa facility.  There was some deterioration in the  energy availability factor performance – a  measure of a plants availability to provide  electricity.  All the power plant units need maintenance  at some stage or another – while the  backlog of 36 deferred outages as of  March 2011 was reduced, during the  reporting  period  other  scheduled  maintenance outages had to be deferred.  As a result, the backlog as at 31 March  2012 is 26 outages.  Report of the chief executive continued  19 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Eskom requires about 3 000MW of  generating capacity in reserve to take  generating units off-line to perform  essential maintenance. Continuing to  reduce the maintenance backlog while  keeping the lights on requires other supply- and-demand levers to help maintain the  generating capacity reserve. We have  developed a plan to address the short- term supply/demand dilemma. We also  launched the 49M campaign to encourage  South Africans to embrace energy savings  as a national culture and reduce the  countrys electricity use by 10%. A  mandatory national energy conservation  scheme needs to be put in place and  maintained until December 2013 as a  safety net to ensure a stable system. Keeping the build programme on track  and ensuring long-term capacity The Medupi project is not progressing as  quickly as we had originally planned, mainly  because of delays on the boiler contract.  We announced during the year that the  first unit would come online only during  2013.    The government has not yet announced  how its Integrated Resource Plan will be  implemented. Until these decisions are  taken, the country has no new capacity  commitments beyond the completion of  Kusile in 2018/19. Eskom continues to  develop a resource plan to cater for the  anticipated technologies.  Pricing for a sustainable electricity  industry During 2012 Eskom will submit a  proposalto NERSA for the third multi-year  price determination (MYPD 3) which will  be effective from 1 April 2013. NERSAs  Employee and contractor safety remains   a major concern  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 20 decision in this matter will set an electricity  pricing framework for the next period.  An appropriate tariff structure that  allows for cost recovery, including return  on assets, is necessary to encourage  investment in the electricity industry over  the long term. This will ensure that South  Africa has the energy infrastructure that  itneeds – and that the country can afford  it. Tariffs need to be set at levels that are  sustainable, by allowing an appropriate  migration to cost-reflective tariffs while  taking into account the impact on the  economy with provision made to ensure  that low-income households are able to  obtain electricity in a sustainable manner.  Vending system The online vending system, through which  more than 4.2 million customers buy  prepaid electricity, failed on several  occasions during the period November  2011 to February 2012. Eskom regrets the  inconvenience experienced by some  customers during the system failures. The  system is now operational and ongoing  fine-tuning is improving its reliability.  Coal supply Long-term coal supply remains a concern.  Even though 80% of our requirements up  to 2018 are secured, we need a framework  to balance the development of South  Africas coal-export industry with the need  for a secure supply of coal for domestic  power generation over the life of the  power stations. 2012/13 outlook1 Over the year ahead, we will focus on five  critical areas:    Improving safety   Keeping the lights on 1.

Board committees exercise their delegated  authority in accordance with board- approved policies. Each board committee  comprises a majority of independent non- executive directors and each is chaired by  an independent non-executive director.  The board delegates management of day- to-day operations to the chief executive.  The chief executive is assisted by the  executive management committee and its  subcommittees.

Changes in executive management  committee composition in 2011/12   Thava Govender became acting chief  officer – Generation business in  September 2010; he attended Exco  meetings, but was not a member. In April  2011 he became a member of Exco.  33 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Ethical business conduct Eskoms board is accountable for the  groups ethics-management programme,  which is run on an operational level by the  executive  management  committee,  assisted by the ethics office. The  programme includes the following:   Assessing the organisational risks and  opportunities   Fostering ethical standards in the form  of a code of ethics, conflict of interest  policy, including business courtesies and  private work   Raising awareness regarding ethics  (training, reporting, advices)   The ethics helpdesk and whistleblowing  hotline.  Quarterly ethics status reports are used to  monitor the progress of this programme.  Eskom is also a signatory to the UN Global  Compact, which includes an anti- corruption clause, as well as the World  Economic Forums Partnership Against  Corruption Initiative. Internal control The board is responsible for ensuring that  internal controls at all levels are effective  and has approved the implementation of  an integrated framework to systematically  evaluate and improve controls across  thecompany. The internal audit department reviews  internal control systems and reports its  findings to management and the audit and  risk committee. The audit and risk  committee monitors and evaluates the  responsibilities of management and of  internal and external audit to ensure that  all major issues reported have been  satisfactorily resolved. It reports any  unresolved important matters to the  board. Combined assurance  In line with King III, Eskom is applying a  combined assurance model to ensure  coordinated assurance activities. The board  audit and risk committee oversees  assurance activities. The committee also  oversees the establishment of effective  systems of internal control to provide  reasonable assurance that Eskoms financial  and non-financial objectives are achieved. The assurance and forensic department  provides independent and objective  assurance, consulting and investigative  services to improve the organisations  operations.  The  department  has  unrestricted access to all functions, records,  property and personnel. The general  manager – audit and forensics attends  executive  management  committee  meetings.  Eskoms internal forensic capacity will be  strengthened through a partnership with  the Special Investigating Unit (SIU).

External auditors independently audit  and report on the financial statements  and selected sustainability information in  this report.  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 34 Corporate governance continued are directly accountable to the group  executive: Generation. The nuclear safety  assurance  function  is  a  separate  department in Generation with its own  technical experts and resources reporting  directly to the group executive: Generation  and is thus kept independent of the  production function. An executive delegation visits Koeberg power  station In line with global best practice, Eskom has  a three-tier system of nuclear safety  governance:   The top tier is the boards social, ethics  and sustainability committee, whose  meetings are attended by international  nuclear experts.    The middle tier consists of the nuclear  management subcommittee presided  over by the group executive: Generation.  This makes recommendations on issues  such as nuclear policy, standards and  benchmarks, and overall business  requirements.   The third tier, the safety review  committees, brings together experts  from various parts of Eskom to evaluate  nuclear-safety  issues  and  make  recommendations.  During 2011/12, Eskom implemented the  compliance management charter and the  compliance strategic framework that had  been approved by the board in 2010.  Legislation pertaining to Eskom was  reviewed and governance, management  and reporting capability created to  enhance Eskoms capacity to manage  compliance. Baseline principles have been  established and Eskom will develop the  necessary supportive capacity in the  coming year. During the last quarter of 2011/12, Eskom  conducted a comprehensive review of  compliance with important acts and  regulations. The review highlighted the  importance of adequate and timely plant  maintenance to reduce safety risks. Specific  attention was also given to compliance  with PFMA and NERSA requirements.  Eskom is substantially in compliance with  significant legislation affecting its operations. Security risk management The board is responsible for ensuring that  an integrated crime-prevention plan is in  place to minimise Eskoms exposure to  crime, particularly fraud. The security risk- management  department  develops  strategies to protect assets, interests,  information, people and processes and  gives assurance that the required measures  are implemented. The executive manage- ment committee is kept informed about  security issues. Nuclear safety All aspects of electricity production –  including safety – at Koeberg power station   35 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Legislation and guidelines Eskom adheres to the statutory duties and  responsibilities set out in the Companies  Act and augmented by the PFMA. In  addition, Eskom is guided on best practices  by King III and the Protocol on Corporate  Governance in the Public Sector, as well as  international guidelines. Eskom has applied  the majority of the King III principles and  practices. Because Eskom is a state-owned  company, some of these cannot be applied  and, in some instances, Eskom has adopted  alternative  practices  to  those  recommended by KingIII.  Eskom has amended its memorandum of  incorporation to bring it into harmony  with the Companies Act, 2008 and has  submitted it to the Minister of Public  Enterprises for comment. It is envisaged  that the memorandum of incorporation  will be approved by the shareholder  during2012. Shareholders compact The government of the Republic of South  Africa is Eskoms sole shareholder. The  shareholder representative is the Minister  of Public Enterprises.  Each year Eskom, in consultation with the  Minister of Public Enterprises, agrees on  its performance objectives, measures and  indicators in line with the PFMA. Annual  targets are annexed to a list of principles  agreed to by Eskom and its shareholder  (the shareholder compact) and regular  reports are provided.

Eskom  aims to attract and retain skilled, high- performing employees. To achieve this,  Eskom has established the following  remuneration principles:   Ensure that business requirements  determine market positioning   Provide market-related remuneration  structures, benefits and conditions of  service   Maintain external competitiveness to  attract and retain key skills   Ensure internal equity through defensible  differentials in pay and benefits   Remunerate employees in accordance  with their job grade and at least at the  minimum of the applicable salary scale   Follow a lead-lag market approach. Eskoms remuneration structures fall into  four categories, set out below.  Non-executive remuneration Remuneration is paid in accordance with  the approval of the shareholder and  consists of a fixed monthly fee. Non- executives are reimbursed for company- related expenses. Bargaining unit  Bargaining-unit employees (all those below  middle management) receive a basic salary  and benefits. Major benefits include  membership of the pension and provident  fund, medical aid and an annual bonus  (13th cheque). Basic salaries and conditions  of service are reviewed annually through a  collective bargaining process. Bargaining- unit employees also participate in the  annual short-term incentive scheme (see  overleaf). Managerial level  Managerial-level  employees  are  remunerated on a cost-to-company/ package basis. The package includes  pensionable earnings, compulsory benefits  and a residual cash component. Managerial  employees also participate in the annual  short-term incentive scheme.  Executive remuneration Executive remuneration links remuneration  to the performance of the organisation  and the individuals contribution. Basic  salary is augmented by short- and long- term incentives. International and local  benchmarks are considered in determining  remuneration. The remuneration strategy  is aligned with the shareholder guidelines.  39 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 The board approves the remuneration of  the finance director and group executives.  The chief executives remuneration is  approved bythe shareholder. Factors taken  into account include level of skill,  experience, contribution to organisational  performance and success of the group. The balance between fixed and variable  remuneration and short- and long-term  incentives is reviewed annually. The chief executive, finance director and  group  executives  have  permanent  employment contracts based on Eskoms  standard conditions of service. The remuneration of the executive  management  committee  members  consistsof the following:   Guaranteed amount – fixed cash  portion and compulsory benefits. This is  reviewed annually   Short-term incentives – rewards for  achieving set objectives set by the chief  executive and approved by the board  committee (refer to the key indicators  on page 144)   Long-term incentives – rewards for  achieving objectives set by shareholder  (refer to the key indicators on page144). During the 2011/12 financial year, the  following details are pertinent for executive  management committee members:   On average, they received below- inflation increases on their guaranteed  portion of earnings   Performance contracts indicate that  only 20% of performance is based on  individual performance, while 80% of  performance is based on the collective  Eskom  performance  weighted  accordingly   Cognisance must be taken of the  responsibilities and risk carried by  directors and executives, given their  broad accountability   On the key indicators table, the linkages  to the chief executives compact  (performance targets) are indicated.

Risk-monitoring system implemented The executive committee has implemented  a risk-monitoring system that enables  management to respond appropriately to  all significant risks that could affect the  business. Eskoms integrated emergency  response structures manage emergencies  that exceed the scope of normal business  in a coordinated manner.  Risk monitoring is done at departmental,  regional, operating unit and subsidiary level  and is reported upwards to group level.  After these integrated risk reports are  consolidated, the executive committee and  the boards audit and risk committee  review and evaluate the risk profile to  determine the major corporate and  business risks. Integrated risk and resilience framework  under way An internal benchmark review of Eskoms  risk management maturity, conducted in  the last quarter of the financial year,  indicated that Eskom has a capability  maturity close to the global benchmark for  electricity utility companies. An integrated  risk and resilience framework to make  Eskom a risk intelligent company in the  medium term is being developed.  What follows is a high-level examination of  the key material issues and risks facing  Eskom in the period under review, focusing  on how these issues affect each other and  what Eskom is doing to mitigate the risks  they pose or capitalise on the advantages  they offer. Greater detail on how these  issues and risks affect the companys value  chain is set out from page 57.  Becoming a high-performance  organisation  Focus on safety  Safe working conditions are a core Eskom  objective – alongside safe operation of its  power plants and transmission and  distribution  infrastructure  in  the  communities in which it operates. Work- related fatalities are an unnecessary  tragedy with far-reaching consequences for  staff morale and performance. Such events  also negatively affect Eskoms reputation  and may in certain instances have  repercussions in terms of labour law. While  there are significant health and safety risks  associated with an electricity business that  cannot be avoided entirely, Eskom works  to minimise these factors.  Incorporation of safety into performance- management system  Eskom has included safety in its  performance-management system across  all divisions. Any accidents reported count  against  the  achievement  of  key  performance targets.  Operating context: material issues continued  45 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Safety-management system established A safety-management system has been  established. Eskom will continue to focus  on training of safety practitioners which  emphasises Eskoms policies and follow it  up with compliance audits. Safety  performance features strongly in Eskoms  remuneration strategy (refer to page 144,  and footnote 2 on page 150).  Safety training and monitoring for staff Eskom ran several safety awareness and  training programmes for staff throughout  the year. Employees are expected to  follow the cardinal rules of safety or be  disciplined. This has resulted in a  considerable increase in safe behaviours  (such as use of safety belts) since 2008.  Targeted initiatives for specific types of  health and safety incidents were also  conducted. Eskom manages around 11 000 people on the  Kusile power station site. Contractor safety forums conducted Eskom held contractor forums to ensure  that the standard of safety management at  Eskom sites was in line with best practice.  Contractors are expected to comply with  Eskoms safety, health and environmental  policy; deviation from this policy is not  tolerated and can lead to the termination  of a contract. Safety-improvement initiatives  Several initiatives to improve safety were  introduced:    The Zero Harm campaign was launched    Peer reviews on risk-control inter- ventions were conducted at selected  sites    Work was stopped on a number of  occasions to discuss and embed safety  issues    Management took robust action on  repeat incidents   Boot camps were held to focus on  specific safety issues. Regulation As a state-owned company and South  Africas primary electricity provider,  Eskom is subject to extensive regulation  of many aspects of its operations.  These include licensing, tariff structure,  trade commitments and environmental  impacts.  Such regulation has the potential to affect  Eskom and its stakeholders by changing its  structures and operations (for instance,  through the new ISMO Bill), by affecting its  revenue stream (through regulating tariffs  and imposing penalties for environmental  emissions). Eskom is engaging its shareholder (the  government) and all relevant regulatory  bodies to factor possible changes to its  mandate, role and national commitments  into all planning initiatives. Refer to  www.eskom.co.za/IR2012/010.html for  more information on regulation.  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 46 Operating context: material issues continued What is multi-year price  determination? As a regulated state-owned company,  Eskoms revenues and South Africas  electricity prices are determined by  NERSA through the process of a  multi-year  price  determination.  Eskom is currently in its second  MYPD cycle, which began on 1 April  2010 and ends on 31 March 2013,  and it is preparing its submission for  the third cycle (MYPD3).  The price-determination process  requires Eskom to submit its  proposed application to the South  African  Local  Government  Association, which represents the  municipalities that constitute the  single largest buyer group of electricity,  and the National Treasury, for  comment and takes into account  their input into its application to  NERSA.  NERSA analyses Eskoms application  to ensure that the utility is operating  efficiently and that customers are  getting value for their money. It also  consults with various stakeholders  and the public before making its  decision.  Revision of 2012/13 increase in MYPD 2 NERSA approved an average tariff increase  of 24.8% for 2010/2011, 25.8% for 2011/12  and 25.9% for the 2012/13 period of  MYPD 2. In March 2012, at Eskoms  request and after due consideration to  ensure no negative impact, NERSA revised  the second increase downwards to 16%  for the period from 1 April 2012 to  31March 2013.  Preparation for MYPD 3 application Eskom is preparing to submit its application  for the third MYPD to NERSA in the  second half of 2012. The application will  address the following:   The transition to cost-reflective tariffs,  which is expected to continue based on  a real return on replacement values for  assets, but over a longer period. The  Electricity Pricing Policy states that cost- reflective tariffs should be reached  within a five-year period ending   March 2015. However, given the  importance of electricity in the economy,  Eskom will suggest phasing in the  increase over a longer period.   Building a financially sustainable and  viable electricity industry   Supporting economic growth and job  creation   Ensuring the security of supply.  Whereas previous determinations spanned  three years, Eskom proposes that MYPD 3  should cover a five-year period. This will  allow customers to plan for price increases,  provide rating agencies and lenders with  certainty of revenue inflows over a longer  period, and ensure that cost-reflective  pricing is achieved.  Stakeholder engagement Should any of the corporate or business  risks Eskom faces materialise and result in  significant financial loss, price increases or  load shedding, in isolation or in aggregate,  it will have a significant negative impact on  Eskoms shareholder and stakeholder  relationships, and its brand and reputation  – all of which may constrain Eskoms ability  to raise capital. A strategy has been put in  place to manage these risks and to engage  with stakeholders.   47 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Weekly system status bulletin Eskom releases weekly system status  bulletins as well as quarterly briefings to the  media, to keep stakeholders informed as to  the status of its constrained supply system. Building strong skills South Africa has limited availability of  contractors with the required skills and  capacity to support the capital expansion  programme, and competition for skilled  workers is intense. To deepen the skills pool for the benefit of  both the capital expansion programme  and for future grid maintenance, Eskom  has in the current year:   Partnered with six leading South African  universities to train engineers in areas  relevant to Eskom.   Launched the Eskom Welding School of  Excellence to develop in-house skills  and bring down the companys welding  reject rate. The 150 learners enrolled in  the programme will receive a dual  South  African  and  international  qualification. Critical information-systems failure  Effective and secure information systems  are essential for efficient management,  accurate billing of customers, payment of  suppliers and employees and effective  power generation and transmitting of  electricity over the national grid. The  confidentiality, integrity and availability of  information systems could be affected by  ineffective design or controls, frequent  failure of critical applications, inadequate  disaster-recovery plans, lack of stability in  the integration environment, poor data  security and deliberate cyber-attacks.  These risks could result in loss of day-to- day production and critical information, as  well as the inability to recover the network  as a result of inadequate disaster-recovery  plans.  The controls in place to prevent system  failure include information standards and  control frameworks, third-party security  assessments, vulnerability assessments,  reviews of infrastructure and applications,  automated application testing, change- control management and development  and monitoring of disaster-recovery and  business continuity management plans. Leading and partnering to keep  the lights on Keep the lights on  Electricity demand levels for 2011/12 were  similar to the previous year, with peak  demand during the winter of 2011  reaching 37 065MW at the end of May,  including non-Eskom generation (May  2010: 36 970MW). The supply-demand  balance is expected to remain tight  throughout 2012 and 2013, until the first  unit of Medupi power station starts coming  online. Eskom has put in place a recovery  team to ensure that load shedding is  avoided, but energy conservation and  partnership with all stakeholders will be  essential to achieve this. This is one of Eskoms key performance  targets: ensuring that the lights stay on by  managing supply and demand in such a   Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 48 Operating context: material issues continued way that essential maintenance can be  done. Reductions in energy demand achieved Eskom runs several energy and demand- reduction programmes to encourage  industrial customers, municipalities and  households to reduce their energy  consumption. This makes more capacity  available on the electricity supply system,  creating opportunities for maintenance  work and reducing the likelihood of load  shedding in the future. These programmes  include:    Power buy-back agreements with  industrial customers.   The Energy Conservation Scheme,  which sets energy allocations for the  countrys 500 largest electricity users.  This voluntary scheme may become  mandatory in future. To date 96 of  Eskoms 135 key industrial customers  (using 100GWh per year) have been  contracted.    Residential power-reduction initiatives  (installing low-flow shower heads, LED  lights, pool timers, geyser blankets and  subsidising solar water-heating systems).   The Power Alert system, broadcast on  television between the hours of 17:00  and 21:00, indicates the status of the  load on the grid and urges viewers to  turn off non-essential appliances in times  of excessively high demand.   The 49M campaign, which aims to  encourage energy-efficient attitudes and  habits in all consumers, particularly  residential users. Demand-side management has reduced  peak electricity demand by 2 997MW for  the combined financial years 2005 to 2012.  A single power station unit contributes  about 600MW to national electricity  supply, so demand-side management has  now conserved five generators worth of  output (a typical power station has six).  The challenge of infrastructure deterioration  Eskoms ageing electricity supply network  and power stations require essential  maintenance and upgrades. Given the  constraints on the power system, there has  been a reduction in the maintenance  window, which has resulted in a backlog,  which increases theprobability of network  or plant failure and, in some cases,  contraventions  of  environmental  regulations.  A project to coordinate a comprehensive,  synchronised maintenance and refurbish- ment plan is under way. This project uses  demand-side initiatives to create windows  of opportunity to do the required work  and so improve plant and grid efficiency  while reducing the possibility of plant  failure and load shedding.  Eskoms drive to become a high  performance organisation by creating a  step change in its technical performance is  enabled by the deliverables of the  Back2Basics programme launched. This  includes a more consistent and world-class  approach to engineering, maintenance and  operating practices.  49 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 The Back2Basics programme The Back2Basics programme was  established in 2010 to improve  overall performance across Eskom by  standardising,  simplifying  and  optimising processes and systems.  The programme aims to ensure that  management information is complete,  accurate, reliable, accessible and  timely. Eskom is currently improving data  quality to effectively manage process  risks, standardise reports and drive  process and system training.  Back2Basics includes the following  programmes: services tools, project  tools,  engineering  tools  and  operations,  and  maintenance  and outage management tools and  initiatives. Eskom has achieved the  major milestone of implementing a  consolidated,  standardised  and  improved  SAP  application  on  schedule and within budget. In  2012/13,  the  Back2Basics  programme will continue to develop  and document standardised and  optimised processes, focusing on the  project and engineering tools and the  maintenance and outage maintenance  areas to improve Eskoms efficiency  and performance.  Deliver capital expansion programme Eskoms capital expansion programme was  initiated in 20051 and will increase  generating capacity by 17GW by 2018. The  capital expansion programme met its key  performance targets during the reporting  period, considerably exceeding them in the  case of the amount of generation capacity  commissioned and the amount of  transmission  capacity  installed  and  commissioned. In total, the programme  has increased Eskoms generating and  transmission capacity by 5 756MW,  transmission lines by 3 899kms and  transmission substation capacity by  20195MVA since 2005. The  central  challenge  facing  this  programme is to remain on schedule.  Eskom is using an integrated approach to  manage schedules, budgets and risks  associated with the expansion programme  and all of its capital expenditure  programmes.  This has involved using lessons learnt to  date and putting in place procedures, tools  and systems to make all capital programmes  highly effective and efficient. These include  a project lifecycle methodology, project  development and readiness assessments,  and the Eskom high-performance utility  model. For more detail on these processes,  see www.eskom.co.za/IR2012/011.html. Capital expansion accomplishments In 2011/12, Eskom achieved the following:    535MW of generating capacity was  added to the electricity supply system  – Grootvlei power station  160MW  – Komati power station  325MW  – Camden power station  20MW  – Arnot power station  30MW   631km of power lines were added to  the grid   2 525MVA substation capacity was  added to the grid 1. Eskoms total net maximum capacity in 2005 was 36.2GW.  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 50 Operating context: material issues continued   The return-to-service commissioning of  Grootvlei power station was completed   The return-to-service Komati power  station  commissioning  was  74%  complete by the end of the year, ahead  of its 73% target   The new Ingula pumped storage power  station, due for completion in 2014/15,  was 41% complete, behind its target of  48% due to the geological conditions  related to the main turbine hall Improving capital expenditure execution Given the size and strategic importance of  the capital expansion programme as well  as Eskoms significant periodic on-going  capital expenditure, Eskom established the  Group Capital division in September 2010  to improve capital portfolio management  and the development and execution of  projects.   The capital-allocation process is built on  successful divisional methodologies and  Eskoms  integrated  risk-management  approach. These are now standardised  across the group and strongly informed by  the practices of local and international  peer companies such as Sasol and Britains  National Grid.  Eskoms capital prioritisation and allocation  processes are made up of a series of  stages that:   Scrub and validate individual projects  before inclusion into the portfolio    Rank projects based on risk scores and  categories before accounting for  constraints to project delivery   Translate an execution-constrained  project list into divisional budgets   Monitor performance and adjust capital  portfolio budgets based on new  projects originated, changes in strategic  direction and delivery performance. Ensuring timely capital investment  Until recently, decisions on capital  investment were not made in good time,  leading to a delay in the country obtaining  sufficient generation capacity to meet  anticipated  demand.  A  lingering  consequence of the late start of the capital  expansion programme is that South  Africas  supply-demand  balance  is  expected to remain tight throughout  2012 and 2013, when the first unit of  Medupi power station comes online. In the  years ahead, a comprehensive capital  investment schedule is required for the  IRP 2010 and the need for timely  investment decisions isbeing addressed in  continual engagements between the  government and Eskom. Delays on Medupi power stations first unit Delays in the boiler for the new dry- cooled, coal-fired station at Medupi,  the new power station being built in  theLimpopo province, has resulted in the  completion date for the first unit (unit 6)  being postponed to 2013. This unit was  initially due to come online in late 2012,  adding 794MW to the power grid. This  unsatisfactory delivery performance is  being addressed with the contractor at  the highest level and there has been  significant improvement in performance  since January 2012.  51 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Securing servitudes for transmission lines Delays in acquiring servitudes are leading  to project delays and cost increases. Eskom  continues to engage with land owners and  is working with the government to resolve  these matters. Servitude at Thabazimbi Ensuring better engineering scope definition Inadequate engineering scope definition  during project planning and development  has led to delays in project timelines.  Eskom is putting in place stronger controls  through project readiness assessments to  prevent this from happening in future. Addressing industrial action Industrial action as a result of employee  dissatisfaction – particularly contractors  relationships with their employees – has  led to project delays and property damage.  This is being addressed through various  mechanisms, including project labour  agreements (for Medupi and Kusile) and  strong industrial relations policies (Ingula).  Changing technology Eskom continues to develop a resource  plan to cater for anticipated technologies  based on the possible energy-mix  allocations in the Integrated Resource  Plan2010. Reducing the carbon  footprint and pursuing  low-carbon growth opportunities  The way in which Eskom generates,  transmits and distributes electricity  unavoidably has an impact on the  environment. This is particularly true in the  case of Kusile and Medupi power stations  which, when complete in 2018, will  produce 4 800MW and 4 764MW of  extra power, making them some of the  largest coal-fired power stations in the  world. Kusile and Medupi, power stations  being built in Mpumalanga and Limpopo  provinces respectively, have been the  target of some protests because they will  be coal-burning facilities. While the  protests have not seriously disrupted  construction, they have had a negative  reputational effect. Although Kusile and  Medupi power stations will increase the  total carbon footprint, the design and  technology of these power stations is  more efficient compared with existing  coal-fired plants, resulting in a reduction in  water usage and carbon dioxide emitted  per unit of electricity generated.  Eskom is aware of its impact on the  environment and strives to embed a  culture of environmentally responsible  behaviour and decision making across  thebusiness. Eskom works hard to ensure  that it operates as a responsible corporate  citizen and takes its commitment to  environmental responsibility seriously.  The Eskom/Endangered Wildlife Trust  (EWT) strategic partnership is in place to  avoid ormitigate wildlife interaction with  electrical infrastructure. The partnership  continues to ensure that Eskom reduces its  impact on biodiversity.  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 52 Operating context: material issues continued Water scarcity  Eskoms power stations depend on a  steady, adequate supply of water of a  certain quality. Competing resource needs,  drought in catchment areas, pollution and  poor water supply infrastructure all have  the potential to hinder Eskoms access to  affordable water. Involvement in COP 17 Eskom and the South African government  demonstrated their commitment to  reducing carbon emissions at the COP 17  conference in November and December  2011. Government policy is already in  place to determine national carbon  budgets to curb South Africas emissions.  Eskom is working with the government to  determine what carbon savings are  possible from its side and what resources  will be needed to achieve them. Renewable-energy projects and  independent power producers  Eskom is finalising plans for a wind farm at  Sere, due for completion in December  2013, and a pilot concentrating solar  thermal power plant near Upington, due  to start construction in December 2015.  Together, these will add 200MW of power  to the grid when completed.  Eskom is in the process of installing solar  panels at 13 coal-fired power stations, four  peaking stations and Megawatt Park  to supplement  auxiliary  electricity  consumption. The installations at Kendal  and Lethabo power stations have been  completed, and the remaining 15 sites will  be operational in 2013. Eskom actively supported the Department  of Energy in finalising the request for  proposals and power-purchase agreement  for the Renewable Energy Independent  Power Producer (IPP) programme, formally  launched in August 2011. The request for  proposals calls for 3 725MW of renewable- energy technologies to be in commercial  operation between mid-2014 and the end  of 2016. Proposals have been received from  28 preferred bidders so far, with the  combined potential to provide 1416MW  of power. Eskom is working with government  to connect successful IPPs to the grid.  Carbon tax discussions The National Treasury plans to introduce a  carbon tax in 2013/14. Eskom has  participated in discussions with the  Treasury to identify ways to enhance the  effectiveness of the tax and limit any  unintended consequences for electricity  tariffs and the economy.  Gaseous emissions, water pollution and  other environmental issues Gaseous emissions have increased marginally  across the fleet of power stations. The  existing fleet does not have technology to  reduce gaseous emissions. However Kusile  will be commissioned with flue gas  desulphurisation (FGD) and plans are in  place to retrofit Medupi during the first  general overhaul. FGD will remove at least  90% of sulphur emissions. Both power  stations will be commissioned with  technology to reduce nitrogen oxides. They  will also have the most efficient fabric filter  technology in Eskoms fleet of power  stations, for the removal of particulate  emissions.   53 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 In future Eskom will not only report on  these emissions, but targets will be  determined once Medupi and Kusile  power stations are online and abatement  technologies are retrofitted to existing  power stations.  Lessons learnt from past environmental  legal contraventions were shared with  employees and contractors, contributing  to a significant decrease in the number of  environmental contraventions, from 631 in  2010/11 to 50 in 2011/12.  Eskom formed a task team during the  reporting period to reduce particulate  emissions  and  is  implementing  improvement plans.  A technical plan to eliminate liquid effluent  discharge by recycling polluted water for  reuse by power plants was developed and  projects are under way to improve the  water use performance at several power  stations. Projects have been initiated to  investigate the use of mine water  and reduce the reliance on fresh water  in the longer term. While Eskom does  not utilise groundwater, its activities have  the potential to result in groundwater  pollution. Monitoring programmes are in  place to detect potential pollution and  mitigation measures implemented if  pollution is detected.  A programme to achieve ISO 14001  certification progressed well this year with  several power stations and construction  sites achieving certification for the first time. Compact fluorescent lamp programme  Eskom has distributed more than 47million  compact  fluorescent  lamps  (CFLs)  throughout South Africa since the  inception of the CFL programme in  December 2003.  Engagement with civil society Eskom facilitated a number of meetings  with environmental NGOs in the period  under review. In particular, a technical  workshop was held to share information  on Eskoms water strategy and provide an  opportunity for NGOs to present their  water-related initiatives and views on  water management.  Securing future resource  requirements, mandate and the  enabling environment Competition for coal  Coal-fired power stations depend on a  continuous supply of coal of an acceptable  quality. However, long-term coal supply is  threatened by international competition  for South Africas coal reserves and the  influence this has on coal prices. New  specifications for the acceptable quality of  coal are also having an influence on supply.  Coal-stock levels were at 39 days at the  close of the period under review, having  recovered from a low of 36 days at the  end of July 2011 following labour action at  a number of collieries, but down from the  41 days at 31 March 2011. 1.  One environmental legal contravention was registered in March 2011 and, following an investigation,  was reclassified as an event. This has resulted in the reported number of environmental legal  contraventions for 2010/11 changing from 64 to 63.  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 54 Operating context: material issues continued Conductor, equipment and  electricitytheft Electricity theft (illegal connections) and  the theft of distribution cables and other  equipment continue to hamper operations.  Operation Khanyisa, a campaign launched  in 2010 to promote the legal use of power,  is helping to address this issue as part of  the energy-loss and theft-management  programme. Maximising socio-economic contribution Eskom contributes to governments New  Growth Path by providing reliable, sustainable  and cost-effective energy to fuel South  Africas power-intensive core industries  (mining, beneficiation and manufac turing).  It also contributes to job creation through  its capacity expansion programme and  training through the Academy of Learning  and the learner programme (refer www. eskom.co.za/IR2012/012.html).  Pursuing private sector  participation  Eskom is committed to facilitating the  entry of IPPs and acknowledges the role  that they must play in the South African  electricity market. Eskom has already  signed agreements with non-Eskom  generators and IPPs under the Medium- Term  Power  Purchase  Programme  (373MW),  securing  515MW  from  municipal generators and 120MW of  capacity under the short-term power  purchase programme. To date, Eskom has  signed power-purchase agreements with a  total contracted capacity of 1 008MW.  On 21 May 2012, the Department of  Energy announced a further 19 preferred  bidders following the second round of  bidding, totalling 1 275MW. Eskoms  board  has  also  approved  participation in the Department of Energys  Open-Cycle Gas Turbine IPP project, which  will see Eskom purchase peak-hour  electricity from IPPs. A Public Finance  Management  Act  (PFMA)  (1999)  applicationto take part in this transaction  has been submitted to the Department of  Public Enterprises. Finalisation of the  agreement is dependent on governmental  approval.  Cumulative IPP installed capacity and power purchased Key performance  indicator  Description Actual  2012 Actual  2011 Actual  2010 IPP installed capacity (in  MW) Medium-term power  purchase programme  373 373 – Municipal base load  purchases 515 515 – Short-term power  purchases 120 – – Total 1 008 888 – IPP power purchased  (in GWh per annum) 4 107  1 833 –  55 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Preparations for ISMO During 2011 the government tabled the  ISMO Bill, which provides for a separate  state-owned entity into which certain  functions would be spun off from Eskom  over time. A phased approach toward  theISMO was envisaged, starting with the  ring-fencing of the relevant organisational  units initially into an Eskom division, after  which the division can be transformed into  an Eskom subsidiary – and then into a  separate state-owned company. The System and Market Operator division,  operating under the governance of the  board, was instituted on 1 October 2011.  Its functions include energy planning,  feasibility studies, IPP procurements and  market administration. A comprehensive business plan has been  developed following the phased approach  in meeting the objectives of the ISMO Bill  and Eskom is following the necessary  governance and permissions processes to  establish a subsidiary. Eskom expects to  phase in the subsidiary structure during  2012/13.  Clarity regarding ISMO Eskom is engaging the government and  relevant regulatory bodies for clarity on  the implementation to factor possible  changes into its planning. Integrated Resource Plan 2010 allocation  Eskoms  new  generation  steering  committee is currently engaging the  Department  of  Energy  and  the  Department of Public Enterprises about  the allocation. This will impact Eskoms  ability to meet the targetedenergy mix to  reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  Ensuring financial   sustainability  Eskom must raise capital to pursue its  capital expansion programme and improve  its operations. New capital projects will  require pre-identified funding sources  before they are authorised to proceed.  Eskom is investing strategically and  leveraging its assets to secure financing. An  appropriate tariff structure that allows for  cost recovery, including a real return on  the replacement value of assets, is  necessary to encourage investment over  the long term. Tariffs need to be set at  levels that do not constrain economic  growth, with provision made to ensure  that low-income households can obtain  electricity in a sustainable manner.  Eskom has raised a significant amount of  debt (some government guaranteed) to  fund the capital expansion programme,  and the companys credit metrics are  closely monitored.  Other risk factors (if unmitigated) affecting  Eskoms ability to raise capital, as well as  impacting the cost of borrowings, include:   Reliance on the governments credit  rating. Any negative change in the  governments credit rating directly  affects Eskom.   Rand depreciation increasing the cost of  imported  equipment  purchases,  impacting the Rand value and hence  thecost of foreign loans.   Uncertainty regarding the tariff price  path.   Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 56 Operating context: material issues continued   Significant increases in environmental  taxation (including carbon taxes) not  recoverable from Eskoms customers.   Non-payment for electricity as a result  of increased electricity tariffs.   Inappropriate cash liquidity levels in the  future.    Regulatory uncertainty regarding the  establishment of the Independent  System Market Operator.   Power system crises that might result in  a loss of investor confidence. Continued repercussions from the global  financial crisis could also negatively affect  Eskoms ability to raise capital.  All of these risks are constantly monitored  and action plans continually revised to  address the potential risks. Financing negotiations Eskom is working with the government,  regulators and financing institutions to  obtain adequate and affordable funding,  and has already secured more than 77% of  its required funding up until the completion  of the Kusile power plant in 2018/19 – the  final project on the current capital  expansion programme.  Savings mechanisms put in place Cost-saving drives are under way and Eskom  is monitoring budgetary perform ance.  Significant savings in operating costs were  made in both 2010/11 and 2011/12. Mali subsidiary During the year significant unrest occurred  in Mali due to a coup. Eskom has since  March 2010 been negotiating to exit from  Mali and the exit date for Mali has been  extended to 31July 2012. The Mali business  continues to be disclosed as a discontinued  operation. There is sufficient provision for  exit and all the major financial risks have  been addressed in the exit agreement. Market-making risk Eskom partakes in local market-making  activities in a bid to reduce the funding  cost of the company. Most investors place  a premium on liquidity of bonds and are  therefore prepared to accept a lower yield  (relative to alternative bonds) to invest in  bonds where the issue sizes are large and  deemed to be liquid. The risks of market making include the  anticipated loss on turnovers, typically the  bid/offer spread thereon, which is partially  mitigated  through  carry  trading  opportunities. In addition there is the  potential negative impact on liquidity  which Eskom believes is limited due to the  strategy of holding sufficient liquidity  buffers as well as a portfolio of liquid  Government bonds. Adequate liquidity levels  Significant progress has been made in  funding the capital expansion programme  and Eskom is in a healthy funding and  liquidity position. The latest projections  indicate that Eskom has sufficient cash  from cash on hand, investments, net  operational cash flows and current secured  facilities available to fund the business for  the next 18 months.  57 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Value chain performance A vulture flies past a high-voltage line at the new Ingula pumped storage scheme  This section of the report has been  structured according to this value chain to  communicate important issues that arise  in day-to-day  operations.  Eskoms  performance in each of these fields is an  indication of the health of its operations  and how closely they are aligned with its  strategic objectives.  The material issues and risks summarised  at a higher level are spelt out along the  value chain, which includes the following  elements:    Construction (managed by the service  functions)   Primary energy (managed by the service  functions)   Generating electricity   Transmitting and distributing electricity   Customer service   Service and strategic function key issues  (safety, health, environmental and quality  issues are addressed under this section  but are the accountability of the entire  value chain)   Financial performance. Construction Since 2005, Eskom has been involved in a  major capital expansion programme to  increase South Africas generation and  transmission capacity to meet the growing  demand for energy. The total cost of this  phase of the programme to 2018/19 is  estimated to be R340 billion (excluding  capitalised borrowing costs). When  completed, two of the deliverables, Kusile  and Medupi power stations, will be the  third and fourth largest coal-fired power  plants in the world. In addition to the  capacity expenditure, Eskom has significant  capital expenditure to refurbish, maintain  and strengthen its current operating plant  amounting to approximately R19 billion for  the current year.  Operational highlights    Commissioned three Komati units (units  4, 5 and 6), Grootvlei unit 5, plus  increased capacity at both Camden unit  6 and Arnot unit 5. Altogether Eskom  added 535MW of power to the grid.   The 304km, 765kV transmission line  from Perseus in the Free State to  Gamma in the Western Cape went live.   Significant progress was made in placing  contracts for Kusile power station.   Medupi, Ingula, Kusile and power  delivery projects  obtained  ISO14001:2004 certification, indicating  that they abide by the international  environmental management system  standard. Operational challenges   Increasing generation capacity while  limiting Eskoms carbon footprint   Containing costs   The capital expansion programme is  contributing to skills development and  local manufacturing capabilities, but  Eskom is competing for skills locally and  internationally   Construction-schedule delays. Eskom  has increased its monitoring of  contractor performance to develop  remedial strategies as required.

This is expressed  in US dollars per kilowatt (USD/kW) for  installed capacity and generally includes  engineering, procurement and construction  (the basic plant cost), as well as a  combination of owners development,  contingency and transmission costs. Overnight cost calculations take into  consideration factors such as site location,  year of comparison, technology used and  station size, but exclude escalation in  equipment, labour, commodity, capitalised  borrowing costs and operating and  maintenance costs. Another way to compare power station  costs is the levelised cost of electricity  (LCOE) method. This calculates the  present-value cost in USD/MWh of energy  production. LCOE includes the capital cost,  as well as fuel and all fixed and variable  operating and maintenance costs. Interest  rates, inflation and taxation are also taken  into account.  Direct comparisons of plant cost are more  difficult using the LCOE method due to  the great number of cost components that  need to be evaluated. However, LCOE is a  better way to evaluate the overall cost of  a plant because it takes into consideration  operational and maintenance expenses.  Several factors make it a challenge to  obtain consistent and accurate benchmarks  for the cost of Eskoms new power plants:   The numbers are commercially sensitive   The assumptions behind comparison  numbers (for instance, the technology  used, the plant design, the base year and  the exchange rate) vary greatly   Costs are constantly changing and have  increased substantially in recent years  due to rising demand for equipment  and commodity price movements   Consideration of contextual issues such  as localisation, supply chain, economic  cycles/parameters and economies of  scale. Benchmarking information presented on  page 63 comes from studies by the  Electronic Power Research Institute, Lazard,  an investment bank and the International  Energy Agency. The limits of such high- level comparisons should be understood  and considered with due care.   63 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Summary of benchmark information Study  Rand/ USD  exchange  rate Technology Overnight  costs  (USD/kW) Cost   components LCOE  (USD/ MWh) Cost  components EPR1 (2010) 7.4 Pulverised coal  with FGD1 2 403 – 2 656   Basic cost   Contingency 80 – 85   Capital cost   Operational   cost   Fuel cost Data for  Integrated  Resource   Plan 2010 Pulverised coal  without FGD1 2 091 – 2 281 71 – 75 Lazard (2009) 8.32 Super-critical   with and   without carbon   capture 2 800 – 5 925   Basic cost   Contingency   Owners   development   costs   Borrowing   costs   Transmission 78 – 144   Capital cost   Operational   cost   Fuel cost   Transmission International  Energy Agency  (2010) 8.2 Super-critical   from various  countries 672 – 2 539   Basic cost   Contingency   Owners   development   costs 29 – 100   Capital cost   Operational   cost   Fuel cost Pumped storage 2 703 73 – 149 1.

Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 64 Value chain performance continued Eskoms costs have been adjusted to the same base year and exchange rate as the  benchmark studies to match the cost components of these benchmarks. The outcome is  presented in the table below.

While Medupi and Kusile are  both coal-fired power stations, a cost  difference arises because Medupis costs  do not include flue-gas desulphurisation  (FGD). The capital expenditure phasing is  also different, resulting in Kusile attracting  higher escalation and financing charges. The figures above were adjusted to the  base year and exchange rate of the  benchmarking figures on page 63. Based  on the current economic and financial  parameters applied by Eskom, the  overnight cost (excluding borrowing costs  but including owners, development costs,  transmission and contingency) and LCOE  calculations for capital expansion projects  are as follows: Current power plant overnight costs  and LCOE Power station  Over- night cost (USD/ kW) LCOE (USD/ MWh) Medupi 2 300 54 Kusile 2 500 73 Ingula 1 700 110  65 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Primary energy Eskom needs to source and procure  sufficient primary energy resources (coal,  water, uranium, sorbent and biomass) of  the necessary quality, on time and at  minimum cost for its power stations to  operate.

This represents  non-refundable advance payments to suppliers and fuel assemblies in process of fabrication.  67 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Road-to-rail migration plan About 35.5Mt of coal was transported by  road in the 2011/12 period, up from  30.5Mt in 2010/11. Eskoms long-term  coal-supply strategy includes investing in  low-cost coal-transport infrastructure  through the road-to-rail migration plan.  This strategy, which is being implemented  with Transnet Freight Rail, includes  designing and implementing rail-offloading  capabilities at power stations that are  linked or could be linked to the main rail  network with rail sidings.  The strategy aims to:   Secure coal supply by putting logistics  solutions in place at Camden, Tutuka,  Majuba, Grootvlei, Kendal and Hendrina  to cater for a throughput potential of  32Mt per year by rail Coal road-to-rail migration   9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Mt 2009 2010 2011 2012 2012 Target   Improve cost efficiency, including  lowering the cost of road repairs   Improve road safety and minimise  reputational damage to Eskom. Coal quality The quality of coal that Eskom uses is vital for efficient power plant operations.  Eskom has largely concluded all its current contracts at a specification of coal that  is based on power plant design and operations. However, in the course of mining  coal and as a result of various issues with geological reserves, mining operations,  equipment effectiveness and availability, there are times when the coal delivered  from the mining suppliers is of a poorer quality than that which is contracted. This  may bedue to lower calorific value, higher ash content, higher moisture content and  more rock impurities. This damages coal-handling and grinding equipment, reduces  the efficiency of power plants, causes load losses, and increases emissions and the  ash-removal burden.  Mining conditions and coal quality in Mpumalanga have deteriorated in recent years  because the better-quality coal has already been extracted, leaving behind only  poorer-quality deposits, and coal is now being mined in difficult geological areas. Coal beneficiation (purification), blending and online quality-monitoring capabilities  were not built into most long-term coal supply agreements, making it a challenge to  maintain consistency of coal quality supplied to power stations. Eskom is undertaking  various projects to improve the quality and consistency of its coal, including online  coal-quality monitoring, cross belt sampling and beneficiation at cost-plus mines.  Eskom is also engaging with mining houses to ensure the timely supply of life-of- mine plans to enable better control of coal qualities being mined and delivered to  power stations.   Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 68 Value chain performance continued Strategy for the Waterberg coalfields The Waterberg coalfields in Limpopo  province currently supply coal to Matimba  power station and will supply coal to  Medupi power station, both of which are  in Limpopo. There is a 600km railway line  from the coalfields to Mpumalanga, where  Eskoms main coal-fired power stations are  located, but it is not capable of meeting  Eskoms growing needs or those of the  export coal industry. The line is to be  upgraded to carry at least 20Mt of coal in  the near future, and a new rail line has to  be built to increase this quantity in the long  term. It is planned that the Waterberg coalfields  strategy be implemented by Eskom in  conjunction with Transnet Freight Rail and  the Department of Water Affairs. It will be  monitored by the Presidential Infrastructure  Coordinating Commission. Eskom is also in  discussion with mines for long-term coal- supply contracts in the Waterberg and is  planning the second phase of its water- augmentation project to ensure the timely  availability of water. If the project proceeds  as envisioned, rail imports to Mpumalanga  could begin by 2019. Water South Africa as a whole faces severe water  challenges in the coming decades and  Eskom is no exception. Sustainable supply  of electricity is highly dependent on  securing adequate water supplies to run  generating plants. Eskoms water strategy addresses the risks  of water scarcity, security and pollution,  and the impact of climate change.  The strategys goals are to:   Ensure long-term water planning   Develop and implement conservation  strategies   Meet the water requirements of new  and existing power stations   Meet the water-quality objectives of the  various catchment areas   Efficiently manage water costs    Influence policy, strategy, planning,  legislative and regulatory issues related  to water   Work with stakeholders on water  challenges and solutions   Offer water management assurance,  advisory service and support. Nuclear fuel strategy Nuclear fuel is procured and delivered to  Koeberg nuclear power station in  accordance with government-authorised  contracts for supplying uranium and  enriched uranium, and for fabricating  nuclear fuel. The current uranium and  enriched uranium contracts are sufficient  to satisfy Koebergs demand until 2017 and  the fuel-fabrication contracts will last until  2015/16. Generating electricity Eskom has the ambition to ensure that  no supply interruptions occur due to  plantunavailability. To realise this ambition,  Eskom aspires to become a world-class  generating utility by demonstrating high  reliability and availability of its generating  assets, with an aspirational Energy  Availability Factor (EAF) of 90%.

The  system was further affected by damage to  unit 4 at Duvha power station in February  2011, which contributed more than 1% to  the UCLF in the current year, and the use of  poor-quality coal in the past, which  negatively affected the performance of  some of the coal-fired units. Koebergs  performance was negatively affected by a  36-day forced outage on unit 2 to repair a  hydrogen leak related to the generator  stator coolant system.  Technical performance Overall, Generations energy availability  factor (EAF) performance deteriorated to  81.99% in 2012 compared with 84.59%  the previous year, failing to achieve the  target of 84.1%. EAF is a measure of a  plants availability to provide electricity  minus external energy losses not under  control of plant management and internal  non-engineering constraints.  During the year Generation made use of  every possible opportunity to undertake  maintenance activities. This is reflected in  the planned capability loss factor being  significantly higher than the previous year  and higher than target.  Eskom has made steady progress in  reducing its maintenance backlog, from  36 required maintenance outages at  31 March2011 to 26 by 31 March 2012.

Eskoms  plant profile and performance aligns closely  with that of VGB (Association of Large  Boiler Operators). The energy availability of  Eskoms coal-fired units is benchmarked  against that of VGBs members. VGB is a  European-based technical association for  the electricity and heat generation  industries, with 495member organisations  from 35 countries, representing a collective  capacity of 520GW. Energy availability When considering the best quartile and  the median, Eskoms performance has  historically been better than that of the  VGB fleet. Over the past few years, this  gap has, however, been closed, and for  2010 the performance for the two  organisations was the same. The worst  quartile has, however, seen a deteriorating  VGB trend which has maintained the  performance gap to Eskom. Eskoms declining performance trend is  due to increased operating pressure on  the electricity production infrastructure  and other operating factors outlined in the  performance overview section. Eskoms units continue to operate at  higher load factors than VGBs coal-fired  units.  Nuclear station Eskom is affiliated to the World Association  of Nuclear Operators (WANO) and the  Institute of Nuclear Power Operations  (INPO). South Africa is a member of the  International Atomic Energy Agency. These  affiliations enable Eskom to benchmark  performance, conduct periodic safety  reviews, help define standards, disseminate  best practice and train personnel. Through  INPO, Eskom has obtained international  accreditation for its systematic approach  to training of licensed and non-licensed  nuclear operators at Koeberg.  Eskom is  the only non-US utility to receive such  accreditation. An International Atomic  Energy Agency Operational Safety Review  Team visited Koeberg in August 2011  while a WANO Peer Review of Koeberg  was undertaken in November 2011. Although Koebergs safety performance  remains amongst the best in the world, its  availability and hence electricity production  performance in 2011 was adversely  affected by the forced shutdown of unit 2  in2011. Maintenance work at the Koeberg nuclear power  station Koeberg also compares its performance,  with respect to public exposure to  radiation arising from Koeberg effluent  releases, to the limits set by the National  Nuclear Regulator (NNR). Exposure to  radiation is measured in units of milliSievert  (mSv). The limit recommended by the  International Atomic Energy Agency for   Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 72 Value chain performance continued public exposure to radiation is 1.0mSv per  year. However, the National Nuclear  Regulator has set a stricter limit of 0.25mSv  per year for South Africa.  The average public exposure to radiation  arising from Koebergs operations has  been less than 0.005 mSv in recent years  (or less than 2% of the limit imposed by  the National Nuclear Regulator).  Public individual radiation exposure due to effuent from Koeberg 0.015 0.010 0.005 0.000 MilliSieverts 20031 20041 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 1. Calendar year Refer to www.eskom.co.za/IR2012/014.html  for more details of benchmarking by  Generation. Thermal energy-efficiency programme Eskoms planned thermal energy-efficiency  programme aims to increase generation  efficiency by at least 150MW by the end of  2015. This will equate to about 400kt less  coal being used across all coal-fired power  stations per year, which translates into a  reduction of 1.5Mt of carbon dioxide  emissions a year. Energy savings for the year under review,  based on steps taken at 10 coal-fired  stations, amounted to between 31MW  and 35MW.  Monthly heat-rate trends – that is, coal  energy in megajoules (MJ) consumed per  unit of electric energy produced (in kWh)  – at the pilot at Majuba power station  showed that the station was able to  perform better than the agreed 11.3MJ/ kWh target for eight months of the year.  The thermal energy-efficiency programme  was extended to another five coal-fired  stations, yielding positive results. The full  energy-efficiency programme will be rolled  out to the remaining coal-fired stations  during 2012/13. Progress on restoring Duvha power  stations unit 4 On 9 February 2011, the 600MW unit4  atDuvha power station was taken off-load  for a statutory turbine test. The protection  on the unit failed, causing severe mechanical  damage to the turbo generator and the  surrounding area and starting a fire. The  fire was rapidly brought under control by  the power stations fire team. This was the  first time one of the Duvha units failed  during such a test. The other five Duvha  units were not affected and continued to  supply electricity. The root cause of the incident was a  modification applied by Eskom in 2004  that, inadvertently, when installing a new  programmable logic controller, removed a  maximum speed limit during over-speed  test conditions. The modification error has  been corrected on the remaining units,  while corrective actions have been applied  to eliminate contributory causes. The Duvha recovery project is progressing  in phases, with the unit due to come online  in the second half of 2012.  73 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Transmission is part of the process of  getting the electricity that is generated by  Eskoms power stations to its distribution  networks and end customers.

Benchmarking Benchmarking Transmission performance  against similar utilities is challenging because  of differences in network firmness, reliability  criteria, definitions and data capture.  The Transmission division participated in  the International Transmission Operations  and Maintenance Study during 2011/12 to  identify best global practices. Twenty-seven  companies participated in this study, which  focused on maintenance and plant  performance. Eskoms transmission-plant  performance is in the first quartile for  extra-high  voltage  switchgear  and  instrument transformers. Its performance  is below average in the overhead line and  compensation asset categories. Transmission grid maintenance About 60% of Eskoms transformers  and 55% of its power lines are more  than 25 years old and require ongoing  maintenance and refurbishment. Trans- mission equipment is maintained in  accordance with manufacturers specifi- cations, as well as standards and procedures  developed by Eskom for the lifecycle  management of the assets.  Southern African Energy The SADC region has an abundance of  renewable and other primary energy  sources and could in time play a significant  role in meeting South Africas electricity  requirements and assist with enhancing the  energy mix to improve South Africas  environmental performance.

A number of projects are already being  advanced in several countries, with the  primary focus on hydro and natural gas  resources and transmission strengthening.  A number of SADC countries are  implementing new generation projects. In particular, Namibia increased its  generation capacity by 90MW, while  Botswana, having increased its capacity by  150MW during the year, is set to add a  further 450MW before the end of 2012. Eskom has engaged in cross-border trading  for many years. While Eskom is a net  exporter of electricity, the net volume  exported  (exports  less  imports)  represents only 1.36% of the total energy  available in South Africa. The majority of  the imports are from Cahora Bassa (HCB)  in central Mozambique with small volumes  from Lesotho.  Eskoms exports firm power to the  national utilities of Botswana (BPC),  Namibia (NamPower), Swaziland (SEC)  and Lesotho (LEC).  Eskom has trading relationships with  Zimbabwe (ZESA) and Zambia (ZESCO),  but these agreements are for non-firm  power when surplus capacity exists and  during emergency situations. In addition  Eskom  exports  to  three  end-use  customers, one in Mozambique and two in  Namibia. Eskom wheels (transports)  power on behalf of Electricidade de  Mozambique (EDM), the national utility of  Mozambique, from Cahora Bassa to the  load centre in the south of Mozambique.   Eskom has the opportunity to trade  electricity on a market platform called the  Day-ahead Market, although minimal  volumes are traded on this platform due  to the prevailing energy constraint across  the region, Eskom, along with other  Southern African Power Pool members1,  has the right and obligation to trade and  wheel  electricity. Distribution Distributions mandate is to operate and  maintain the distribution network. Eskom  owns 47  509km of distribution lines,  311831km of reticulation power lines and  11415km of underground cables in South  Africa, representing the largest power-line  system in Africa. Since 1991 Eskom has connected more  than 4.2 million electrification households  to  the  distribution  network. The  electrification strategy was to connect as  many customers as possible with the  available funding (least-cost approach).  Network planning focused primarily on  compliance with minimum regulatory  requirements and not on continuity of  supply requirements.  This approach resulted in lengthy radial  subtransmission and distribution lines  supplying large numbers of customers with  few alternative supply options in the event  of supply interruptions. Distributions  networks are therefore characterised by:   Average feeder length of more than  100km (some as long as 300km)   High number of customers (in some  cases more than 10 000) per feeder.   Low network visibility, limiting the  remote control of switching devices.  Eskoms material issues discussed 1.

The reporting methodology, network  characteristics, environment and operational  processes and practices of the distributors  in the benchmark panels are not the same,  which results in a wide range of performance  levels. This makes any direct performance  comparison a challenge. Eskoms network interruption performance  is dominated by the performance of rural  lines, which have been built on a least-cost  basis. In this way, Eskoms distribution  networks differ significantly from those of  distribution companies that have supply  areas that include large cities and towns.  Rural lines in South Africa include long  radial lines with very limited redundancy  and back-feed capability1. This significantly  distorts direct comparison with North  American distributors. In the benchmark  panel the South American peer group is  more appropriate from a network  investment and customer point of view,  than the North American peer group (as  well as European peer groups).

Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 78 Value chain performance continued Distributions long-term objective is to  reduce SAIDI to 39 hours and SAIFI to   17 interruptions by 2016/17. Four strategic  initiatives are planned to help achieve  these targets:   Establishing additional technical service  centres to ensure that field staff  members  are  located  close  to  customers and networks.    Increasing live-line work so that power  does not have to be disconnected when  maintenance is performed or new  customers are being connected to the  network. Live-line work currently  accounts for 50% of planned work,  which has had a substantial positive  impact on both SAIDI and SAIFI. A  business case to increase live work to  70% of planned work is being prepared. Working towards universal access to electricity in South Africa Eskom implements the integrated national electrification programme on behalf of the  Department of Energy in the companys licensed supply areas.

The targeted number of electrifications  for the next five years amounts to 724 636 connections.   Refurbishing  and  strengthening  networks, which includes:   –  Revising the planning criteria used to  reduce the number of customers  affected by a fault and setting the  criteria for the creation of redundancy  on networks  –  Identifying poor-performing networks  that require special attention  –  Increasing visibility of network  switches to allow remote operation,  reducing travelling time and facilitating  fault-finding.

The structured delivery units will focus  on all customer service channels and  touch points such as walk-in centres,  contact centres and vending outlets.  Eskom will also explore how it can  leveragetechnology, such as the use of  social media platforms for customer  communication.   In support of Eskoms purpose to  improve the quality of life of all South  Africans, Eskom continues to strive to  ensure that customers have reliable and  sustainable electricity solutions (quality  product and services) through improved  access to Free Basic Electricity (FBE),  uninter rupted access to electricity  token vending, accurate bills, simplified  tariffs and transparent communication. The final phase in 2013/2014 will focus on  developing segment-specific strategies to  ensure utilisation of the most appropriate,  optimalchannels and service offerings to  each customer base. A nerve centre  to ensure regular monitoring and  response to matters impacting the  customer experience will be established.  Performance and measurement tools will  be enhanced to enable Eskom to respond  to customer needs and introduce ongoing  improvements where appropriate. Performance Transformation journey to customer service  excellence Eskom has set itself an aspiration of  becoming a world-class customer service  organisation by creating fully satisfied and  serviced customers who consistently rate  Eskom in the top quartile. In order to overcome the current  challenges to reach the aspiration, Eskom  will progress in three phases with  completion expected in 2014. Over the past 12 months, significant  progress was made in setting up a new  division with centres of excellence and  structured operating units to ensure a  single  point  of  accountability  and  relationship management for all customers  of Eskom. For the second phase going  forward, a 12-month transformation  journey has been developed to eliminate  the negative sentiments of the public  about Eskoms customer service. The phases for 2012/2013 will be focused  on:   Getting the basics right by simplifying,  standardising  and  optimising  our  processes, systems and data, as part of  Eskoms Back2Basics programme.   Building skills to enhance people and  organisation competence to ensure the  best people are the face of Eskom to  customers.  Through  the  Eskom  Academy of Learning, the School of   Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 82 On-line vending system The on-line vending system in Eskom had  operational performance issues that affected  customers in the country on a large scale at  the end of 2011 and start of 2012. The  problems were mainly due to infrastructure  issues during the change-over to new  hardware. In addition to this a vendor  software system malfunctioned after they  made changes to their system. The system is  operating normally and is being closely  monitored. No major incidents have been  experienced since the middle of February  2012. The infrastructure is in the process of  being replaced, and further application  changes by the vendor are anticipated in  the near future. No further unplanned  interruptions are expected as all known  issues have been resolved. Eskom understands the impact to the  customer when system issues are  experienced and apologises for the  inconvenience caused.  Benchmarking Customer service index Eskom uses a combination of monthly  perception and interaction-based customer  surveys to measure the service delivered to,  and the satisfaction of, its residential, small  and medium customers. The index  combines the results of two external  surveys and four internal measures. Eskom  achieved a score of 85.55% (2011: 84.37%)  against the target of 85.82%. Eskom uses  these results to identify which aspects of  service require improvement.  Demand-side management Commercial and industrial initiatives Eskom will continue to engage with  customers about balancing supply and  demand during periods of generation  constraints.  Large  customers  have  responded  favourably  and  already  contribute to the stability of the national  power system by reducing load through  power buy-back agreements and demand- side management initiatives. Eskoms demand market participation  programme is to be extended to small  industrial and commercial undertakings  through a programme called demand  response aggregation. This programme  will be piloted for customers consuming  more than 500MW. The proposed Energy Conservation  Scheme, if passed into law, will see energy- reduction targets being set for the  countrys 500 largest electricity users and  charges imposed for non-compliance.  Eskom has already implemented a  voluntary energy conservation scheme  and is engaging with the South African  Local Government Association and  municipalities to help their customers  implement energy-conservation measures. Power buy-back initiative As part of the efforts to create the  necessary space to perform essential and  critical generation plant maintenance,  Eskom has entered into power buy-back  agreements with certain of its large  industrial customers. The power buy-back  period is typically for 30 days or  longer with all current agreements  terminating by 31 May 2012. The  requirement is that customers reduce  their base load demand and this reduction  is purchased by Eskom at a rate negotiated  with customers. The rate takes into  account the customers fixed costs,  contractual obligations and various other  requirements, including the requirement of  no permanent job losses. Value chain performance continued  83 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 This initiative has proved to be beneficial in  creating the additional space on the power  system through base load demand  reduction. During this power buy-back  period, lower-than-usual commodity prices  and surplus stock levels would have had a  significant negative impact on the economy,  jobs  and  our  customers  business  operations. Eskom believes that through  the power buy-back scheme, customers  are in a slightly more favourable position  than they would have otherwise been in  creating a win-win situation for both  parties. Residential initiatives A residential mass rollout programme has  recently  been  approved  to  make  households more efficient by installing  low-flow shower heads, LED lamps, pool  timers and geyser blankets.  There has been a significant increase in  solar water-heating system installations,  with 158 175 claims (27 149 for high- pressure systems and 131 026 for low- pressure systems) verified during the  financial year.  Eskoms Power Alert and geyser evening  campaigns between 17:00 and 21:00 aim  to reduce power demand during the  evening peak.  Eskom internal initiatives Eskom aims to improve the energy  efficiency of its plants and offices by  conducting energy audits and undertaking  efficiency programmes that focus on  lighting, heating, ventilation and air- conditioning. The demand savings of  1.4MW achieved in 2011/12 translates to  energy savings of 45.0GWh (2011:  26.2GWh) for the year, against a target   of 25.5GWh.

Safety A price cannot be put on the value of  human life or that of human abilities. While  many campaigns, policies, procedures and  programmes have been instituted in  Eskom over the past few years to prevent  occupational health and safety (OHS)  related incidents and fatalities, the results  of  these  interventions  have  been  unsatisfactory as highlighted by the Eskom  safety record.  To deliver on the OHS objectives, the  OHS capability within Eskom from a policy,  compliance and implementation co- ordination perspective has been centralised  into a single department within Eskom.  This department will drive the OHS  strategy which focuses on addressing  seven key areas to achieve the desired  objectives and bring about the step  changesought: 1.  Connecting OHS to everything that is  done in Eskom and personalising OHS 2.  Attaining commitment to ZERO harm  and OHS across Eskom 3.  Making  compliance  with  OHS  requirements a non-negotiable 4.  Ensuring that Eskom has an optimal  OHS organisation structure resourced  with the required competencies and  number of competent staff to deliver  on the OHS mandate In 2010/11, Eskom introduced the integrated high-performance  utility model for the identification of core capabilities,  processes and the required reporting that spans across the  entire value chain, including the service and strategic  functions.

The LTIR  target was not met, which is a great  disappointment, but the safety of our  people remains fundamental to our  business.  In risk-specific terms, the leading causes of  injuries were motor vehicle accidents,  caught between, and struck by objects and  falls. Quality management Eskom has made an undertaking to  develop and implement management  systems that are ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and  OHSAS 18001 compliant to achieve  sustainable performance improvement,  with zero harm to people and the  environment. The first milestone of this  performance improvement journey is the  establishment of ISO 9001 Quality  Management Systems as the foundation  for good business management. This will  pave the way towards positioning Eskom  for sustained success to ultimately become  a high-performance organisation and top  global utility. Upon achieving ISO 9001  compliance, the management systems will  be enhanced by addressing Environmental,  Health and Safety requirements. The  execution of the ISO  9001 implementation  plans is under way, with good progress  made on certification. Skills Eskom aims to grow human capital by  retaining core, critical and scarce resources,  and by effectively developing skills and  talent.  Eskom has sustained its skills base and a  significant number of learners received  training over the past five years. In 2011/12,  5 715  (2010/11:  4 240)  learners  (engineers, technicians and artisans), with  three- to four-year learning/bursary  contracts, were in the pipeline. This number  will increase to 5 907 in 2012/13, with  incremental increases in the years that  follow. By 2015/16, there will be a pipeline  of 6 100 learners.  All targets have been exceeded including  the  learner  pipeline,  engineering,  technician,artisan and a youth programme  of 5 159 for period 2011/12 against a  target of 2 100. Eskom is to implement an integrated  workplace skills plan to address the key  training priorities in closing the core and  critical competency gaps. Transformation and employment  equity Eskom has implemented an ambitious  employment equity plan, supported by a  long-term, target-setting strategy (Equity  2020) to drive the transformational  agenda. The plan seeks to create a  workplace and staff profile that is diverse  and inclusive, and to ensure that diversity  becomes the Eskom way.  89 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Zero fatalities  Zero injuries  Zero environmental incidents  Zero tolerance What should we do to achieve zero incidents at our site?

Eskom manages the national CFL clean  development mechanism project within  the terms of the emissions reduction  purchase agreement signed with BNP  Paribas in September 2010. Corporate social investment The Eskom Development Foundation  NPC is responsible for the corporate  social investment strategy. Eskom supports  governmental  priorities  in  skills  development, job creation and poverty  alleviation – particularly in communities  where the company implements its capital  expansion programme. The foundation  also donates to philanthropic and welfare  causes through registered non-profit  organisations.  Early childhood development is a major focal area  in Eskoms corporate social investment strategy The outcome of COP 17 presents many  opportunities. Eskom can:    Submit robust investment plans to the  government to access funding from the  Green Climate Fund when it becomes  available   Provide input to the technology  mechanism, which is intended to  support mitigation and adaptation to  climate change, based on Eskoms  experience in innovation, research and  development, through the Department  of Science and Technology   Provide input to the development of  the national adaptation plan through the  Department of Environmental Affairs  and Department of Energy   Access additional sources of revenue for  new technologies and energy-efficiency  programmes through the carbon  markets.  Eskom will use the momentum from  COP  17 to further entrench its energy- efficiency messages and discuss the effort  and resources required to diversify the  electricity mix.  The Department of Environmental Affairs  issued a white paper on the national  climate change response in November  2011. This document outlines a process, to  be concluded within a two-year period, for  developing (in consultation) sectoral and  company carbon budgets that align with  South Africas pledge at Copenhagen.

The  allowance for impairment for electricity  receivables increased from R2.8billion to  R3.3 billion over the same period.  Repairs and maintenance Other group operating expenses for the  year to 31 March 2012, which amounted  to R15.2 billion (2010/11: R12.1 billion) for  the group and company, consist primarily  of repairs and maintenance and are  monitored closely.  The  companys  gross  repairs  and  maintenance expenditure1 for the year to  31 March 2012 was R17.6 billion (2010/11:  R14.1 billion). Ensuring that the outage  plan is executed in good time remains a  challenge given the electricity demand- and-supply balance.  Company repairs and maintenance costs  of R3.2 billion (2010/11: R2.1 billion), that  were classified as major overhauls, were  capitalised during the year.  Financial performance continued 1.  Including employee benefit cost relating to repairs and maintenance.  103 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 The groups maintenance cost is slightly less  than the companys due to the elimination  of intercompany transactions, stemming  from maintenance work performed by  Eskom subsidiaries Roshcon and Rotek.  Net fair value loss on financial  instruments, excluding embedded  derivatives The net fair value loss on financial  instruments,  excluding  embedded  derivatives, was R2.4 billion for the year to  31 March 2012 (2010/11: a loss of  R1.8 billion) for the group and a loss of  R2.4 billion (2010/11: a loss of R1.9 billion)  for the company. These losses consist  primarily of the costs attributable to the  rolling over of forward exchange contracts,  all of which are 12 months in duration.  The costs vary from period to period  due to the timing of the placement of  related procurement contracts and  exchange rates. Gain on embedded derivatives The net impact on the income statement  of changes in the fair value of the  embedded derivatives (relating to the  special pricing agreements) for the group  and company was a fair value gain for the  year to 31 March 2012 of R0.3 billion  (2010/11: loss of R1.3 billion). The  embedded derivative assets were Rnil  (2010/11: Rnil) and liabilities amounted to  R5.5 billion (2010/11: R5.9 billion).  Discussions continue with interested  parties, including the Department of Public  Enterprises and the National Treasury, to  find a solution regarding the remaining  special-pricing agreements. Net finance cost After capitalising borrowing costs and  including unwinding of interest on  provisions, the net finance charges for the  year to 31 March 2012 was R4.0 billion  (2010/11: R4.7 billion) for the group and  R3.9 billion (2010/11: R4.8 billion) for the  company. Gross finance income for the  year to 31 March 2012 was R3.5 billion  (2010/11: R2.4 billion) for the group and  R3.6 billion (2010/11: R2.4billion) for the  company.  Gross finance cost for the group and  company for the year to 31March 2012  was R12.2 billion (2010/11: R15.4 billion).  Included in gross finance cost was the  effect of a re-measurement of the  government loan at 31 March 2012  resulting in a gain of R5.5 billion (2010/11:  R2.5 billion loss).  The combined borrowing  costs capitalised for the group and  company was R5.0 billion for the year  (2010/11: R8.6 billion). Unwinding of  interest for the group and company  amounted to R2.0 billion (2010/11:  R1.7billion). Gross finance costs (excluding the  remeasurements of the government loan)  continue  to  increase  as  additional  borrowings are raised to fund the capital  expansion programme. The weighted  annualised cost of borrowing as at 31March  2012 was 9.78%1 (2010/11: 9.54%).  Taxation  The effective tax rate for the year was  28.0% (2010/11: 27.9%) for the group and  28.3% for the company (2010/11: 28.2%),  1. Excluding Government loan remeasurement.  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 104 both in line with the current statutory tax  rate of 28%. On a company level, provision  is made only for deferred tax as Eskom is  in an assessed lossposition. Liquidity and capital resources  The groups cash and cash equivalents  increased from R12.1 billion at 31 March  2011 to R19.4 billion at 31 March 2012.  The companys cash and cash equivalents  grew from R11.5 billion to R18.4 billion in  the same period. Cash and cash equivalents, together with  liquid investment in securities, amounted  to R40.5 billion (2010/11: R49.9 billion).  The group currently carries sufficient funds  to cover Eskom comfortably for the next  financial year. Based on the latest  projections and including the signed and  committed facilities per the planned draw- down schedule, Eskoms requirements are  covered beyond March 2013.  Cash flows from operating  activities The groups net cash inflow from operating  activities for the year was R38.5 billion  (2010/11: R22.7 billion), while the company  had a net cash inflow of R38.5 billion  (2010/11: R22.1 billion). The free funds  from operations at 31 March 2012 stood  at 15.15% (2010/11: 9.51%) of gross debt  for the group. The improvement in the cash flows from  operating activities and in the free funds  from operations as a percentage of gross  debt is primarily due to the increased  operating profitability of the company. Cash flows used in investing  activities Cash flows used for investing for the  year under review were R59.9 billion  (2010/11: R46.5 billion) for the group and  R59.0billion (2010/11: R44.9 billion) for the  company. The group capital expenditure  cash flows included in this line item,  excluding capitalised interest, amounted  to R59.5 billion (2010/11: R45.3 billion)  primarily due to the progress of the capital  expansion programme.  Cash flows from financing  activities The net cash inflows from financing  activities for the year were R28.7 billion  (2010/11: R20.3 billion) for the group and  R27.4 billion (2010/11: R19.4 billion) for  the company. The raising of borrowings  and the issuing of securities per the funding  plan have been slowed to match the  reduced capital expenditure. The debt-to- equity ratio for the group (including long- term provisions) as at 31 March 2012 was  1.64 (2010/11: 1.61) and for the company  1.69 (2010/11: 1.66). Funding update Eskom maintains healthy cash reserves. The  funding progress remains positive and, in  line with corporate practice internationally,  a portion of the next financial year (ending  March 2013) is already prefunded. The global sovereign credit crisis and the  anticipated implications of new global  banking regulations (Basel III) have not yet  materially affected Eskoms ability to access  funding, but have made such funding  increasingly expensive. Financial performance continued  105 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 The Ingula pumped storage scheme near Ladysmith is built mainly underground During 2011/12 South Africas sovereign  rating outlook was changed to negative by  major ratings agencies. Given the close  relationship between the sovereign and  Eskom ratings, the rating agencies revised  Eskoms outlook to negative. While Eskom  has not observed any direct impact as a  result of the change, it did have an  immediate effect on the rand, which  consequently affected hedging activities.  From a new funding point of view the  major focus over the past year was on the  Sere wind farm and the Upington pilot  concentrating solar plant, which will be  financed by the Clean Technology Fund in  conjunction with other developmental  finance institutions. Eskom has also secured  export-credit-backed financing from both  the US Export and Import Bank (for Kusile  power station) and obtained approval by  SACE in Italy (for the Ingula underground  works contract). By the end of 2011/12 Eskom had secured  more than 77% of the funding required for  the capital expansion programme. Of the  R23.4 billion allocated as other in the  funding plan, Eskom has identified and  partially secured R13.2 billion from various  sources. This includes facilities that have  already been signed, primarily related to  funding for renewable projects. Eskom  continues to explore other sources of  funding, including Islamic bond finance  (Sukuk), preference shares and retail bonds.

The  expected magnitude of the future build  programme will require a funding approach  that continues to support Eskoms long- term standalone investment credit rating,  and which may include technology and/or  equity partners for certain aspects of the  strategy. The success of the strategy will  require certainty on the tariff trajectory  and a flexible approach that allows for  potential industry restructuring.  107 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 Summarised group annual financial statements Maintenance on the distribution network near Cullinan, Gauteng  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 108 Contents Approval of the summarised group annual financial statements 109 Report of the independent auditors 110 Summarised group statement of financial position 112 Summarised group income statement 114 Summarised group statement of comprehensive income 115 Summarised group statement of changes in equity 116 Summarised group statement of cash flows 120 Selected notes to the summarised group financial statements 122  1 General information 122  2 Basis of preparation 122  3 Significant accounting policies 123  4 Income tax expense 123  5 Changes to subsidiaries/common control transaction 123  6 Unusual changes impacting the statements of financial position,  income,comprehensive income and cash flows 123  7 Critical accounting estimates and judgement  124  8 Issuances, repurchases and repayments of debt securities 124  9 Dividend paid 124 10 Segment information 125 11 Material events subsequent to 31 March 2012 130 12 Material changes in property, plant and equipment 130 13 Material changes in contingent liabilities 130 14 Material changes in capital commitments 131 15 Issued share capital 131 16 Related-party transactions 131 17 Revenue 131 18 Employee benefit expense 131 19 Cash generated from operations 132 20 Restatement of comparatives and change in accounting policies 133 The summarised group annual financial statements have been prepared under the supervision  of the finance director, PS OFlaherty CA(SA).

The unrealised portion of the net change in fair value  is not distributable and has been reallocated from a distributable reserve (accumulated profit) to a  non-distributable reserve. 6.  The insurance reserve is a contingency reserve created in terms of the Short-term Insurance Act, no 53  of 1998. 7.  The foreign currency translation reserve comprises exchange differences resulting from the translation of  the results and financial position of foreign operations. 8.

Refer to note 20.  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 122 Selected notes to the summarised group  financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 1. General information Eskom Holdings Limited changed its name to Eskom Holdings SOC Limited  (Eskom) in terms of the Companies Act of South Africa, 71 of 2008, which came  into operation on 1 May 2011. Eskom, a public company and holding company of  the group, is incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of South Africa. Eskom is  an integrated operation that generates, transmits and distributes electricity to  industrial, mining, commercial, agricultural, municipalities, and residential customers  and to international customers in southern Africa.  2. Basis of preparation The summarised group annual financial statements of Eskom as at and for the year  ended 31 March 2012 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (together  referred to as the group) and the groups interest in associates and joint ventures.  The summarised group financial statements do not include all of the information  required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with  the Eskom Holdings SOC Limited 31 March 2012 annual financial statements. The   audited annual financial statements of the group and company as at and for the year  ended 31 March 2012 are available for inspection at the companys registered office  and on the Eskom website at www.eskom.co.za/IR2012/021.html. The summarised  group annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with the recognition  and measurement principles of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),  presentation and disclosure requirements of IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, and  in the manner required by the Companies Act of South Africa, 71 of 2008.  The summarised group annual financial statements are prepared on the historical  cost basis except for the following financial instruments which are measured at fair  value: 	 embedded derivative assets and liabilities 	 financial instruments classified under held-for-trading 	 financial instruments classified under available-for-sale 	 post-retirement medical benefits  123 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 3. Significant accounting policies The accounting policies applied by the group in these summarised financial  statements comply with IFRS. With the exception of the revised IAS 24 Related party disclosures, there were no  new and revised standards and interpretations effective during the year ended  31March 2012 that were relevant to the group. The revised IAS 24 Related party  disclosures provides an exemption for government-related entities. The revised  standard still requires disclosures that are important to users of financial statements  but eliminates requirements to disclose information that is costly to gather and of  less value to users.  4. Income tax expense Income tax expense recognised for the full financial year is in accordance with  IAS12 Income taxes. 5. Changes to subsidiaries/common control transaction The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor SOC Limited (PBMR) was previously not  consolidated as it was not considered to be controlled by Eskom Enterprises SOC  Limited (Eskom Enterprises) in terms of the shareholders cooperation agreement.  However, with effect from 1April 2011, Eskom Enterprises obtained control over  PBMR due to the termination of the cooperation agreement and consequently  consolidated PBMR as per IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements.  The acquisition of PBMR is considered to be a business combination between  entities under common control. Therefore all of the assets and liabilities have been  recognised at their book values at the date of acquisition and the excess of the  purchase consideration over the net assets of PBMR has been recognised directly  in equity. 6. Unusual changes impacting the statements of financial position,  income, comprehensive income and cash flows There have not been any unusual changes impacting the summarised statement of  financial position, income statement, statement of comprehensive income and  statement of cash flows during the year ended 31 March 2012.  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 124 7. Critical accounting estimates and judgement Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and are based on historical  experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are  believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The group makes estimates and  assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by  definition, seldom equal the related actual results.  The significant estimates and judgements made by management in applying the  accounting policies and the key sources of estimating uncertainty were substantially  the same as those applied to the financial statements for the year ended  31 March 2011 except for the forward pricing curve. The forward electricity price  used to value the embedded derivatives at 31 March 2012 is based on the current  MYPD 2 approved tariff for 2012/13 of 16%, and a forward tariff path for the next  five years (2013/14 to 2017/18) that ultimately achieves cost reflective tariffs. 8. Issuances, repurchases and repayments of debt securities The nature of the groups issuances, repurchases and repayments of debt securities  are consistent with those reported previously. The details of the debt raised and  repaid by the group are disclosed in the statement of cash flows. 9. Dividend paid No dividend was paid to the shareholder during the year ending 31 March 2012  (2011: nil). Selected notes to the summarised group  financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012  125 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 10. Segment information Segment information for the year ended 31 March 2012 Management has determined the reportable segments, as described below, based  on the reports regularly provided, reviewed and used by the executive management  committee (Exco) to make strategic decisions and assess performance of the  segments. The reportable segments have been aligned with Eskoms new operating  structure. The prior year segment report has been restated in line with the new  structure. The following summary describes the operations in each of the groups reportable  segments: Generation Consists of the generation and primary energy functions.  These functions procure primary energy and generate  electricity for sale. Transmission Consists of the transmission grids, systems operations and  the South African Energy (international buyer). These  functions operate and maintain the transmission network  for transmitting electricity and also sell bulk electricity to  international customers. Distribution Distribution consists of nine provincial operating units. These  units provide, operate and maintain the distribution network  for distributing. Group customer  services Group customer services consists of the customer service  and integrated demand management functions and sells  electricity to key large, redistributors, large and small  customers. Group capital Group capital is responsible for the planning, development,  monitoring of all capital projects and the execution of  capacity expansion projects. All other  segments Relates to operating segments which are below the  quantitative thresholds for determining a reportable  segment in terms of IFRS 8 Operating segments. These  include the groups subsidiaries. Corporate and  other Relates to all service and strategic functions which do not  qualify as a reportable segment in terms of IFRS 8 Operating  segments.

Restatement of comparatives and change in accounting policies Related parties The revised IAS 24 Related party disclosures became effective during the current  financial year. The revised IAS 24 provides government-related entities an  exemption which eliminates the requirements to disclose information that is costly  to gather and of less value to users. The group applies the IAS 24 paragraph 26  exemption in respect of its relationship with public entities at the national and local  levels of government. Related party disclosures were previously not separately  provided for municipalities, which are at the local sphere of government, as the  specific guidance from SAICA was applied, which allowed that where management  deemed this to be appropriate, only related party disclosure at the national sphere  needed to be provided. The revised IAS24 requires that where management elects  to use the exemption, transactions that are individually significant or individually  insignificant but collectively significant should be quantitatively or qualitatively  disclosed. As a result, a quantitative indication of transactions with municipalities and  entities in the national government sphere is accordingly disclosed. IAS 24 contains only disclosure and not measurement requirements. Therefore, the  revision to IAS 24 did not have an impact on amounts previously recognised in the  groups financial statements. Voluntary change in accounting policy with respect to the presentation of  foreign exchange gains and losses Previously, the group presented foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to  loans and receivables, debt securities issued and borrowings in profit or loss within  finance income or finance cost. With effect from 1 April 2011, the group presents  foreign gains and losses in profit or loss within net fair value gain/(loss) on financial  instruments, excluding embedded derivatives.  This change in accounting policy was considered appropriate to give a fairer  presentation of the groups risk management policy of hedging foreign transactions  by disclosing the impact on profit or loss of foreign exchange differences in the  same line in profit or loss as where gains and losses on derivatives held for risk  management are disclosed, which is within net fair value gain/(loss) on financial  instruments, excluding embedded derivatives.  Restatement of comparative information for the statement of cash flows The comparative cash flow statement has been reclassified to enhance disclosure. Restatement of accumulated profit at 31 March 2010 The amortisation period on the euro bond loan was restated, resulting in an  adjustment between cash flow hedge reserve and accumulated profit of  R494million.  Eskom Holdings SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012 134 Selected notes to the summarised group  financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 20. Restatement of comparatives and change in accounting policies  (continued) Employee benefit obligations Previously, all employee benefit related obligations recognised in terms of IAS 19  Employee benefits were not presented in the same line item on the statement of  financial position. A reclassification was made and all employee-related obligations  are now presented in the same line item on the statement of financial position  within Employee benefit obligations.

These  focus areas are:    Safety – no operating condition or  urgency of service justifies exposing  anyone to safety risks. Eskom must  exhibit a safety culture driven by  leadership and individual behaviour.   Keep the lights on – Eskom is working  to ensure security of supply and  demand-side savings by improving coal  quality, giving IPPs access to the  transmission grid and reducing power  demand through programmes such as  the Energy Conservation Scheme and  the residential mass rollout programme.    Ensure financial sustainability – the  MYPD 3 application will be a high  priority.   Deliver on the capacity expansion  programme – Eskom aims to deliver  high-quality capacity expansion projects  on time and within budget, while  providing all South Africans with access  to electricity.    Improve operations – the focus will  beon implementing and embedding the  Back2Basics programme (processes,  systems and tools) and various division- specific  programmes  to  achieve  operational excellence.
