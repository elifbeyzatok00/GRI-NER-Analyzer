The Imperative of Hope Wipro Sustainability Report 2010-11  The theme of our sustainability report for 2010-11 The imperative of hope  symbolizes the pressing need for seeking answers to the intractable social and  environmental problems that the world faces in a spirit of optimism and courage.  The challenges are so many and so deep rooted  that many view them with a sense  of resignation as part of an existential dilemma that we can only hope to cope with  and not ever resolve. For the business sector meanwhile, these problems have brought center stage the  crucial  questions of being responsible and being sustainable,   answers to which  are not very clear even to the best minds.  The notion of a responsible business  has gained currency rapidly in recent years and is broadly equated to good  corporate citizenship – Comply with all regulations, Reduce ones environmental  impact and Engage on community initiatives. In comparison,the idea of  sustainability in business is much more complex and nuanced, related as it is to  larger ecological and social issues. Two such big challenges – Climate Change and  Universal health – illustrate the complexity involved  Where will solutions for Climate Change come from   From big disruptive  technology innovations ? or from several small efficiency levers? or from a  radical structural shift to a society that de-emphasizes energy intensive  lifestyles? or from continuing with the status quo and shift the focus to adaptation  to the possible negative effects of climate change  How do we progress on the war against disease and malnutrition   From  increased government spending on public health and nutrition? or from  grassroots innovation that provide affordable healthcare solutions? or from   radical financial disincentive programs that discourage consumption of foods  that are known to cause lifestyle diseases  What is immediately apparent in both the above examples is that it is not any  one single approach that will work, rather a multitude of perspectives and  approaches will be necessary. What is perhaps not clear to many is the role of the  business sector in combating such challenges and the raison detre for its involvement.  At  Wipro, we believe that there are multiple reasons why business must not only  get involved but must lead and take charge  on issues of sustainability– ranging from  the logic of doing well by doing good  to the fundamental notion that business enjoys  great power today which vests it with equally great responsibility. Further, it is an  almost axiomatic truth that the survival and well being of business is inextricably  linked to the survival of the society and planet that it is a part of.   Over the last four years, we have set up the momentum for a corporation wide  sustainability program at Wipro that involves employees, customers, suppliers,  investors, the government, communities and the education system. As part of this  charter, we have defined some very aspirational goals on dimensions like GHG  emission reduction, Water, Waste, Biodiversity, People Diversity and the Supply  Chain. Like everyone else, we face many  of the dilemmas and conundrums that exist  around sustainability  and progress is not always as fast we would like. But, to our  minds, the apt analogy to view such situations is that of mountaineer battling every day  towards the peak where during difficult conditions just staying alive is progress.  This is the underlying spirit that this reports theme embodies : the imperative for  organizations to stay the course and journey forward. however slowly, with a sense  of determination, the imperative of hope. THE IMPERATIVE OF HOPE For this report, we invited some of the best minds to pen their thoughts on  some  of the core sustainability issues. What we have is a bouquet of  independent, informed and insightful essays. Why and What next for  corporate sustainability? Why report ? Universal Electrification, is it a  possibility? What the natural world means to us ? What is quality education?  Cities and are they places for Biodiversity? These perspectives come with  the richness of experience, the feel for things and the underlying  indomitable spirit of hope against odds.  CONTENTS 1. LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN 3 2.

It was  started with the intention of bringing the run loving community at Wipro together and also to celebrate the  essence of Spirit of Wipro as a community. The annual, global run has become a recent  tradition at  Wipro  and is really about people who love to run. The runs most recent 6th edition was held on 15th October 2011.  Images from the Spirit of Wipro Run 2011 run through this report. Miles with the Sun as it was called, the run was  held in over 56 cities across the world and relayed across countries with the dawn at Philippines and ended in  Vancouver 24 hours later. The Run is a time when diverse cultures, races and 24,000 people come together to  celebrate the Spirit of Wipro in all its magnificence. What made it richer, vibrant and more exciting this year was  the fact that each of the 56 locations decided to add a cultural feature to the run. Each location began the  celebration with a local culture piece of that region – for example India had performances like the Chenda,  Dollu Kunitha and Bhangra to kick off the run, China had the dragon dance, Canada a drum circle and  there were flash mobs in Romania! 15th October 2011 was truly one of the longest days in the history of  Wipro as an organization, where  Wiproites from around the world embarked on a unique journey to keep the  sun from setting.   Dear  fellow Stakeholders, Welcome to our fourth sustainability report. We started publishing our sustainability report in 2008. However,  our sustainability journey has been much longer. I refer here to our decade old  program in education, the even longer term engagement with our local communities  and the continuing initiatives on water & energy conservation. I also refer to our core  values, beliefs and principles of conduct, which have always served as our bedrock.  Let me present a brief overview of our sustainability program.  Resource efficiency is central to how smartly the world manages its depleting  resources. At Wipro, we have a long history of efficiency driven actions, both with  respect to resources and to our business processes. For example, over the last  decade, we have realized an improvement of more than 30% on our electricity  consumption on a per employee basis. Our initiatives on energy efficiency span a wide  range: from strategic initiatives like our green building  program (with LEED  certifications) to smart projects like the server virtualization program and to  employee-led actions on saving paper, transportation fuel and electricity. Our  thrust on water efficiency encompasses the three dimensions of recycling, rain  water harvesting and conservation with recycling accounting for 32% of our total  water requirements.  We ensure that nearly 83% of our waste gets recycled or reused  appropriately. Climate change: Our commitment to the global challenge of climate change is  reflected in the ambitious five year green-house-gas reduction targets that we have  set for ourselves. The adoption of renewable energy (RE) is a crucial plank of our  reduction strategy and nearly 10% of our current electricity procurement comes  from RE sources.  But in order for us to be able to scale up in line with our targets, we  think that several challenges need to be addressed to accelerate the creation of   renewable energy capacity and supply. We stay committed to working closely  with the relevant stakeholders in this regard, including the governments.  Diversity: We continue to drive our momentum on increasing the diversity quotient  of our workforce on the three dimensions of gender, nationality and people with  disability. Women constitute 28% of our workforce with many in senior leadership  LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN roles. 20% of our employees are from nationalities besides India, this is a three-fold  increase over a two year period. 253 people with disability are now part of the  Wipro team.  As we focus on increasing these numbers, we are striving hard to make  sure that our facilities meet and exceed the access norms for people with disability. Our programs on education and community engagement continue to get stronger  every year, as does our environmental stewardship of the Wipro range of green  desktops and laptops. We are starting new initiative on sustainability in the supply  chain which we will strengthen in the coming years. You will find details of these  initiatives and more inside this report. While doing all of this is important, it is even more important to do it on a bedrock of  integrity and transparency.  Our commitment to transparency is reflected in several actions, including a report  like this and in other sustainability disclosures. I am happy to share that  we are now  a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for two years in succession, are  ranked # 1 in India in the Asian CSR Index,  ranked No. 1 in the Morgan Stanley  Capital International Emerging Markets Index and are a part of the Nasdaq Global  Sustainability 100 Index.  In the World Economic Forum at Davos, a few weeks back, I had the opportunity to  interact with several leaders from business and government. The overriding sentiment  was that a new world order needs to be constructed on the building blocks of the  three Es – Economic growth, Equitable society and Ecological sustainability.  This has been our view for some time. We also believe that business must play a  crucial role in making this happen. Government and civil society are equal  stakeholders in this mission, but as a crucible of innovation, problem solving and  value creation, the business sector is uniquely positioned to make a vital difference.  What it will take is a strong willed commitment to more responsibility and to walk the  extra mile. It will also require different mindsets, for as Albert Einstein  said many  decades back "The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of  thinking we were at when we created them."   Let me end by reaffirming our commitment to walking this path with determination  and optimism. Azim H Premji  004 Our sustainability report for 2010-11 is a reflection of how we view sustainability – as  something that is organization wide and is embedded in our communication to  employees, solutions to our customers and in our engagement with our global supply  chain. The summary that follows provides highlights of some of the work that we are  doing set against the larger sustainability context of these issues. Note:  We are a global company with a presence in more than 55 countries;  however, a lot of examples and metrics given below are India centric. This is more a  reflection of the fact that 80% of our workforce and our environmental footprint  is from our Indian operations. This is something that we clearly see changing in the  years to come with an increasingly global workforce and a commensurate  expansion of people and community initiatives. ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY Energy  Our world faces rapidly depleting natural resources accompanied by  significant collateral damage to the environment; India is already  staring at a looming crisis in energy, water and other key natural  resources. In such a scenario, conservation of resources, efficiency of  energy conversion and minimization of waste have become critical  drivers of value creation. Energy efficiency coupled with significant ramp-up in renewable energy purchase and  generation is the core plank of our GHG mitigation strategy over the next 3 years. We  have and will continue to look for opportunities in reducing energy footprint in other  areas through virtual computing, travel substitution technologies, transport and  logistics optimization. We will have focused targets for each of these levers as well as  benchmark ourselves with peers and leaders. Water We see that the meaning of efficiency in Water use assumes multiple dimensions: that  of recycling, harvesting and of conservation.  Recycling constitutes 32% of our water  provisioning, while all our new campuses also have significant rain water harvesting  capacity that helps recharge ground water. We are considering  2010 - 11 as the new baseline year to set our water goals. This is  mainly due to significant improvement in metering infrastructure at  source and consumption points. We plan to implement customized  water management plans for each of our key locations.  Over the last two years, we have been grappling with the realization that water is not  just another natural resource but a strongly emotive issue that is at the heart of  peoples lives and of cultures; and therefore the issue of water use is not just about  efficiency but also about its larger social and ecological impact. It is to understand  the nuances of this dimension of water and to act accordingly that we launched the  Responsible Water project. Starting with two of our large campuses in Bangalore  and Chennai, this uniquely important project will help us understand our upstream  trails of the water that we consume and its impact on proximate communities. Waste Wipro recognizes waste material as a valuable resource; this  value has been best realized by adopting stringent targets,  periodic monitoring, life cycle thinking, sustainable consumption,  in-house recycling units and vendor evaluations. With a focused  program over the years at each of our locations, we now recycle  83% of our waste disposed. The remainder of approximately 17%  is mainly disposed  to landfills. We have a target to reduce this to 5% by 2013. Biodiversity Nature provides us the best illustration of why diversity is critical;  it is well understood now that biodiversity or the plurality of  species is crucial to human well being – from providing new sources  of medical cures to preserving climate integrity and providing  livelihoods to millions. We think that the business sector must get  involved much more in the issues of biodiversity.  At  Wipro, we have started a unique  program of converting some of our facilities to biodiversity campuses, starting with  our campus at Electronic City in Bangalore. In addition, all our new campuses will be  designed on the principles of biodiversity. OUR REPORT IN SUMMARY  005  SUSTAINABILITY IN THE WORKPLACE Change and transformation come from empowered  people whether as individuals or as part of small  groups, teams, organizations, communities etc.  Spirit  of Wipro, our values framework, highlights this  powerfully by articulating the need to act with  sensitivity with all our stakeholders and through a  demonstrated Intensity to Win where the  winning implies both, our stakeholders and  Wipro. For our employees, sustainability assumes multiple dimensions – the assurance  of a fair workplace, the empowerment at all levels to express oneself and to  participate in the organizations development, the focus on continuous learning,  the emphasis on diversity and inclusivity and the close attention to health,  wellness and safety.  We look at these as part of an interrelated whole, not as silos.  For example, on the dimension of employee health and safety, our emphasis is holistic  and all round - starting with sound preventive health care practices that  emphasize balanced lifestyles with our yoga, gym and sports facilities encouraging  fitness as a way of life and going on to a comprehensively designed package of  health insurance and reimbursements that includes family and dependent parents. COMMUNITY INITIATIVES Health care is of course a central issue for the world and all countries, rich or poor,  face serious problems that need tackling. India faces several challenges on this front,  ranging from infant and maternal mortality to malnutrition and sanitation related  deaths. This clearly represents a huge loss and drain of human potential but what gives  reason for hope is that many of these problems are addressable with good,  cost-effective primary health care practices. It is with  this in mind that we initiated primary health care  projects under the aegis of Wipro Cares at our  operations in Waluj (Maharashtra), Tumkur  (Karnataka) and Hindupur (Andhra Pradesh).  Working through partners, we currently cover  34 villages with a combined population of 48000 and the results after a year of  operations have been extremely encouraging. We will continue to focus and step up  efforts in this direction. In a country of 1.3 billion + people, education is a prime mover of human potential and  capability; and yet, its advantages are not available to more than 30% of our  populaceand wherever available, it is incomplete and inadequate in various forms.  Wipro Applying Thought in Schools (WATIS), our program in school education  has been trying to address some of the systemic anomalies in our urban school  system for a decade now.  A detailed study that we undertook with Education  Initiatives, one of our partners on the quality of education in the top schools of the  country reveals a not too rosy picture of learning outcomes in subjects like science,  mathematics and social sciences; even more disconcerting were the findings  pertaining to attitudes and values around tolerance of diversity, sensitivity to the  disabled and ecological responsibility. This study reconfirms the nature of  challenges that face us in our education- it is something that we recognize well  through our decade long work during which period we have reached out to nearly  2000 schools and 10500 educators with an effective reach of 800,000 children,  all in collaboration with our network of more than 25 partners. Our effort is a small  but important nudge in the direction of making our school education system more  meaningful without which the much talked about demographic dividend of  Indias population is likely to remain a distant dream. Mission10X, our four year old program, with a vision to create a significant  improvement in the quality of engineering education has reached out to over 13,000  faculty members from more than 900 engineering colleges in India, covering 24 states  and Union Territories. SUPPLY CHAIN, CUSTOMERS AND INVESTORS Our supply chain engagement program, to be launched in 2012, recognizes the pivotal  role supply chain partners play in our sustainability journey. We also collaborate with  our customers to provide solutions to reduce their own ecological footprint. Our  record in disclosures and transparency, as rated by widely recognized independent  raters, helps investors make informed choices on responsible investing.   REPORT PROFILE  AND ASSURANCE  APPROACH Report Profile Materiality Determination Note on Data Metrics in this Report Wipros  Approach to Report  Assurance 2  REPORT PROFILE AND  ASSURANCE  APPROACH 008 In this section, we provide an overview of the profile of our sustainability report  for 2010-11; the profile provides the anchoring context in terms of coverage  and scope for the report itself. A key topic discussed in this section is  Wipros Materiality approach that helps determine the priorities of our  sustainability program and the corresponding disclosures.  In the latter part of this section, we articulate our approach to report assurance,  a key determinant of the quality and transparency of any report. Report Profile The profile of our sustainability report is covered under the following heads: Profile Parameter Time Period Scope and Boundary Content Data Methodologies Provides information on Reporting Period and  frequency of publishing the report Provides the scope of the report in terms of business  divisions that are covered and the sustainability topics  covered in each In this sub-section, a framework is articulated for  determining the relative materiality  of different  sustainability areas for Wipro - this largely determines  the depth of coverage of these topics in the report Provides a contextual framework of the underlying  processes, systems and empirical assumptions for the  data and metrics published in this report Brief Description Reporting period: The reporting period for this sustainability report is the  fiscal year April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011.  referred to hereafter in short as 10-11. Date of the most recent previous report: Our most recent sustainability  report was for the fiscal year 2009-10,  released in March 2011. Reporting cycle:  Our sustainability report is published on an annual basis.   This reports scope, content and boundary  The process for defining the scope of this report is based broadly on the  G3.1 guidelines provided by the GRI framework. The content of the report is  based on the following guiding principles. Scope and boundary: Wipro Ltd. is a diversified conglomerate with a strong  presence in the IT services, Consumer Products and Infrastructure Engineering  markets. This report is primarily for Wipros IT businesses. The adjacent chart  provides a visual representation of Wipros business divisions with the broad scope of  reporting for the IT business. The content of this report This is our fourth sustainability report and like our previous reports, we continue  to adopt the stakeholder format of reporting. Given that stakeholder inclusion  and engagement  is such a crucial cornerstone of the AA1000 and the GRI  frameworks, we believe that the stakeholder format is more appropriate for  focusing attention on concrete sustainability issues for each of the stakeholders.  In doing so, we are cognizant of the risk that some of the broader sustainability  issues may not fall under the ambit of any particular stakeholder and we have tried  to ensure that these are covered as relevant to the report.  - Americas - Europe - India - Japan - Middle East - Asia Pacific - Financial performance indicators for  all geographies - Environmental performance for all  geographies                    - Employee metrics for all geographies - Social Programs cover primarily India - Other qualitative reporting covers all  geographies (unless otherwise  specified) - India - Americas - Europe - Business Process Outsourcing - Financial performance indicators for  all geographies - Environmental performance for all  geographies - Employee metrics for all geographies - Social Programs cover primarily India - Other qualitative reporting covers all  geographies (unless otherwise  specified) - India - Enterprise Products - Personal Computers  (PCs) - Network Products The IT products  division serves only  the India market;  therefore wherever  the report contains  specific reference to  data on IT products, it  is for the Indian  geography - India - South East Asia - Personal Care  Products - Lighting - Furniture The sustainability  disclosures of  this division are  not covered  under this report The sustainability  disclosures of  this division are  not covered  under this report Geography  Presence Primary  Offerings Scope of  Reporting - India - Europe - Hydraulics - Water  Treatment - Clean Energy - Consulting - Package Implementation - Application Development &  Maintenance - Testing Services - Technology Infrastructure - Product Engineering Software Services IT Services IT Business  BPO Services WI IT Products Consumer  Care &  Lighting Infrastructure Engineering Table showing the scope and coverage of  the report REPORT PROFILE AND  ASSURANCE  APPROACH 009  Sustainability challenges – globally and in India – are many and it is critical that  organizations carefully choose the most material ones from these. This is important  so that adequate resources and management attention are allocated to these  initiatives. This process of Materiality Determination should logically be based on  the priorities of the organizations stakeholders. Wipros materiality determination framework is driven by the issues  that our seven stakeholders below consider relevant and important i. Employees ii. Current and Future Generations iii. Customers iv. Investors v. Suppliers vi. Community vii. Government and Policy Makers The identification and relative prioritization of material issues is based on a  combination of the following three factors:  a. Direct feedback from the stakeholder e.g. Employee perception survey,  Customer feedback,  Feedback from one-on-one interaction with government  and civil society b. Indirect inference from public sources of information e.g. CSR survey results in  the public domain c. Informed dialogue and discussion between  Wipro leaders  and employees in  meetings, open houses, blogs etc A detailed delineation of the primary sustainability issues for each of the above  stakeholders is available in Section 5 of the report. The distilled outcomes of the above processes are represented in the two matrices  below – one for Social and Human Rights and the other for Ecological & Economic  factors. The materiality of a particular sustainability dimension is based on the  combination of two criteria – The Stakeholders interest in the issue  and its  Relevance / Priority to Wipros IT Business. The seventeen sustainability dimensions – eight in Economic/Environmental and  nine in Social  – are really an aggregate of more granular parameters and factors  that are part of the GRI framework. The Annexure at the end of this chapter  details out the correlation between each of the seventeen dimensions and multiple  GRI indicators. Stakeholders' Interest High Medium Low Relative Relevance to Wipro Climate  Change Public Policy Biodiversity Product/Service Quality Resource Efficiency Pollution Economic Disclosures Public Benefit Medium High High Medium Low Medium High Safety & Health People Development Workplace Benefits Community Engagement Human Rights Anti-Corruption Diversity Voice of Stakeholder Freedom of  Association Stakeholders' Interest Relative Relevance to Wipro MATERIALITY DETERMINATION REPORT PROFILE AND  ASSURANCE  APPROACH 010 Materiality - Ecological / Economic Goals Materiality – Social / Human Rights  There are no significant shifts in the materiality positions of the 16 indicators  represented in last years report (see Page 13 of our 2009-10 report).  However, we have added a new dimension Community Engagement, taking the  total number of Materiality categories to 17:  The relationship between Business and its immediate community must be based on trust  and a common understanding of issues that affect both; Continuous engagement with the  community therefore becomes crucial in this context. The issues to engage with are many  and vary depending on the industry and the geography e.g. Primary Health Care,  Education and Sanitation are critical issues in rural India while Transportation, Tree Cover  and Pollution assume significance in an urban context. While Wipro has a decade old community program 'Wipro Cares', the only reason why this is  being introduced as a separate dimension in this year's report is due to its centrality to our  thinking and actions. Hence the dimension of community engagement in materiality matrices, is rated high  in relavance to both Wipro and the Stakeholders. The ten most material issues for this year remain the same as enumerated in the  last report with just Community Engagement getting added – these are those in the  Top-Right quadrant of the two matrices and reflect high relevance for both Wipro  and its stakeholders i. Product and Service Stewardship ii. Employee Health and Safety iii. Voice of the Stakeholder iv. Climate Change v. People Development vi. Workplace Benefits vii. Resource Efficiency viii. Pollution ix. Diversity x. Community Engagement These ten sustainability dimensions – and the balance seven as well – are covered in  detail in the rest of this report where we articulate Wipros vision, goals and  performance on these. REPORT PROFILE AND  ASSURANCE  APPROACH 011 This report contains several data metrics and numerical indicators that are  interwoven into the articulated flow of the different sustainability issues. These  metrics and numbers are derived from one or more of the following:  Enterprise IT systems or Manually systems ( largely in MS-Excel )   Based on standard protocols or on  organization-specific rules  e.g. the GHG protocol, Rules for calculating attrition  Based on assumptions and rules of thumb  Further, it is important to take note of the following points in the above context: i. Wipro maintains a sophisticated infrastructure of internal IT applications – based  on SAP R/3 ERP and other Enterprise applications - where most of the enterprise  data and information are captured, collated and analyzed.  These systems cover  financial, HR, sales, delivery and procurement processes. ii. Our financial systems comply with Section 404 of the Sarbannes-Oxley  framework. This implies a high degree of rigor and a robust system of checks and  balances that ensure integrity of financial data. iii. While our Environmental IT systems are not of the same maturity as our financial  and HR systems, we have been making steady progress in the automation of these  systems. The recording of all key EHS parameters in Wipro-owned campuses is  done in a central IT system; we have taken the first few steps in using tools for  GHG analysis – however, this continues to be a priority action area for us as we  plan to invest in more sophisticated automation in these areas. Changes with respect to last report The scope this year includes environmental performance data on Energy and GHG   for operations in all countries.( Please see Section 5c).

The visual below showing the  organizational architecture of Wipro illustrates this point – most of the boxes  reflect a long-term orientation that a company needs to assiduously build and  ingrain into its DNA. Business strategic planning at Wipro takes key inputs from a variety of  stakeholders with respect to changes, current and foreseen in the socio-economic  climate and/or technology landscape. These create various risks and opportunities  for a business entity. The purpose of enterprise risk management in an organization  is to manage, mitigate and optimize the risk for compliance and assurance to  various stakeholders. Hence the need for an integrated approach to governance  mechanisms, risk management and compliance. These assume greater importance  in a climate of changing regulatory landscape, increasing system complexity,  larger scale and deeper supply chain systems. In the following sections, we  articulate our approach to these interconnected elements, namely – Enterprise Risk  Management  and  Corporate  Governance. The visual is a summary of all key constituents of Wipros Sustainability  Governance and Management framework; in the following sections, we  describe in greater detail the dimensions of Enterprise Risk Management,  Corporate Governance and the Ombuds-process.

The top 16 risks and the current/planned  status in organizational preparedness and planning are shown below. We started  including climate change and sustainability risk from 2008-09 onwards. We have  started on a Comprehensive Sustainability Risk Inventorization Exercise,  which will provide us with a framework to assess and integrate core sustainability  risks into our enterprise strategy.  This exercise will be completed by June 2012. Wipro's  Top 16 risks (2010-11)  We classify risks in five categories – Emerging Risk, Concern, Threat,  Enhanced Threat and Post Risk Event; Similarly, we classify our responses to  risks in five categories -  Identify,  Assess, Recommend, Mitigate and  Optimize.

We are planning to implement a rigorous stress testing program to assess  repeatability and reproducibility of controls in Finance.  Information Security and  Procurement Processes.   We are consciously moving to a regimen of responding to weak signals backed by  program-managed mitigation and validation. This is also aligned to the Article 15 of  the Rio Principles (also known as precautionary principle ), which we subscribe to,  in our enterprise risk planning.

The lead independent directors primary role is to coordinate  the responsibilities and activities of the other independent directors.  Code of Business Conduct and Ethics:  Wipros Code of Business Conduct &  Ethics (COBCE) is a formal articulation of our approach and position on multiple  dimensions of business ethics and integrity. The COBCE along with our Environment  and Health & Safety policies provide policy shelter on a wide range of issues of ethics,  labor and human rights. The COBCE covers human rights, prevention of fraudulent  and corrupt practices, freedom of association, elimination of child and forced labor,  advertisement and media policy, avoidance of conflict of interest, prevention of sexual  harassment and unyielding integrity at all times.  The COBCE is socialized at multiple  points of an employees lifecycle - it is first covered as part of the induction program of  new hires and subsequently, every employee has to take an online test annually to  assert his familiarity with the tenets of the COBCE. We have a zero tolerance policy  AN ORGANIZATIONAL  PROFILE 026 for non compliance with the COBCE, especially on non-negotiable factors – e.g. child  labor, anti-corruption etc. More details of the COBCE are available at http://www.wipro.com/investors/Pages/corporate-governance.aspx  The Ombuds-process: Having a robust whistleblower policy that employees and  other stakeholders can use without fear or apprehension is a sine non qua for a  transparent and ethical company. Wipros Ombuds-process is designed to be this and  more. It allows and encourages any affected stakeholder to report breaches of the  COBCE and any other matter of integrity to the concerned Ombuds-person.  In Wipro, our Chief Risk Officer is also the Chief Ombuds-person who works with  designated Ombuds-person in each BU. The process ensures confidential and  anonymous submissions regarding (i) questionable accounting or auditing matters,  the conduct of which results in a violation of law by Wipro or (ii) substantial  mismanagement of company resources (iii) Any instance of sexual harassment or any  other form of discrimination (iv) Any violation of human rights as articulated in the  COBCE and as per the principles of the U.N.Global Compact.

Address  all  correspondence  to  cb@esmt.org Few concepts today have so totally captured the corporate  consciousness the world over as the twin ideas of corporate  responsibility (CR) and sustainability. Simply put, CR,  sustainability, corporate citizenship and many other similar  terms essentially connote that in todays business landscape, a  companys long term success and perhaps even survival is tied  to the stewardship of not only its own well-being but also  that of the natural and social environment in which it operates.  With stakeholders such as consumers, investors, and  employees paying increasing attention to companies social  THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE:  NOT A ZERO SUM GAME C B Bhattacharya,  E.ON Chair in Corporate Responsibility, and Dean of International Relations Professor,  and environmental footprints, CR efforts have moved into  uncharted management territory. We see companies  reengineering supply chains to make them greener,  supporting social causes through employee volunteer  programs, or lobbying for human rights. This is valuable  evidence for the importance of the concept of corporate  responsibility and a great help for the social and environmental  beneficiaries. At the same time, all this hoopla means that the low-hanging  fruit of corporate responsibility is mostly picked. Mere  engagement in corporate responsibility is no longer enough to  differentiate a company from its competitors in the eyes of  customers, employees and other important corporate  stakeholders. It is also not enough for managers to make a  business case for corporate responsibility by merely  demonstrating the economic value of energy or water  conservation. To make a boardroom case for continued  investment in CR, the real challenge for companies going  forward is to understand the conditions under which  stakeholders react favorably to corporate responsibility  Leveraging Corporate RESPONSIBILITY The Stakeholder Route to Maximizing  Business and Social Value C B BHATTACHARYA SANKAR SEN DANIEL KORSCHUN 028 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES  initiatives and reward companies through coveted behaviors such as loyalty and  positive word of mouth. Absent such understanding, it will be hard or even  impossible for companies to drive competitive advantage through corporate  responsibility. In other words, if stakeholders do not ultimately value corporate  responsibility, rewarding companies for their efforts in this domain, then corporate  responsibility  itself  cannot  be  sustainable. No wonder then, that successful companies are increasingly construing  corporate responsibility in terms of the interests of a specific but large and diverse  set of stakeholder segments (among those stakeholders are consumers,  employees and investors, but also communities, governments and the environment  itself). These efforts are shaped by the strong belief that endeavors in the corporate  responsibility domain can elicit company-favoring responses such as increased  purchases from customers and greater employee loyalty. But how is a manager to  know whether stakeholders will indeed respond positively to his/her CR  initiative? In our book Leveraging Corporate Responsibility: The Stakeholder Route to  Maximizing Business and Social Value my co-authors Sankar Sen, Daniel Korschun  and I have integrated over a decade of research that spans multiple global  companies and thousands of stakeholders to shed light on the conditions under  whichit pays to be good. The key premise of the book is that corporate  responsibility offers opportunities to foster strong stakeholder relationships that  create value not only for a company but also for society and the environment.  To find out the stakeholders real needs and expectations we delved into the  psychological underpinnings that govern stakeholders relationships with  companies. In particular, we focused on customers and employees, the two  1 stakeholder groups widely recognized to be the most important .We identified  the psychological levers that drive coveted stakeholder behaviors and  identified the conditions under which these psychological levers produce such  desired behaviors. Admittedly, this research was conducted primarily in the U.S.  and Europe, but given that our work is rooted in human psychology, we believe  that the results are applicable to other contexts as well. 029 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES Our research identifies three interdependent psychological levers that drive  stakeholder reactions to corporate responsibility: Understanding, Usefulness, Unity  (the 3Us model). The first lever is a stakeholders Understanding of a companys  CR initiatives. The first component of Understanding is awareness. Our research  shows that most customers and even many employees are not aware of what  companies do in the CR realm. The simple implication is that if they dont know, there  is no possibility that they can reward the companies for their CR initiatives. Once a  stakeholder becomes aware of a corporate responsibility activity, he or she often  questions the companys motivations for engaging in CR: Are they seriously trying to  help the community or is it just about profit? A study conducted for a Fortune 500  consumer goods company shows that awareness of a corporate responsibility  program (in this case a large donation to a child development center) yielded  significantly greater intent to purchase its products when stakeholders attributed the  donation to genuine concern for children on the part of the company. Notably,  stakeholders are remarkably supportive of profit or market motivations on part of  the company as long as the company shows genuine interest and makes a difference to  the social cause as well. As one focus group participant put it:  It (the market motive)  is good because they are going to help us along with themselves.  The second lever underlying stakeholder reaction to corporate responsibility is  Usefulness. Usefulness refers to the degree to which a CR initiative provides  benefit to the stakeholder. Much like products and services, CR initiatives also fulfill  certain fundamental needs for stakeholders. The needs that they fulfill and the  concomitant benefits they provide can either be functional in nature (e.g., energy  savings from more efficient appliances) or psycho-social (e.g., better integration of  work and personal life from working for a socially responsible company). Consider  this quote from an employee at a global consumer goods company: One of the things that Ive been putting a lot of thought into the last few years personally and  trying to move more and more in the direction of, is trying to overcome this complete  separation of work and non-work life. I dont want to leave here for them to say I have been selling soap. It is probably not quite what  I am after. So, the better I can meet the personal purpose and pair it with my professional   work, the more satisfied I am because then I see I can better combine the two. It is not the  choice do one or the other. Understanding and Usefulness work together to create a sense of Unity  (the third lever in our framework) between the stakeholder and the company.  Unity can best be described as a sense of belongingness to or connection between  the stakeholder and the company. Stakeholders develop a sense of Unity with a  company based partially on whether and how they Understand its corporate  responsibility activity and how much they find the activity Useful. Given a choice,  stakeholders tend to deepen their relationships with companies with which they  feel a sense of connection based on an overlap of values and withdraw from  companies with which they have a mismatch in values. Armed with the insight of the 3Us and how they work, companies can develop and  implement compelling corporate responsibility programs that drive positive  stakeholder reactions. When these levers work harmoniously, they produce the  greatest value for both the company and society, maximizing the triple bottom line:  people, planet and profit. It is important to note that we do not view corporate  responsibility as yet another cynical instrument of corporate profit. Instead, my  co-authors and I argue that for firms to gain value from their corporate responsibility  efforts those efforts must improve the lives of their stakeholders in significant ways.  In other words, creating social value is a prerequisite for creating business value.  One key implication of this framework is that companies need to eschew the idea that  corporate responsibility must be enacted in a top-down way. In spite of a strong  stakeholder involvement rhetoric, most companies continue to develop and manage  their corporate responsibility as a top-down process. In a recent survey, 71% of the  participating companies reported to the United Nations Global Compact that  corporate responsibility policies and practices are currently developed at the CEO  level. But in todays environment, there is a strong demand for co-creation. Our  research shows that the best way to improve Understanding of corporate  responsibility activities, to make activities maximally Useful to stakeholders and to  foster Unity is to actively involve stakeholders in corporate responsibility activities  whenever this is possible. Through co-creation, stakeholders become part of the  solution, thereby reducing gaps that exist between their expectations and the firms  response. Co-creation is not a new idea. Yet, most of the co-creation discussion and  action has centered on the need to engage the diverse sectors of society – particularly  NGOs, the government, the media and others. Less has been said and done  about engaging the companys primary stakeholders, such as employees and  consumers. What we find is that when most of the decisions are made by the  company itself, many employees are left feeling unempowered, unmotivated, and  sometimes even disillusioned and disengaged.  Another key implication to leverage corporate responsibility is that communication  needs to become more prominent in corporate responsibility planning. As  mentioned above, awareness of CR initiatives is quite low for many companies.  This holds not only true for the general public but even for employees. Even at  companies that invest huge resources and enact major sustainability programs,  awareness is frequently in the low double digits for consumers and around 50%  for employees.  Too many companies limit their corporate responsibility  communication to an annual report and a few electronic repositories. Just note this  quote by an employee who participated in a focus group: We actually do have a  volunteer website that gives you the organizations you could go to, but its obviously not  well-publicized. Its just sitting there on the L drive. Corporate responsibility management  needs to be accompanied by a communication plan that clearly articulates how  effective programs are, how they fit into the companys strategy and how corporate  responsibility can benefit different stakeholders. Finally, companies that want to maximize corporate responsibility value must measure  stakeholder responses with more discipline than they do at the moment.  It is quite common for companies to spend much money measuring customer  preferences of products and services or employee job satisfaction while only few use  the same disciplined approach when assessing the value generated by corporate  responsibility. The framework outlined in our book provides three leverage points  (Understanding, Usefulness, and Unity) that managers need to track and subsequently  relate to stakeholder behaviors as part of assessing reactions to corporate  responsibility among stakeholders. In short, the answer to the oft asked question,  Does it pay to be good? is a resounding, It depends! Investments in the CR and  030 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES  sustainability realm are rewarded by stakeholders only under certain conditions as  articulated above. But there is value to be extracted for those who get the  strategy right. This message is particularly relevant for India and other emerging  markets where CR and sustainability is still in relative infancy and if managers get it  right from the get go, they will be able to do a whole lot more good for the  environment and society as well as contribute to their bottom lines. It is time to  realize that the triple bottom line is not a zero sum game. The article is based on the recently published book Leveraging Corporate Responsibility:  The Stakeholder Route to Maximizing Business and Social Value, written by  C B Bhattacharya, Sankar Sen and Daniel Korschun and published by Cambridge  University Press. 1 McKinsey survey of 391 UN Global Compact participant CEOs (2007), available at  www.mckinsey.it/storage/first/uploadfile/attach/139881/file/cest07.pdf, accessed  November 2, 2011. 031 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES  Preamble:  The Sustainability Mobius Business and The Sustainability Megaforces Sustainability Strategy and Governance At Wipro The Wipro Sustainability Dashboard for 2010-11 Aligning with Sustainability Charters and Networks 4 WIPROS   STRATEGIC  PERSPECTIVE  BUSINESS AND THE SUSTAINABILITY MEGAFORCES Sustainability Megaforce Summary Update The business sectors role The Climate Change  Crisis The recently concluded COP 17 at Durban on climate change seemed  to provide some hope of a solution to the impasse on the Kyoto  Protocol. However, the deeper concern is that after more than ten  years of the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I – developed countries – are  nowhere near their GHG emission reduction targets.   Opinions differ on what must be done – ranging  from a dramatic  increase in R&D investment that will make renewable energy  technologically mainstream and commercially feasible to  geo-engineering solutions that will cool the planet to shifting the  focus from mitigation to adaptation, on the assumption that  catastrophic global warming is sure to occur. Of the Indian governments  National Action Plan on Climate Change,  the two missions on Solar and Energy Efficiency have gained significant  traction. The business sector must involve itself and take advantage of  the several opportunities that these missions will generate.  At the  same time, the government must provide a clear direction path, ensure  consistency in its policy of incentives, remove tariff barriers so that  access to leading edge technology is ensured and facilitate easier  financing for investment in clean energy. Business must set ambitious goals for itself on GHG reduction and  energy efficiency and back it up with the necessary investments.   Visionary companies are making early moves in research and in  developing new low-carbon products and services. WIPROS  STRATEGIC  PERSPECTIVE 034 The problems of sustainable development have emerged prominently onto the  center stage only in the second half of the 20th century when the world began to  understand and grapple with the multi-fold outcomes of rapid industrialization and  technology infused modernization. The environmental movement has its origins in  Rachel Carson's landmark findings in 1962 on the negative effects of DDT,  considered a wonder pesticide till then. Her seminal book 'The Silent Spring'  triggered off a wave of consciousness and actions around the need to find the right  balance between ecological preservation and economic considerations.  Ralph Nader's consumer rights movement around the same time brought focus  on issues of automobile safety and acted as a catalyst for manufacturers in all  industries to tighten standards of safety for the end user. The history of labor rights  goes back to the early twentieth century when the first unions were formed and when  Henry Ford I dramatically increased workers' wages as he saw them not just as  THE SUSTAINABILITY MOBIUS factors of production but as consumers and citizens in their own right.  In the latter  decades of the century, issues of child labor and discriminatory practices gained  attention as supply chains of companies spread out like webs into many more  countries, including in emerging economies. All along, the problems of poverty,  inequity, and corruption persisted and in fact, only got  exacerbated.  In the last decade has come the realization that these ecological, social and economic  problems cannot be compartmentalized; rather, they are deeply entwined with each  other with no clear start and end points – much like the mobius strip shown above.  At Wipro, we view sustainability challenges as mobius like in many ways. What  follows is our articulation of the eight sustainability megaforces that will shape the  21st century – we have been talking about these since our 2008-09 report and  each year is an updated summary of the developments on these eight dimensions.  Sustainability Megaforce Summary Update The business sectors role The number of people without access to clean drinking water or  sanitation continues to rise. Of the 1.1 billion people across the world  who do not have access to clean water, 400 million are from India.    India is widely recognized as a water-stressed country with withdrawal  to availability ratios  ranging from 0.5 to 0.8.  Access to clean water  is inevitably linked to positive outcomes on gender equity, higher life  expectancy and improved child mortality.  Agribusinesses and biotech companies must step up research on  water efficient seeds and crops. This will have a cascading impact on  water availability as agriculture accounts for more than 80% globally. Water intensive industries while continuing to reduce its water  consumption must ensure that community water resources are not  compromised. The business sector must further the agenda on water by going beyond  internal efficiencies and look at water from a responsible, wider angle  lens that includes social and ecological impacts of their consumption.  Further, they must take the lead on driving advocacy on fair and  equitable pricing of water – which implies a willingness to pay  significantly higher prices. The Looming Water  Disaster Sustainable Cities With more than 50% of the worlds population living in cities today  and with another 1.2 billion people set to join the ranks of city dwellers  by  2025,  cities  are  often  power  centers  in  their  own  right. Cities are held to be crucibles of innovation, diversity and wealth  creation; at the same time, they are responsible for a disproportionate  share of resource consumption, air and water pollution and for  destroying natural ecosystems.  The definition of a sustainable city must necessarily include several  dimensions – of buildings and living spaces that are culturally  congruent and ecologically sustainable, of infrastructure that is both  efficient and equitable  and a  social fabric that inspires diversity  and connectedness between people.  The business sector is one of the prime drivers of increased  urbanization and therefore has a major stake in reversing the tide of  unsustainable urbanization that is the norm today. Business must work with city governments in shaping the policy agenda  in the direction of sustainable urban spaces. Sustainable infrastructure – building materials, energy efficient assets,  mass transit systems, smart uses of technology along with the   preservation of urban  water ecosystems, biodiversity and green  spaces must find place the business sectors social agenda. Universal Education That education is the most powerful force multiplier in the vision of a  just, humane and sustainable society is almost axiomatic.  It is one of  the eight U.N. MDGs and high on the priorities of most governments -  Business must recognize that solving the seemingly intractable  problems of education cannot be the governments job alone. WIPROS  STRATEGIC  PERSPECTIVE 035  Sustainability Megaforce Summary Update The business sectors role and yet achieving universal education has proven to be an elusive goal  for many developing countries.  With nearly 35% of children in Class 5 in India not able to read or write,  we clearly have a long path ahead.  As the biggest customer for the education systems output –  employable talent - business must partner with government in  addressing the challenges of education. This will require a steely  willingness to get involved in a sector where the processes of change  are gradual and where outcomes are likely to become visible only over  decades. Social historians have  long held the view that diversity and pluralism  engender innovation Closely linked to diversity are the twin issues of Inclusivity and Human  Rights – eliminating discrimination on any ground and including  disadvantaged minorities in mainstream social processes is a crucial  driver of more diverse and vibrant schools, colleges, workplaces and  cities.    But as the latest U.N MDG reports indicate, progress has been slow.  On gender diversity for example: women continue to be over- represented in vulnerable jobs and under-represented in mainstream  jobs e.g. the proportion of women employees in industry has not  changed from 30% between 1999 and 2008. Empowerment of women has shown to be closely correlated with  variety of social outcomes e.g. the prevention of human rights abuses  like child labor, better management of community resources like  water and healthier offspring. The business sector must commit to strong affirmative action to  promote diversity and inclusivity at the workplace. The dimensions  must include gender, nationality, physical disability and economic  status at the minimum. Further, business must exercise oversight on its supply chain to  ensure that basic human rights are protected without exception –  in particular, child and forced labor must be avoided without  exception. Diversity, Inclusivity and  Human Rights Transparency is normally equated with ethical behavior,  anti-corruption and high standards of voluntary disclosures.  Financial corruption, as much as it is a moral issue, diverts crucial  monies from much needed spending on social challenges and has  therefore, an indirect but tangible impact on sustainability.  Disclosures  by institutions hold them up to public scrutiny and thereby, in a  constant state of responsible behavior. A recent Reuters survey disclosed that public trust in business in the  U.S. tumbled by 14%;  therefore, one of the business sectors  primary tasks is to restore trust in itself. This, it must do through  transparent disclosures about its products, what it is doing to  protect human rights within and outside the company and about its  zero tolerance for bribery, corruption and discriminatory practices. Ethics and Transparency WIPROS  STRATEGIC  PERSPECTIVE 036  Sustainability Megaforce Summary Update The business sectors role Rising food inflation in India and in many other parts of the world over  the last few years is seen by experts as symptomatic of a deeper  malaise with agriculture and the food supply chain. As the global  population is set to rise from 7 billion to 9 billion over the next four  decades, the problem of feeding the world adequately is further  compounded  by  considerations  of  equity  and  sustainability.  Agriculture is the biggest consumer of water, accounting for nearly  80%; Reducing the intensity of its water consumption can prove  central to water security in many countries.  Other sustainability  challenges include improving crop productivity without the use of  soil  depleting  pesticides  and  fertilizers. Biotech companies must engage and listen to the concerns of  environmentalists, nutritional scientists and citizen groups as they try  to develop solutions for crop productivity.  Food logistics companies must continuously reduce wastage in the  supply chain. Agri-business must collaborate with academia and research  institutes for ways of preserving and enhancing soil fertility for that  holds the key to sustainable food security. Sustainable Food An outcome of the global financial crisis of 2008 that is not widely  known is that the number of people living in extreme poverty has  actually risen since then. Fuelled by the economic crisis and rising  food inflation, nearly 2 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day at  2005 prices – as extreme poverty is defined. Linked with extreme  poverty are higher infant and maternal mortality, lower life  expectancy  and  poor  levels  of  education.  Business – in consonance with government - must address poverty  elimination in two ways – first, it must place job creation as one of its  central responsibilities and second it must address underserved and  unserved markets with appropriate products and services e.g.  microfinance, affordable product versions for the poor, local  sourcing that opens up local livelihood options, extremely  affordable  healthcare  etc. The fact that addressing these markets has a strong business case  should be further reason for the business sector to embrace the  poverty challenge whole-heartedly. Eliminating Poverty Wipro is deeply aware of these sustainability forces and the complex inter-relation between them. We are engaged intensely with some of  these, especially on the issues of climate change, water, education,  diversity and inclusivity and transparency. These are detailed in the rest of the report. WIPROS  STRATEGIC  PERSPECTIVE 037  SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE AT WIPRO The unique characteristic of corporate sustainability is that it straddles both the worlds of  business and the social arena outside; this can, however, result in its confused positioning within  the organization and therefore, it is critical to set up an effective governance structure that    Our view of corporate citizenship based on the belief that  business must get involved in social issues because it is the  right thing to do, and not because of compliance  pressures A compelling  vision that  has leadership  backing    year goals for Energy, GHG reduction, Water, Waste and  Biodiversity; these goals have year-wise milestones and  are part of all our public disclosures   We have similarly articulated statement of direction and  qualitative goals on Health and Safety, Diversity, Green  Computing and Wipro Education We have a  structured and well defined dashboard of five  Set well   defined  and  measurable  sustainability  goals    sustainability program at the corporate level;  WATIS and Wipro Cares carry distinct responsibilities  for education and community care programs.

What follows is a visual representation  of  key  elements  of  sustainability  governance  and  how  Wipro  tries  to  address  them. WIPROS  STRATEGIC  PERSPECTIVE 038  THE WIPRO SUSTAINABILITY DASHBOARD FOR 2010 - 11 For sustainability to be institutionalized within an organization, the same rigor of goal setting,  measurement and monitoring is necessary as is common in business operations. Sustainability  goals hide multiple layers and dimensions many of which are not quantifiable or where a numerical  metric does not disclose the complete picture. Our position therefore is that the rigor of goal  setting and tracking in the sustainability arena must not be equated to a set of neat numbers.  The goals and measures presented in the sustainability dashboard below are a condensed  summary but a complete understanding of these dimensions is possible only in the detailed  analysis  that  follows  in  subsequent  sections. Sustainability Dimension Key Performance Highlights (2010-11) Vision and Goals for Future Energy & GHG Intensity  Our Energy Efficiency per employee stood at 279 units (kwh) per month Vs  275 units per month for 2008-09. This marginal increase is largely explained by  a significant increase in the proportion of data centers in our business model.    After factoring for this, the metric is 270 units per month on a consistent  comparable basis, a reduction of nearly 1.5%  Our GHG emission intensity has reduced by 2.3% to 4.23 metric tons per  employee as compared to 4.33 metric tons in 08-09. It is to be noted that this  represents the aggregate of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions  To reduce the scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity  of Wipro's operations from 2.5 metric tons per employee  in 2010-11 to 1.3 metric ton per employee by 2014-15. This  target applies to all of our campus facilities and offices  For Date centers - which account for nearly 20% of our  energy consumption we are in the process of establishing a  metric that is representative of the nature of its operations  For Scope 3 emissions - we report on 5 of the scope 3  emission categories. Baseline goal for overall scope 3 will be  set once we expand and report on all applicable categories Note : This is a restatement of 2009 - 10 goals Water Efficiency  of waste water. The recycled water is primarily used for sanitation and  landscaping  In all Wipro owned campuses, we ensure  zero discharge of any untreated  water into municipal drains or common public areas 32%  of our  total water requirements in 2010-11 was met through recycling   To improve our fresh water efficiency by 5% year-on-year as  measured on an per employee basis (Base year: 2010-11);  this translates into a reduction from 1730 liters per  employee per month to 1480 liters per employee per  month by 2015. The base year has changed due to a  significant improvement in water metering infrastructure,  leading to better accuracy  To define empirical norms for responsible consumption of  water on the basis of its socio-ecological impact. To have the  definitions in place by March 2013 and to start measuring  Wipro owned campuses against these criteria from  2013-14 onwards.

In addition to investigations of urban ecology and  biodiversity, she also coordinates a program of research on land cover change and community  forest institutions in South Asia.  Cities represent some of the most challenging environments for ecological systems,  with natural and human-induced impacts resulting in rapid and often extreme  modification of environment, ecology and biodiversity.  Yet, cities also provide the only  face of nature that many urban residents perceive today – and the number of people  who live in cities worldwide, and in India, is only increasing over time. It is becoming  increasingly important, therefore, to have a good understanding of the processes that  shape ecology and conservation in cities. Unfortunately, despite the vast numbers of  people who live in cities, we know very little about what shapes urban biodiversity and  ecosystem change. The attention of ecologists has largely been focused on natural  ecosystems where the footprint of humankind is not as all encompassing, and cities  have remained in the hinterland of ecological knowledge. This is despite the obvious  fact that cities have a footprint on ecology, biodiversity and natural resources such as  food and water that far exceeds their size, drawing on resources from areas far  exceeding their boundaries, and depositing waste material across the world.  BIODIVERSITY AND THE CITY:  CHALLENGES FOR BENGALURU Dr. Harini Nagendra In recent decades, however, rapid progress has been made towards understanding the  linkages and complex feedback loops between social preferences, human drivers of  change, and ecological structure and function – although much of this is based on  studies from North America and Europe. In most of the developing world, and  certainly in India, there is a severe dearth of basic information on ecology and  biodiversity.  This has severe implications for urban conservation, and especially so in  India, where urbanization has been an exceptionally dynamic force in the last two  decades.  Bengaluru provides a characteristic example of tensions between humans and nature.  Those who know the city as a recent urban center, famous for the genesis of new  words such as Bangalored, may not be aware that the settlements around the city  can be dated at least as far back as the 4th century, and the city itself boasts of an  uninterrupted history as an urban center of commerce and industry since the 16th  century. Bengaluru has, however, faced an unprecedented explosion of growth in  recent decades, with highly unequal growth rates, rapid land use change, and contested  access to natural resources including water and green spaces. Grazing land, orchards  and agricultural fields are rapidly being converted into apartments and commercial  complexes, water bodies are shrinking through encroachment and pollution, and the  city has lost tens of thousands of trees in recent years to make way for ever-expanding  traffic and infrastructure requirements. For many urban residents living in congested  built environments, these urban green spaces and lakes may provide the only  reference to nature that they will ever experience. Yet, urban planners and policy  makers do not appear to adequately recognize the importance and criticality of the  numerous social and ecosystem services contributed by these open areas, green  spaces and water bodies, which are being irreplaceably lost. Five years ago, the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment – one of  Indias foremost research organizations working on conservation and sustainable  development issues – began a comprehensive investigation of urban biodiversity and  046 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES  047 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES ecosystems in Bengaluru. Our goal was to put together a comprehensive database of  factors that shape the distribution of and changes in biodiversity,  ecology, and land use  in the city, which can then serve as a platform to provide informed inputs for  management and policy.  The urban landscape of the city, until the late 1970s, fit its image as Indias garden city  and the city of lakes, consisting of a few residential homes and offices interspersed  with fruit orchards, lakes, agricultural fields and parks, with tree lined roads connecting  large green patches within academic institutions, public sector campuses, and military  grounds. While the city covered a much smaller area up until the late 18th century,  Bangalore expanded substantially when it was part of the British cantonment and city,  and again post-Independence, when a number of academic institutions and public  sector enterprises were established across the city. Yet, the most rapid period of land  use change appears to have occurred after the 1980s, with large scale degradation and  conversion of open spaces and greenery into urban land uses. Yet, Bangalore remains  fortunate in having a number of parks, streets, home gardens, academic institutions,  public sector and government offices, and military areas that thankfully continue to  preserve substantial amounts of greenery and biodiversity.  What kinds of biodiversity do these different types of land use support? In urban  environments, human choice, behaviour and policies directly impact biodiversity.  This  can be especially noticed with respect to plants, whose location and identity is largely  controlled by human choice. Old maps, photographs and documents indicate that,  prior to the 19thcentury, the natural landscape of Bengaluru was open and scrubby.  Locally valued trees such as Ficus species, mango, jackfruit, tamarind and neem were  planted along roads to provide travellers with shade and fruit, while Hyder Ali and Tipu  introduced large numbers of exotic species such as Eucalyptus and cypress. An  awareness of increasing temperatures due to urbanization begins to find expression in  documents as far back as the mid19th century. In response to this, British and Indian  horticulturalists began an extensive program of tree plantation to provide the city  with shade and greenery. Species selection was done with an eye to selecting exotic  trees, designed to provide a spectacular visual pageant with flowers that bloomed in  successive seasons, a visual Ritusamhara.  Our studies of street trees in Bengaluru indicates that the city has a very high species  diversity compared to other urban areas worldwide, although tree density is quite  low, and there is much space for additional planting. The trees that dominate the visual  landscape of the city, including the rain tree, copper pod, African tulip and gulmohar,  are being slowly replaced by a less diverse and smaller sized set of trees, with a  preference now being shown for endemic species such as honge and orchid trees. Yet,  many naturalists from the city observe that these exotic species have been around for  one or two centuries, and can be considered to be naturalized Bengalureans,  supporting a number of bird and butterfly species. Their decimation across the city can  cause lead to catastrophic alterations in the bird, butterfly and wildlife populations of  the city. Unfortunately, very little attention is paid to developing a well formulated set  of guidelines for urban planting that are scientifically grounded in data, and not based  on changing opinions. Bengaluru also has the privilege of being home to two historic gardens – Lal Bagh,  which dates back to the 18th century, and Cubbon Park, formed in the 19th century.  An 1891 British book by John Cameron, Catalogue of Plants in the Botanical Garden,  Bangalore (Second Edition) describes 3,222 species of plants found in Lal Bagh alone.  These two botanical gardens thus occupy a specific place in the city because of the  diversity and rarity of many of the plant species found here, as well as the size of these  gardens, and the age of many of these trees. In addition, the city also hosts a number of  small neighbourhood parks. Visually, you can see quite clearly that these look rather  different in their plan and layout, and indicate changes in planting preferences that have  shaped the ecology of these parks over time. Old parks are more wooded, with large  canopied trees and a more forested look, while the recent small neighbourhood  parks that sprung up all over the city in the 1990s are horticultural parks with  manicured hedges and greater lawn area, fewer trees and more shrubs.  The trees in these parks are overwhelmingly dominated by non-local species, and the  most common tree, accounting for 20% of all park trees, is Polyalthialongifolia (also  called the mast tree or false Ashoka).  As with street trees, we find changes in planting  preferences over time, with the large sized iconic trees like gulmohur and copper pod  now giving way to trees like honge, mast trees and royal palm, and wooded parks giving  way to horticultural landscaped gardens. These are changes that will impact the citys  ecology as well as the environment. Ideally, we need a consistent, well formulated tree   048 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES policy that is not shaped by personal preferences of administrators and planners,  instead specifying a scientifically based, appropriate mix of tree species to be planted  that takes into account human needs as well as ecological and environmental  requirements.  Our research also indicates that some of the largest trees in the city are located on its  wide streets, and these are larger (thus presumably older) than those in Bengalurus  parks and home gardens. This has significant implications for the city, as it is the large  trees on many city roads that have been decimated in recent years for a variety of  infrastructure projects. Apart from the obvious impact that this has on ecology and  biodiversity, we find that trees on streets canhave a substantial impact in reducing  pollution and bringing soaring summer temperatures under control. The levels of  Suspended Particulate Matter are very high on many exposed roads, with 50% of the  locations we studied showing levels approaching twice the permissible limits. This can  have dangerous impacts on human health. Yet, having tree lined roads reduces levels of  pollution to within acceptable or near-acceptable limits on many city streets. Sulphur  dioxide levels are also reduced by much as 65%. Further, tree lined roads reduce  ambient air temperature by as much as 5C, and reduce the surface temperature of  asphalted roads by as much as 25C, leading to significant mitigation of urban heat  islands and providing a win-win way to partially mitigate the impact of global  warming and climate change. Yet, rather than encouraging this as an approach to  combat climate change, Bengaluru seems to be on a path exacerbation of these  impacts, by cutting down the citys oldest and largest trees – as these presumably have  the greatest role to play in combating pollution and ameliorating urban heat islands.  Bengaluru is also known to host to an impressive list of other plant and animal species.  A checklist of fauna compiled by S. Karthikeyan in 1999 lists as many as 340 species of  birds, 160 species of butterflies, 40 species of mammals, 38 species of reptiles, 16  species of amphibians, and 41 species of fish in the city. There has even been a report of  a new ant species identified in Bengaluru as recently as in 2006, from the Indian  Institute of Science campus – indicating the richness as well as the unexplored nature  of many Indian city environments. Changes in land use and management practices impact such biodiversity. The  challenges of urban conservation are many, and human preferences for biodiversity  shape outcomes. Thus, for instance, surveys repeatedly indicate that most city  residents like birds like sparrows and enjoy looking at butterflies and dragonflies,  but do not want to coexist with snakes, lizards, mice, bats or beetles. Butterflies are  found where caterpillars thrive, and thus a butterfly friendly garden can also be  expected to contain plants with evidence of leaf damage due to caterpillars and  insects. Areas with dense greenery will often be home to snakes, toads, and frogs.  Surveys of old home garden owners indicate that they are more sensitive to these  issues, and the city tended to support greater levels of overall biodiversity in the past.  In many locations, these large gardens are being converted to apartments, which  prefer pruned, visually aesthetic landscapes that do not provide the same levels of  support for overall biodiversity. Many of these new city habitats and landscapes  including corporate campuses and upscale gated residential communities are also  strongly dominated by manicured landscapes, with exotic turf grasses,  non-flowering variegated shrubs and herbs, and hybridized small sized flowering  trees and exotic palms that do not provide fruits, flowers, insect habitat and  nesting areas for butterflies, birds, and insects. The extensive use of pesticides also  impacts bird feeding, nesting and breeding. Yet, in our experience much of this can be reversed simply by providing people with  more information about the consequences of such preferences for certain aesthetics  on biodiversity, which they are often unaware of. Thankfully, in recent years there is  increasing attention being paid to urban ecology, and a growing population of urban  residents from many Indian cities including Delhi, Pune and Bengaluru, who participate  in efforts such as tree planting and lake protection. Thus in Bengaluru, for instance,  collaborations between citizen groups and the government have led to the effective  restoration and maintenance of lakes in the southern and western parts of the city.  Corporate groups have also come forward to support some of these initiatives,  especially towards tree plantation and lake maintenance. Urban advocacy groups have  played a major role in increasing public awareness of green issues, and have pursued  several landmark Public Interest Litigations that have enabled public commons such as  lakes to be preserved for public use. Such collective action by a diverse array of city  groups has great potential to help in providing an atmosphere that supports the  conservation and promotion of urban greening and biodiversity, where policy makers  and planners can be urged to pay attention to these critical issues.   JAPAN  WIPRO  AND ITS  STAKEHOLDERS A Summary of our Stakeholder Engagement 5  WIPRO AND ITS  STAKEHOLDERS 052 A sustainability-centric approach to business focuses on multiple stakeholders, not  just the investor. These stakeholders may not have a direct connect with the  organizations business operations and  yet they assume significance in the broader  sustainability context of the industry sector and the geography in which the  organization operates e.g. if a company runs operations in a water-stressed area, the  local community becomes an important stakeholder for the organization to engage  with on water management.  At Wipro, we have always viewed our customers, employees and investors as  strategic partners and stakeholders. Over the last decade, our deep outreach into  education and community care has brought us in close engagement with two new  stakeholders – partners in the education ecosystem and proximate communities.  While the IT services industry model does not necessitate  a deep supply chain, the  rapid expansion of this sector in the last two decades has resulted in a variety of  ancillary services e.g. bus transport, housekeeping, canteen, security. Services  suppliers and contractors have become thus a critical stakeholder for our operations.  As the case study on the Wipro Green PC in Section 5d shows, our suppliers have  played a strategic role in the success of our Green Computing journey. In  progressing towards the goal of a sustainable and inclusive society, government,  academia and research play a crucial role –> the government by legislating progressive  policies and the academic / research worlds by driving fundamental innovation.  Over the last three years, Wipro has started engaging and collaborating closely with  government and policy bodies on matters related to energy, water and ICT in  governance. Simultaneously, we have also started collaborative partnerships  with research and academic institutions. To these stakeholders, we have added  another stakeholder, Current and Future Generations. We think that the future must  inform our thinking and actions on sustainability more than anything else,  otherwise our vision will stop short of being truly sustainable; therefore, while this  stakeholder group may not have a tangible and real face to it, they act as an anchor  for  our  decisions. Starting with our last sustainability report (2009-10), we had a slightly modified list  of eight stakeholders wherein we had split our earlier Education and Society  stakeholder into two distinct groups: Education Ecosystem and  Communities and  NGOs. Both these stakeholders continue to be covered in the same section  Education and Society.

In 2010-11, we underwent  significant changes in our organizational structure. The primary need for this change  was to recover from the effects of the global economic slowdown, as well as move to a  simpler and more agile business model. The structural change was complemented by a  renewed sense of direction and leadership approach.  Large scale changes often result in uncertainty, anxiety and speculation. It was very  important to give our employees time and space to absorb and adapt to these changes  and to manage the anxiety. Our change management program was designed to enable  a constructive transition to the new structure and approach. It was participative and  transparent and rich in communication. The combined strength of our established  engagement practices such as Wipro Meets and Open House events with  customized programs like Dialogue Now enhanced the effectiveness of our  change management.  Effective organizational change must not just address market demand; they must also  have wins for stakeholders. The year witnessed continued investment and rigor in  capability building with greater variety and richer programs across levels and  specializations. Information systems and online processes were enhanced to create a  simpler and easier day-to-day experience for employees. We also created  opportunities for employees to enhance their professional experience through  newer and challenging assignments. Our efforts to improve diversity and create an inclusive workplace continue to  receive widespread support and encouragement despite the external and internal  flux. Initiatives for greater gender diversity and persons with disabilities have made  significant progress. Wipro was awarded the second place in the 2011 Annual  Diversity Council Honors Award and was listed 1st in the IT/ITeS Industry and 9th  overall in the Aon Hewitt India's Best Employers Survey 2011. The fundamental  strength of our organization combined with a robust sustainability framework has  ensured that we continue to surge forward in our efforts in these core priorities. Pratik Kumar EVP – Human Resources  EMPLOYEES AND SUSTAINABILITY  AT THE WORKPLACE 058 POWER TO DO GOOD Wipro sees itself as a socio-economic citizen. Our actions have an influence and  impact on organizations, people and social entities around us. The philosophy that  drives our actions is the 'power to do good.' We believe that we have a responsibility  to create a just, humane and equitable society. Our corporate goals and actions are  closely tied with principles defined by global standards defined by the U. N. Global  Compact, OECD guidelines and International Labour Organization. Doing good begins at home. We believe that the global standards that we embrace as a  corporation must translate into our actions as an employer. These standards are  incorporated in meeting the strategic drivers that shape our people practices and  processes. Ours is a global knowledge workforce that offers high end solutions to a  global customer audience. In this context drivers such as engagement, learning and  empowerment are integral to building a world class workforce. Our core values of the  Spirit of Wipro create a global foundation for employees across all countries and  businesses. At the same time, our practices are broad and flexible in integrating local  regulatory and cultural flavours. Our practices of hiring, workplace health & safety,  remuneration, learning and career advancement are influenced by internationally  recognized standards set by U.N. conventions. Our Diversity and Inclusivity initiative  incorporates elements from the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of  Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). All our efforts point towards creating and  nurturing a workplace characterized by freedom, fairness and world-class practices,  so that our global workforce may flourish and grow.   We believe that employees must experience the 'goodness' of these practices in their  day to day lives at work. In order to ensure this, our communication to employees  openly reiterates our intent and encourages employees to share their experiences so  that we may improve. Employees are also active partners in our efforts to be a  responsible citizen and this collective power of good continues to energize and renew  our commitment. Our commitment to being a responsible employer extends to all  permanent employees, contract employees and our third-party workforce.  Irrespective of employment category, all employees are active partners in our efforts  to be a responsible citizen  COBCE and Ombuds Process - The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  (COBCE) continues to be the driving governing force for all workplace and  business processes and conduct. Over the years, the COBCE has set guidelines for  all business transactions and practices. Since its launch in 2002, the COBCE is  periodically  updated;  the  latest  one  was  carried  out  in  March  2011. The COBCE is an overarching guideline that is based on Wipros core values. It applies  to all organizational practices and is designed to help employees recognize and deal  with ethical issues in their work. The code reflects the universal principles defined by  the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International  Labour Organization. Wipro is committed to compliance with all applicable laws and  regulations in its countries of operations. We are committed to conducting business in  an ethical manner and acting with integrity in dealing with our customers, suppliers,  partners, competitors, employees and its other stakeholders. The COBCE is  applicable to all employees, contractors, consultants and all other categories of  employees. Wipro also requires that its service providers, contractors, dealers,  distributors and others conduct their businesses in a legal and ethical manner. Service  agreements issued to contractors and vendors clearly state organizational  expectations. Needless to say, geographical expansion and new office locations  exclude conflict zones and locations with weak people governance regulations. The code explicitly covers our responsibility towards preventing and eliminating child  labor, forced labor and all forms of discrimination. Our hiring practices for all  permanent and retainer employees have built-in mechanisms to ensure human rights  compliance as part of pre-employment screening. Contracts signed with vendors  for third-party employees also explicitly mention compliance requirements in line  with all COBCE principles. We are also working on implementing a distinct code of  conduct for suppliers, which will include environmental and people related aspects.  At our campus premises, security protocol provides guidelines and vigilance on this  aspect.  The COBCE also includes prevention of fraudulent and corrupt practices,  avoidance of conflict of interest and the advertising and media policy. Wipro  respects employees right to form or participate in trade unions. However, the  evolved governance and engagement practices provide an open and  empowering workplace environment for employees.  Across our IT businesses, there  are no registered trade unions.  All people policies, practices and significant changes and transitions are implemented  based on the COBCE principles and the Spirit of Wipro. All new hires undergo  orientation on the COBCE via an online training module, Spirit of Wipro workshops  and focused sessions on COBCE. All employees are encouraged to ask questions  about the COBCE and Ombuds processes during these sessions as well as during  interactions with business leaders. The COBCE is further socialized by the annual  certification process. Every employee is required to undergo an online COBCE  certification process, which assesses the extent to which the COBCE has been  internalized in the individual. Prevention of discrimination, workplace harassment or sexual harassment is a key  feature of the COBCE, which reflects principles outlined in several United Nations  conventions. This commitment is a free and fair workplace is institutionalized by the  Ombuds process, which addresses all complaints of discrimination, harassment,  hostile behavior, cheating, fraud and policy violation. In 2010-11, a total of 453  complaints were received via the Ombuds process. The data tables at the end of this  section contain a comprehensive list of the categories of complaints and remedial  actions taken.  The COBCE defines our commitment and actions as a meritocracy and equal  opportunity employer. All decisions regarding hiring, learning opportunity, salary,  compensation and separation are based on merit and performance. We are  committed to non-discrimination on any grounds, such as nationality or ethnic origin,  gender, race, religion, caste, disability, political or sexual orientation. This commitment  reinforces a progressive and high-performing culture at work. There were no  significant investments or acquisitions in 2010-11, apart from some minor  restructuring of overseas subsidiaries. Due diligence on Human Rights/Labour  Practices is part of all investment and M & A activities.

In doing so, our practices of employment, engagement, diversity, compensation,  learning, promotion and many others are based on merit, non-discrimination and shaped by  the values of the Spirit of  Wipro.  New Employee Assimilation: In 2010-11, our workforce grew in strength and we  welcomed 39247 new Wiproites into the organization – a mix of lateral and campus  hires. New joinees in all countries attended induction programs, which were designed  based on the nature of work, type of business and geography. Lateral new hires were  inducted into the organization via the weekly induction programs and campus hires  attended customized, extended induction programs. 215 Middle and senior level  employees joining Wipro IT businesses in client facing roles, at locations outside India,  attended the Global Assimilation Program (popularly known as GAP). GAP is a  quarterly induction program of 2 weeks that equips participants with a  comprehensive perspective on Wipro's business groups, functions and networks  specific to the participants' job roles. The GAP site is available to employees at  http://knetsites.wipro.com/sites/1062/GAP/default.aspx  The Engagement effort also grew in strength and impact during the year 2010-11.  The focus on employee connect was maintained and renewed via the Meet Your  People Program, which enables employee connect in a cascaded manner. Employees  connect with leaders in different ways: Organizational, Business Unit, Team and  Individual. These engagement sessions consist of a free exchange of information and  views between leaders and employees on key performance highlights, organizational  changes, leadership perspectives and people priorities.  Engagement at the Organizational Level - Wipro Meets:  One of the most visible engagement mechanisms is the quarterly Wipro Meets event,  which connects all employees of the IT businesses with the organizational leadership  team. The event is chaired and led by the IT Businesses CEO along with the senior  There are various forums available to understand human rights issues – right from  the organization wide biannual EPS to various interaction avenues with function  and location human resources team and facility management coordinators. Some of  these are the All Hands Meet, Skip meetings, quarterly senior management forums  like Wipro meets and also representation of Wipro employees in EHS  committees (like transport, Health and Safety and Food). In 2012-13 we will  analyse inputs from these various forums to arrive at top material human rights  and labor practice issues and detail the action areas. We have also started an  external  independent sustainability risk assessment exercise which also covers social  aspects – this will be completed in 2012-13. Some of the specific focus stakeholder  groups we have identified to be material for a detailed assessment are contract  workforce and support services staff (example; hospitality, facility maintenance). The  Ombuds process covers grievances related to Human Rights and is available to all  stakeholders (see page 86). We have recently done a comprehensive assessment  of Ombuds categories, we will report those that are explicitly related to Human  Rights from 2012. Strengthening the COBCE – Prevention of Sexual Harassment Council -  Wipro has revamped its sexual harassment investigation process and procedure to  make it more comprehensive, spread awareness, make the reporting easy and faster  resolution of complaints. With 125,000+ employees and still counting, there was a  need for extended body of fact finders within the organization in compliance with  legal framework. Keeping these requirements in consideration, the central review  committee worked on the revamp of the process and framework for Prevention of  Sexual Harassment.  The revamp included a crisper and clearer policy, redraft of the committee, a revised  fact-finding framework, and an in-house built online training module. The revamp was  done in consultations with an external consultant and legal team. A heterogeneous  team of more than 35 fact finders from employee facing and associated functions like  Human Resources, Risk, Legal and Security was trained by an external expert. These  fact finders are equipped to address complaints relating to sexual harassment.  FEEDBACK, ENGAGEMENT  AND CULTURE BUILDING   EMPLOYEES AND SUSTAINABILITY  AT THE WORKPLACE 063 leadership team and is attended by a live audience  at the corporate office as well as a global audience,  over an easy-access internet/intranet webcast. In  2010-11, the Wipro Meets format was revised to  achieve greater reach and participation.  Engagement at the Business Unit Level: The All Hands  Meet is hosted by Business Unit Heads, to bring business  performance updates to employees. Leaders leverage the  forum to confer reward and recognition awards for  excellence in performance and to felicitate Long Service  Award recipients. In international geographies, employees attend 'In Sync', a quarterly  communication and engagement forum, held across locations and customer accounts.  On an average, over 5000 employees participated in each quarterly InSync event,  during 2010-11. Team and Individual Level Connect: At project and smaller team levels,  leadership and talent engagement leaders continued to host open, speak-easy  sessions. Structured one-to-one discussions with individual employees were also  planned and held.  Employee Perception Survey: After the  2009 Employee Perception Survey, business  leaders and employee volunteers came  together to form action teams and work on  improvements. The improvements brought  about by these teams were communicated  across the organization. At present, the organization is gearing up for the next  Employee Perception Survey; our collective journey of improvement continues!  Stakeholder Feedback- Project Delta: Over and above the various initiatives  and practices of seeking feedback, Project Delta was an initiative launched in  November 2010, to study and improve specific people processes and practices.  The project team consisted of 26 volunteers from across IT businesses.  The team interacted with over 250 leaders, managers and individual contributors,  to prepare an assessment of 16 people processes. The assessment was done  through interviews and discussions, which were documented with transparency,  in the presence of the audience. The team applied the People CMM framework to  the project, for the assessment and recommendations. The findings and  recommendations were shared with the Senior Vice President – Human Resources –  IT businesses.  Action planning and implementation  are  currently  work  in progress. The People Events Calendar was launched in 2010 - 11, for all IT Businesses  and is hosted on the intranet. The e-calendar provides a transparent and  comprehensive one-shot view of all critical and significant people impacting events  and processes for the year, such as engagement events, compensation revision and  reward dates, performance management process dates and career progression dates.  The mid-term and annual performance reviews and career development plan is  applicable to all employees in the organization. Wipros IT businesses underwent organizational changes during 2010-11. The  organizational changes of 2010-11 were based on the principles of simplicity, agility and  functional efficiency. The resultant organizational is comprised of four primary entities:  Strategic Business Units (SBUs), Service lines, Go to Market & Global Delivery Organization.  Strategic Business Units have been re-defined so as to better align to industry value chain and  bring greater value to customers. They are the primary customer facing units and would  consist of integrated Go to Market structure (Sales), Delivery and Support Functions. CHANGE MANAGEMENT Saurabh Govil, Senior Vice President-Human Resources for Wipros IT businesses  explains the Change Management effort.  Question:  Why did the organizational change take place? Saurabh: The primary need for this change was to move to a simpler and more agile  business model, so that we can better leverage the opportunities that are coming up. The  structural change was complemented by a renewed sense of direction and leadership  approach.   EMPLOYEES AND SUSTAINABILITY  AT THE WORKPLACE 064 Question: How did the change impact employees? Saurabh: The change impacted employees differently at different levels. Leaders were  more directly affected by the leadership change; managers and employees down the line  were more impacted by the structural and operational changes in their day-to-day  working. As expected, these changes impacted strategic, operational and process  dimensions. The changes posed challenges to existing ways of working and paradigms and  called upon leaders and process owners to drive the transition effectively, in a  collaborative, sensitive and transparent manner. Question: How did the organization understand employee perceptions and  reactions to the change? Saurabh: A communication plan was designed to cascade the structural and operational  changes in a cascaded manner, so that employees across levels had sufficient time and  support in comprehending and aligning to the changes. The communication sessions  consisted of carrying information to employees as well as gathering feedback from them.  A customized communication pack was given to leaders, which consisted of talking  points, FAQ kits and comprehensive presentation packs. Leaders interacted with their  teams to explain the new structure via webcasts and town hall meetings. Employees  received frequent updates on the new structure and related announcements; these  updates were also made available to all on the intranet. Question: How did you respond to these reactions and anxieties / questions? Saurabh: To do so, an Organizational Change Management Group was created, which  worked along with the CEOs office. The group was the central custodian of all internal  communication. The change management process adopted the Head-Heart-Hand  approach, with the intent of securing the rational and emotional commitment of all  stakeholders. The revised organizational structure and operational model was designed to  provide strategic benefit to the organization and related stakeholders. The communication  of this structure was planned keeping in mind  stakeholder priorities and emotional points of  impact. In order to achieve a strong logical and  emotional connect on the ground, communication  and operational tools were created to enable  Aon Hewitt Best Employers  Survey: Wipro participated in the  Aon Hewitt Best Employers Survey  2010-11. The survey opened in  August 2010 and 200 organizations participated in it. The survey-to-results process  was rigorous and lasted nearly 9 months. The first stage of information gathering  involved submission of detailed entries around engagement drivers, people practices  as well as submission of responses to the CEO questionnaire. This was followed by an  Employee Opinion Survey to gauge employee perceptions. Post the survey, 80  organizations were selected for an onsite audit – Wipro was one among them. The  day-long onsite audit consisted of interactions with employee groups, human  resource functional leaders and the CEO. The final selection of winners was made  after all the audits by a team of empanelled judges. The organizational change  management process took place in parallel with the survey and selection stages.  Wipro was listed 9th overall and 1st in the IT/ITeS Industry in the Aon Hewitt Indias  Best Employers Survey 2011. The 25 top companies were announced on 29th April  2011 and are profiled in the 14th May 2011 edition of Outlook Business.  leaders to drive change effectively. The Change Management Group defined the transition  approach, identified change agents and leaders and streamlined processes to enable a  smooth operational transition for all employees. Question: What is the status of the change management process? Saurabh: The operational changes are in the implementation phase. However, the  experience of a New Wipro will take time to be completely realized. We are in constant  touch with employees on this, through channels such as Dialogue Now, which enables  employees to directly communicate their views and suggestions to the CEO, via a  confidential intranet link. We also have a newly  created Employee Advocacy Group, which will work  on specific matters that impact all employees. These  initiatives will forge higher levels of partnership for  the journey ahead.  SAFE AND HEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENT Employee safety and health continues to be a core priority at Wipro and the basis for this  stems from the value Act with Sensitivity, from the Spirit of Wipro.

Wipro has been supporting Earth Hour for the last three years. This year, we went one  step ahead by celebrating Earth Hour on a working day in order to create a meaningful  impact. On Friday, March 25th 2011, Wipro facilities across the globe shut off comfort  cooling between 8.30 AM and 9.30 AM  local time. EMPLOYEES AND SUSTAINABILITY  AT THE WORKPLACE 066 Employees were also encouraged to celebrate  Earth Hour in their individual capacity on March  26th, 8.30 PM by switching off lights at their homes  and in spreading the word among their friends and  families.  The collective benefit - a total of 15.34 tons of  Carbon-oxide was saved during the golden hour. @ wipro We Cycle – A Unique Initiative: As a  commitment to a greener planet and fitter  Wiproites, last year we launched the @ Wipro  We Cycle initiative that aimed to keeps  employees fit and help contribute towards a  healthier planet. As a part of this initiative, Wiproites can now purchase a bicycle under  the two wheeler loan or Furniture and Equipment Scheme. This initiative was brought  under 'Wipro Advantage' a program that enables Wipro employees to avail exclusive  discounts/deals on various products/services. On the day of launch, there was a buzz  created all around by the cycle camps put up by vendors. Around 100 employees  were provided free cycles to ride around the campus and spread their enthusiasm.  Spirit of  Wipro Run Every year, we conduct the Spirit of Wipro run to reinforce our belief and our  employees participate enthusiastically to show their support. In October 2010, we  had over 14,000 Wiproites - along with their friends, families and in some cases even  Wipro customers - put on their running shoes. The Spirit of Wipro Run 2010, in  its fifth edition, was spread across 35 cities from around 15 countries in the  world. While each region added its special flavor to the run, the main theme  of the marathon was about celebrating the spirit of diversity @ Wipro. For the first  time, an official Runner's list was launched as a part of the run, where running  enthusiasts were given a platform to express their love for running. It also gave  them an opportunity to engage with other fellow runners, and this led to the building  of a Running Community @ Wipro. The runners could also dedicate their run to any  of the fellow runners from around the world with their original Spirit of  Wipro Run T-shirts. Social Media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter  played a pivotal role in engaging the employees through the event. As a finale to the  entire event, Wipro has decided to engage in an afforestation project and plant a tree  for each of the 14000 + participants of the run. The project also ensures that these  trees are nurtured and well looked after.  EMPLOYEES AND SUSTAINABILITY  AT THE WORKPLACE 067 REALIZING ASPIRATIONS:  LEARNING AND GROWTH A high-performing, talented workforce thrives on learning and development. Training and  development is an integral part of the work culture at Wipro. Learning takes place in many  different ways. Structured learning takes place via formal, structured programs, workshops  and online trainings. Developmental efforts are shaped as longer-term investment, via our  lifecycle programs and leadership building platforms, to achieve maximum impact. A large  amount of learning takes place on a day-to-day basis, from everyday experiences and sharing  with team-mates. Teamwork is an integral driver of our learning culture and our young and  energetic workforce rates Teamwork as a satisfactory engagement parameter. The  combination of world-class learning programs and systems and our work culture make  learning a way of life for all employees at  Wipro. In a year of change and transformation, the organization strengthened learning and  development coverage as well as depth. Training programs were enhanced across  levels, in number and in type, in order to keep pace with client expectations.  Leadership and capability building efforts were also enhanced to enable leaders to  drive change management successfully.  During the year 2010-11, the online Integrated Talent Management System  increased its offerings by 2300 programs, taking the total size of offerings to nearly  8000 programs. The ITMS fulfills mandatory, broad-based learning requirements as  well as individual training needs which are stored in the form of Individual Learning  Plans. Every Wipro employee has an Individual Learning Plan that addresses individual  learning needs. Employees across Wipro IT business now have a broader and deeper  basket of ITMS offerings to choose from. At least 10% of the content on the ITMS is  created by in-house leaders and technical experts from within the IT businesses. The reach and coverage of the Talent Transformation expertise was enhanced by the  introduction of the Certified Talent Transformer initiative, in 2010-11. The Certified  Talent Transformer initiative is envisioned around a learn-while-you-share approach.  In-house professionals, who are keen to share their expertise and experience by  training others, are trained on classroom or online facilitation. Through this initiative,   EMPLOYEES AND SUSTAINABILITY  AT THE WORKPLACE 068 493 in-house middle and senior level employees were trained to become trainers.  These trainers were selected for their knowledge and skill and were trained by  18 Master Trainers from the Talent Transformation function. Certified Talent  Transformers use structured training material as well as their own experiences to  maximize the value of this approach. The Certified Talent Transformer community has  trained nearly 15000 employees so far, on Technical, Behavioural and Business skills. Enabling young employees – Launch of the Real Life Lab. Every year, Wipro recruits thousands of young graduates from reputed campuses  across India. In order to prepare them with the necessary skills and perspectives  required to succeed in a project environment, the graduates undergo a formal training  program named the Project Readiness Program (PRP) before they are assigned  to work on projects.  The PRP enables a smooth transition for our young talent from  the academic mould into a corporate mould. The framework and the curriculum of  the PRP has been designed based on inputs from business leaders and draws on the  collective expertise of over 180 faculty members. The PRP is upgraded every year and  in 2010-11 a significant improvement was made with the  introduction of the Real Life  Lab. The Real Life Lab is a live learning environment for employees who join Wipro  Technologies from academic and engineering institutions. New employees undergo  intensive training soon after joining, of which 2 weeks is spent at the Real Life Lab.  While at the lab, real-life work and learning scenarios, in the form of case studies and  scenarios, are used to familiarize employees with working in a project environment.  The lab helps accelerate learning and hone their technical and project skills.   The WASE program (Wipro Academy of Software Excellence) continued to make  progress during the year. Introduced in 1995, this pioneering initiative has enabled  Wipro in preparing best-in-class young talent. The WASE program consists of an  8-semester (four years) off - campus collaborative MS Program with the Birla Institute  of Technology & Science (BITS), Pilani (Rajasthan, India). Students receive technical and  academic inputs as well as the opportunity to apply their learning in live projects. In  2010-11, 2023 students joined the WASE program. Global Delivery Capability Building: The Global Delivery Organization is the  largest employee group, consists of all IT technology and service delivery offerings.  All customer facing projects within Wipro Technologies function within the overview  of the Global Delivery Organization. Technical and Project management skills are  hence key business enablers and success factors. Roles and responsibilities across  levels are clearly defined by our Role Based Framework which is available to all  employees on our intranet portal. The framework carries a clear explanation of roles,  skills and competencies and career paths available. The Unified Competency  Framework enables technical competency building to create a competitive edge for  our business. The framework helps in identifying technical competency needs of  people and businesses, assessing gaps and enabling competency development for  employees. By structured training and evaluation methods, the UCF enables a steady  pool of competent engineers, which is necessary for addressing the business' growth  needs. In 2010-11, 29158 employees underwent training and assessment vis--vis the  UCF, of which 84.5% successfully cleared the assessments - 7% higher than 2009-10.  Project Management capability expectations have evolved over the years and we have  a comprehensive approach to build capability across levels, covering all aspects of  people, process, and cultural excellence. First-time managers handling operational  responsibilities participate in the Future Manager Program. Successful completion of  the FMP then paves the way to prepare for the next step, which is the Project Manager  Academy which prepares front-line managers build critical operational and  managerial skills. In 2010-11, customized interventions were initiated to enhance  capability at middle and senior levels. At the middle management level, the Delivery  Manager Academy offers individualized development. Delivery Managers are  entrusted with driving growth, operational efficiencies, customer relationships and  people engagement.  Hence, the academy has been designed based on extensive  inputs from senior management and current industry requirements. The program is  delivered by experienced faculty drawn from within the organization as well as  premier academic institutes such as the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore  (IIMB). The learning methodology is a blend of live and online learning modules, video- based-learning and case-based workshops. The course has been structured to ensure  that participating managers apply the learning in their own work environment  through on-the-job assignments to be completed under the guidance of mentors  drawn from the senior management of the organization. In 2010-11, 870 Delivery  Managers were training under this program.  EMPLOYEES AND SUSTAINABILITY  AT THE WORKPLACE 069 Growth Centers were introduced to build Program Manager capability across all  business units.

The training design includes modules on organizational culture,  Spirit of  Wipro and corporate etiquette. Top Honours! In 2010, Wipro was awarded the American Society for  Training and Development Award for its learning and development  practices for the seventh year in succession. Wipro is the only  organization globally, to win this award seven times in a row.  Organizations nominated for this award are evaluated by an external  independent panel.  Accelerated Career Framework: At Wipro, the entire spectrum of roles is divided into different career groups, based on  the associated responsibilities and competencies. Based on feedback from employees  as well as a benchmarking exercise with companies, a significant change was made to  the career grouping structure in July 2010, in the form of an 'Accelerated Career  Framework' (ACF). Before the ACF was launched, employees who joined Wipro from  campus experienced career band promotion after spending 4-5 years in the  organization. This practice was out of sync with the organizational merit-based  differentiator approach and promotion criteria. Thus, a decision was made to bifurcate  one of the core career groups into two. Engineering campus hires are now eligible for  progression to the next career group, after completion of 3 years (1 year as a  probationer and 2 years as a confirmed employee). The change also enables them to  enjoy higher compensation. It ensures that employees with more experience and  skills are differentiated from those who join fresh from campus. The change exercise  was a major one, and involved changes in the career group and compensation of over  30, 000 employees. All employees who were moved to the higher career group  were also given the hike in compensation associated with career group progressions.  All people related policies were also updated according to the new career  grouping structure. and introduced new ones. New programs focused on specific aspects of leadership  such as Building a Leadership Brand. Some offerings were focused on sensitivity and  people development, such as Building Trust, Cross Cultural orientation, Emotional  Intelligence and Talent Building. The team covered nearly 12000 middle, senior and top  level executives through their programs during the year. Process Training at Wipro BPO Solutions: Given the dynamic business  conditions and the highly demanding and intense work environment of the BPO  industry, there is a need to continuously refresh and update skill levels and expertise.  Each Wipro BPO business process caters to a specific customer segment. The nature  of work varies across processes, based on the technical complexity, nature of product  or service offering. Each process within Wipro BPO has a robust training mechanism  in place in order to provide comprehensive work related training to employees. Every  new hire at a Wipro BPO process undergoes 2 weeks of pre process training, followed  by process training.  Pre-Process training focuses on Voice and Accent and helps orient  employees with functional cross-cultural skills. Process Training trains employees on  specific work processes and tools and equips them with concepts, operations skills.  Process training consists of classroom instruction as well as on-the-job training and  lasts 2-16 weeks.

Retainerships are assignments that are mutually beneficial to the individual and  organization and are formalized by legally valid contracts. Traditionally, retainerships  were created to fulfill low-skilled positions of a temporary nature. However, today the  retainership is a flexible employment offering, opted for by specialists, consultants and  freelance experts. Across Wipro's IT businesses, retainers fulfill important and basic  positions in technical and functional roles. Retainer terms and conditions include  mandatory benefits such as Provident Fund and paid leave. Retainers in specialized  roles who are required to travel or relocate for official requirements are eligible for  appropriate travel and relocation expense reimbursements.  Retainers are also  covered by a medical insurance package that covers hospitalization, life insurance and  accident insurance.

The themes are built into in our  people processes and practices, to achieve  Women of  Wipro goals. WOMEN OF WIPRO - LIFE STAGE APPROACH Persons with Disability –  In 2009, Wipro introduced a comprehensive  framework designed to aid the inclusion and a high degree of contribution by  employees with disabilities who worked with Wipro. This laid the foundation to  welcome more people with disability into Wipro. We believe that an environment  that is automatically inclusive is basic to facilitating not just employment but career  building for persons with disability. Across Wipro, 82 persons with disability joined the organization in 2010-11 across  various roles. We currently employ 253 persons with disability working with us  today in different roles and employment categories across geographies.

We have had 6 sessions  and have discussed on various topics like customer interactions,  strategy and delivery focus.  The sessions were very focused and have  helped me understand the leaders thought process in a situation. The  trainer compliments it with practical examples.  I am looking forward  to learn a lot from these sessions and from the program  – Workshop participant. The philosophy behind this charter on gender inclusivity is quite  simple - We aspire to create a sensitive organization where men and  women alike can flourish and grow in their careers with a holistic  approach towards performance and work.  This commitment is also  about creating a workplace where women employees can continue  their careers through different life-stages and as an organization we  would provide the right opportunities and support.

WIPROS GENDER DIVERSITY FRAMEWORK In 2010, Wipro was awarded a Special Recognition Award towards  Building Best Practices in the area of Gender Diversity at the  Nasscom Diversity & Inclusivity Summit. In 2010, Wipro Technologies was ranked #6 by the Association of  Diversity Council (USA)  In 2011, Wipro Technologies was ranked #2 by the Association of  Diversity Council (USA)  Breaking all Barriers Contest We ran a month long contest called 'Breaking All Barriers', which consisted of  employees reviewing Wipro workplace premises on accessibility, to create  awareness around enabling Persona With Disabilities via providing best  infrastructural support. Over 14 Wipro locations, including Romania and Atlanta  were covered by the teams based on universal guidelines on accessibility for persons  with disability and  Wipro's  checklist of building awareness. Wipro Infotech's service lines operate on a talent intensive business model, consisting  of skilled employees who design and implement IT services for clients that include  day-to-day IT support and administration. A significant portion of the workforce  deployed for this skill comprises of partner employees, who are employed by multiple  authorized vendors and deployed at Wipro operational client sites, in IT  management roles. This business model provides strategic advantage to Wipro's  IT service offerings. At the close of 2010-11, the number of partner employees was  10495, with the majority aligned to the Professional Services Division service line.  With an aim to groom and build this talent pool, Wipro Infotech has developed a  focused framework to engage and develop partner employees during 2010 - 11.  PARTNER EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT  AT WIPRO INFOTECH At Wipro, we believe that the extended people supply chain is a valuable organizational  contributor. Partner employees must therefore feel the benefit of working in an open and fair  work environment. Our efforts towards this extend beyond policies and benefits; rather, we  strive to create an experience of learning and self-led development for all. Engagement and  development practices for partner employees have been designed in line with our values and  our Code of Business Conduct. These practices are based on the same principles of merit and  non-discrimination that drive our core people practices.

At the close of 2010-11, the number of partner employees was 10495, with  the majority aligned to the Professional Services Division service line. With an aim to  groom and build this talent pool, Wipro Infotech has developed a focused  framework to engage and develop partner employees during 2010-11.  The first step was to set up a dedicated team consisting of senior employees from  business and talent management, to drive the initiative. The initial objective was to  create a strong foundation of engagement, in terms of talent assimilation and  development. The partner employee engagement team ensured a streamlined  engagement process, through regular client site visits, one-to-one discussions, team  celebrations and other events. As a next step, specific processes to better assimilate  and develop partner employees were initiated. These include:  Weekly Induction sessions; these include modules of the Spirit of Wipro  values, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (COBCE) and Security policies.  During 2010-11, 70% of partner employees participated in COBCE workshops  Formal inclusion in the site-o-meter survey, by which employees convey specific  workplace related feedback on aspects such as workplace conditions, hygiene,  development, processes etc. Based on survey feedback, action plans are drawn up  with specific timelines for closure. The site-o-meter currently extends to all  employees at the Professional Services Division and in future may be extended to  other talent intensive service lines of Wipro Infotech  Performance Management and Career Management processes for partner  employees were initiated. These enable performance reviews and structured  feedback sharing. Opportunities to acquire new skills, build capability and explore  careers with Wipro were also made available to partner employees  Partner employees now have access to the Synergy intranet portal, which includes  information on available project opportunities. It also enables easy processing of  claim reimbursements and attendance record management  A Reward and Recognition framework was established formally for partner   employees As a parallel initiative to ensure compliance to legal and human rights aspects, the  Partner Employee Engagement team also invited partners to disclose their hiring and  people management processes through an audit. 96% of partners participated in the   Other  Committee Green Initiatives Committee: Consisting of cross functional members that discuss and  implement green initiatives – 1 location WOW –Women representatives that provide health & hygiene suggestions – 1 location EMPLOYEES AND SUSTAINABILITY  AT THE WORKPLACE 077 EMPLOYEE CITIZENSHIP IN ACTION Employees are partners in our organizational efforts to create meaningful impact on people,  communities and future generations. Since inception of Wipro's Good Citizenship programs,  employees have volunteered in different ways to initiatives such as Wipro Cares, eco-eye,  Mission10X and many others. Irrespective of the length of the engagement, the participation  benefits the end recipient, the organization as well as the employee.  Every year, Wipro employees across India volunteer their services towards multiple  initiatives run by Wipro Cares. Established in 2004, Wipro Cares is a not-for-profit  initiative of Wipro that engages with the community outside Wipro in the areas of  Education, Environment, Health Care and Disaster Rehabilitation. Wipro Cares'  educational initiatives are founded on the belief that education is the key which can  open doors to self-help and change. The initiatives are focused on meeting the  educational needs of the urban poor, children in particular. Wipro Cares offers  opportunities for holistic development such as running bridge schools, non formal  schools, providing vocational training and training teachers to engage with empathy.  During 2010-11, nearly 200 Wipro employees across urban India volunteered their  services for various Wipro Cares activities at schools, orphanages and other  institutions. Joy of Giving The Joy of Giving Week is India's "festival of giving". In 2010, Wipro Cares led the  events of the week in collaboration with GOONJ. GOONJ runs a 'Vastradaan'  initiative that provides clothes and other amenities to far-flung villages, collecting on  an average 20,000 kg (about 1.2 lakh units) of clothing every month, processing it and  distributing it through a unique clothes-for-work program.  During the Joy of Giving week, employees across Wipro IT businesses, Wipro  Infrastructure and Wipro EcoEnergy donated old clothes and school kits to GOONJ.  Many new volunteers signed up with Wipro Cares during the week and many more  sent in monetary contributions towards the Wipro Cares Trust. audit, which was followed by remedial action and follow-up. This is an on-going  process, to collectively make continuous improvements with respect compliance.  We will progressively extend this to other business units of the organization. EMPLOYEE CONSULTATION & REPRESENTATION A cross functional team with representation of employees from project teams,  contract staff and operations/facility management team exists across locations.  These committees are anchored by the location operations team and take part in  risk assessments, safety inspections, water audits & balance studies, hygiene & food  quality assessments and in green initiatives. Over 500 employees are part of these  groups with representation across gender and physical abilities. Over the next few  years, we look to institute this at more centers.

The number of locations has been consistently  increasing every year. The data for 2007-08 pertains to 54 locations while the 2010-11  pertains to 60 locations. All India locations are part of the environmental reporting  scope – energy, emissions, water and waste. Rest of World 19% of our IT employees work from locations outside India. Of this, a significant  majority (72%) is based out of customer premises, for which we are not reporting  environmental data. The Wipro overseas offices operate out of leased facilities – we  have  energy consumption data available for 80%, of the facilities while for the balance  20% we have used rules of thumb to arrive at best estimates.

These facilities house 72% of the employee workforce, while approximately 10% of  our employees work from smaller leased offices. The balance 18% of our employees  work from our overseas  client sites at any given point of time. While it is in our own  facilities that we have the flexibility and control to implement best practices, our  attempt is  replicate some of these to the extent possible in our leased offices. Ecological Sustainable Commitment: The triple bottom line of economic,  environmental and social good forms an essential part of its approach to  responsible Corporate Citizenship. With the environmental Management System  as its backbone, Wipro reaffirms its commitment, as part of its environmental  policy through a set of driving principles, namely – Regulatory  Compliance,  Minimization of our Ecological Footprint, Integration of Ecological Programs with  Business Strategy, Customer Stewardship, Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Transparency  in our reporting and Leadership Commitment.  Below is an extract from our Environment Policy that articulates the driving principles  of the EMS framework. ENERGY & GHG REDUCTION Goal(s)   Reduce the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG intensity of Wipros operations from 2.6 MT  per employee in 2010-11 to 1.3 MT per employee by 2014-15, translating into a net  reduction of nearly 60,600 tons at the Wipro Ltd level.  This target applies to all of our  campus facilities and offices  For Data Centers - which account for nearly 20% of our energy consumption - we are  in the process of establishing a metric that is representative of the nature of its  operations  For Scope 3 emissions - which comprise emission sources that are not in our direct  sphere of control - while we have a strong baseline measurement in place, we are in  the process of expanding the sources to be included under this Scope as per the new  GHG Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. We will  complete this exercise by end-2012 and simultaneously establish goals for reduction  that are appropriate for this category Note: Energy efficiency - our energy profile is changing rapidly; we plan to do a detailed analysis of  energy optimization opportunities before, trying arrive at targets. The goals as articulated above must be interpreted against the larger context of the IT  Services industry's hitherto employee-centric business model where a 'Per Employee'  metric seems the most logical choice.  However, in recent years there has been an  increasing proportion of Data Centers that we run for our customers where the 'Per  Employee' metric is not the right one; therefore, we are adopting a more nuanced  stance of layering our GHG emission reduction goals – while at the overarching level,  our original published goals on a Per Employee basis will continue to provide an  anchoring reference, for practical purposes we will monitor our goals on the three  layers explained in the Box above. The former is depicted in the first chart below while  the second chart shows the reduction targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions alone for  our office facilities and does not include data centers. What is clearly comes out  though is our commitment to halve our GHG intensity on a Per Employee basis.

It needs to be noted  that this is without normalizing for the significant addition of data centers and labs; a  relatively lower level of seat utilization also contributed to this increase. The IT Services industrys energy consumption pattern is largely driven by electricity  consumption in campuses and buildings and by fuel consumption in employee travel  and commuting.  However, the latter falls under Scope 3 emissions and our analysis is  primarily centered around the former.  The three primary sources of electricity  consumption in buildings are – Cooling, Computing and Lighting. Empirical analysis of  past data shows the split between these three sources to be approximately 50:35:10  in percentage terms with the balance 5% consumed by other infrastructure like Water  Treatment Plants, Pumps etc. Energy Efficiency is a function of four major factors – Technology, Processes for  measuring, auditing and monitoring, Asset Utilization and Behavior.

For example, Wipros early investment in LEED  rated buildings helped us realize a cumulated energy efficiency of more than 20% over  a five year period.  Internal factors like these determine the Degree of Control that an  organization can have on its energy consumption while external factors – e.g. Business  Climate, Regulations and Incentives etc – determine the Degree of Influence on its  consumption patterns. This is depicted in the visual below – when internal factors are  dominant, the Degree of Control is high and vice-versa. Given the wide range of factors contributing to energy efficiency, we think that a more  complete picture can be derived only by adding other efficiency metrics.  Therefore  we propose the addition of one new intensity metrics with 2010-11 as the baseline  year; For Datacenters, we will arrive at a different set of metrics. A consolidated  interpretation of these  metrics will help understand and analyze energy efficiency for  our office facilities much more effectively.  Per Square feet of office space: This metric excludes any data centers built exclusively  for customer operations/servicing. This metric is relatively more independent of the  volume of business activity and can help normalize for inter-period comparisons  where the external business context may be different. The table below shows the baseline measurements for 2010-11 for all office facilities,  India and Global.

Meeting these goals will  require much more than a  business-as-usual approach. The  mitigation strategy consists of  three key elements – Energy  Efficiency, Renewable Energy  (RE) Generation and Purchase  of RE. The proposed split  between the three key elements  is shown in the adjoining chart. - Higher Cooling  Efficiency (Earth Air  Tunnel, Geo-Thermal) - Higher Lighting  Efficiency (LED) - Changes in bldg design - Behavioral and process  changes Energy Efficiency Renewable Energy  (Gen) Renewable Energy  (Purch) 15% 5% 80% - MW Scale generation  of Solar PV, Wind,  BioGasifier - MW Scale purchase of  Clean Energy from third  party providers Energy Efficiency RE Generation RE Purchase GHG Mitigation Approach 5% 15% 80% ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY  AT WIPRO 095  Across the last three years, the contribution of electricity related emissions has  remained consistent at around 60% of our total GHG emissions, with the balance  coming mainly from business travel and employee commuting.

Restatement of figures:  There is a restatement in data published in the Sustainability  Report for 2009-10. The data presented earlier was the data submitted to CDP 2010. These  figures have been subjected to verification audits towards the later part of 2010 as part of  GRI external assessment. The observations and corrections were not incorporated in time for  publication in the 2009-10 GRI report, and hence have the earlier unverified 2010 CDP  figures. We are taking some steps to close the gaps between these two disclosures and the  verification process. Energy efficiency measures Our five year GHG reduction targets are based on an estimated improvement of 2 to  3% in energy efficiency per annum compounded. Our focus has been on the gradual  improvement of energy efficiency through a variety of measures. Given that we have  already realized significant energy savings from our early investments in green  buildings, additional efficiencies can be realized only through a combination of real  time matching of demand and usage and constant optimization of equipment  efficiencies through proactive maintenance; the deployment of a smart information  analytics platform that can enable the remote management of energy infrastructure is  a central plan to this approach. We are aiming to include all these measures through a  ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY  AT WIPRO 097 IT Business (India) Energy Efficiency:  An analytical picture The first  graphs below shows the four year trend of Energy Efficiency on a Per  Employee basis (kWh of Electricity Per Month Per Employee) while the second graph  depicts the split between different sources of energy.

Green buildings that use these principles cost about 2 to 4 percent more to  build, but can save as much as 8 to 9 per cent in operating cost annually as  compared to a conventional building. Wipro has about 3.4 million sq.ft LEED certified space in India,  approximately 25% of the total office space in India - perhaps the largest in  the country.  All our campuses are designed in conformance with the LEED  Gold standards. Procurement norms of the LEED standard require that we  procure construction materials and equipment that meet the required  environmental norms and standards in Energy and Water Efficiency, Waste  Management and Impact on Biodiversity. We are addressing energy efficiency measures holistically, by both active  and passive means, right from design, material selection and technology  selection. Further, we are scaling up the energy performance by smart  solutions and adaptive measures. Bringing down the demand by regulating  usage, which could be done either by behavior efficacy or by using enablers.  For example:  sensors.

Since we last wrote a case study  in our 2008-09 report on LEED buildings, we have  expanded significantly our footprint of Green Buildings. Energy Efficient Computing While energy efficiency of computing infrastructure seems to have followed a  doubling Moores law of its own, the cumulated energy consumption of IT  infrastructure has increased rapidly. Computing accounts for 32-35% of the total  electricity consumption in Wipro and is prime area of focus in terms of energy  efficiency improvement; In this context, Virtualization of server infrastructure is  one of our major initiatives that along with greater computing efficiency also results  in a smaller resource and energy footprint. Server Virtualization Program  We provisioned 247 virtual servers in the year 2010-11. The total number of virtual  servers now is 495 - and these are hosted on 70 physical servers. Virtualization of our  server environment significantly brings down the energy costs due to on-demand  load sharing between server spaces, easier configurability and centralized power  management of the servers. In 2010-11 alone, we saved 265 Mwh units of electricity  due to this. This translates to a GHG emission reduction of 220 Metric Tons of  CO2-equivalent. 15 40 160 247 33  Our renewable energy strategy As shown in an earlier chart, our GHG mitigation plan has a significant dependence on  the deployment of renewable energy in our operations – purchase of RE and captive  RE together account for 85% of our targeted GHG emission reductions till 2015.  Our five year plan (2009-10 to 2014-15) is scale-up the sourcing of RE to more than  150 million units from clean power technologies. This represents nearly 32% of our  total power requirement – a significant increase from the current 9%.  The broad plan is to achieve the above goals through a mix of procurement through  PPA (power purchase agreements), purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs)  through the medium of power exchanges, captive Megawatt scale projects through  independent producers and a few  micro-installations within our campuses. In 2010-11, we purchased 24.5 Mn Units of RE power, mainly from small hydro  producers. We are targeting a 70% increase in the current financial year (2011-12) to a  figure of 40 to 45 Mn units of power, again primarily from micro hydro sources.  Currently, we are well positioned to reach this target, having purchased more than  25 Mn units already. At the targeted level of RE usage, the total estimated  reduction in GHG emissions will be of the order of 32000 Metric Tons of  CO2-eq for 2011-12. Solar Thermal Heating Category of use Approx. Savings (Mwh/Year) 1274.14 Solar PV installations 3.391 Use of captive renewable energy in our operations Our approach has been to start with pilot projects in Solar Photovoltaic (PV), Micro  Wind Turbines and Solar heating applications. The highest footprint of usage has  been in solar heating applications as solar thermal heaters are used for water heating  in our guest houses, dormitories and cafeterias.  The approximate electricity savings from these applications are shown in the adjacent  table. ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY  AT WIPRO 099  THE CHALLENGES OF RENEWABLE POWER PURCHASE IN INDIA The Prime Ministers National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)   launched in mid-2008 first suggested a renewable power purchase  obligation (RPO) for state electricity distribution entities as a means of  improving the RE mix in the grid and of accelerating RE development.  Since   RE power cannot be differentiated from hydrocarbon  power  in the grid,  the concept of the Renewable Energy Certificate ( or REC) as a tradable  instrument  in energy exchanges was introduced in September 2010.  However for institutions other than distribution entities that wish to  purchase RE from the open access market, the challenges are many – e.g.  price parity with the grid, availability of sufficient supply capacity,  transparency and efficiency of the governance process, inadequate market  mechanisms for trading in RE etc. On the last named dimension, India  currently has two energy trading exchanges – The India Energy Exchange  and  Power Exchange India – where  RECs are traded on a monthly basis;  but the supply of RECs is mainly against non-solar sources e.g. Microhydro,  Wind, Biomass and it is not difficult to see that this is because Solar Energy is  still battling several teething problems  and it will be a while before solar  capacity becomes visibly significant.  Indias National Solar Mission (NSM) seeks to change this and provide an  accelerated impetus to the development of solar energy in India through a  combination of commercial incentives and technology R&D. While we  appreciate the vision of the NSM, we think that a lot more foundational work  needs to be done before the build up of solar capacity becomes visible; in this  regard, we had communicated our concerns and recommendations to the  Indian Prime Minister in early 2011, the gist of which is reproduced in  Section 5H on Government and Policy.  The point that we are emphasizing  here is that for business entities that wish to increase their RE footprint, supply  capacity is likely to pose a constraining factor in the near future. The two major levers for organizations to increase their RE footprint are to (I)  Enter into long term Private Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with independent  producers and (II) to purchase RECs from the energy exchanges; each of these has  its pros and cons - Long term PPAs provide revenue security to the developer who  in turn can offer dynamically flexible pricing mechanisms that reflect falling prices of  emerging technologies like solar energy. For the customer, it is a long term  agreement that provides the best option of a commercial justification since there is  reasonable assurance of declining prices. On the other hand, the REC pricing mechanism as currently designed  acts as an  incentive for developers but  mainly seems to cater to short obligations of green  power purchase by distribution utilities and does not provide answers to questions  of long term energy security for institutional purchases. PPAs with private RE developers The cost of this power can be priced competitively (at par or below grid price) if  one enters in to a medium or long term agreement. In the current regime, the  generator and purchaser have an additional option to trade the REC in the market.   Although the entity that finally holds the REC has the legal claim to renewable  power, the PPA partners contribute by way of long term financial arrangement and  commitment to generation and purchase of power. In summary, while the RE mission in India has had a fair start in terms of policies and  incentives that aid investments in this space, there is significant ground that needs to  be covered if RE has to become a force by itself in Indias quest for energy security ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY  AT WIPRO 100  Business Travel Our Per Capita GHG emissions on account of business travel for 2010-11 is 19%  lower than the corresponding metric for 2008-09. Our consistent focus on the usage  of  video conferencing, live meetings and tele-conferencing infrastructure – backed by   improved user experience – has been a significant contributory factor towards this. Water is an issue that entwines social and ecological concerns at once in a manner  that is much more emotive and direct that other ecological dimensions. In India,  Water and its availability for drinking, cooking, sanitation, farming and industrial  purposes is a challenge that is much more immediate than climate change and one that  requires a engagement with a different vision and approach from government,  business and civil society from the myopic outlook that been hitherto the norm. At Wipro, we view water from the three inter-related lens of Conservation,  Responsibility and Security; our articulated goals are therefore predicated on these  three dimensions. Goal(s):  by 5% year on year   responsible water management in  proximate communities, especially in  locations that are prone to water scarcity   Recognizing water availability as a  business risk, to proactively assess and  plan for the water security of the  organization in a manner that is congruent  with the above two goals To improve water efficiency (Freshwater use per employee)  Responsible Sourcing - To ensure  LIVE MEETINGS Internet enabled video and voice conferencing technologies are used  extensively, delivering cost savings through reduction in travel. A total of  87,600 meetings with an average attendance of 4 people per meeting have  been conducted using this service. We have assumed that 75% of meetings happen across locations in India, the  balance being within the same city/facility. Even if one considers that all  these meetings happened within India (which is a very conservative  estimate considering most of the time the meetings are between teams at  overseas customer locations and those based in our India centers) and  takes an average distance of 1000 KMs between our offices in India, we have  saved 25,097 tons of CO2 equivalent by avoiding travel for 50% of the  people attending each meeting. WATER EFFICIENCY 3 We recycle 872880 m  of water in 21 of our major locations, (647111   for 19  locations in 2009-10) using Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), which represents 32% of  the total water consumed. Water is withdrawn from four sources - ground water, municipal water supplies,  private purchase and rain water utilization – with the first two sources accounting for  nearly 65% of the sourced water. The per employee water consumption for the  3 reporting year is 1.81m  per month and 1.75 m  when inclusive of contract staff.  3 m 3 ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY  AT WIPRO 101 Water Efficiency Water Security Water Responsibility  Water Withdrawal by Source 0 2000000 1800000 1600000 1400000 1200000 1000000 800000 600000 400000 200000 3 m Ground  Water Municipal Water Supply Private Purchase Industrial  Association Rain Water Utilized Total 2009-10 2010-11 2008-09 305231 655369 474198 53620 0 1488418 265459 635722 478632 13204 5052 1398070 416143 749988 626031 110242 3423 1905827 The water supplied by the municipal bodies and the industrial association are sourced  by them in turn from river or lake systems. Our water that is purchased from private  sources can be traced to have been extracted from ground water.   36 of our 60 locations in India are leased and located in prime city areas. For these  locations, waste water is discharged to CETPs (Common Effluent Treatment plants)  and to the municipal sewerage systems. We take care not to discharge waste water  into any subsurface waters, surface waters or sewers that lead directly to rivers,  oceans, lakes, wetlands, and ground water. The treated water from our sewage  treatment plants are tested for control parameters as specified by the local pollution  control board. These parameters are in conformance to permissible central pollution  control board requirements. Discharges into CETPs and municipal sewers is treated  and discharged as per the municipal requirements. Our facilities do not generate any process effluents that would have needed  specialized treatment plants. Our two factories are equipped with Effluent  treatment plants to cater to process effluents.  Approximately 72562 m  of the rainwater harvested in 13 locations is used to charge  the ground by means of recharge pits, as against 21353  for 6 locations reported in  2009-10 The figure below is a snapshot of our water withdrawal by source;  the 36% increase in  total water consumption over the previous year is on account of a commensurate  increase with the workforce and extended water requirements for our new data  center cooling infrastructure.  Our future steps on this would be to explore and pilot  recycled water for other uses apart from flushing and landscaping.  3 3  m We take care not to withdraw water from water bodies that are recognized to be  particularly sensitive due to their relative size, function, or status as a support source  for endangered species. None of our operations impact any nationally or  internationally designated water conservation areas.  ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY  AT WIPRO 102  UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIO ECONOMIC CONTEXT OF WATER  India is one of the most water stressed countries in the world with an  estimated 30% of the population still without access to potable, clean water.  However, unlike the problems of energy and GHG emissions, the solutions  to the water crisis cannot come from grand breakthroughs in technology or  through policy interventions. Water has been and will continue to be  predominantly a local issue that needs to be managed by local stakeholders.  Changing consumer profiles, insensitivity towards usage, urban centric  growth and lack of transparency have aggravated the water availability  scenario in our communities.  The infrastructure of water distribution in urban centers of India suffers  from poor accountability – thus leading to lack of awareness and misuse.  It is  not surprising that the cost of water does not take into account the  current and future impacts to the economic, social and environmental  balance of the extended ecosystem. Added to this is the issue of equitable  distribution of water – access is assured to those who can pay and very often  denied to those who cannot but this is accompanied by the irony of the  latter paying much more than the former. Proper  maintenance of water and  sewage infrastructure is another prime urban water issue that needs considerable  improvement. Sourcing of water is a complex interplay of various socio-economic factors at  various levels – organization, community, catchment area and the city. Hence a  multi-stakeholder approach to water management is crucial. While government  agencies and the public sector have been important players in water till now, there  are enough case studies from across the world that illustrates the critical  importance of community management of water. With the objective of improving  our own understanding of  the socio-economic context of our sourcing of water  and acting upon it,  we have commissioned a comprehensive study to explore these  areas at two of our large locations in Bangalore and Chennai. The study, to be  completed in 2012, will serve as a reference template for Wipro to form an  informed understanding of the water scenario in the other locations that it  operates in. More importantly, the study should provide us with the basis for  engaging with different stakeholders and to devise appropriate strategies and action  plans that consider both the short and the long term aspects of water ecology and  water security in our campuses and areas proximate to it. ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY  AT WIPRO 103  POLLUTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT Goal(s):  To ensure by 2013 that not more than 5% of all generated waste  ends up in landfills Pollution of air and water poses one of the most serious threats to community health and  welfare.  Wipro fosters robust processes to segregate waste into organic, inorganic,  E-waste, hazardous, packaging, Biomedical and other waste. Our waste management  strategies are centered around either (i) recycling the waste for further use or  (ii) arranging for safe disposal.   Waste Management at Wipro began its journey in 2007-08. With the split of  waste approximately being - 20% reaching  land fills, 35% recycled and the remainder  disposed to vendors of which the final fate of the waste was unknown, nascent steps in  the development and Implementation of efficient waste management strategies were  taken.   An established target provided the platform to drive a segment based approach to  waste management – the objective being to develop a definite waste hierarchy so as to  extract maximum practical benefits and generate minimum amount of waste through  responsible sourcing of waste vendors, investments in in-house eco-friendly waste  management units and the minimization of waste generation at the source. A monitoring plan for the evaluation of all types of waste generated at our campuses  was initiated. Based on the type of waste generated, they were classified into  E-waste, Hazardous Waste, Inorganic Waste, Organic Waste, Packaging Waste and  other waste. High waste generation sources such as the cafeteria and office paper  were targeted and appropriate investments towards in-house recycling units were  made. Our facilities are now equipped with Bio-Methanation plants, Organic  Waste Converters, Vermi-Compost Pits and Paper Recycling Plants. In addition,  source based segregation is put into practice with each category owning its  space in the waste storage area. Colour coded and labeled bins are made  available at common points around the facility.  Considering that final fate of a majority of our waste lies in recycling vendor hands, we  began to evaluate category-specific vendors. Vendors are identified based on a  detailed vendor evaluation process by the Central Procurement office and the  Environmental Health & Safety Department. Prior to entering into a contract,  the waste vendors are audited to determine the handling, storage and disposal  practices & protocols.  With the above practices in place, in 10-11, Wipro has evolved to a stage where  we recycle 83% of the waste disposed across our campuses -  through both,  authorized vendor tie ups and in-house recycling units. The remainder is incinerated  or disposed to municipal landfills. We continue to remain dependent on external  vendors for the disposal of certain waste categories such as Mixed solid waste,  Metals, Plastics, Packaging Waste, Tissue waste and Garden waste. We ensure that  all vendors are evaluated for their practices and a detailed account of all waste  handling is maintained and tracked on a monthly basis. Wipro recognizes waste material as a valuable resource; this value has been best  realized by adopting stringent targets, periodic monitoring, life cycle thinking,  sustainable consumption, in-house recycling units and vendor evaluations. These tools  and approaches are potentially transforming and have an exciting leading edge in  Wipros waste management journey in achieving its target. The figures in the following page provide detailed statistics on the multiple categories  of waste generation, recycling and disposal that happens as part of our operations.

But like  all other ecological capital, biodiversity loss is a trade off that considerations of  economic growth have constantly to grapple with. The business sector faces this  dilemma directly when it has to take decisions on setting up operations in the  proximity of biodiversity sensitive zones; even if not on such a serious note, the  creation of most new infrastructure invariably involves the destroying of tree cover.  As an organization with large campuses in urban settings, we are acutely conscious of  our responsibility on this front and have set for ourselves the following goals.  To convert five of our existing campuses to biodiversity zones by 2015  All new campuses will incorporate biodiversity principles into their design  Our first biodiversity project was initiated at our Electronic City campus in  partnership with ATREE, a globally renowned biodiversity institution (www.atree.org)   in 2010-11. The project will get completed in its first phase by 2012.We think that  this is a unique experiment in a corporate context;  Biodiversity projects are, by  nature and design, long term and visible results take many years to show. But we  see manifold benefits from a program like this.    A significant improvement in the air quality in and around the campus  An eventual  reduction of 1.5 to 2 deg C in the ambient temperature  with a  corresponding reduction in cooling load, electricity consumption and GHG  emissions  A higher level of ground water conservation  Visibly superior campus aesthetics on account of more trees, less grass, natural  water bodies and more species of fauna  A unique platform to engage employees as biodiversity evangelists and champions BIODIVERSITY ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY  AT WIPRO 106  WORLD SPARROW DAY  AT WIPRO Another notable reflection  of our commitment to  biodiversity was the hosting  of the World Sparrow Day  on March 20th 2011 at our  Bangalore campus. The  house sparrow was once  common in Indian cities  but today it is equally  conspicuous by its absence.  Empirical research suggests  several reasons for its disappearance, many   of which are symptomatic of  the direction in which rapid urbanization has happened e.g. the  predominance of tall vertical glass fronted buildings that do not allow  nesting spaces for sparrows. Championing the cause of the sparrow and other common bird species has  been Mohammad Dilawar, one of Time magazines 2008 Heroes of the  Environment. Through Nature Forever Society (www.natureforever.org), a conservation institution set up by him, Mohammad has been  passionately advocating the cause of the house sparrow across the  country. World Sparrow Day, a brainchild of Mohammad, has the vision of  making sparrow awareness and conservation a global movement.

While it is  estimated that there are at least 60 million households that use kerosene for lighting,  1 several times that many depend on biomass for cooking . It is either due to lack of grid  access or due to poor and unreliable supply that these households, mostly of rural  poor, depend on kerosene for lighting. This essay restricts itself to discussing the  challenges of electrification and briefly discusses the role of solar photovoltaic  technology towards meeting the challenges of rural electrification. Universal electrification should be considered an important mandate of any  government, given that the access and consumption of even small amounts of  electricity is known to significantly improve the socio-economic welfare of  households and communities. Towards achieving this goal, India has initiated several  programs in the past. The most recent, and certainly the prominent one, has been the  Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyuthikaran Yojana (RGGVY) of Ministry of Power with a  mandate of providing one unit (1 kWh) of electricity per day per household by 2012.  This was primarily meant to be achieved by grid extension. This program has been  rolled out and large sums of money have been allocated and several villages have been  grid connected. Similarly, intense electrification has been carried out in several  2 villages that were originally only name-plate electrified . There have been a few  studies on the RGGVY program  and the jury is still out on the progress made by the  3 program  thus far. UNIVERSAL ELECTRIFICATION: A POSSIBLE SOLUTION Shuba V. Raghavan Formally with Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), Bangalore The additional capacity required to meet the RGGVY mandate works out to be less  than 10,000 MW of installed capacity. To put these numbers in perspective, as of June  4 2011 the total installed capacity in India was around 177,000 MW .  However, for the  annual 8-9% GDP growth rate that India is targeting, the generation capacity has  5 to more than double by 2020 . Hence, the additional capacity requirement to meet the  mandate of RGGVY is small in comparison. Large power plants based on conventional  fossil fuels and renewable sources are in the books. However, it has to be noted that  this is going to take time. Moreover, unless carefully planned, this is unlikely to result in  significant improvement in rural electricity supply in the immediate future. Given this,  what is the best way to expedite energy reach to all and make the GDP growth an  inclusive story? In fact, a range of solutions should be considered to successfully electrify un- electrified villages, hamlets and individual houses that  are in electrified villages, yet not  grid connected. Depending on the geography,  terrain, distance from the grid, this  could be accomplished by grid extension, micro-grids based on decentralized  distributed generation at the regional or village level and decentralized generation at  the household level. Furthermore, depending on the availability of local resources, the  decentralized generation can be based on a portfolio of resources – mini-hydel,  biomass, solar or fossil fuel such as diesel or natural gas. Grid extension is the least cost option for urban areas and densely populated rural  areas. However, for remote settlements mini-grid and off-grid solutions are likely to be  attractive, since the deployment will have lower lead time, negligible transmission and  distribution losses, local employment generation and boost to local economic activity.  Furthermore, if based on local renewable source, this could be accomplished with a  lower carbon footprint. However, measures should be taken to ensure that the plant  will continue to operate and can be integrated with the grid when it does arrive. The  key challenges related to decentralized generation is often the steep up-front sticker  price, local capability to install and then maintain the system in the years to come,  financing so that the end-users can afford and the cost of generation. 112 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES  113 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES  There are several examples of success stories in India of decentralized generation.  Husk Power is one such story – it constructs and operates biomass based power  micro-grids (capacity of 35 kW to 52kW to power over 250 households), using locally  available rice husk as their fuel source.  They are based on a pay-and-use model  where the households pay periodically an upfront fee for a fixed quantum of electricity.  An example of generation at household level is that of Solar Home Lighting Systems  (SHLS). Though solar is perceived as expensive by many, three major solar players, all  Karnataka based, have been successfully servicing the rural solar markets for more  than a decade with varied business models. For example, SELCO Solar operates more  as an energy service company than as a solar product company, by providing  customized systems and financial packages. The interesting part is that these three  solar players have leveraged the countrys rural regional banking network and  have operated thus far at market conditions – consumers have availed of loans at  market rates.  Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology provides the flexibility in scaling from a few watts  to light a single bulb in a home to electrify individual homes to entire communities.  From a conventional techno-economics standpoint, solar PV might appear expensive  with an estimated levelized cost of electricity of about Rs. 16/ kWh (assuming Rs. 120/  W for the PV modules), taking into account the other infrastructure costs for a micro  6 grid . However, the range of applications, and institutional mechanisms that have  evolved to disseminate them, have made solar based applications flexible to meet the  rural households needs as well as be affordable to them. Furthermore, as aspirations  and affordability rise, modules can be added, allowing greater loads and consumption.  Moreover as the resource is not a constraint, solar lighting systems, once paid for, can  continue to operate for years to come. It can abate the grid when it is on or provide  backup power in the case of outage. Of course the only catch here is that these  systems need battery storage as the hours of supply (day time) and the demand  (evenings) do not match. However, if adequate efforts are taken in planning this hurdle  can be crossed. The only reason why decentralized distributions have not seen a wider up-take is the  institutional mechanisms that govern the operations of the plant. While, no single  institutional mechanism has reliably worked in all situations, the common thread has  been that the operations and maintenance has to be guaranteed and the tariff and cost  recovery mechanism has to be structured keeping in mind the end-users willingness  and ability to pay. Among the distributed generation technologies, solar has played an important role  in rural electrification and is likely to continue to do so in the years to come.  While the technology is already mature and ready to be harnessed, innovation in  product designs and business models are needed for increased dissemination.  With the adoption of LED based lighting the landscape is already changing; the wattage    requirement has dropped translating into lower PV panel size and hence cost.  At this juncture, it is important for the government to plan its role very carefully.  While financial impetus is required and welcome, it has to be structured carefully  not to stifle the market. The strength of the large banking network in India can be  utilized to reach lighting solution to the poor in remote areas.  Even at todays costs, solar for decentralized generation is economically viable and can  play a major role in rural electrification in the coming years. Enabling policy  mechanisms, tariff and cost recovery mechanisms that can vary with the ability to pay  have to be carefully planned.  Furthermore, if reliable service does not follow sales,  these installations might end up as solar trash. If adequate efforts are taken solar  lighting systems can prove to be a quick, clean and sustainable solution. 1 National Sample Survey Organization, 2007. 2 A village is deemed electrified if the distribution network has been set up and if  minimum community facilities and 10% of the households are grid connected  http://www.powermin.nic.in/rural_electrification/definition_village_electrification.htm 3 Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Program: Urgent Need for mid-course correction,  July 2011, Prayas Energy Report. 4 Ministry of power website, http://www.powermin.nic.in/JSP_SERVLETS/internal.jsp,  accessed on August 29,2011. 5 Low Carbon Studies for Inclusive Growth, an Interim Report, May 2011, Planning Commission, Government of India. 6 Detailed techno-economics of solar lighting systems are presented in Harnessing Solar  Energy: Options for India, December 2010, CSTEP report.

What  follows is a summary of the new milestones reached during 2010-11 on the three  pillars of Energy Efficiency, Toxics Elimination and End-of-Life  Responsibility for e-waste. (For a detailed overview, refer pages 140-141 of our  Sustainability Report for 2009-10).  All the 24 laptop models and 24 desktop models introduced in 2010-11 are  now certified for U.S. EPA's Energy Star 5 rating. Out of these models, half of  them exceed ES 5 rating requirements. On an average ES 5 models have  operational power savings of 15%  Wipro Green Console - a power management solution for system  administrators shipped with desktops Energy Management  While all our desktop and laptop models are already 100% RoHS compliant, the  number of vendors who are RoHS compliant has increased from 30 to 49  PVC and BFR free models being progressively launched since 2010.  37% of our product launches now are PVC/BFR free - and balance planned to be  rolled out by 2012 Chemicals Management   Multi-fold increase in collection of e-wast through our collection centers-this is  now available for computing e-waste from other manufacturer / vendors  600 components/parts recycled on an average per month  Waste Management WIPRO'S GREEN COMPUTING  JOURNEY:  AN UPDATE Driven by Moores Law, the economics of computing has been a three  decade long story of More for Less- more output for less resources – in  other words, a sustainability dream; But the Jevons Paradox – named after  English economist Stanley Jevons  and that articulates the puzzle of  increased consumption of a scarce resource even as its efficiency increased  – is visibly evident in the case of computing resources. Even as chips have  become smaller, demand for materials used in electronics has only increased.  A recent IEEE paper stated clear evidence for the Moores Law equivalent  for energy efficiency of computing i.e. where energy consumption per  MFLOP of computing power has halved nearly every two years.  We already see the above in evidence: the run-in on the rare earths used in  electronics and its geopolitics, the vast quantities of electronic waste that is  generated every year, a lot of which either lands up at landfills or is  processed unsafely in the informal sector and the fact that data centers  alone account will soon account for 10% of the total electricity  consumption in the U.S.A.  Given these facts, the electronics and Hi-Tech industry have a critical  responsibility on product stewardship. Till now, they have responded  reasonably well, driven by both, a sense of responsibility and transparency  that comes more readily to the industry and by pressure from civil society.  For nearly five years now, Wipro has been a pioneer in applying sustainability  principles to its range of desktops and laptops. On the three drivers of  Toxics Elimination, Energy Efficiency and End-of-Life responsibility, we  have tried to raise the bar constantly. Our Green Computing story has  been articulated in fair detail in our previous sustainability reports which  the reader can refer to. What we present here is an update.  CUSTOMER  STEWARDSHIP 120 Extended Producer Responsibility in Green Computing Wipro was one of the early pioneers in recognizing the e-waste problem as one of  Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and was the first in India to start an extensive  take back program in 2007. Over the last three years, we have constantly improved  and matured the process for take back and safe processing.  In FY 2010-11, a total  of 260.43 tons of E-waste (2.6 ton of CO  equivalent) was collected from our  2 17 collection centers across India and disposed through our network of certified  partners.  The whole process chain is depicted below: All EOL material that arrives at the collection centers is either segregated for reuse or  recycle. Storage devices first go through a process of datawiping before it is sent for  recycling.  Around 600 parts or components per month, ranging from monitors, motherboards and  other accessories are segregated, checked thoroughly and reused in our sustenance  services. The balance EOL material is sent to an authorised e-waste recycling vendor. WIPRO'S  GREEN CONSOLE  POWER  MANAGEMENT SOLUTION  FOR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS All desktop models are now shipped  with a unique power management  solution for customers – called  Wipro Green Console. Many of our desktop customers are large  government departments and corporates.  The Green Console module  will be useful for system and network administrators in such organizations  to remotely monitor power management and manage patch deployments.  The solution  also provides a comprehensive aggregate dashboard of  energy usage profiles and helps one identify scenarios for potential energy  savings. The tool can also provide the cost of electricity based on energy  tariffs for the reporting period. Wipro Green Console has been designed  to empower organizations to significantly reduce their energy costs  without impacting their users. The tool is estimated to save around  20-30% of energy for a networked deployment of desktops. Key Features:  Client ready power saving tool   Discover network/client system, apply power policies/schedules   Browser Based application   Power Audit – Defined templates   Client power polling at scheduled intervals   Dashboards Re-Usable Ewaste EOL Asset  Validation HOD, Storage  Devices Degause /  Datawiping Functional  Testing SCRAP Dispose to  Recycler Test Result SCRAP Pack & Label  (RE-USE/GREEN) Pass Fail Dispose to  Recycler  CUSTOMER  STEWARDSHIP 121 Our efforts have focused around multiple levers :  Socializing the idea to our customers and convincing them on why returning their  EOL equipment constitutes responsible behaviour   Our own investment in terms of bearing the logistics costs of collecting,  warehousing and transporting the EOL equipment   Identifying and working with certified partners who can be trusted to safely  process the e-waste  As the table shows, our efforts have shown impressive results with a five  fold increase in the quantum of e-waste collected over a two year period Total E-waste Recycled (Tons) 49.0 92.0 260.43 Average per month (Tons) 4.1 7.6 21.70 2010-11 2009-10 2008-09 Year Beyond the norm: In 2010 - 11, we extended our take back services beyond  the norm to products that originate from other vendors. Through our Infrastructure  Availability Services (IAS) division - that provides multivendor implementation,  support and maintenance  services to domestic customers in India – we offer our  customers the choice of returning these other electronic products. This provides an  enhanced convenience value to customers and is especially valuable in the instances of  imported products where the primary manufacturers presence in India is limited to  sales and first level technical support. Going forward, we welcome the impending coming into effect of The e-waste  legislation from May 2012;  we played a central role as part of the MAIT committee  (Manufacturers Association of Information Technology) that worked with the central  government in the drafting of this regulation. The legislations strong emphasis on  Producer Responsibility is something that we have always believed in and advocated. EPR (EXTENDED PRODUCER  RESPONSIBILITY) AND BEYOND Popular images of mountain heaps of discarded mobile phones typify the  problem of electronic waste(e-waste)  – that of the potential risk of  toxic metals – Cadmium, Mercury, Antimony etc - leaching to the  ground and polluting land and water. However, the problem of electronic  waste globally  is not one of unmanageable volume alone; many electronic  products contain upto 60 elements of the periodic table and extracting  them safely for further reuse requires stringent standards of the relevant  technology, something which is not available in most countries. This has  led to the emergence of an unorganized, informal sector in developing  countries like India which uses dubious methods to extract the metals e.g.  incineration, acid-bath etc. The pollution and health risks from such  methods are extremely serious. It therefore becomes the responsibility  of the primary producer of the electronic product to ensure that at  the end of its life, the product is collected back from the customer and  safely processed by the recycling ecosystem, which typically will consist of  multiple points of expertise that are geographically dispersed. Precautionary approach for development of new product lines We are starting a life cycle assessment program, including verification, for some of our  key personal computing product lines. The first step in this journey we have  undertaken is to look at core environmental and social performance indicators across  our supply chain to understand focus areas. The study, currently underway, will be  completed in 2012.  CUSTOMER  STEWARDSHIP 122 ARISE:  AN INNOVATION MODEL  IN ADVANCED AND  AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE In early 2011, we created a joint  initiative with IMEC - a leading research  organization in nano-electronics and  nano-technology – to co-innovate and  build next generation intelligent  systems, called Applied Research in Intelligent Systems Engineering (ARISE). The joint  initiative will initially focus on developing intelligent systems based on next generation  sensors, wireless and energy harvesting technologies for key industry verticals.  Emerging markets, consisting of 80% of the global population, offer great  opportunities for intelligent products to be designed ground up to address its unique  needs. Nanoelectronics is one of the cornerstones of the thrust to designing product  that address societal challenges like efficient and sustainable healthcare system,  sustainable urbanization, and sustainable use of energy.  Arise  is designed to be a bridge between industry and academia.  Focused teams will  work on applied research, technology scanning & evaluation, humanistic science and  systems design. In the initial phases, arise will explore and develop solutions based on  bio-sensor based interventions for affordable patient health monitoring and advanced  imaging technologies. Industry OEM NGO Government Startup ARISE Academia &  Research labs Our strong leadership in Green Computing is reflected in the continued  top position (India) that we hold in the latest Greenpeace ranking of  Green Electronics.   SUSTAINABILITY  AND THE  RESPONSIBLE  INVESTOR Responsible Investing and Wipro Investor Engagement Our Economic Performance and Value Add to Investor 5e  SUSTAINABILITY AND THE  RESPONSIBLE INVESTOR 126 Wipro has been closely observing the discernibly growing trend of Investors  adopting the Principles of  Responsible Investing into their decisions. While there is  a long way to go, we are heartened by the visible increase in the support for this  movement from the business sector. The measurement of social and environmental  externalities in financial terms is a central driver of this movement but this is an  area which is still at a nascent stage and one that will require both, more rigorous  academic consistency and vigorous advocacy to make it a mainstream practice. One of the data sources on environment, governance and social factors used by  institutional investors is the indices that track the performance of socially responsible  companies to facilitate Responsible Investment. Wipros commitment to sustainability  is reflected in us being part of two leading global sustainability ratings/indices, the DJSI  and NASDAQ Sustainability 100. Wipro is a constituent of the global DJSI 2011 (Dow Jones Sustainability Index) for the  second consecutive year, widely considered as the gold standard for companies in  sustainability. The Global DJSI comprises 318 companies, 2 of which are incorporated  in India. We were rated in the top 2 in India in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index  (CDLI) for 2011 and No.1 in 2010 by Carbon Disclosure Project. Our CDP response  for 10-11 can be viewed at www.cdproject.net.  Newsweek International rated Wipro  as one of the top 50 Greenest companies in the world for 2011.We have also been  included in the NASQAQ 100 Global Sustainability Index of the 100 global  sustainability leaders from across industry sectors.  Wipro Limited is also ranked first among Indian companies in the 2010  Asian Sustainability Rating (ASR). ASR 2010 analysed the publicly available  information of the 542 largest listed companies in 10 Asian countries.

OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND VALUE ADD TO INVESTORS Wipro believes that economic success is a by-product of the goal of  meeting the  expectations of all its stakeholders, of which Investors form a critical segment. We  believe that our investors look for good governance, fair and unbiased reporting and  consistent and predictable business performance. For the investors, these  performance criteria will translate to a more liquid, fairly valued and profitable  investment. We seek to build investor confidence in our company by benchmarking  our practices with the highest standards of governance, continuing investor  interactions and being responsive to feedback and critique.   Our financial performance can be better understood against the larger backdrop of  the Indian IT industry and the macro forces that are important underlying factors.  The  box item below is a critical summary of the Indian IT industry. SUSTAINABILITY AND THE  RESPONSIBLE INVESTOR 129 The Indian IT sector The global business environment continued to remain unpredictable and uneven in  FY 11. While the developed economies reflected softness, the emerging economies  compensated by continuing to growth, though at a subdued rate.  This made global  businesses reassess their strategies and identify areas for both near term and long  term improvements. In this new environment, the IT Sector has identified new  customer needs  and defined new opportunities to continue its growth trajectory:   Global  GDP is estimated to have  contracted by 0.6% in 2009 and subsequently  expanded by 5% in 2010. The expectation for the year 2011 is 4.4% growth. With  Global IT spends being directly linked to  GDP growth, the expectation is a  growth of 4% in FY 11  In India, IT-BPO sector revenues have grown from 1.2% of the national GDP in  1998 to an estimated 6.4% in FY 2011 reaching USD 88.1 billion - IT software sector and services sector (excluding hardware) is estimated to  account for USD 76.1 billion - IT services segment was the fastest growing segment, recording 22.7%  growth  - Indian software sector export was estimated to gross USD 59 billion in FY  2011. Its share of total Indian exports (merchandise plus services) increased  from less than 4% in FY 1998 to 26% in FY 2011  In the domestic market the IT - BPO revenues excluding hardware was expected  to grow at almost 16% to reach INR 787 billion in FY 11. The growth is primarily  driven by the strong economic growth, rapid advancement in technology  infrastructure, increasingly competitive environment for Indian businesses,  increase in government focus on governance and emergence of business models.  This has helped IT reach new customer segments even as the penetration into  the existing customer segments continued Viewed from the customer segments, BFSI continued to dominate demand, even as  emerging verticals such as retail, health care, media and utilities witnessed growth.  The direct employment provided by the IT Sector in FY 11 was expected to reach  2.5 million, an increase of 240,000 employees, while indirect job creation is  estimated at 8.3 million.  Financial Performance   Wipros Economic Value Add and distribution among its constituents is broadly  consistent in FY 11 when compared with FY 10.

The term Corporate Sustainability sounds technical, abstract and remote to many.  But given the growing influence of corporate sector in the modern world, it needs to  be better understood and appreciated by all stakeholders. For only then we can shape  a better world, for us today and for the future generations tomorrow.   Given the poetic liberty, the origin and evolution of corporate sustainability  movement can be anchored on a select few individuals without missing out on  anything substantial. This article attempts to do just that by anchoring on four  individuals - a 19th century economist William Stanley Jevons, Henry Ford the  20thcentury entrepreneur-industrialist, John Elkington, the sustainability crusader and  the 17th century evangelist, John Weseley.  While the economist highlighted the finite  nature of resources in the face of accelerating consumption, the industrialist fought a  losing battle in his attempt to leverage the corporate entity for public good. It took  eight decades for this issue to resurface in the public domain as the crusader defined a  CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY:  WHY DID IT START?  WHERE CAN IT GO? Shankar Jaganathan revised measurement system to place the shareholders demand in a proper  perspective. Enforcing this measure needs the evangelists idea to be revived, where he  highlighted the social issues integrated in economic decisions that required a  comprehensive view. Jevons Paradox This story begins with the industrial revolution, a period that heralded material  affluence on a scale never seen or imagined before. Mass production enhanced the  quality, quantity and variety of goods and services available to humanity. William  Stanley Jevons, one of the deep thinkers of that era called it the Age of Coal. To him coal  made all the difference. With coal almost any feat is possible or easy; without it we are  thrown back into the laborious poverty of earlier times he noted. Coal, a fossil fuel  was leveraged for the first time on a large scale to produce energy for manufacturing  that dwarfed all previous human endeavors. As the quantum of coal consumption  accelerated, its finite availability triggered a basic question in Jevons mind. He  addressed it in his book The Coal Question published in 1865. The byline to this book  explains the issue that troubled Jevons, An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of  Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal-Mines.  Coal was the first of non-renewable resources that mankind used in large quantities  which triggered concerns over its exhaustion. Following coal, as petroleum was mined  and used for transport needs, the same question came up; would the world run out of  oil? Gradually this concern for exhausting the non-renewable resources came up in all  cases where non-renewable resources are used.  Today this concern extends to the  two basic resources that nourish human life, i.e. water and air too, which earlier was  seen as renewable. This concern however is not shared by all. Some believed that  science and technology will provide the answers for meeting the human needs. Either  new substitutes would be found like petroleum to supplement coal, or the resource  itself would be used more efficiently, if not both.  132 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES  133 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES In the days of Jevons itself, the efficiency argument was put forward. Not only was it  articulated loudly, but tangible evidence inspired it, with events like James Watt  improving Thomas Newcomens steam engine by increasing energy utilization from  coal. Jevons the economist noticed a strange phenomena occur when efficiencies  increased. Consumption of coal instead of declining rose sharply. Analyzing this  phenomenon, he concluded, It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical  use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth.  This observation today goes under the name of Jevons paradox. In short, this paradox  states utilization increases with an increase in efficiency, thereby consuming larger  resources.  Computer users over the last two decades can attest to this phenomenon as data- storage space evolved from KB to MB to GB to finally arrive at TB or Terra-bytes.  Jevons paradox, over the years has been repeatedly validated across a range of  resources thereby eliminating increased efficiency as a solution to overcoming  resource scarcity. Search for alternatives is the only avenue that remains. Petroleum  became the next source of energy to supplement coal. Its liquid state, enhancing its  portability, made it very attractive for individual consumption as distinct from coal  which is primarily used for industrial purposes. Not Just Fords Defeat Petroleum opened up new options for personal transport. Henry Ford the American  industrialist leveraged it by building low cost automobiles providing personalized  transport solution to masses. The successful entrepreneur within a short time  realized another dimension in Jevons Paradox. Increased efficiency meant reduced  cost. Reduced costs enables lower prices translating to an expanding market. In his  attempt to increase efficiency and reduce costs, he made a radical departure. In line  with other costs like rent, wages and interest, which are traditionally capped, he added  profit to this list unleashing pandemonium. Starting on a clean slate in 1903, Henry Ford built a very successful company. In 1915,  the company recorded revenue of $120 million with $25 million profits. From this  profit he distributed a dividend of $16 million translating to 800% return on the $2  million capital investment. In line with his desire to limit costs and increase efficiency,  Ford issued a newspaper advertisement on July 31, 1916, where he shared his  intention to limit future dividend payments to 5% of the original capital invested  per month.  After capping the dividends at 60% per annum, Ford declared he would  use rest of the money to reinvest in business to employ more men and share the  benefits of the new industrial system with the greatest number possible.  Other shareholders, namely the Dodge Brothers who held 10% interest in the  company filed a suit in the court seeking to restrain Ford from implementing his plan.  They contended that the interest of the shareholders was impinged. Instead of  maximizing profit for shareholders, Ford had deviated from this 11th Commandment  and was seeking to limit profits. During the court hearing, Henry Ford was asked to  state the objective of organizing the Ford Company. Violating the 11th  Commandment, he replied, Organized to do as much good as we can, everywhere,  for everybody.  And incidentally to make profits. In response, the Court in 1919  gave a landmark judgment which shaped the future of the corporate world.  Upholding  the 11th Commandment  it  held. A business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of  shareholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end. The  discretion of the directors is to be exercised in the choice of means to attain that end,  and does not extend to a change in the end itself, to the reduction of profits, or to the  non distribution of profits among stockholders in order to devote them to other  purposes.  This judicial decision legitimized the view that the objective of a business is to make  money. Though this decision was applicable only in the United States of America its  economic success made most other nations emulate it. They adopted not just the  regulatory environment, but also the American business philosophy. In the new  scheme of thinking, all other stakeholders became costs to be minimized, as  maximizing the shareholders interests became the sole concern. A defeat for Henry  Ford in the year 1919, turned out to be a defeat for all other stakeholders for the rest  of the 20th century.  A cynical view is to herald this decision as the entry of the  corporate world into the barbarian age. For the corporate world to return to  civilization, it would take many decades before a Swede opened up the gate for its  homecoming.    134 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES Elkingtons Civilization The single minded focus on serving the shareholders interest helped the corporate  sector grow in numbers and size. By the end of the 20th century of the 100 largest  economic entities in the world, 51 were corporate entities. In large countries like the  USA and India, their largest corporate, Wal-Mart and Reliance Industries had an annual  turnover accounting for about 3% of the countrys GDP. This size provided the  corporate entities with power to influence their environment. Further with  globalization opening up national borders, large multi-national entities present in  scores of countries wielded enormous influence over the foreign governments  shaping economic legislations and defining fiscal policies. This in turn further  accelerated their turnover and profits, making the global corporate citizens first  among equals in a predominantly democratic world. In the 20th century, new influences emerged working at multiple levels. While the  corporate influence is visible in the physical sphere, hidden from the public eye, a more  subtle influence was at work in shaping human aspirations. Human life and social  concerns which for centuries were shaped by a blend of religious, ethical, social,  political and economic thoughts gradually came under the sole influence of economic  considerations. Increasingly ethical, social and political issues came to be viewed  through an economic lens. An illustration of this feature is when economic theory  invaded social and personal life. Garry Becker, the Nobel laureate in Economics among  his other contributions evaluated the institution of family using economic concepts.  Viewing family as a small factory producing services for its members, he equated the  decision to have a child with buying consumer durables to be evaluated on a cost- benefit scale. He added up the cost of food, shelter, clothing, toys, and the childs  education to be balanced with the joy of having and raising children and the desire for  care in old age. He even attributed the falling fertility rate in the western societies to  government retirement schemes that guaranteed income to the aged, which reduced  the benefits from having children. Perhaps it is in anticipation of these trends and their implications that Stanislaw Lec  the 20th century European poet remarked Is it progress if a cannibal uses a fork? This  quote captures the context for a debate on the corporate impact on growth and  progress. While corporate contribution to growth is not contested, its positive  influence on progress is hotly debated. The negative influence of a single minded focus  on profits has seen many corporate entities being identified with sweat shops where  employees were placed in inhumane work conditions, spurious products that harmed  rather than benefited the consumers, exploitation of natural resources to the  detriment of the society and unethical means used that erupted from time to time in  corporate scandals which cheated investors out of their share of profits. Many conceded the mixed impact of corporate sector, but believed the positives far  exceeded the negatives. Even among those who saw the negative impact grow, they  could not size it nor balance it against its positives. A sector trained to pursue targets  needed something tangible to chase. John Elkington, the environmentally sensitive  Swede provided the corporate sector with not one but three bottom-lines to chase.  In addition to the traditional financial profits, the Triple Bottom-Line added two more  dimensions, people or the social impact and planet or the environmental impact.  Building on the triple bottom-line concept, we have the Global Reporting Initiative a  voluntary reporting framework for corporate entities with performance indicators to  track all the three bottom-lines.  Is triple bottom-line the gate that will permit the corporate sector to return to the  civilized world from the barbarian age? However triple bottom-line and Global  Reporting Initiative are only voluntary initiatives. If the corporate entities do not  voluntarily enter who or what can induce them to come in?           Weseleys Ethics  Hyman Minsky, an American economist identified five phases in the evolution of  capitalist economies. He painted a vivid picture of this evolution by identifying the  triggers for change and the power wielders in different eras. He traced the origin of  capitalism to sea trade in 1600 AD and identified the merchants as its primary driver.  The advent of industrial revolution shifted the power from the merchants to the  industrialists marking the second phase. The third phase saw the bankers usurping  power by financing mergers and acquisitions to construct big businesses. The Great  Depression in 1930s brought to the forefront the importance of management in  running big business, placing the power in the professional managers hands. This  marked the fourth phase. The fifth and the final phase identified by Minsky was the  advent of institutional investors who shaped the economy with equity markets  dominating the mindshare.   135 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES Large corporates are publicly listed entities. With their shares listed in stock  exchanges, the corporate top management looks to their share price and market  capitalization for vindicating their performance. Moreover in the last three decades,  many companies have linked their top management compensation to their share price  appreciation. This provides the investors with a lever to induce corporate  management to toe their line. For a variety of reasons, the investors in the last three  decades have used multiple other factors in making their investment decision, giving  rise to the concept of Socially Responsible Investments or SRI.   SRI has both a long and a short history. The triggers were multi-fold and can be  grouped under three broad heads: religious, environmental and humanitarian. Each of  them played a distinctive role in different geographies to bring SRI to the forefront.  Religious edicts have had a major influence, especially in Islam and Christianity.  Likewise environmental disasters and inhuman practices triggered environmental and  humanitarian filters.   The apartheid regime in South Africa that differentiated between human beings and  sanctioned discrimination based on the color of their skin, was opposed by the  investment community, though belatedly, by avoiding companies operating or investing  in South Africa. Likewise, the Pax World fund launched in 1971 by a Methodist  preacher focused on pacifist activities by eliminating companies engaged in  manufacturing war weapons, triggered by the popular opposition to Vietnam War.  The  environmental triggers too came into effect after the Bhopal plant disaster in India in  1984, which was followed in quick succession by the Chernobyl nuclear leakage in  1986.  The long history of religious triggers to economic activities goes back to the Sharia  law applicable to Muslims. This law separates all activities into halal or what is approved  and haram or what is prohibited. The prohibited economic activities include riba or  collecting interest, maysir or gambling and gharar or what is ill-defined. Gharar has a  more descriptive definition. It prohibits the sale of the birds in the sky, the fishes in the  sea, the unborn calf and the milk in the udder. In short, it prohibits contracts where the  goods are not defined, certain or the time of delivery or their quantity is not fixed.  Though Sharia law goes back to the seventh century, its presence in the investment  world is quite recent. It was only in early 1990s that the first Sharia - compliant mutual  funds started to appear. Today there are many Sharia based indices across the world  like Dow Jones Islamic Market Index, FTSE Global Islamic Index Series and Malaysian  Kula Lumpur Sharia Index. In India, the BSE TASIS Shariah 50 index is the first.  Like in Islam, the Bible too has strong strictures on regulating economic dealing with  brethren. Over time as these strictures began to lose their stringency, John Wesley, the  founder of the Quakers sect delivered his sermon on The Use of Money in the 18th  century. In this sermon he gave three guiding principles. He said gain all you can, save all  you can and give all you can. But this advice was with certain reservations. In short he  advocated a livelihood that did not harm the individuals life, mind or soul. A life that  was styled on prudence and austerity in spending with the excess income shared with  other fellow humans. A visible evidence of these ideas was in their shunning the slave  trade and armament business, both profitable businesses of that era.  In the recent times, triggered by these ideals, Friends Provident Stewardship Fund was  launched in 1984, which is among the first funds that used ethical filters in their  investment decision making process. Soon thereafter a wave of ethical funds was  launched to meet the growing needs of the church, the discerning individual and the  long term oriented pension funds. Ethical funds either have a negative list of industries  in which they avoid investing, or a positive list of industries to which they confine their  investing. However, these funds remained on the fringes in the 20th century.   SRI successfully moved from being a niche segment in the 20th century into the  mainstream in April 2006, when the United Nations launched the Principles of  Responsible Investing initiative. Investors who are signatory to this initiative are  required to align their interests to the broader objective of society by nudging their  investee companies to comply with the requirements of triple bottom-line. Though  this is also a voluntary initiative for the investors it has assumed greater importance  due to the endorsement from the United Nations combined with the global financial  crisis of 2008 that has made financial sector players search for respectability.  Looking ahead, a basic issue that needs to be addressed is whether sustainability  reporting should be mandated? Supporters of this move see it as the only way to  mainstream it in the corporate world. On the other hand, advocates who want it to  remain voluntary believe this movement will be stronger only when corporates with  conviction adopt it. For the non-compliant, a hostile environment created by the  stakeholders will do.    ETHICAL  SUPPLY CHAIN Supply Chain Engagement5f  ETHICAL  SUPPLY CHAIN 138 Business models of most industry sectors today are based on multi-tier,  geographically dispersed supply chains. Efficient access to resources and skills and  the increasingly globalized nature of markets have aided and accelerated this  process. The environmental footprint of the end product is thus distributed across  the value chain, typically in an uneven manner;  issues of governance, labor and  human rights also fall in the domain of each firm in the chain and may present a  widely varying picture. However, it is an axiomatic norm that the primary producer of  the product or service carries overall responsibility and is expected to exercise  varying degrees of influence and control on its supply chain in its sustainability  charter.  Wipro recognizes this compelling state of affairs and is committed  to including its supply chain in its sustainability program. As a predominantly  IT Services organization, our supply ecosystem comprises a high proportion of  contract workforce – both, software and facility services. The social and ethical  dimensions of sustainability -  Child Labor, Forced Labor, Discrimination, Health and  Safety – assume greater significance for us; In our first phase of the program  therefore, our primary focus will be on the Ethical Supply Chain.  We present below the broad areas of supply chain engagement and some examples of  our engagement areas with a high level assessment of the materiality of each  category. Since we are at a nascent stage of our supply chain program, we are not  presenting the maturity level of each category of engagement. Supplier  Category Materiality We have extended our diversity and equal opportunity program to our contract workforce  ecosystem in India; in particular, we encourage our partners to  increase the focus on women  and people with disability.  In line with the Wipro Code of Business Conduct, we have a zero tolerance policy for breaches of  basic human rights – Child and Forced Labor and Discriminatory Practices. In addition, we encourage  our services partners to continually improve the provisioning of health and safety benefits and  Periodic review of performance and Integrating employee feedback. Refer to our engagement with a  local transport authority in our previous report (2009-10, Pages 170-174). The responsible water use framework study, which we are doing with a reputed NGO, works closely  with local water authority. The study will be a good basis in furthering our engagement. LEED building standards prescribe procurement from local suppliers within a 800 KM range.  Our COBCE applies uniformly. Most of our software and hardware providers are large multinational organizations and  hence are at  a reasonably advanced stage of their own sustainability journey. Software Contract  Workforce Transport  Electricity Water Broad Sub-Categories Skilled and  Unskilled Labor Civil and  Infrastructure Software/Hardware People-based  Onsite Services Utility  Services Material  Providers High Medium Medium High Medium Examples of current eEngagement SUPPLY CHAIN ENGAGEMENT  The visual below presents our broad approach to supplier sustainability – based on the four pillars of ethical, ecological, responsible and local: Ethical Wipro expects its suppliers to  adhere to similar standards of ethics  and integrity as for itself. Specific  clauses in the COBCE require our  suppliers to adhere to ethical  behavior in every respect with zero  tolerance for any breaches.  Our Ombuds process is available  24X7 (online and through specified  contacts) for suppliers and  contractors to report any breach of  code of conduct by Wipro  employees. In 2011-12, we are rolling  out other channels e.g. multilingual  24X7 call center. During 2010-11, there were 13  instances of suppliers who were  found in breach of the COBCE,  subsequent to which we terminated  and blacklisted 10. For the balance 3 –  where the breaches were not  serious-  limited actions were taken  along with counseling and warnings. Local Recognizing the socio-economic  benefits of local procurement, we  encourage sourcing from the local  economy. Aligned to the LEED standards, nearly  50% of the construction materials are  sourced locally. At an aggregate level, nearly 80% of  our supplier base is based in India; By  value, 68% -up from 44% last year - of  the procurement for the year was  from these India based suppliers.  We have also started an exercise in  consolidating our supply chain base -  to make our engagement more  focused and meaningful. Ecological On ecological sustainability, our  expectations from suppliers are  twofold – first, we expect suppliers to  supply products and services that  exceed environmental standards.  In  particular, for our LEED buildings and  for our Energy Star green computers,  our suppler selection criterion is  entirely based on this set of  capabilities.  Second, we expect our suppliers to  establish a program of ecological  sustainability in their own operations.  Responsible We recognize that it is our extended  responsibility to maintain oversight  for the fact that our suppliers and  contractors adhere to the minimum  principles of human rights and  employee welfare.  Adhere to all regulations on  minimum wages, maximum  working hours etc  Protect health and safety of  employees  Demonstrate – in policy and  action – zero tolerance for child  and forced labor We influence suppliers who are in the  breach to take corrective actions.  Our plan is to set up a system of  supplier-training and independent  verification of our suppliers by 2012. ETHICAL  SUPPLY CHAIN 139  Case Study:  Collaborating to Provide a Secure Work Environment. For an organization of our operational scale – number of locations and employees  working out of large campus facilities – protection of assets and employees safety is a  critical responsibility. Wipros Global Security Group (GSG) is vested with this  responsibility; the staffing model of GSG is predicated on a very high level of  outsourcing to an external agency but with important leadership roles retained within  Wipro. What we present here therefore is a case study of supply chain engagement  that combines elements of sensitivity to human rights, employee safety and  working  conditions, all built on a bedrock of collaborative partnership. The Global Security Group (GSG) collaborates with employees, industry associations,  state and central governments to ensure enterprise wide management of physical  risks and vulnerability.  We have converged physical security requirements with  Information Technology (IT) in the areas of access control, fire safety system,  transport security and surveillance. GSG restores lost and found items worth  more than Rs.10 Mn to the employees every year.  GSG is a central stakeholder in   business continuity planning  and in facilitating client audits across business units. Outsourced manpower is an integral to the staffing  of GSG. Minimum wages with  additional allowances for retention coupled with statutory obligations and rewards  and recognitions are some of the measures encouraged for retention and motivation  of the outsourced security personnel. The focus on people development is maintained  through training programs that leverage Wipros internal expertise. Accurate, timely  payouts to the security staff are ensured through diligent oversight backed by prompt  redressal mechanisms. Incentives for exemplary performance of duties, fair play and  acts of bravery are encouraged. Considerable emphasis is laid on  enhancing soft skills  for the security staff. Confidence and capacity building of the Security and  Emergency Response Training  team is done through a diversified training curriculum. The other areas of focus in the GSG are  Joint patrolling of employee commute areas in collaboration with CISF and  Police - through Joint Task Forces -  to provide a safe  commuting experience for  employees at all hours, especially during night  Augmented security preparedness by conducting anti-terror mock drills in  coordination with NSG, Special Forces, NDRF, CISF, Local Police, Fire  services and Hospitals  Encouraging internal ERT members for role plays during Evacuation and Fire Drills  at all locations. Interactive briefing and debriefing session after the event with the  Government agencies and their representatives leading to role-clarity for  all the agencies backed by greater self-assurance and confidence in the process  Intensive awareness drives  – through the hosting of Security Week - are  periodically organized; these are characterized by interactions for the security  staff with Senior Police officers, quizzes, live chats, conduct of mock drills and  role plays  Assistance to employees in critical SOS situations increasing security awareness,    rehearsals and augmentation of ERT volunteers and assistance to Mitr (in house  counseling program) and the all pervasive concern for the differently abled  employees are the cornerstones of inclusive security  Security beyond the campus concept is accepted as part of duty and enhanced  focus on women safety through self defense lessons, provisioning of escort  services, toll free helpline numbers are part of the drive to ensure a safe and  secure work place and beyond ETHICAL  SUPPLY CHAIN 140  EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES Suhel Quader is an ecologist at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore.  His research group asks questions about why animals behave as they do, how  populations change as their environment changes, and how the interactions between  species is influenced by their surroundings. Suhel has a particular interest in participatory  science; that is, in encouraging volunteers from all walks of life to contribute to a better  understanding of the natural world. He runs two such Citizen Science efforts:  MigrantWatch (www.migrantwatch.in) and SeasonWatch (www.seasonwatch.in), the latter  in collaboration with Wirpo Applying Thought in Schools. Suhel's MSc in Wildlife Science  (from the Wildlife Institute of India) was followed by a PhD from the University of Florida  and post-doctoral research at the University of Cambridge. In the end, it's about joy and about sorrow.  About wonder at what is, and regret at  what could have been, and hope for what could be. Let me explain Imagine a world with pterosaurs. They soar majestically in the open skies, some with  leather wings spanning the length of a bus, others compact enough to fit into a small  backpack. They wheel and circle in our cities, fighting the kites for roadkill. They skim  the ocean's surface, banking sharply at the sight of a shoal of fish. They hiss at us when  we come too close, and flash their patterned head-crests in annoyance. They perch on  top of our apartments and trees, hunched and brooding and glaring at all who pass  below.  WHAT THE NATURAL WORLD  MEANS TO US Suhel Quader Sadly, pterosaurs aren't with us today, and all we know about them comes from fossils  wrested out of their graves. But how splendid it would be to be able to marvel at one  of these creatures in the flesh! How wonderful to gaze upon a living dinosaur! The  absence of live pterodactyls is, of course, not due to human agency, but their absence  still impoverishes us – the mystery of these wondrous flying reptiles reaches out to us  across a chasm of a hundred million years.  Now imagine a world with moas. The biggest of these great birds of New Zealand  were twice the height of a man and weighed as much as a tiger. Their only predator was  a huge eagle, largest of all known birds of prey, and as close to a tiger-hunting raptor as  the world will ever see. Both moa and eagle were driven extinct 700 years ago, the  moas hunted by settling Maori tribes and the eagle by consequent starvation.  Humans drove moa and eagle extinct; how much worse that it happened like this, than  with the pterosaurs, for whom our fateful intervention was not to blame. But why is it  worse? The unmeasurable preciousness of culture Let me draw a parallel with human culture and artefacts. How much is the Taj Mahal  worth? What would a developer need to pay to compensate us and future generations  for razing it to build a new highway? What is the dollar value of the Great Sphinx of  Giza, or one of the world's fast disappearing languages, or of the Mona Lisa? I don't  mean the dollar value of possession, but rather the value of their very existence.  These human creations are priceless; which does not mean that we should spend the  Earth to preserve them, but rather that humanity would be diminished if they were to  disappear or be destroyed. Literature, custom, art, artefact – these speak to us about  our human-ness, as cultural animals divided by language, religion and tribe, yet still  bound by our common roots as bipedal apes; and by our common future as stewards  of our shared planet. The destruction of these human creations shrinks that space  which we occupy in the universe. Not the physical space, but in that of our imagination  – of who we are, and what we could be. Consider a world without our rich cultural  inheritance. Delete, one by one, Ajanta, the Acropolis, the Coliseum, the Dancing Girl  of Mohenjo-daro; and closer in time, Konark, the Red Fort, the Eiffel Tower, the Statue  141 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES  142 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES of Liberty. Life would not change materially – we would still be pursuing our human  dreams and our human desires through our human material means. But our world  would be less rich, our perspective less broad, our understanding of ourselves and our  history less nuanced. How too could we explain to future generations why a road  replaced the Coliseum, a power plant the Acropolis, a factory the Red Fort? Our  sadness at their loss prompts us to ponder our joy in their existence. The natural world  So also do we derive joy from the natural world. Plants, animals, creatures of all types  are meaningful to us in many ways. The outward beauty of their form delights us. We  frame their meaning in metaphor.  Their life and their death inspires poetry and  literature. Deeper still, we know they are shaped by natural selection; a force  exquisitely simple yet incomparably powerful in generating new forms. Every creature  we see is the product of millions of generations of evolutionary tinkering; changing  now this way, and as the environment alters, now that. And, of course, these creatures  have not arisen, and do not exist, in isolation. Instead, every organism is linked to  uncountable others through invisible chains of material need into a great machine of  interlinked flows of matter and energy. In this network of life, even the meanest,  most unremarkable creature has a place  – by which I do not mean that it is necessarily  important, but rather that it fits. So the beauty of nature lies not only in individual  creatures, but also in its connections: in the processes that sustain the intricacies of  ecosystems, with their uncountable interactions. You could say, well, this is not so special: we can create new species and we can make  artificial ecosystems. And, of course, we can. But we cannot create history.  Each species has a history stretching back to the beginning of life on Earth. Imagine  the evolutionary tree as a river system moving back through time, human trickle  meeting the rivulet of the other apes, then merging with the monkeys to form the  primate creek, which eventually joins that of all the other mammals. And the swift  stream of mammals reaches that of the reptiles, and then the amphibians, then the  fishes. And at each confluence the diversity, the number of species, increases greatly,  far outnumbering the creatures that are alive today. And the vertebrate river lumbers  backward in time to meet the massive tributary of arthropods, swelled by countless  millions of insects; and so on, branches joining as we go further and further back in  time, with most of the river's length consisting of single-celled animals and plants.  Until finally, 3.8 billion years away, the river ends at the beginning of life; a beginning  that we barely understand, but where we know something unique and precious has  taken place. And every drop of water in every little creek and rivulet bears an imprint  of what has gone before – of what is downstream in our imaginary backwards  river of evolution. Every creature is related to every other, through a deep and  wonderful ancestry. In the same way, each ecosystem has a past and history, of how environments changed  and species colonised and disappeared, to leave the plants and animals we see today.  When the Indian plate collided with Asia, the bottom of the Tethys Sea was pushed  upwards, rock shearing and buckling in unhurried convulsions. Muddy ocean-bottom  was replaced by seagrass beds, then by grasslands, then tropical forests. And as the  millennia ground on, and the land rose high and higher into the rarefied sky,  broadleaved trees were replaced by conifers, which in turn yielded to stunted bushes  and finally to the hardy herbs and grasses of the high Himalayas, that live and die in  temperatures that would kill an unclothed man in minutes. Here, now, snow leopards  stalk mountain sheep; and vultures shatter bones to eat their marrow, heirs of the long  and dramatic history that has shaped their habitat and themselves. So the rock and soil and plants and animals of any acre on the Earth are precious and  unique. Again, this does not mean that every individual beetle, every species of lichen,  every network of beings must be protected in some kind of Platonic museum of Ideals  forevermore. No, the world is, and has ever been, a changing place, and enforced stasis  is not our Ideal. Rather, I mean that if we choose to kill an individual or destroy a  species or bulldoze an ecosystem, we must do it with our eyes open to the magnitude  of our loss rather than in ignorance and indifference. Changing attitudes, changing values If nature is a commodity, then our relationship with nature is subject to the  coldblooded rules of pure economics. Instead, I argue that totalling the material  benefits that nature provides us with an incomplete valuation.  Nature is part of our  human being. We are all the poorer for not recognising and celebrating this.  143 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES As sapient masters of our home planet, how can we promote this view? How can we  convey the sense of beauty and preciousness in each living thing, surrounded as we are  by the concrete and electronica of modernity? How can we be better curators of our  rich past and better stewards of our shared future?  I think the place to start is to be  open and honest about what we hold good and true about nature. To express our  sense of awe and wonder at our ancient planet and its creations, and our gratitude to  be alive to see and smell and touch the world around us. This sense is not, I think, difficult to convey to young children. But as they get older, and  more and more caught up in the technological and social minutiae of life, I suspect that  the battle becomes harder and harder, until finally we are so occupied by the here and  now that we rarely step back to marvel at the larger world around us. But step back  we should and marvel we must. In doing so, though, there is a trap to avoid – which is to be fixated on what is cute or  cuddly or ferocious or clever. In the 1980s, two Australian species frogs went extinct.  These were unremarkable except for one thing: the eggs developed in their mother's  stomach. Female frogs swallowed their fertilised eggs, switching off acid production in  their stomachs. When the tadpoles emerged, the mother would regurgitate her babies  out into water, where they would swim and develop into adults themselves. How  bizarre, how wonderful, and yes, how beautiful! But these species were alone among  frogs in the habit, and so this unique behaviour is now lost forever to us, one of the  uncounted victims of our accelerated world. It's about joy, and about sorrow. About what is, what could have been and what can  still be.  EDUCATION &  COMMUNITY  CARE Education and Community Care Wipro Applying Thought in Schools Mission10X  -  Transforming  Engineering Education in India Wipro Cares - Community Care Where it Matters 5g  EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY CARE Readers who have been following our previous sustainability reports would know  that it is in Education and Community Care that we started our Corporate  Sustainability program a decade back in 2001. The reasons for this deliberate set of   choices then have the same compelling validity today.   Education is the only catalyst of social development that can bring about change  which is truly sustainable and durable over the long term;  and  It is a fundamental responsibility of every business to engage deeply with its  proximate communities and try to address some of their biggest challenges The following visual is a condensed summary of the primary areas that these three  programs address and the current profile of each of these initiatives. While the  sections that follow provide the salient highlights of our programs in Education  (Wipro Applying Thought In Schools and  ) and Community Care (Wipro Cares) for the year 2010-11, they really represent outcome of a decade long  journey of iterations and changes that these programs have undergone. Further, we  are acutely cognizant of the reality that we are still in a fairly early stage in these  initiatives and that there will be many more changes in the years to come. Most of our operations are located in urban centers in India and overseas in  commercial or industrial clusters. We work with the civic authorities, resident  associations and NGOs in understanding and addressing core issues arising from our  operations. These could be specific resource issues – e.g. the Responsible water use  study at two of our campuses, Page 103, local public transport facilitation, pages  170 – 174 of our earlier 2009-10 report or lake restoration or sanitation projects  near our campuses. However, from our experience in urban community programs, the  primacy challenge is not one of resources and capabilities and therefore our primary  focus is around advocacy and addressing deeper, more systematic issues e.g. in our  school education system or in our engineering education – which are addressed by  WATIS and Mission10X respectively. Wipro Cares, our community care program, is  focused on health and education programs for local communities around our  factories in the consumer care and infrastructure engineering businesses – these are  predominantly located in non-urban centers. In cities, Wipro Cares focuses on the  education needs of children who are disadvantaged in some sense e.g. children with  hearing disability, children of migrant laborers etc. Mission10X EDUCATION &  COMMUNITY CARE 146 Education VISUAL SUMMARY OF WIPRO'S PROGRAMS IN  EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY CARE Community Care Addresses Long-term  disaster  rehabilitation  & issues  of health,  education and  environment Addresses Issues of deep  systemic reform in  India's education  ecosystem Works with  proximate  communities  through partners Comprises Wipro Cares,  a not-for-profit  trust Comprises Mission10X,  a not-for-profit  trust Works with 700+  engineering  colleges across  20 states, reaching  10,000 faculty Comprises Wipro Applying  Thought in Schools  (WATIS) Through a  network of 30  partners, reaches  2000+ schools  across the  country  School Education:  Where it all starts The primary driver behind our decision to work on improvement of school education  was that it was one of the most important social issues in India and also because it has  the largest multiplier effect on social change. We realized that while our schools reflect notions of good education that are held  widely in society, quite a few issues plague the education system - the perceived  objectives of education, the methodology employed in classrooms, the organization  and culture in schools and the social and individual outcomes it produces. This makes  the need for a critical engagement with this idea important and this has to be at  multiple levels: with schools, educators, parents and larger society.  To impact/influence education at a systemic or societal level, it is imperative that we  engage with it in a sustained manner and timeframe and continuously learn and revisit  our strategy based on work on the ground. We believe this is a more effective way of  contributing to Indian education than working directly with a few schools.  This was the thought that led to the initiation of the Wipro Applying Thought in  Schools program in 2002.  The primary stakeholders and the most material issues that arise on  this theme Wipro Applying Thought in Schools is driven by a vision of an equitable and just  society and we see our work in education as a way to contribute to the building of  such a society. Therefore, in a way, the primary stakeholder is the larger society. Within  the education space, however, our stakeholders have been the teachers, students,  leadership and management team, parents and most importantly for us, the network  of social organizations that directly work with schools. So far, we have worked with around 2000 schools and 10,500 educators, reaching out  to approximately 8,00,000 children.  More importantly we have worked on projects with 30 organizations so far and the  projects helped them develop specific capabilities and hence capacity to work in  education reform. We are currently actively working with around 21 organizations  while we are part of a network of 26 social organizations. THE JOURNEY SO FAR EDUCATION &  COMMUNITY CARE 147 WIPRO APPLYING THOUGHT IN SCHOOLS  Holistic School  Engagements What we did - HSE projects were long-term  projects that engaged with all stakeholders in  one or a few schools and included curricular,  assessment and administrative issues in a  school. The approach towards these projects  was consultative and dialogic and the specific  issues dealt with were determined by the  context of the school.  What we learnt - Schools respond  positively to cultural or procedural changes  when a third party intervention happens.  Need for specific inputs and usable material is  critical. Given the largeness of our country,  there is a need for more organizations to  engage deeply in educational issues.  Teacher Empowerment  Programs What we did - 2 year long  intense Teacher training program  for schools in partnership with  qualified partner organizations.  What we learnt - While  teachers benefited immensely we  realized that a teacher functions  as part of the school system which  in turn enables or restricts her  from working in a certain manner.  So looking at the education  problem only as a teacher and the  teaching-learning problem is  limited and not enough.  Organizational Capability Development What we did - Work with more organizations on  projects that help them develop specific capabilities.  We also helped build new organizations and support  them in developing capacity and stature in education  reform space.  What we learnt - Issues related to subject matter  and curricular pressures limit a school and a project's  ability and inclination to make fundamental changes in  the way the school functions.  There is a need to keep  specific subject areas central to a project and develop  a deeper understanding and share this with schools.  So that, it is in sync with the school's objectives.   Some educational issues demand a larger visibility and  engagement at societal level - this beings the need  for a few large scale, high visibility projects.  In the coming years... Focus on Themes & Outcomes: We  believe we are on the right track in having the  primary objective as building capabilities in  social organizations across the country.  While this objective will remain, additionally  significant part of our work will focus on  specific thematic areas and have tangible  outcomes from each project - outcomes that  can be disseminated  to a large audience. Themes: Ecology & Education, Social  Sciences, Maths.  Science, Values, attitudes and  School environment.  - Outcomes: Organizational  Development, Material and Literature for  children and Educators, Public Advocacy  Goals For 2010-11:  from our experience and evolving. After a decade of evolution through Teacher  Empowerment Program (TEP), Organization capacity building and Holistic School  Engagement (HSE), in 2010-11 it was time to look back at our learning and refine what  we do.  An exercise to articulate a refined strategy was to be conducted this year.  Also in the current strategic phase as described above, work in themes like ecology &  education and public advocacy needed to be brought into focus in a big way.  With this in mind last year we decided to work on two large projects –  SeasonWatch and Quality Education Study. While doing this we also wanted to  continue to remain committed to our core ideas of organizational capability  development based on direct work in schools. This formed the three-fold  goals  of  2010-11. As an organization, we have been continuously learning  Continue other existing projects  and partnerships New Projects 'Season Watch', a citizen science program taken to schools across the country  to deepen children's engagement with ecology, in partnership with National  Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) Quality Education Study (QES), to study popular schools in India's metros  on student learning outcomes, but also student attitudes and values, co-scholastic  learning and organizational aspects and learning environment. Conducted in  partnership with Educational Initiatives (EI) Refine our strategy based on 10 years of experience EDUCATION &  COMMUNITY CARE 148 Summary of Progress Highlights for 2010-11 Refining our strategy In 2010-11 we reflected on the past experience and articulated our concerns in  school education and also the refined strategy. Over the years of our work in this space, we have become exposed to many issues  within school education reform and have documented them in detail as Our  concerns on school education (available at www.wiproeducation.com. Click  Our concerns in School Education under Position papers on the right panel.) Out of the many concerns within school education, we have chosen to engage with a  few which we feel are important and where we can make the maximum difference.  These are listed below:   Most issues with schools require an external organization to intervene and help.  For a country of India's size there are not that many organizations that are  committed and have the capacity to work on the cause of improvement of quality  of education  We feel that there is a paucity of good material on education and in children's  literature  We perceive a need to broaden public discourse on schools and quality education  based on ideas stemming from deep educational thinking. We work towards  raising matters like the following from our direct work in schools and also through  studies and public advocacy: - School education is still focused on rote memorization and textbook based  learning focussed on examinations and marks - Different areas of knowledge are not dealt with sufficient depth of  understanding. Knowledge is compartmentalised into subjects and the process  of connecting with the experiences of the student is not aided well - Student is not conceived of as an active participant in the process of  knowledge creation - Schools are not inclusive places that help different kinds of children including  those from all socio-economic backgrounds learn well  Modus Operandi: How did we do it We have been engaged with these issues for a decade now. While the specific  program objectives have continuously evolved, we have stayed constant with a  certain mode of working. This can be articulated as specific characteristics we firmly  believe in:  Working on experimental projects in one or a few schools to understand  educational issues better from a school's perspective  The projects are always in partnership with social organizations committed to  education reform. They have the capabilities to engage with schools and have the  staying power  Each project should have an objective of learning something – for the school, the  partner organization and larger society  We learn from the project and advocate some causes towards shaping public  thinking about schools and education In the process we build and nurture a community of partner organizations working  across India in diverse contexts and in different areas within education. Our Strategy Our Social Vision: A democratic society which values equality, diversity,  justice and social sensitivity, where each citizen is capable of realizing his/her  best  individually  and  collectively. Our Mission: Work with social organizations to increase their capacity in engaging  with school education to realize the vision.

The analogy of this idea is learning with  understanding, which is sustainable versus cramming for an exam, which is  unsustainable. What is needed for achieving quality education is a stated vision of  quality education, clearly defined processes and low-stakes assessment and  monitoring system. Vision of Quality Education Multiple visions of quality education are possible – e.g., one vision could be emphasis  on holistic education involving sports, character building, understanding, sensitivity,  nation-building, etc.  Some of the key ingredients of the vision setting exercise are: - what is chosen or emphasized in the vision should be clearly stated and actions of  a week / month must be relatable to it - attempt must be to paint a picture of what quality education will look like - in  society, in the class room, in the staff room, in relations with parents, in relations  with teachers, etc - diversity in student population, demographic, cultural, ability-based, is critical to  represent real life and build sensitivity Clearly defined processes Certain things must be defined and monitored so they are done regularly - e.g. process for  visits by teachers to other schools, parent interaction etc. Teacher capacity building should  arguably be the most important process in the school. In many cases, internal ratings can be  made for a process – for instance, teachers could observe each others lessons and rate them.  Best ideas from areas like ICT and HR should be consciously included. Low-stakes assessment and monitoring Low-stakes assessments ensure that the feedback from the exercise is accurate (essential  for taking corrective actions) and does not create stress in the system. Attempts should  be made that these test not only help the student with cognitive learning but also other  aspects like values and creativity. - efforts should be undertaken to make this a shared vision - it is not about what we want  but as much about discovering what we are and truly believe in  Updates on other Projects Holistic School Interventions have the charter of working closely with a few schools, understanding school level issues and developing prototypal solutions.

Going Forward -  Future Plans With the refined strategy in place, the broad framework of our work now has a much  more clear anchorage. New projects and partnerships are firming up. From this year  onwards we are going after these outcomes – organizational capability development,  educational material & publications and public advocacy. In the next year, we intend to make more progress in the various themes we have  identified in the refined strategy. In ecology and education, we are already working  through the SeasonWatch project. The plan is to widen the reach and participation in  this project and also to forge new partnerships and projects in this theme. Recognizing the critical role of Social Sciences in building a better society, we intend to  start working in Social Sciences. The partners' forum of 2010 on History and  Education has given us more impetus to work in this area. In the next year, we plan to  explore ideas and experiments with our existing partners as well as forge new  partnerships in this theme. In the area of Mathematics education, we have researchers and educators in our  partner network who have been working in this area for years. We intend to deepen  our understanding of Mathematics education through study and discussions with our  partners. We are aiming at identifying focus areas and opportunities for work in Math  education. The QES study phase has been completed and findings and report will become  available next year. These will be shared with our partner network in the next year's  partner forum. With data on wide range of aspects of schools and student learning  available, there is an opportunity to build a large advocacy effort. We plan to do a  nationwide campaign to expand the notion of quality in education. Apart from these, there are many projects which are in various stages. For those  beginning and winding up, we intend to engage closely to give it shape or to study the  impact and garner the learning. For those continuing, we intend to continue engaging  through visits and periodic reviews and other engagements. EDUCATION &  COMMUNITY CARE 154 THE VOICE OF ONE OF OUR  KEY PARTNERS  Diversity and space for social organizations in education -  Rohit Dhankar, Digantar In India, the discourse around what is good education has gained significant  popular attention in the past decade. And this is triggering many different  ideas, ideologies and visions, often leading people, systems and policy in  different directions. In education, sharing and critiquing ideas and  practices in a spirit of understanding is very important. The Wipro  Applying Thought In Schools initiative has been facilitating that from the  beginning through its Partners' Forum and encouraging partners to work  with each other in various ways. I can see an all round churning of ideas and  learning happening in this way.  Another important contribution of Wipro in current scenario of  supporting educational ideas and action is even more important. In  partnering with Wipro, there is still space for the actors on the ground to  develop their own agendas and convince  Wipro of the worthwhileness of  these to get financial support.  This is especially important for two reasons. One – education needs  continuous seeding and nurturing of ideas to remain robust in theory and  practice. Shutting down the generation and nurturing of ideas is a sure way  to emaciate education. The second is that in the present climate the space  for developing their own agendas by actors in education (NGOs) is closing.  This significantly decreases the space for the blooming of new ideas and  diverse thought processes.  Wipro seems to still retain faith in the 'other' by allowing their partners to  pursue their own agendas and allowing diversity in ideologies and methods.  MISSION10X  TRANSFORMING  ENGINEERING EDUCATION IN INDIA The journey so far On Teachers Day, 5th September 2007, Mission10X embarked on a journey to  transform engineering education in India. The key challenge to be addressed was the  dismally low employability skills of engineering graduates in the country. Mission10X  sought to create a quantum improvement in the situation by bringing about systemic  change in the existing teaching-learning paradigms in engineering education.  As of March 2011, Mission10X has reached out to over 13,000 faculty members from  more than 900 engineering colleges in India, covering 24 states and Union Territories.  Based on the inspiration from Mission10X, many noteworthy innovations are now  practiced by the faculty members in their classrooms. Community of Mission10Xians  has created over 5,700 innovative assets across various Engineering disciplines, which  are hosted in our community portal www.mission10x.com. Many Universities have  concurred with this innovative methodology and are actively supporting this initiative.  These University bodies along with Mission10X collaborate in conducting faculty  enablement workshops and engagements, undertaking joint research in creation of  educational assets and disseminating new learning. The partnerships have opened new  doors for Mission10X in various States across India by providing a platform to  cultivate a culture of innovative thinking in the faculty members within the States.  Premier educational bodies like Indian Society of Technical Education (ISTE),  an Apex body of All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has partnered with  Mission10X and now jointly certifies the efforts of faculty members attending the  Mission10X workshop and learning Mission10X Learning Approach. Mission10X is  also recognized as Gold member of the International Federation of  Engineering Education Societies (IFEES), Washington DC. Recently NASSCOM [National Association of Software and Service  Companies (India)], IT industry association has partnered with Mission10X to  adapt Mission10X methodology as the backbone of pedagogy across IT industry  members. This understanding intends to enhance employability skills through multi- pronged approach.  Behind the impressive numbers that Mission10X has achieved are the many stories of  individual teachers, heads of institutions and students opening their minds to new  ways of learning. Change is never easy and it is only because all these individuals have  wholeheartedly embraced and championed change that we are seeing the  transformation in engineering education.  EDUCATION &  COMMUNITY CARE 155  The launch of Phase 2 Change needs to be tangible. The impact of an  initiative that seeks to bring about change is best  evaluated in terms of its progress on appropriate  metrics. Having already empowered 10,000 faculty  members across the country in its first three  years, Mission10X has now embarked its Phase 2  on a more rigorous journey to strengthen the  quality of engagement in engineering education by  setting for itself a larger goal to empower 25,000  more Faculty, deploy 2,500 Learning Kits and  develop 250  Academic Leaders by 2013. The launch of Phase 2 has seen more faculty  members across India benefit from the movement  and this is only going to grow from strength to  strength to change the landscape of Engineering  education in India. One of the gaps that Mission10X observed in engineering education is the students  lack of exposure to the latest technology, particularly in their laboratory practices and  the industry expectations. UNIFIED LEARNING KIT as it is aptly coined helps the  learner to possess higher forms of learning using a practice based approach. With  ULKs, students are exposed to the latest technologies, encouraged to do research in  emerging areas and motivated to adopt a multidisciplinary learning approach.  Phase II of Mission10X will ensure that the students are kept abreast with the rapid  advances in technology by facilitating deployment of over 2500 Unified Learning Kits.  EDUCATION &  COMMUNITY CARE 156  ULK helps the learner to possess higher forms of learning using a practice based  approach. These learning kits provide state of the art technologies integrated into  small form factor kits that are handy and could be carried by each learner from early  years to final year. Currently learning kits have been deployed in the 4 partner  institutes and will be moving into open source shortly.  Leadership in the education space influences the quality of learning through  institution building. Successful institution building requires academic leaders to  innovate, inspire and transform institutions by working through constraints, adapting  to the changing global environment and rising to the expectations of all stakeholders. In the last one year, the launch of Phase 2 of Mission10X ACADEMIC  LEADERSHIP PROGRAM has helped Academic Leaders to equip them with  skills to better manage organizational challenges, build high performing teams of  faculty members and develop the next class of high-potential faculty members within  their institutes. There is no formal training process to prepare academic leaders. In the light of  increasing stakeholder's expectations, global challenges and possible opportunities  available to India, academic leaders need to be prepared. This workshop was designed  after a detailed need analysis and identifying a list of required competencies.  Mission10X conceptualized multilevel academic leadership program along with  international partners like Harvard Business School Publishing(HBSP), Development  Dimensions International (DDI) and many others. The first Level 1 workshop was  launched in the month of March 2011 in Hyderabad.  By the end of phase 2 by 2013  more than 250 senior academic leaders from engineering are expected to be part of  this process.  4 years ago Mission10X embarked on a journey of transformation. While much has  been achieved there is much that still needs to be done. Creating institutional change  is never an easy task. Yet, getting significantly better returns from higher education is  absolutely essential if India wishes to reap the fruits of the demographic dividend.  Along with the thousands of Mission10Xians, heads of institutions, partners and  students who are the key focus of this initiative, the mission rededicates itself to  changing the face of engineering education in India. EDUCATION &  COMMUNITY CARE 157  The overarching context Responsibility towards proximate communities, especially those who happen to be  more disadvantaged, must constitute a fundamental commitment of every  responsible corporate entity.  It is with this belief and philosophy that Wipro Cares  was formed in 2003. The charter of Wipro Cares – stemming from the values  of Spirit of Wipro - is thus centered around the following needs of marginalized  communities in the proximity of our operations.   Access to decent education  Access to affordable primary healthcare  Restoration of degraded environments  Long term rehabilitation in disaster struck areas   Wipro Cares is organized as a Trust with funds donated by Wipro employees that are  matched by Wipro. In each location, the Wipro Cares work is driven by a Location  Committee constituted of volunteering Wiproites.   WIPRO CARES: COMMUNITY CARE WHERE IT MATTERS Assess social  impact of the  project and address any gaps Define areas of Engagement Drive project implementation  with appropriate governance mechanism Develop objectives  and outcomes for the project Identify communities & partners at various locations across the country The Wipro Cares approach to meaningful engagement with communities EDUCATION &  COMMUNITY CARE 158 The primary stakeholders and the most material issues that  arise from them The principal stakeholders for Wipro Cares are  Disadvantaged proximate communities  Our NGO partners who engage directly with the community and  Wipro's employee volunteers As stated earlier, the material community issues that we have chosen to address are:  Primary health care, Access to school education, Restoring local  environments  and  Long-term rehabilitation after a disaster. Continued support for the victims of  Tamil Nadu Tsunami, Karnataka & Bihar Floods Social foresty initiative in rural Tamil Nadu that addresses ecological preservation and rural livelihoods Provided to more than 25000 people in 25 villages   around our plants in Waluj, Tumkur & Hindupur Reached out to more than 10500 children in Pune, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata and Hyderabad Disaster  Rehabilitation Restoration of Environment Primary  Healthcare Services Access to Education Summary of progress highlights: During 2010-11 Wipro Cares added support for four new projects, taking the total  number of active community projects to 15. The summary highlights are represented below:  The new projects:  In 2010-11, we built on our nascent initiative started in 2009-10  on Primary Health Care and added two more programs at Tumkur and Hindupur  where we have a Consumer Care factory and a Hydraulics Cylinder factory  respectively. Our first program at Waluj, Project Sanjeevani continues to be a  flagship project and a role model on delivering primary health care to rural villages in  India.   A brief descriptive summary is provided below:  Tumkur Health Care Project (around WCCLG plant at Tumkur)  The health care project in Tumkur covers 11 villages with a population of  over 11000 to ensure comprehensive primary health services delivery and  regular health camps on various diseases. The program also includes  community mobilization and the capacity building of anganwadi workers and  traditional birth attendants  Hindupur Health Care Project  (around WIN Hindupur Plant)   The health care project in Hindupur covers 9 villages with a population of around  12000 to provide comprehensive primary health services and specialized services  through regular health camps. The project also generates awareness around issues  related to health  Sanjeevani  Health Care Project ( around  WCCLG Plant at Waluj) In its second year now, Project Sanjeevani continued to cater to the primary health  care needs of nine villages around Waluj. In 2010-11 the mobile clinic provided  health care services to more than 12,000 patients and the Reproductive Child  Health (RCH) clinic aided more than 1500 expectant mothers on key health issues  pertaining to them  Schooling for Children with Hearing Disability:  Ashrya  Akruti.  Hyderabad  is a centre that caters to the needs of hearing impaired children and provides  them with special education. The project provides for the school staff that is  trained to meet the needs of the hearing disabled children.  The center provided  to the needs of 197 hearing impaired children in 2010-11  Social Forestry in Rural Tamil Nadu:  TIST,  Thiruvallur The project involves sustainable tree plantation and its scientific management  along with generation of livelihoods for farmers. Targeted at  25 subsistence  farmers in Thiruvallur district - around 150 kms from Chennai - the aim of the  EDUCATION &  COMMUNITY CARE 159 project is to create sustainable green cover on degraded lands along with providing  livelihood options to farmers from the tree produce.  The project is managed by  TIST ( The International Small Group & Tree Planting Program)  but the governance  model is really one of collaborative community management of the commons – this  ensures stability, consistency and eventual durability of the trees. With 25,000  saplings on 100 acres of land, this project is a stand-out example of an initiative that  meets both, ecological and social goals in a balanced manner Rural e-Governance: Wipro is part of the consortium-anchored by the Center  for Public Policy, IIM Bangalore – that is working on the design of an effective and  sustainable Common Service Center (CSC) in rural India. The consortium has a  number of public and private sector organizations who have volunteered to join in  true public-private partnership spirit. The introduction of the CSC at the Gram  Panchayat level is in line with the objectives of the National E-Governance Plan. The  CSC is intended to be an effective service delivery mechanism to the citizens of rural  India. Specifically,the purposes of the CSC  are:  Envisioned as the front-end delivery points for Government, Private and Social  sector services to rural citizens of India  Provide high quality and cost-effective video, voice and data content and services, in  the areas of e-governance, agriculture and allied sectors, artisans, education, health,  telemedicine, insurance as well as other private services. A highlight of the CSCs is  that it will offer web-enabled e-governance services in rural areas, including  application forms, certificates, and utility payments such as electricity, telephone  and water bills etc The idea is to develop a platform that can enable Government, private and social  sector organizations to integrate their social and commercial goals for the benefit of  rural populations in the remotest corners of the country through a combination of IT  as well as non-IT services.  Some key applications that are integrated into the CSC are  Mathru Suraksha (Health information for expectant mothers and government health  workers) and NREGA mobile feature.  The consortium was formally launched in October 2009 and as of March 2011 there  were 15 centers functional in Karnataka. Wipro is program managing the planning,  design and implementation work and also providing technical evaluation and  consultancy services.   EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES Quality education, by definition, has to be delivered in a sustainable way since it  depends so fundamentally on human capacity. For example, learning with  understanding, is sustainable while cramming for an exam is unsustainable. It is  widely accepted that while the latter may get marks and possibly a degree, it is the  former that truly helps students to discover and achieve their full potential. I believe there are three main ingredients for achieving sustainable, quality education.  They are collective necessary and sufficient. These three are: 1. a clear and stated vision of quality education 2. clearly defined norms and processes and  3. low-stake assessment and monitoring systems. A Clear and Stated Vision of Quality Education Multiple visions of quality education are possible – for example, emphasis on holistic  education versus emphasis on character building, versus a strong focus on academic  excellence versus an orientation towards nation-building and patriotism, etc. So more important than the specific vision are the way the vision is shared and  implemented. Specifically: - the vision must be clearly articulated and known widely in the school - the actions of a week / month in the school must clearly draw from the larger goals  and vision. The linkage should be clear to the stake-holders QUALITY EDUCATION, GOOD SCHOOLS  AND HOLISTIC SCHOOL ASSESSMENT Sridhar Rajagopalan - continuous efforts should be made to make the vision a shared one and clarify it if  necessary - very often visions reflect a generic desire and such visions can be quite hackneyed  (to be among the top 10 schools in the country). Rather the vision should follow  from a reflection exercise to understand what the leaders truly stand for and  believe in - the vision must try and describe a picture of what the class room, the staff room,  relations between teachers and parents and indeed society would look like were  this vision to be perfectly achieved - and finally, I firmly believe that diversity in student population - demographic,  cultural, ability-based - is critical to represent real life and build sensitivity - and  must be a key part of the vision Clearly Defined Norms and Processes Clearly defined norms and processes are a must both for transparency and  sustainability. It is interesting that in schools many key processes are unmonitored  |and performed by individuals singly. Also many of these processes are performed  regularly – for example, what exactly is done when a teacher is suddenly absent, or  what should be done if a child falls sick, or what is the response if a parent seeks leave  on the first day after vacations. Many processes would relate to teachers' professional  development – for example, the process for visits by teachers to other schools,  teachers observing each others classes etc.  Ideally along with the norms and processes, the rationale or logic behind each of them  should also be documented. Such documentation may contain reasons for and against  a particular decision followed by a final decision. This helps in the process of the vision  and values being understood and shared more widely in the school.  For example, Eklavya School, Ahmedabad, the school co-founded by the author in  1997 publishes processes for various important tasks: Managing Director, Educational Initiatives 160 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES  161 EXPERT  PERSPECTIVES These discussions are invaluable. Individual teachers realise how students in other  parts of the country are learning, and this causes them to reflect and question their  own assumptions.  The reverse also happens, with school heads understanding individual teachers  strengths and weaknesses and cases where teaching aids or resources or training  workshops may need to be provided.  If the assessment studies are conducted by an independent agency that specialises in  educational assessment, the quality of the assessment process and the standardisation  achieved is likely to be higher. Being an external agency, it has no stake in the  performance of particular schools or systems – and hence, external testing is always  considered more credible. To make the student assessments in cognitive areas meaningful, the tests should  include not only procedural or straightforward questions on basic skills but should  also test the student ability in understanding and applying the knowledge.  At the same time, attempts should be made that these test not only the student's  cognitive learning but also other aspects like sports, music, values and creativity  that constitute a holistic school education. Findings from a Quality Education Study  Our organisation, Educational Initiatives, has, jointly with Wipro, recently completed  the first part of a study to look at factors that may be promoting or hindering quality  education with holistic skills including student attitudes and values and school climate  being studied through multiple instruments. While the detailed findings will be  separately discussed and released, two of the findings were that there was a negative  correlation between student performance and Principal and Teacher belief that strict  discipline is important in the school and classroom. A second finding is related to  academic pressure. When students express that they are under a lot of pressure to  perform academically, they also seem to display a higher degree of confidence in their  scholastic abilities, but actually perform lower in the scholastic assessment. Both these findings lend important lessons if our goal is sustainability. Short term  measures and short term goal focus or a narrow academic focus alone does not make  a great education. Only when schools, parents and society as a whole recognise this,  can we hope to provide holistic, quality education to our children. - The Students Continuous Overall Performance Evaluation (SCOPE) process  involves details of a students overall progress being are recorded in a file from the  year student joins the school until she leaves. It is seen as a gateway through which  a class teacher knows a student better as it contains details about home visits  family details including photos, report cards and anecdotes written right from the  childs first year in the school. The process clearly describes how a teacher has to  observe and record brief details of one or two students every day, making it easy  even for a new teacher to follow the process. - Norms specifying what is allowed for lunch and tiffin are clearly defined. The list of  items of foods allowed is also displayed in each classroom. Some items like fried  snacks and fast foods are restricted to a particular day of the week. All these are  also discussed in the first mothers workshop for the year and during home visits –  for which too the process is defined. Low-stakes Assessment and Monitoring Systems Any institution needs to have in place mechanisms to help it continuously improve.  Periodic, low-stake, student assessments conducted by an independent body can play  a critical part of any continuous quality improvement strategy in education.  Low-stakes assessments ensure that the feedback from the exercise is accurate  (essential for taking corrective actions) and does not create stress in the system. It is  important that the test should be low-stakes for students and teachers so that it does  not create pressures and fears among parents, teachers, etc. If that happens, the  original purpose of determining the actual state of learning is likely to get distorted by  special preparation, coaching, cheating, etc. It may appear that the power of a student assessment exercise comes from testing  every school and child and knowing where it stands. However, the real power comes  from bringing into the open the issue of student learning. The exercise of conducting  an assessment and sharing the findings gives a clear message that what students learn  eventually is very important in education. A scientifically designed student assessment  can achieve that. This triggers debates about issues like whether every child can learn well wit  understanding, teacher capacity, facilities in the school or classroom, etc. The actual  levels of learning become visible to the physical and educational community.   SINGAPORE  ADVOCACY  AND  PUBLIC POLICY Wipro and Regulatory Compliance  5h  Wipro Sustainability Reports 2009-10 CDP disclosures  08,09, 10 & 11 Good policies and regulations are like a lighthouse – they direct and guide  without standing in the way. Unfortunately, the short history of social and  environmental regulation over the last few decades has been characterized by a  Business Vs Government position that is ruled by a paradigm of compliance, rather  than collaboration between the two. This paradigm must change to one of  constructive dialog and interaction especially in the arena of sustainability where  enlightened regulation can be a clear differentiator for driving change. We are  beginning to see this happen globally as well as in India. The Indian business sector has  been an active participant in both, policy formulation and in a more general process of  debate and dialog on various challenges of development and sustainability.  Clean  Energy, Climate Change, Energy Efficiency, Water, e-waste, Green Procurement and  Corporate Social Responsibility norms are some of the areas where business and  government have been engaged with each other quite deeply. At Wipro, we have always strongly believed that meeting the challenges of  development  cannot be the governments job alone and that the business sector  must participate along with other stakeholders. Our sustainability advocacy is  constructed on the three pillars of   Direct policy inputs to government  Engagement and dialog as part of industry networks  Publications and Disclosures that advance and further knowledge and action Our areas of focus have been Climate Change, CSR norms, Green Rating of  companies, Green Procurement and e-Waste. The visual below illustrates our actions  in the area of climate change on the praxis of the three pillars mentioned above. Our engagement in sustainability advocacy is summarized in the following pages,  where we articulate the highlights of five of our engagements on multiple areas:  Sustainability rating of companies, CSR norms, Green procurement, Solar Energy  roadmap for India and e-waste regulation. Engagement with Prime Minister's Office on NSM Key Member of CII Climate Change  Council Wipro's Climate  Change Advocacy Influencing through Industry  Networks Direct Policy Inputs Public Disclisures ADVOCACY AND  PUBLIC POLICY 164  Program Key Highlights Program Key Highlights The CII Green Business Center, Hyderabad constituted a task  force to evolve a framework of sustainability ratings. The  framework is designed to assess companies on a 1000 point scale  on multiple dimensions of energy efficiency, renewable energy,  waste, water, lifecycle footprint and product responsibility.  Wipro was a key member of the task force that designed this  framework. The task force, comprising leading companies from  across industry sectors, completed the exercise over a nine  month period from June 2010 to February 2011. The rating  framework has since been introduced on a pilot basis for select  companies during the latter half of 2011. We think that rating frameworks such as these will introduce rigor  into the way ecological goals and outcomes are measured and  further, they will bring in a virtuous cycle of continuous  improvement on key sustainability dimensions. CII-GBC  Greenco Rating or Optional. This is designed to encourage many more companies  to start the practice of publishing their position and progress on  sustainability, even if it is at a basic level.   Wipros position on mandatory CSR spend is that such a move  would eventually prove counter-productive as companies, in the  pressure to comply, will find contrived ways of meeting the norm.   We think that CSR must flow naturally from a companys values  and convictions and will work best when aligned with the  companys overarching mission and goals.  In mid-2010, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) instituted a  study cum engagement with industry around the idea(s) of  evolving a set of guidance norms for Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR) for Indian industry. Among other points, the  notions of a mandated spend on CSR and off mandatory  sustainability disclosures were placed on the table for discussion.  This was followed by the publishing of the National Voluntary  Guidelines (NVGs) by the MCA in collaboration with the Indian  Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) in mid-2011. The CII-ITC Center for Sustainable Development (CESD)  constituted a working group that was tasked with the goals of  coming out with a set of recommendations that would represent  industrys position on the above points. Wipro played an active  part in the working group. Based on the inputs of the working  group, CII has come out with a detailed report that lists two  categories of disclosures – Essential or Mandatory and Leadership  CII-ITC CESD  work group on  CSR norms CII instituted a Green Procurement council  in mid-2010 with the  objectives of framing guidelines for procurement of goods and  services that would be aligned with sustainability parameters – e.g.  Energy Efficiency, Material Intensity, End of Life handling,  Compliance with human rights norms etc. Wipro was a key member of the steering committee of the council  which published detailed draft recommendations in late 2011. The  draft report addressed industry specific parameters as well as a  more universal set of issues e.g. e-waste handling is an issue that is  specific to the electronics industry. We think that a green procurement framework will help establish  a minimum standard for suppliers to meet and will set in motion, a  cycle of healthy competition and continuous improvement of  green products and services. CII Green  Procurement  Council The National Solar Mission (NSM) has set an ambitious goal of 20  GW (Gigawatts) of solar energy for India by 2022. Given that the  aggregate installed capacity of Solar PV (Photovoltaic) is not even  200 MW, the NSM goal looks daunting. A multitude of factors and  forces have a bearing on solar power: relatively high footprint of  land, the requirement of  high solar insolation on the land and  the  relatively high price per unit of solar energy compared to current  grid prices. While the last few years has seen a sharp increase  CSTEP Report  on Solar Energy  options for  India ADVOCACY AND  PUBLIC POLICY 165  Program Key Highlights The acute problem of e-waste has been discussed in brief in our  section 5D on Customer Stewardship. The unorganized sector in  India is ridden with unsafe practices of toxics handling and the  unethical practice of child labor. We hold the position that  producers and manufacturers must bear the major responsibility  for end of life e-waste handling; what this means is that while the  actual processing and disposal can be done by an ecosystem of  certified vendors, the producer has the onus of collecting the end- of-life products and ensuring its safe processing in subsequent  stages. The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) proposed a draft  e-waste legislation to address the above issues. The Manufacturers  Association of Information Technology (MAIT) formed a task  force to engage with the MoEF in evolving the legislation. By virtue  of our early pioneering work in e-waste, we played a central role –  as part of the MAIT committee – in helping draft the e-waste  legislation that is now due to come into effect from May 1st 2012 MAIT e-waste  task force in investment in R&D, solar technology is still nascent and peak  energy efficiency conversion is in the low range of 17-20%.  Given the above context, a comprehensive analysis and study of  solar energy options  for India would be of great value. Our  partner, Center for Study of Science,Technology and Policy  (CSTEP) commissioned such a study in early 2010. The study  assesses technology options in the two major categories of Solar  Photovoltaic and Solar Thermal, the cost structures and options  for designing incentives and subsidies, the options of grid  connected and off-grid models and the governance challenges and  choices that India must consider. Wipro EcoEnergy was an active  participant and contributor to the study which was released in  January 2011 titled Harnessing Solar Energy: Options for  India. A summary of the report, authored by Dr. Shuba  Raghavan of Cstep, is available elsewhere in this report. WIPRO AND  REGULATORY COMPLIANCE As a responsible corporate citizen and driven by our core values of integrity and  ethics, Wipro has an exemplary record of compliance with government  regulations in all the countries that it operates in. The visual below illustrates the  common regulations and directives that Wipro complies with in the financial,  labor and environmental domains across the geographies we operate in.  Taxation (Payment of Excise duties, Sales tax, Customs duties,  Corporate Income Tax)  Mandatory publishing of quarterly and annual results (both U.S.  GAAP and Indian GAAP)   Compliance with SEBI guidelines for companies listed on Indian stock  exchanges and with SEC rules for companies listed on U.S. stock  exchanges  Compliance with requirements of the Sarbannes Oxley Act   Maximum number of working hours per week  Minimum number of days for casual and sick leave  Minimum Wages Act  Shops and Establishments Act  Freedom to form trade unions and employee associations  Laws in EU and American countries that govern data privacy on  employee information   Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) prior to the start of a new  facility  Clearance from state Pollution Control Board (PCB) on measures for  water treatment, diesel storage,  handling and disposal of hazardous  substances etc; This is required prior to the commencement of a new  facility and subsequently on an annual basis Financial  Regulations Labor Regulations Environmental  Regulations ADVOCACY AND  PUBLIC POLICY 166  Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (COBCE) is an important reference  anchor that determines our compliance with key regulations pertaining to labor and  human rights, anti bribery and anti corruption, supplier responsibility and  transparency on government engagements.  In our previous sustainability reports, we have been making a mention of the  peculiar circumstances surrounding the industrial estate of Okhla in Delhi, India  which houses  one of our older BPO operations. This entire industrial estate has  been in breach of the local building regulations, including the office buildings  where operate as tenants. Our status as tenants prevented us from rectifying the  situation and as a result, we have been obliged to pay a fine every year. We moved  out of the premises during 2010-11 to our own facilities in Greater Noida and  therefore, there was no fine that we had to pay on this account. There were no  other instances of  fines paid by us during the reporting year. Code of business conduct with the government As with other business partners, our code of business conduct and ethics governs  our engagement with governments and regulatory authorities. The Code covers  Wipros policy on lobbying and dealing with Government contracts. We do not  as a matter of policy, contribute to political parties in cash or kind in any  geography that we operate in.

The Report has been evaluated against the following criteria:   Companys approach to stakeholder engagement and its materiality  determination process;  Adherence to the principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness as set  out in the AA1000AS (2008); the reliability of the specified sustainability  performance information, as required for a Type 2, moderate level assurance  engagement as per AA1000 (2008),  6b. INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT   Adherence to the additional principles of Completeness and Neutrality as set out  in DNVs Protocol, and the principles and requirements of the GRI G3.1 for an  application level A+ As part of the engagement, DNV has verified the statements and claims made in the  Report and assessed the robustness of the underlying data management system,  information flow and controls. In doing so, we have:   Reviewed the Companys approach to stakeholder engagement and its materiality  determination process;  Verified the sustainability-related statements and claims made in the Report and  assessed the robustness of the data management system, information flow and  controls;  Examined and reviewed documents, data and other information made available by  Wipro Limited;   Visited the Corporate Office at Bangalore, computer factory at Kotdwar, four  Development centers and Business process outsourcing centers located in India  i.e. at Bangalore, Hyderabad, Noida and Kolkata;  Conducted interviews with key representatives including data owners and  decision-makers from different divisions and functions of the company;   Performed sample-based reviews of the mechanisms for implementing the  Companys sustainability related policies, as described in the Report;  Performed limited stakeholder engagement to verify the qualitative statements  made in the report;  Performed sample-based checks of the processes for generating, gathering and  managing the quantitative data and qualitative information included in the Report Opportunities for Improvement The following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities for  improvement reported to the Management of  Wipro Limited and are considered  for drawing our conclusion on the Report; however they are generally consistent with  the Managements objectives:   extend the materiality determination system and continuously monitor and  evaluate the material issues at site level, including human rights and site  compliances as a result of changes in internal and external environments;   strengthen the existing data management system to ensure consistency in  measurement methodology for internal benchmarking, monitoring and reporting  of sustainability performance;  implement a systematic data verification mechanisms to cover all performance  indicators across the IT sites, which will assist in further improving the quality of  quantitative and qualitative data for sustainability reporting;  fully report on key material performance indicators that are partially reported, in  the subsequent reports Conclusions We have evaluated the Reports adherence to the following principles on a scale of  Good, Acceptable and Needs Improvement: Inclusivity:  As a part of its stakeholder engagement process, the company engages  with its identified stakeholders through different modes and at frequent intervals and  the inputs from the stakeholder engagement has been reported with due regard to  materiality.   In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is Good. Materiality: The Company has fairly attempted to bring out the issues of significance  to its IT businesses in this report. In our opinion the material issues have been  appropriately prioritised and responded to in the Report. The Report provides a  balanced representation of material issues related to the companys sustainability  performance. In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is Good. Responsiveness: We consider that the Company has responded adequately to key  stakeholder concerns, through its policies and management systems and the same are  adequately reflected in the Report.  In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is Good. INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE  STATEMENT 170  Reliability:  The majority of data and information verified at corporate office and site  were found to be accurate. Some of the data inaccuracies identified during the  verification process were found to be attributable to transcription, interpretation and  aggregation errors and the errors have been corrected. Hence in accordance  with the AA1000AS (2008) requirements for a Type 2, moderate level assurance  engagement, we conclude that the specified sustainability data and information  presented in the Report is generally reliable and acceptable.  Additional Parameters as per DNVs Protocol Completeness: Some of the GRI G3.1 core indicators have been reported partially  and the rationale behind partial reporting and exclusions are explained within the  Report along with the time frame for complete reporting.  In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is Acceptable.
