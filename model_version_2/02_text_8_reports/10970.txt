This is why we have translated our values into seven position state- ments we call ICAs Good Business. These position statements describe how we  work, and everyone who works with ICA is expected to know and follow the guide- lines. ICAs Good Business also encompasses the ten principles of the UN Global  Compact, which ICA has signed. ICA also supports the Global Compacts Caring for  Climate initiative. For us, the equation is simple. If we do not take responsibility today, we will only  hurt ourselves as a business tomorrow. Minimizing our environmental impact, pri- marily by reducing energy consumption in stores, has therefore been a high priority  for many years. An exciting example of how far we have come is ICA Kvantum San- negrden in Gothenburg, the first store we have built entirely based on our guide- lines on maximizing energy efficiency while not sacrificing customer experience. It is  a store of the future that will serve as a model for all new stores.    Read the Presidents statement in its entirety on page 2-5 in the ICA Groups Annual Report.    If we do not take  responsibility today,  we will only hurt our- selves as a business  tomorrow. Kenneth Bengtsson This is the iCa Group The iCa Group is one of northern eu- 	 ropes leading retail companies, with  around 2,200 of its own and retailer- owned stores in sweden, norway, es- tonia, latvia and lithuania. iCa also has  offices in these countries and sourcing  operations in China and Vietnam.        The Group includes iCa sweden, iCa  norway, rimi Baltic, iCa real estate and  iCa Bank, which offers financial services  to swedish customers.  iCa aBs head office is located in solna,  	 sweden. iCa aB is a joint venture 40 per- cent owned by hakon invest aB of swe- den and 60 percent by royal ahold n.V.  of the netherlands.  The iCa Group offers a wide range of  	 products in its stores, including other  suppliers brand-name products as well  as its own private labels. The first iCa pri- vate label was launched in 1922.  Today the following product lines are an  important part of our Cr work: iCa Gott liv, our line of healthy alterna- 	 tives  iCa i love eco, our organic product line 	 iCa skona, our green product line for  	 cleaning products.

This is the  very foundation of iCas business. With the help of strong shared  values and an attitude that every link in the chain is important, from  supplier to employee and customer, we have integrated Cr work in  every area of the Groups operations. iCa is a sustainable company  with a solid financial footing, a commitment to the environment and  strong social engagement.  The ICA Groups CR strategy is focused on creating a more sustainable value chain,  from primary production to customer, and guiding us in integrating the issues of cli- mate change, food safety, quality in stores and corporate responsibility into day-to- day operations. We are continuously working to improve our CR work and to in- crease transparency through an active dialogue externally and internally. The CR  strategy is based on our materiality analysis which is defined annually to identify  current areas and issues that are of importance to our economic, environmental  and social performance. ICAs most important Group goals are shown below. They are complemented by  more customer-oriented targets for each company to strengthen their local presence. ICAs CR work is coordinated with our two owners, Royal Ahold and Hakon Invest.  Ahold and ICA support similar philosophies in this work, report using the same  guidelines and generally share the same approach to how this work is performed.  Hakon Invest supports and actively monitors ICAs sustainable development work,  and encourages its portfolio companies to share their knowledge. iCas most important goals Economic  increase sales faster than the total mar- 	 ket in each sector. reach an operating margin of 3.5–4 per- 	 cent. reach a return on equity of at least 14–16  	 percent over a business cycle. Maintain an equity/assets ratio at 30–35  	 percent in the long term. Environment reduce the Groups direct greenhouse  	 gas emissions by 20 percent by 2012  compared to 2006. reduce the Groups direct greenhouse  	 gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020  compared to 2006. Social 100 percent of iCas corporate brand  	 suppliers in high-risk countries will be   socially audited by 2011. 80 percent of suppliers of iCas corpo- 	 rate food brands will be GFsi certified  by 2010.     Read more about the outcome 2010 in our Annual Report, page 10–11.  5 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures ICAs Good Business – the fundamental   values in everything we do ICAs Good Business is the seven position statements that serve as the foundation  for ICAs CR work and are based on the UN Global Compacts ten principles on hu- man rights, labor standards, the environment and anti-corruption. Each position is  backed by ICAs policies and guidelines we use on a daily basis. The foundation of iCas corporate responsibility work ICAs CR policies, with  guidelines for daily  operations Business ethics policy   	 (incl. competition law compliance). new store policy. 	 health policy. 	 information policy   	 (incl. guidelines for financial   information). Customer policy. 	 personnel policy. 	 Quality, environmental and  	 social compliance policy. sponsorship policy. 	 iCa is a participant in the united nations  Global Compact and supports the follow- ing ten international principles. Businesses should: 1.   support and respect the protection of  internationally proclaimed human rights. 2.   Make sure that they are not complicit in  human rights abuses. 3.   uphold the freedom of association and  the effective recognition of the right to  collective bargaining. 4.   eliminate all forms of forced and com- pulsory labor. 5.   effectively abolish child labor. 6.   eliminate discrimination in respect of  employment and occupation. 7.   support a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges. 8.   undertake initiatives to promote great- er environmental responsibility. 9.   encourage the development and diffu- sion of environmentally friendly tech- nologies. 10.  Work against corruption in all its forms,  including extortion and bribery. The ten principles  of the UN Global  Compact. ICAs Good Business iCas Good Business describes  the Groups stance on corpo- rate responsibility. Together  with iCas core values, they  are essential to achieve the  Groups vision and mission.  ICA will: Be driven by profitability and  	 high ethical standards. listen to customers and al- 	 ways base decisions on their  needs. nurture diversity and growth   	 among its employees. Maintain an open dialogue  	 internally and with the com- munity. ensure quality and safe  	 products. promote a healthy lifestyle. 	 adopt sound environment  	 practices to promote sus- tainable development.  6 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures ICAs Good Business philosophy and policies are shared by the entire Group. Al- though this work rests on the same foundation, there are local variations in the mar- kets where the ICA Group is active that affect conditions on a practical level. There  are several reasons for these local variations: Different markets: 	  ICA Sweden is the leader in a mature market. In Norway, on  the other hand, ICA Norway is in an upstart working hard to turn around a nega- tive long-term trend. In Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Rimi Baltic operates in a po- tentially expansive, but uncertain market. Differences in customer behavior:  	 Customer preferences tend to vary. In the Bal- tic countries, which has been hard hit by the financial crisis and recession, food  prices are a critical issue. In Sweden, the recession and financial crisis have not af- fected spending patterns as much, and consumers have the freedom to buy less  price-focused alternatives such as organic and Fairtrade products. Norwegian cus- tomers have felt the recession to an even lesser extent. They remain interested in  healthy meal solutions. Different opinions:  	 Different topics garner different responses depending on local  opinions in the country. In Sweden, food shrinkage, additives and greenhouse gas  emissions are major concerns. Norwegians feel strongly about healthy living and  nutrition. Interest in not throwing food away unnecessarily has also grown in Nor- way. Due to the financial crisis, the Baltic countries have been forced to focus on  economic issues, although the public is also concerned about GMOs and littering. Similarities:  	 The common denominator is an interest in local foods. Country-of- origin labeling has grown in popularity in all our countries. Sweden has the Swed- ish Seal of Quality, and in Norway a new industry trademark, Nyt Norge (En- joy Norway) has had a major impact. Latvia uses the same type of labels, Green  Spoon and Grown in Latvia with Pride. How ICA manages its CR work The overall strategic direction of ICAs CR work is set at the Group level and is man- aged through strategic planning and business planning processes. Overarching re- sponsibility for CR issues rests with ICAs CEO.   The Business Ethics and Policy Committee of Group Management, which has been  in place since 2005, is responsible for monitoring CR goals and strategies, ICAs Good  Business and related Group-wide policies. It also proposes CR priorities and monitors  ethical dilemmas, risks and public opinion about the ICA Group. The cross-organiza- tional team is led by the head of the Corporate Responsibility department.  The line organization can direct questions to each policy owner, who informs and  involves the Business Ethics and Policy Committee when needed. Every employee  is responsible for complying with ICAs Good Business, and everyone is encouraged  to report irregularities based on ICAs Good Business and related policies. If they are  noticed early enough, we have a better chance of preventing risks and taking action.  This benefits not only us but also our employees and other stakeholders.  A whistleblower possibility is included in ICAs business ethics policy, to ensure that  any employee or manager who becomes aware of an irregularity and does not want  to report it through the normal chain of command can do so anonymously.  Read more in the ICA Groups Annual Report, page 40–41.   7 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures Risks and opportunities with our CR work  ICAs CR work entails both risks and opportunities. We must constantly adapt to de- mands for greater transparency, regulatory changes and increasing requirements  placed on sustainability in every level of the supply chain. Unless we can satisfactorily  meet the markets expectations and our own goals, there is a risk that the brand and  ICAs position in the market will suffer. There is also a risk that cost efficiencies will be  affected unless satisfactory measures are taken to conserve energy and reduce waste,  among other things.  On the other hand, our market position could improve if ICA can meet customer de- mand for environmentally friendly and healthy products better than the competition.  We can also be more cost-effective by reducing consumption of energy and materials  in our operations. Generally, we are best able to address sustainable development issues through our lo- cal presence in each market and by educating and informing customers. The model below shows ICAs degree of influence and ability to affect every part of the  value chain.

Maintaining a  continuous dialogue with these groups is also an important part of  ICAs CR work. Among the most important dialogue partners are: Global Compact:  	 The UN initiative to promote corporate citizenship international- ly. ICA has signed the Global Compacts Caring for Climate action platform and is  a member of a Swedish government initiative overseen by the Ministry for Foreign  Affairs to encourage Swedish companies to be ambassadors for human rights, fair  labor practices, a better environment and anti-corruption practices, in accordance  with the principles of the Global Compact. Global Social Compliance Program (GSCP): 	  International alliance seeking to build a  consensus on best practices for labor standards in consumer goods supply chains.  The program is run by the Consumer Goods Forum (formerly CIES), which is a  principal partner of ICA. Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI):  	 Alliance between a number of the worlds  leading experts on food safety from retailers, manufacturers, food service com- panies and service suppliers in the food industry. Coordinated by the Consumer  Goods Forum. Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI):  	 ICA is a member of the Norwegian Ethical Trading  Initiative (ETI) since 2001 which is a forum for ethical trade and other challenges in  global supply chains. Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI):  	 European platform for companies to  improve work conditions at consumer goods suppliers in high-risk countries. ICA  participates together with one of its owners Ahold, which is a member. World Wide Fund of nature (WWF): 	  ICA has worked with the environmental orga- nization WWF on the issues of sustainable fishing, palm oil and free range meats. World Childhood Foundation, Red Cross, the Scoutmovement, the Glada Huddik  	 Theatre, The H.M. King Carl XVI Gustafs Foundation for Young Leadership and  the Swedish Cancer Society/Pink Ribbon: ICA Sweden has longstanding coopera- tions with these organizations. Swedish Society for Coeliacs and Swedish Asthma and Allergy Association: 	  Annu- al campaigns at the Swedish ICA Maxi and ICA Kvantum-stores offering the local  organisations a platform to highlight the allergy handicap. At the same time the  consumers get hands-on assistance in food allergy issues in the stores.  9 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures Swedish National Institute of Public Health: 	  ICA is cooperating on a project called  A healthier Sweden to draw attention to the importance of a proper diet and ex- ercise. Federation of Swedish Farmers (LRF):  	 ICA Sweden and LRF have cooperated for  years and are now working together on various projects. The goal is to meet the  increased demand for foods made from Swedish commodities. Dialogue with ICAs stakeholders ICA has identified its stakeholders from the materiality analysis and the relevant CR  issues. The most important stakeholder groups are customers, employees, owners,  independent ICA retailers in Sweden, franchisees in Norway, suppliers, government  authorities and a number of NGOs. These groups have different expectations and  place different demands on the Groups CR work. Maintaining a continuous dialogue  is also an important part of ICAs CR work.  By cooperating with consumer and environmental organizations, trade organiza- tions, sports clubs and other interest groups, ICA has the opportunity to compare  and improve the way it works. The aim is to use different methods to structure the  dialogue. Key interest stakeholders include: Consumer Goods Forum (CGF)  	 dagligvarehandelns Miljforum (dMF) 	 dagligvareleverandrenes Forening (dlF),  	 employers Confederation of latvia  	 employers will fight against hiV   	 (rimi Baltic is a member) eu animal Welfare platform 	 Forest stewardship Council (FsC) 	 Good pharmacy practice (Gpp) 	 Greenpeace  	 Green Warriors of norway  	 handels- og servicenringens hovedorgan- 	 isasjon, (hsh)  international Chamber of Commerce (iCC) 	 investors Forum in lithuania 	 KraV/debio  	 latvian association of Food retailers 	 latvian Chamber of Commerce and   	 industry (lCCi)  livsmedelshandlarna (sslF) 	 Marine stewardship Council (MsC) 	 Mattilsynet 	 roundtable on sustainable palm oil  	 (through ahold) roundtable on responsible soy   	 (through ahold) swedish Trade Federation 	 svensk dagligvaruhandel  	 swedish Food Federation 	 swedish institute for Food and   	 Biotechnology (siK) swedish national Food  administration 	 swedish society for nature Conservation 	 swedish association of environmental   	 Managers sweden Forest & Trade network 	 swedish Consumer Coalition 	 swedish pharmacy association 	 The association of lithuanian Trade   	 enterprises (alTe)  The Foreign investors Council in latvia  	 The swedish Trade Council in lithuania 	 Ziedot lv  	  10 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures stakeholders key issues and dialogues in 2010 Stakeholder  Key issues  Dialogues/activities to manage these issues Employees   opportunities for skills train- 	 ing and professional devel- opment. strong leadership.

The  sustainability report comprises this Gri-report and the annual  report, also available in printed form. We have published an annual  environmental and corporate responsibility report since 1995. as of  2006, it is published together with iCas annual report. The report  follows the iCa Groups financial year. The 2010 edition covers the  period January 1, 2010 to december 31, 2010. The previous report was  published in March 2009. Information and performance indicators in the report have been selected based on  the CR aspects that are relevant to our operations. The opinions of our stakeholders  are important to consider when defining the key issues in our CR work. These opin- ions are valuable in order to make continuous improvements. With the help of the  GRIs Guidance on Defining Report Content, we have conducted a materiality anal- ysis, where the demands and expectations of our stakeholders, among other things,  served as a basis. The materiality analysis was defined for the first time in 2008 and  is revised each year.   Boundaries The report mainly comprises operations that have a significant, direct impact from  a CR perspective, i.e., the Groups own operations. In Sweden, we collaborate with  around 1,400 independent retailers through agreements. Information on them is  presented when relevant to the overview of the ICA Groups CR work, e.g.: Electricity consumption  	 Waste collected from deliveries of goods to stores  	 Sales data from stores  	 The number of stores that are certified according to food standards and are  	 Swan-labeled Operations outside ICAs direct control, such as suppliers and customers, are not in- cluded in the report. Information on suppliers of ICAs corporate brands is included  in the report when applicable.  13 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures Measurement and calculation methods iCa sweden, iCa norway and rimi Baltic use a common iT system to collect data on Cr issues. The system  supports continuous reporting with the aim to ensure the long-term quality of the indicators included in iCas  continuous monitoring and annual Cr report. The company in each country reports data according to the  Groups definitions and routines for Cr reporting. iCas calculation and reporting parameters are described in  detail below.    Charitable contributions  include voluntary donations from iCa  	 sweden as well as donations from cus- tomers, employees and suppliers collect- ed through iCa sweden. The recipients  are charitable organizations and nGos. Energy  includes stores and warehouses as well  	 as offices belonging to logistics depart- ments. The two iCa To Go stores are not  included. To calculate electricity consumption in  	 swedish and norwegian stores, a sam- pling of stores in each format is used.  Their actual consumption is extrapolated  based on the total number of stores at  the end of the report period.  To calculate energy consumption per  	 square meter in warehouses and stores,  the area of the stores and warehouses in  operation at year-end is used.   rimi lithuania reports average area in  	 connection with the transfer of ware- houses in mid 2010. Goods transports and climate impact  include goods transports between stores  	 and iCas warehouses. Transports by sup- pliers to warehouses are not included. iCa sweden and rimi Baltic is calculated  	 based on distances driven and average  fuel consumption. diesel consumption  for own goods transports in iCa norway  and rimi Baltic is obtained directly from  the diesel supplier. Measurement does  not take into account the amount of re- newable fuel used. a revised method is  scheduled to be introduced in 2011. leased transports between warehouses  	 and stores in norway are estimated on  driven transport distance and average  diesel consumption for their own trans- portation.  Cooling agents  include cooling agents refills in all ware- 	 houses and rimi Baltics stores. stores in  norway and sweden are not included. data on iCa swedens warehouses are  	 based on official coolant reports.  Business travel  includes business travel by air booked  	 through iCas central travel agency for  employees of iCa norway and iCa swe- den. as of 2008, we buy carbon offsets  for air travel.  includes business travel by rail made by  	 employees within iCa sweden booked  through iCas central travel agency or di- rectly through travel providers with iCas  customer number. includes business travel by car made by  	 employees in sweden.   Climate change  The following factors are used to calculate  Co2 emissions:   emissions factor for 2006 nordic elec- 	 tricity for conventional electricity in  sweden and norway.  supplier-specific emissions factor for  	 units that have signed iCas central elec- tricity agreement. The international energy agencys av- 	 erage for the years 2000–2005 for each  Baltic countrys electricity production. The swedish society for nature Con- 	 servations specific emissions factor for  Good environmental Choice electricity. swedish average for district heating from  	 the swedish energy agency (according  to the recommendation of the GhG pro- tocol).  The emissions factor for swedens elec- 	 tricity mix is used to calculate Co2 sav- ings from sales of low-energy light bulbs.  emissions factor for diesel from the nt- 	 verket fr Trafik och Milj (nTM). Global Warming potential (GWp) for each  	 type of cooling agents according to the  Montreal protocol and ipCC. Co 	 2 emissions from air and rail travel are  obtained from iCas carbon offset suppli- ers or the travel provider.  The GhG protocols emission factor for  	 business travel by car. Waste  includes all warehouses as well as iCa  	 norways and rimi Baltics stores. soft  plastics from stores are not included for  all countries, since this type of waste is  returned from stores to warehouses.  national laws and regional waste man- 	 agement systems define the types of  waste involved.  information on waste management  	 methods and amounts is obtained from  waste contractors.  Waste volumes in iCa norway and rimi  	 Baltic stores are based on actual waste  amounts collected during the year for a  significant part of the stores. Generated  waste is extrapolated using the number  of stores at year-end. rimi Baltics waste is based on actual  	 waste data extrapolated by the number  of stores at year end. Waste from out- sourced warehouse in estonia are ex- cluded. Waste reported for rimi Baltic also in- 	 cludes packaging waste for products that  rimi Baltic introduces on the market.  Compostable waste comprises biode- 	 gradable organic waste, i.e., waste sorted  as compostable and 90 percent of organ- ic waste fractions with packaging. Combustible waste comprises combus- 	 tible waste fractions and 10 percent of  organic fractions with packaging. in nor- way, 75 percent of unsorted production  waste is included as well. recycled/reused waste includes glass,  	 metal, wood, plastics and other non- landfill waste. iCa norway also includes  10 percent of unsorted production waste  in recycled/reused fractions and 15 per- cent in landfill waste fractions.  Supplier-related data GFsi-certified suppliers comprise iCas  	 corporate brand suppliers approved ac- cording to one of the quality standards  approved by the Global Food safety ini- tiative (GFsi). information on socially audited suppli- 	 ers refers to active suppliers in high risk  countries and their production units   which have been socially audited ac- cording to iCa social audit or any of the  third party audit scheme that accepted  by iCa. The definition of a high risk country is  	 based on a combination of the un de- velopment programme (undp ) human  development index and economic se- curity index. a country is considered a  high-risk country if it has  <0.85 in the  human development index and <0:50 in   14 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures the economic security index. unless the  two index levels are consistent, the level  of the human development index will  be crucial when a countrys level of risk  is assessed.    Sales trends and number of products  includes sales from swedish and nor- 	 wegian iCa/rimi-stores. in sweden, only  iCa swedens central assortment of the  products described below is included. The number of products corresponds to  	 the total number of unique ean codes  in iCas range of food intolerance prod- ucts or those labeled according to Fair- trade, Keyhole, organic (KraV/debio, eu  organic). Keyhole-labeled products and products  	 for food intolerances are available in  swedish and norwegian iCa stores.  Quality work and product safety  recalls comprise all recalled products  	 from warehouses and/or stores. re- calls that are considered a risk to human  health or the environment are public re- calls, i.e., the public is informed through a  press release, among other measures.  Tests comprise the number of internal  	 and external product tests on iCas cor- porate brands, both new and existing  products. Quality in stores  Certified stores in sweden refer to stores  	 approved and certified by a third party  according to the swedish standard for  food quality. stores that have implemented the food  	 quality standard refer to swedish iCa  stores that apply the standard, but are  not certified by a third party.  hygiene inspections comprise the num- 	 ber of inspections performed by iCa  norways own employees at iCa/rimi  stores in norway. Employees  include personnel employed by the  	 Group, i.e., including workers in stores  owned by iCa. The number of employees comprises  	 full-time workers, workers hired on a tri- al basis and workers with temporary as- signments of longer than three months.  The number of full-time employees  	 (FTe) comprises full-time workers, work- ers hired on a trial basis and temporary  workers of longer than three months.  The average number of employees is  based on the Groups measure of normal  working hours, i.e., 1,800 hours per year.  employee turnover is calculated as the  	 number of people who left during the  year in relation to the average number of  permanent workers and workers hired  on a trial basis.  sick-leave is calculated as the number of  	 hours of sick leave in relation to sched- uled working hours.  The share of men/women at the man- 	 agement level refers to all management  levels within the Group and is based on  the number of full-time employees (FTe). store robberies includes number of rob- 	 beries or robbery attempts of products  or money from a store or store employ- ee including physical violence or threats  of physical violence. Material changes since previous   report period Compared with previous years, the follow- ing changes in the report parameters and  calculation principles were made in 2010:  iCa swedens sales of organic and Fair- 	 trade-labeled products for 2009 have  been revised. a review of the system  showed that a number of products had  not been included in the 2009 figures.  The system has been analyzed and cor- rected.  The number of Fairtrade and organically  	 labeled products is reported as the num- ber of units, i.e., unique ean codes.  The calculation method for diesel con- 	 sumption for hired transport for iCa  norge has changed during the year.  15 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Economic Performance EC Engagements and  investments – creating  value in society       Our aim is to achieve profitable long-term growth based on a well- managed business that creates value for our owners and other  stakeholders. The work includes serving as a positive force in society  and making wise investments for the future. In 2010, the Group  generated revenue of SEK 93 billion.  Our cooperations with charitable organizations are also investments. These cooper- ations endorse important values. The ICA Group benefits in both the short-and long- term from a healthier, more humane and better-informed world.  Popular, high-quality products, new control systems for distribution, improved en- ergy and waste management, good work environments and employee training lead  not only to a better environment and greater social benefit but also lower costs and  better business over time.

In 2010, we were involved in a number of well received  campaigns and activities together with NGOs:  Since 2003, ICA Sweden has been the principal partner of the World Childhood  	 Foundation, where we are working to help marginalized children. We contrib- ute by collecting money for Childhoods projects. The 2010 Christmas campaign  and other activities generated SEK 8,3 million. ICA Sweden sold Mns Zelmerlvs  Christmas album and donated one percent of total corporate brand sales in stores  during a two-week period in December.  For the eighth consecutive year, ICA Sweden was the chief sponsor of the Pink  	 Ribbon campaign, which collects money for Swedish cancer research with the  goal of creating a greater understanding of the connection between food and  breast cancer. In 2010, the Pink Ribbon and promotional products were sold in  ICAs stores through payment cards in the customer magazine Buff, which raised  SEK 7,1 million. During the year, ICA Sweden was also the chief sponsor of the  mustache campaign against prostate cancer, which raised over SEK 3.5 million. ICA Sweden arranged the We can do more lottery in cooperation with the  	 Swedish National Association for Persons with Intellectual Disability (FUB), which  collected a total of SEK 5 million.  ICA Sweden was the main sponsor of the Swedish road race series Blodomloppet  	 for the eighth consecutive year. During that time, the number of runners has in- creased from 14,000 to over 76,000. Blodomloppet brings attention to the impor- tance of blood donations, as well as food and health, and in 2010 races were run  in 14 locations around Sweden. In cooperation with the charity Algojimas, which supports disabled children, Rimi  	 Baltic in arranged a charitable concert on Lithuanian TV. In connection with the  concert, EUR 50,000 was donated by viewers.  Rimi Baltic in Latvia fundraised 342 711 EUR in 2010 and therefore giving a signifi- 	 cant help for eight projects which helped to improve childerns health and even  save their lifes ICA Norway has now installed bottle recycling machines in 293 stores, where cus- 	 tomers can choose to receive their refund or donate the money to the Red Cross.  By donating the deposit, the customer is automatically entered into a lottery. In  total, the lottery generated NOK 12.6 million in ICA Norways stores in 2010, of  which NOK 4.2 million went to the Red Cross. Similar machines in Swedish ICA  stores generated SEK 4.8 million for the Red Cross.

Our  overall risk analysis also includes the assessment and management of risks related to climate change. Societys growing awareness of climate change  is likely to result in new laws and regulations,  which in turn affect our operations financially  and physically. We continuously monitor these  issues so that we are ready to quickly adapt. Im- portant areas include emissions limits on goods  transports, taxes that lead to more expensive  fossil fuels and societys transition to renewable  energy sources. The physical risks that climate change could  cause – temperature changes, drought, oods,  etc. – affect everyone in society. For us, it means  that access to various crops could change over  time due to new growing patterns. Goods trans- ports could be affected if extreme weather con- ditions were to limit our access. New store open- ings could also be affected. Flooding in certain  areas, for example, would be a risk that would  have to be considered in such decisions. Re- duced access to fossil fuels also represents a po- tential risk if ICA cannot handle the transition of  its operations to renewable fuels.   New spending patterns due to a growing aware- ness of climate change could constitute a risk  unless the ICA Group adapts quickly enough to  shifting customer demands. Change Risks Opportunities Challenges give rise to new ideas. The climate change  debate is likely to lead to stricter limits on CO2 emis- sions from transports. This increases the need for en- vironmentally friendly solutions such as more rail  transports. New technology is also being developed  for new demands, which provides opportunities for  eco-friendly solutions. For example, a tax on synthetic  cooling agents would steer development toward more  eco-friendly alternatives in everything from transports  to refrigeration systems in stores.  As customer demand for products adapted to climate  change and environment safety increases, we can also  find new opportunities, e.g., by developing new prod- ucts or finding locations within biking or walking dis- tance of residential areas. Moreover, the ability to bet- ter manage wastes in society in general means that  our stores can also manage their wastes more safely.  The attention being given to the impact of food waste  on climate change is leading to a greater focus on re- ducing shrinkage. Through an early transition to re- newable energy sources, we can ensure that our op- erations will remain viable even if access to fossil fuels  were reduced. Reducing energy consumption is also a  way to save money.    Satisfied customers are a competitive advantage. By  being open, inventive and ambitious, we can improve  customer relations. This can give us a business advan- tage.

In  addition to several initiatives to label local products in all our countries, we are doing  several things to satisfy the growing interest from consumers.  Rimi Baltic in Lithuania has launched a concept it calls Vikis, a shop-in-shop that  	 sells only local products. In a Vikis store, customers can find everything from dairy  products, meat, vegetables and bread to jams, oils and honey. Lithuanian produc- ers have their own ways of making the products and their own recipes. Today cus- tomers can find Vikis in four stores. Plans call for an eventual launch in all three Bal- tic markets.  A popular product launch in Sweden in 2010 was ICA Selection pork, locally pro- 	 duced by four selected farms in southeastern Sweden. The breeding pigs are raised  on feed made only from Swedish commodities, i.e., without any imported soy. The  sows farrow on thick straw. The farms are expected to run primarily renewable  electricity from wind and hydropower. Production is certified according to IP Sigill  (Swedish Seal of Quality), which guarantees that certain criteria are met in terms of  animal welfare, environmental protection and food safety.  ICA Sweden has launched an intranet marketplace, ICA Torget, where local pro- 	 ducers and retailers can meet. Local producers also have the opportunity to come  in to contact with retailers and stores at network meetings and at the annual ICA  convention, where a number of local producers market their products. Marketing  templates have been produced in Sweden to help local producers get their prod- ucts seen in stores. Rimi Baltics promotions in Latvia for freshly harvested local products have re- 	 ceived an enormous response. In Estonia, Rimi Baltic cooperate with the Associa- tion of Estonian Food Industry to label local products with the Estonian flag.   Community development initiatives EC8–9 reported EC8–9 reported The ICA Group wants to be a positive force with a local presence in society. We  therefore participate in debates and various initiatives, in addition to sponsoring and  supporting projects in local communities. In connection with new store openings,  we work with municipalities, regions and authorities to support local development.  In rural Swedish communities, ICA stores serve as an agent for Apoteket and Sys- 	 tembolaget, the state-run pharmacy and alcohol monopolies, as well as for the  postal service. In cooperation with Kuponginlsen, ICA Bank has been handling payment servic- 	 es since 2008 for rural communities that were dropped when Svensk Kassaservice  went out of business.  Through local mail carriers and services of the ICA Bank, residents in about 70 ru- 	 ral routes can pay bills and cash checks.  ICA Bank has an agreement with the Swedish Migration Board to pay out assis- 	 tance to asylum seekers, who receive a debit card from ICA Bank where the mon- ey is deposited. The cardholder can then withdraw cash or make purchases at any  ICA store.  ICA Bank has joined together with ECPAT, 12 other Swedish banks and the police  	 to stop online purchases of child pornography. ECPAT is a global network of orga- nizations working to eliminate child prostitution, pornography and trafficking.  19 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Economic Performance EC ICA is also an active partner in Arena for Growth, a public-private partnership to  	 promote local and regional growth through collaboration and growth-promoting  processes.  We support projects like Jobbsjansen in Oslo, ICAs trainees in the Gteborg sub- 	 urb of Bergsjn, and Merit.nu in Stockholm. Besides that Rimi Baltic has an initi- tive to integrate employees with functional disabilities in the stores. ICA Sweden  in collaboration with the ICA retailers association and local ICA retailers also em- ploy people with functional disabilities through Samhall and municipal day care fa- cilities. Rimi Baltics hypermarkets in Lithuania and Estonia have set up boxes where cus- 	 tomers can donate products to families in need. In 2010 in 14 Rimi Lithuania stores  were collected 91 188 food products, which total value is approximately EUR  83,500. Rimi Baltic in Estonia are donating food for the Red Cross, Food Bank and  Shalom charity. During one promotion in November four Rimi stores in Estonia  collected 7,800 food items.  In Latvia, Rimi Baltic sponsored the Nordea Riga Marathon providning 10,000 run- 	 ners with meal and an environmental friendly shopping bag.  In 14 locations in Latvia, Rimi has donated food to soup kitchens, which feed  	 around 15,000 people a month.   ICA Norway helped to renovate Fattighuset in 2010 and contributed the food dis- 	 tributed to needy families twice a week. At Christmas, all employees have the op- portunity to donate to Fattighuset.  Rimi Baltic in Lithuania and the Vilnius employment office launched a bicycle park- 	 ing project, Veloparkas, in the capital. In 2010, 200 sheltered bike parking facilities  were installed around the city. Rimi Lithuania works closely with Eco dot (recycling system improvement and fu- 	 ture education campaigns are planned) Rimi Lithuania together with Lithuanian Public Health Offices are initiating an edu- 	 cation project Superkids which concerns healthy nutrition. For the third year in succession, Rimi Latvia supports the Large Joint Cleaning in  	 which in more than 300 000 persons have participated . In Rimi and Supernetto  stores any consumer wanting to go cleaning could receive bags for waste. Also,  Rimi office employees took part in the preliminary cleaning by gathering waste  and facilitating improvements in the yard and surroundings of some multi-apart- ment houses.  20 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Environmental Performance EN Environment and climate  change – critical to our future Every part of the ICA Group impacts the environment. This is why we  work with environmental issues throughout our operations. We think  sustainably in our sourcing and distribution and develop climate smart  stores and warehouses. We are working in several ways to preserve  biological diversity and to further increase the number of organic and  eco-labeled products we offer. Reducing energy consumption and waste  is an important part of our internal environmental work. In addition, we  encourage consumers to reduce their own impacts in various ways.  We have a climate goal to reduce the Groups known greenhouse  gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 compared to 2006. Initiatives to preserve oceans, forests,  meadows and species EN12–15 reported Global Compact 8 EN12–15 reported Global Compact 8 Every day the ICA Group sells large amounts of food in five different countries. In the  process, our operations use the Earths resources. But we are careful to do so cau- tiously. If the oceans are overfished and the rainforests are plundered, it will affect  us not only as people but also as a retail company. This is why we constantly look  for new ways to preserve biological diversity. One of the key partners in our work  with biological diversity is World Wide Fund of nature (WWF).  We are continuously expanding our range of organic products with the goal of offer- ing organic alternatives in every product group. Free range beef and open landscapes Since we started working with WWF in Sweden in the 1990s, more than 90,000 acres  of pastureland have been restored. Grazing cattle keep the landscape open and en- sure a rich diversity of flora and fauna. Their grazing and waste are important to the  species richness in the pastureland.  In 2010, the cooperation entered a new phase when WWF transitioned from pri- marily restoring overgrown pasture to ensuring that the results achieved to date are  maintained in the long term as well as spreading the concept to new landowners  and other stakeholders. To avoid seeing restored pasture abandoned once again re- quires owners who remain committed to their preservation. The strongest driver is  the demand for free range beef.  In 2010, ICA launched one new product in its line of free range beef, which now con- sists of a total of 13 products. Sales in 2010 correspond to around 1,800 head of free  range cattle, while about 13,300 acres of Swedish pastureland have been preserved.  21 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Environmental Performance EN Healthy oceans have enough fish The ICA Group has taken a stand in several ways to protect endangered species of  fish. We utilize WWFs guide with a red, yellow and green listed fish in Norway and  Sweden. As far as possible, we try to avoid red listed fish in the main assortment  sold to the stores. WWFs fish guide was updated in October 2010, and we are work- ing to adapt our product range to it as far as possible. We are also expanding our  range of MSC-certified fish such as frozen haddock and cod fillets.  Consumers can trace the cod, haddock and alaska pollock sold under ICAs brands  on the Groups Swedish website, where they can follow its journey from the Baltic  Sea outside Norway to ICAs warehouses and stores and find out what is being done  to protect the species. ICA Swedens website also shows how our seafood products  are classified according to WWFs fish guide. In 2010, farmed salmon was a hot-button issue in seafood-crazed Norway. The de- bate has been whether it is healthy to eat farmed salmon and whether its produc- tion harms the environment. Despite contradictory opinions, we have tightened our  requirements on the fishing industry and require suppliers to provide us with ad- equate information on farmed salmon and its origins, and to take measures to pro- duce the fish sustainably.  Soy and palm oil from preserved forests The manufacture of ICAs corporate food brands in the Swedish market annually re- quires around 2,000 tons of palm oil. We have decided that all palm oil used in ICAs  private labels must be certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) by  2015. This is part of an effort to encourage palm oil plantations to meet environmen- tal, social and economic criteria and preserve the rainforests. The volumes are lim- ited, however. We are therefore buying Green Palm certifications to support more  palm oil plantations in their efforts to meet RSPO criteria.  We are also involved in the issue of soy, whose cultivation can have a major long- term impact on tropical forests and savannas, including in Brazil.  During the year,  we held discussions with the Federation of Swedish Farmers (LRF) among others,  the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and feed producers on how the world  can transition to more sustainably produced soy and how we can reduce its use.  Through the ICA Groups owner, Ahold, we are a member of the Roundtable for Sus- tainable Soy and are carefully monitored developments in this area. ICA Sweden has decided to sell only FSC-certified private-label charcoal and that all  products made of tropical woods, such as outdoor furniture, must be FSC-certified.  The stores in Sweden annually sell around 10,000 tons of certified charcoal. ICA also  offers FSC-labeled disposable grills, notebooks and copy paper.   Read more about our value-added products on page 30-34.  22 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Environmental Performance EN Measures to reduce energy consumption  EN5, 7 reported Global Compact 8, 9 EN5, 7 reported Global Compact 8, 9     The operation of stores and warehouses accounts for a large part of the ICA Groups  total energy consumption. In 2010 the focus has been on concrete actions and ef- forts have paid off.  2010 was a year of unusually long and cold winter and a very hot summer, which  had an impact on energy consumption. Despite this, energy efficiency in our ware- houses in Norway increased due to energy conservation measures and increased  warhouse surface during the year. Total energy increased in our Baltic warehoueses  since they during the year opened new, larger storage units, and during a period had  double warehouses in operation.  The refill of refrigerants increased by approximately 3.7 tonnes during the year. This  is mainly due to the very hot summer that were demanding for the cooling systems  in stores and warehouses.  The objective of the Swedish ICA stores energy usage to decrease by ten percent in  2010 compared with 2007 was achieved. The total energy savings amounted to 14  percent compared to 2007. The Baltic stores energy consumption increased during  the year mainly due to the unusual weather conditions, because a number of stores  opened during the year. For many stores there is a much larger potential for energy  saving than ten percent.

This applies on a widespread basis  in Sweden and Norway. In the Baltic countries, stores are upgrading their refrigera- tors and freezers in connection with Rimis rebranding. The stores are gradually replacing their lighting with more modern, energy ef- 	 ficient alternatives. A number of Rimi Baltics Lithuanian stores have automated  lighting. Savings are estimated at up to 50 percent, and for the whole store it can  generate energy savings of 10–15 percent. The CoolICA system, which is used in Norway to monitor energy consumption  	 and temperatures, has been installed in 393 stores. Rimi Baltic uses an Automatic Monitoring System to control temperatures in re- 	 frigerators and freezers. Several stores have hired energy consultants and conduct  energy audits. Opened in 2010, ICA Kvantum Sannegrden in Gteborg has put ICA Swedens en- 	 ergy-efficiency strategy into practice. Among other things, the store has solar pan- els on its roof, automatic lighting and ventilation, and lids and doors on all refriger- ated cases and freezers. In total, energy consumption has been reduced by about  35 percent compared to a conventional store of the same size. ICA Kvantum San- negrden is therefore seen as a store of the future. Rimi Baltic in Latvia encourages store employees to share their knowledge of en- 	 ergy savings. In Sweden, 377 ICA stores were certified according to the Nordic Swan eco-la- 	 bel at year-end 2010, compared to 382 a year earlier. One of the reasons why the  number has decreased while the share has remained constant is that the total  number of ICA stores in Sweden was reduced by ten. The requirements to have a  store Swan certified were tightened in 2010 in terms of waste sorting and energy  efficiency, among other things. The ICA Maxi Hypermarket, ICA Kvantum and ICA  Supermarket formats are all trying to meet the Nordic Swan criteria. Number and share of Swan-labeled ICA stores 2010 2009 2008 Sweden, number (share) 377 (28%) 382 (28%) 326 (24%) Energy efficient products and services EN6 reported Global Compact 8, 9 EN6 reported Global Compact 8, 9 During the year, ICA Sweden began installing charging stations for customers with  	 electric cars in the parking lots outside ICA stores. The goal is to have stations at  about 20 ICA stores around the country within five years. By year-end, there were  charging stations at ICA stores in stersund, Vsters and Gteborg.  In 2010, ICA Sweden ran a campaign offering regular customers discounted pric- 	 es on energy-saving light bulbs. If customers use the bulbs sold during the year in- stead of conventional incandescent bulbs, CO2 emissions will be reduced by an  estimated 26,600 tons, compared to 18,300 tons in the 2009 campaign. Rimi stores in all three Baltic markets offer bags made from 33 percent recycled  	 material as well as cotton and paper bags.   24 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Environmental Performance EN Rimi Baltic in Estonia participated in Killerkott tapab, a major campaign to in- 	 crease awareness about the environmental dangers of plastic bags and to show  customers the alternatives. For example, it offers recyclable bags as well as cloth  bags at an inexpensive price.  Rimi Baltic in Latvia participated in a project called 10/10/10, Worldwide Green  	 Works Day for the first time in 2010 and offered to exchange a cloth bag for ev- ery four plastic bags customers brought in. In a single day, Rimi stores distributed  30,000 cloth bags.     Greenhouse gas reduction initiatives EN18 reported Global Compact 7, 8, 9 EN18 reported Global Compact 7, 8, 9   Since 2006, the ICA Groups direct emissions of greenhouse gas emissions has de- creased by around eight percent. In 2010 the Groups direct emissions of greenhouse  gases slightly increased compared to last year. This is mainly because the refrigerant  consumption in the Baltic stores and stocks rose because of the unusually hot sum- mer and long and cold winter that has been demanding on systems. Climate impact  of the Norwegian stores decreased drastically when a large percentage of the stores  in 2010 switched to renewable electricity.

A decision has been  	 made that all Maxi ICA Hypermarkets will use it. About 40 percent of Swedish ICA  stores were using renewable electricity at year-end 2010. All warehouses in Swe- den and Norway have been doing so for a number of years. ICA Sweden has around 20 stores that use 100 percent natural coolants, and the  	 number is growing. Coolant levels in refrigeration and freezer systems have been  greatly reduced. Large stores primarily use glycol, which circulates in the system  and cuts the amount of cooling agents. Glycol is used in the refrigeration systems  and carbon dioxide is used for freezers at ICA Maxi, Kvantum and Supermarket.  ICA Sweden is well-positioned in this area relative to the competition. In 2010, ICA Sweden completed a project together with five selected ICA I love Eco  	 suppliers that has provided an important understanding of climate impacts from  products as well as of future sourcing requirements. In 2010, ICA Sweden decided to participate in the project One Tonne Life, which  	 began in January 2011. The goal is to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions  per person from seven to one ton by living and eating sustainably. The results  are being followed through a test family that lives in a specially built, sustainably  equipped home. We will contribute our knowledge of how choosing the right  foods can help the family to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. To draw attention to the issue of climate change, we participate in WWFs Earth  	 Hour campaign in all our markets. We turned off the lighting in the number of  warehouses, offices and stores and encourage our customers to turn off their  lights for an hour for the sake of the environment.  All warehouses in Sweden have fossil free electricity, reducing carbon dioxide  	 emissions by 85 percent compared to normal electricity.    Initiatives for greener transports  EN29 reported Global Compact 8 EN29 reported Global Compact 8   To reduce the total mileage our vehicles drive, we continue to raise efficiencies in  our infrastructure and distribution network, including by ensuring that trucks are  well-filled and have carefully planned routes.  The ICA Group currently does not own any trucks, with the exception of Norway,  where we use our own and lease others. Modern engine technology and alternative  fuels reduce emissions, which we require our trucking companies to verify. In Swe- den, alternative fuels are blended with diesel and the trucks are equipped with tires  with low rolling resistance to reduce fuel consumption and environmental impacts.  ICA Sweden has been a member since 2009 of KNEG – Climate-Neutral Goods Trans- port – and has therefore been committed to promoting future fossil-free distribution  in Stockholm. Since April 2010, three of our trucks are powered by ethanol and have  less climate impact than traditional diesel. Since December, another vehicle also  runs on ethanol. We are open to testing other alternative fuels and are carefully fol- lowing developments in the belief that a mix of alternative fuels will be the best fu- ture solution. Biogas is one alternative, although it is sometimes in short supply. Us- ing alternative fuels on a large scale requires both reliability and access.  Diesel consumption for goods transport between stores and warehouses rose  slightly during the year. This is mainly because ICA in Sweden gradually takes over  the goods transports from suppliers to not run with empty trucks back to ware- houses from the store. This means that ICAs goods transports increases, but the en- vironmental impact overall has declined. In the Baltic countries, goods transports  increased since during the year new warehouses opened and new and old ware- houses where open during a period.  Read about our Diesel Consumption on page 26.  26 We are also trying to shift more transports from road to rail. Today ICA Sweden  transports practically all its beverages by rail. ICA Norway transports imported, re- frigerated and frozen products as well as fruit and vegetables by train to the distribu- tion terminal in Narvik.  ICA Sweden, ICA Norway and Rimi Baltic in Estonia require their drivers to practice  eco-driving. Since 2009, all trucks that drive for ICA Sweden are equipped with alco-  locks.  ICA Sweden has hired a third party to audit its freight forwarders every year. In 2010,  the number of violations was cut in half compared to 2009. Four freight compa- nies followed the requirements completely, compared to only one in the previous  year. The most frequent issue was that they could not properly manage the speeds  of their vehicles. After the annual audit, the freight forwarders submit action plans,  which we review and approve.  The ICA Group limits air shipments to products that do not keep the quality on boat- shipments like sensitive fruits, vegetables and flowers. Any exceptions must be ap- proved by ICAs management. Initiatives for greener business travel  ICA employees in Sweden have guidelines on choosing company cars. In 2010, the  number of eco-friendly cars in ICAs fleet increased from 38 to 42 percent. ICAs cen- tral leasing agreement for Swedish employees steers drivers toward eco-friendly  choices.  Since 2008, ICA buys carbon offsets for air travel by employees in Sweden and Nor- way if they book through our main travel agency. The money is helping to finance  wind power turbines in China. The offsets are purchased according to the Clean De- velopment Mechanism (CDM) Gold standard. CDM is a project model that meets the  requirements of Kyoto Protocols directive for greenhouse gas-reducing measures in  developing countries. ICA Sweden and ICA Norway have increased their number of videoconferences by  19 percent and teleconferences by 53 percent. Business travel by train in Sweden de- creased slightly, while air travel increased, due to the long winter prompted many to  choose air circulate.

During the  year we improved the degree of sorting in our warehouses in Sweden and Nor- way, which further reduced the amount of waste going to landfill and increased  the amount that goes to composting and anaerobic digestion. The total amount  of waste increased during the year compared to previous years, since Sweden and  Norway now also handles waste consisting of non-prescription drugs. During 2010  the issue of food waste was raised in all our markets, and many new ideas were of- fered how we can reduce shrinkage and the amount of food waste.  In Sweden, ICA retailers prepare lunches made from products near expiration,  	 sell blemished fruits and vegetables at a discount and have introduced a concept  called Eat Soon, which allows customers to buy products that otherwise would  go to waste at sharply discounted prices. ICA Norway has a 50% concept where  products near their expiration date are discounted by 50 percent in stores, which  reduces shrinkage.  ICA Swedens warehouses sort all their wastes, and in 2010 99 percent was re- 	 cycled. During the year, procurement contracts were awarded to manage ICAs  inventory waste. Waste providers that could show they recycle the waste while  maximizing recovered energy and minimizing the impact of transports have been  given priority as business partners. ICA Norway has introduced a new quality control system for fruit and vegetables  	 in five warehouses, including in Luhrtoppen and Bryne. The system is clearly re- ducing inventory shrinkage. The quality of fruit and vegetables has improved and  thereby reduced shrinkage in stores as well. ICA Norway has joined with the Church City Mission, the Ministry of Agriculture  	 and Food and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority to create a food bank in Oslo  that accepts items that the industry must discard for practical or legal reasons and  distributes them to charities.  In Latvia, Rimi Baltic works with around 30 zoos and animal shelters that receive  	 soon-to-expire products, while in Estonia it was the chief partner in the UNs Euro- pean Week on Waste Reduction, which was arranged for the third and final year.

All our suppliers have to comply with legal  requirements and ICAs policies.  Structured quality work  PR1 reported Global Compact 1 PR1 reported Global Compact 1   We monitor compliance with the help of audits, product label reviews, product tests  and structured quality assurance in logistics and stores. Taking responsibility for a  sustainable product range also means inspiring customers to make well-informed,  healthy choices on a daily basis. In addition, we offer a wide range of eco-labeled, or- ganic and ethical labeled products.   Quality assurance of our suppliers We require ICAs private label food suppliers to be third-party certified according to  a product safety standard approved by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). These  standards cover food safety management systems, Hazard Analysis and Critical  Control Points (HACCP) plans and good manufacturing practices.  ICA Groups objective was that 80 percent of all food suppliers of our corporate  brands should be third party certified under GFSI by 2010. At the end of 2010, this  amounted to 67 percent for the whole group due to efforts to ensure that we con- tinually have updated certificates in our systems and that enforcing GFSI-require- ment takes longer than expected. ICA Sweden reached the target in late 2010.  We also have our own quality standard in markets where third-party certification is  not yet established or where we feel there are higher product quality risks.  In 2008, we played a part in developing a third-party standard for small-scale food pro- duction, IP Livsmedelsfrdling (IP Food Processing), and reached an agreement to of- fer reduce auditing prices to small producers.  Suppliers of corporate brand cosmetics and hygiene products are required to be  certified by BRC Global Standard Consumer Products (BRC CP) or similar standards.  For other private label non-food suppliers, the goal is to be certified according to  BRC CP, ISO 9001 or similar standards.    29 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social performance  PR Quality assurance of our products All of ICAs private label products undergo sensory and quality tests on the way to  becoming a finished product. The sensory tests evaluate appearance, odor, taste  and consistency. Ingredients, nutritional information and other properties are de- tailed in internal product specifications. In addition to sensory and quality tests, we  test each products function, as in the case of baking powder, washing detergent and  housewares. All products are examined and approved to ensure that they live up to  ICAs policies and internal guidelines. Packaging information is also inspected and ap- proved. Rimi Baltic has expanded its corporate brands in recent years and now has its  own quality organization to assure the quality of these brands in the Baltic markets.   In 2010, we conducted a total of around 5,000 tests, 2,100 of which were sensory  tests on new and existing products.   Read how we control products from the factory   to the store, page 30 in our Annual Report.  Quality assurance of distribution  High quality is maintained throughout the supply chain until our products reach the  store. Product quality is assured through self-assessments and product safety work.  This includes a fully implemented HACCP plan, which is required by law and de- scribes how the company investigates, evaluates and inspects food risks. Quality assurance of stores Since 2009, ICA stores in Sweden have applied the Swedish standard for food han- dling. ICA Sweden played a decisive role in developing what became the worlds first  third-party food safety standard for food stores. In Sweden, the routines are being  introduced in stores under the leadership of our quality coaches. In total, 1,125 stores  have implemented the standard and 223 have been audited and certified by an in- spection body, including all 72 Maxi ICA Hypermarkets.  Number of quality-certified ICA-stores and stores that have  implemented the Swedish food handling standard, ICA Sweden 2010 2009 Accepted by inspection body  223 100 Implemented the standard 1,125 882 The ICA Group has begun promoting the standard internationally, in part to allow  ICA Norways and Rimi Baltics stores to be certified. ICA Norway has begun building  systems and an organization to meet the requirements of the standard. In Norway,  quality coaches have been hired since early 2010 to support and inspect food safety  in stores. Until now, ICA Norway has measured quality in stores based on hygiene in- spections.  Rimi Baltic conducts internal audits to see how well its stores comply with the qual- ity standard; violations have been few in number.

In total, the ICA Group had 31 public recalls during 2010; ICA Norway,  17, ICA Sweden, 10 and Rimi Baltic, 4.  The public recalls of corporate brands included for example Euroshopper Raspberry,  which contained calicivirus and was stopped on March 18. We followed up the re- call by visiting the supplier, which confirmed that it was taking corrective measures  to improve quality. Two hot dog products, ICAs Grillkorv 500 gram and Euroshopper  Grillkorv 400 gram, were recalled on April 13 when it was feared that they might con- tain listeria. Tests later showed no trace of listeria. The third recall pertained to three  types of imported chopped meat sold under the Euroshopper name, when it was  shown that certain batches contained salmonella.  For less serious quality problems, such as different texture, different appearance,  problems with labels and small labelingmistakes, do we withdraw the party from  the warehouses and stores. As a total for 2010, the ICA Group withdrew 920 prod- ucts; ICA Norway, 57, ICA Sweden, 76, Rimi Baltic, 764 and non-food, 23, in stores and  warehouses.

All corporate brands are inspected to ensure that they meet these require- ments. The aim is also to offer a large variety of eco-labeled, organic and Fairtrade  products and to always apply environmental thinking when selecting products.  Healthier eating habits for everyone   Our goal is to be seen as a leader in inspiring people to eat healthy. This includes be- ing a source of inspiration for people with food intolerances, which is a growing cus- tomer group in our Nordic markets. We are already an industry leader in products  for allergy sufferers.  In 2010, we modernized our Swedish ICA Gott Liv line, which includes around 70  products with more fiber and less sugar, salt and fat compared to other brands. In  this work we use the official Nordic nutritional recommendations. Salt is a major is- sue, since studies show that a lower salt intake can help to prevent cardiovascular dis- ease and high blood pressure. We will use the keyhole criteria as a guide regarding the  question of salt. Another future challenge is satisfied consumers desire for fewer ad- ditives and less salt and sugar in their food without sacrificing taste and shelf life.   31 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social performance  PR Keyhole-labeled products  In 2009, the keyhole became a Nordic health symbol and is now used by the en- tire Nordic food retail industry. ICA Norway introduced the keyhole to Norwegian  consumers back in 2006. Through a series of activities and consistent information,  Norwegians were educated to buy healthier food and what the keyhole represents.  Thanks largely to ICA Norways efforts, there was widespread familiarity with the  keyhole in Norway at the time of the Norwegian launch.  Number and the sale of keyhole-labeled products in Sweden and Norway decreased  during 2010. Demand has declined partly because of the public debate on the addi- tives, and different diets. ICAs private label products that are labeled keyhole does  not diminish in sales in Sweden due to that ICA continued to label our products with  the keyhole while other suppliers removed the label. In 2010, ICAs annual Buddy with Your Body – 5 a Day campaign gave 30,000 el- ementary school students the opportunity to learn about fruit and vegetables and  why the body needs them. Around 800 ICA stores welcomed classes to discuss  health.  Encouraging children to eat healthy is also on the agenda in Estonia, where Rimi Bal- tic and health authorities support a campaign called Your Health Is in Your Hands.  - eat 5 handful fruit and vegetables in a day Rimi is also involved in Latvia in encour- aging students to eat right.

All recipes that we develop are adapted to make every day a  little easier for food allergy sufferers.  The allergy-free product range is constantly evolving and in 2010, the number of  products increased with nearly 50 products in both Sweden and Norway. Sales in  Sweden has increased by more than 50 percent since 2008 and in Norway, sales  are also positive. One explanation is our commitment to include these products in  price promotions and in Sweden they are included in the ICA cards personalized of- fers.

The  launch in the Baltic countries in 2010 has been received very positively. In Norway  and the Baltic countries, ICA I love Eco is seen as an economical organic alternative  and sells well despite that other organic sales have trended lower. ICA I Love Eco is  also a success in Sweden and accounts for a significant share of organic sales.  Products in the ICA I love Eco brand are certified according to the EUs organic crite- rias or according to KRAV rules in Sweden or Debio in Norway. Animal-based ingre- dients in ICA I love Eco-products must be approved according to KRAV in Sweden or  Debio in Norway, both of which place more stringent requirements on animal wel- fare than the EU.  ICA Swedens organic sales have more than doubled since 2007 and in 2010 it rose by  over five percent. The organic range continued to gain share of sales, partly to wid- en the range and in part because more customers are choosing organic. Baby food,  fresh spices, grains and tea are some of the commodity groups in which the organic  sales increased sharply in Sweden. In 2010, the number of organic items in our Swed- ish main assortment counted to 1,138 products, an increase of about 100 items com- pared to 2009. ICA Norways organic sales dropped by around four percent during 2010. This trend  is also seen for Fairtrade and keyhole-labeled products.

In 2010, a new packaging de- sign was introduced in Sweden for ICAs ethical private labels to make it easier for  customers to find them on the shelf and to spark interest in what the various labels  stand for. Rimi Baltic launched a few of its own Fairtrade-certified products in 2010.  ICA Sweden introduced a private label banana in 2010, certified by Rainforest Alli- ance and originating from selected plantations in Costa Rica and Ecuador. The first  shipments are being tested in early 2011.  The Swedish ICA store sales of Fairtrade certified products have continued to in- crease. Since 2008, sales growth has been more than 90 percent. In 2010, sales in- creased by approximately eight percent due to ICAs continued commitment to ex- pand and highlight the ethical marked range.  In Norway, sales of Fairtrade marked products decreased. Reduced demand for val- ue-added products have been identified for the industry as a whole in Norway so it  is important to continue to make clear what these products represent.

Many consumers find it  difficult to understand what E-numbers stand for and whether they are really neces- sary. Our position is that they should be used restrictively and only if they add value  for the consumer, e.g., by improving food safety. In accordance with current laws,  we clearly label all additives in the list of ingredients, so that customers can make in- formed decisions.  We are also working actively to limit the use of chemicals that could be hazardous  to humans and the environment. In our agreements, suppliers must pledge to com- ply with our chemical restrictions. We ensure that they do through samples and in- spections.  According to the European regulation on chemicals, REACH, we are required upon  request to inform customers whether specific products contain any substances that  could be classified as toxic. Our goal is not to sell any products containing such sub- stances.  In 2010, the subject of bisphenol-A in baby bottles and other products received a  lot of attention in Sweden. We had been discussing bisphenol with our suppliers of  these products for some time. In 2010, we phased out all baby bottles, cash regis- ter receipts, baby food jars and other baby products containing bisphenol from ICA  Swedens main assortment.  Our stance on animal welfare and GMOs Our products must be manufactured under fair conditions. Animals should not be  put at risk, and natural ingredients should not be altered without good reason. Prod- ucts sold by ICA should be traceable to when and where they were manufactured.  When it comes to fresh meat, we place stricter requirements on animal welfare than  the EU, and we refuse to sell Belgian Blue breed of cattle.  In the ICA I love eco line, all animal-based ingredients are KRAV-certified to ensure  that the animals are treated with respect. KRAVs requirements have been chosen  because they are stricter than the EUs organic rules on animal welfare. Our ICA Se- lection pork and free range beef are also a way to protect the well-being of animals.  ICA takes a fundamentally positive view of new technology that provides consum- ers with better products. For ethical and environmental reasons, however, ICA does  question the production and cultivation of genetically modified foods and seeds  that are not produced in a closed environment . Genetically modified foods (GMO)  and ingredients shall be kept separate and shall be traceable. Consumers are entitled  to information on whether a product comprises or contains ingredients with geneti- cally modified origins.  No such product has ever been or is part of our assortment. Decisions on whether  to include such products in the product range are taken by ICAs management.  36 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social performance  PR How we are perceived by the customers  PR5 reported PR5 reported We work systematically with internal and external surveys to communicate with  consumers and find out what they think about us and our products. In the Swedish Quality Index (SKI) for 2010, ICA maintained a leading position among  Swedish food retailers. The four Swedish formats all rank at the top against the com- petition. ICA Kvantum has the highest customer satisfaction among the formats.  Customer expectations are higher than in previous years, and all the major chains  have managed to live up to them in terms of perceived product quality. The gap is  slightly larger when it comes to service expectations. However, service quality has  improved since 2009 for all retail chains.  SKI measures and analyzes how actual customers and other users rate products and  services in Sweden. Its 2010 retail survey comprised 4,000 interviews. ICA Sweden  received a rating of 72.1 in 2010, compared to 70.6 in 2009. SKI also measures the opinions of bank customers, and in 2010 it showed that ICA  Banks customers are more satisfied in recent years. Measured by customer satis- faction, ICA Bank exceeds the industry average. The SKI bank survey for 2010 com- prised around 22,000 telephone interviews. The Customer Satisfaction Index survey is conducted annually. In the 2010 survey,  all four ICA store formats maintained a strong position in Sweden. ICA Kvantum and  ICA Maxi Hypermarket ranked at the top of their lists. The 2010 survey was based on  telephone interviews with 6,200 customers covering a number of questions.  In Latvias Brand Top, Rimi came in seventh on the list of the countrys most pop- ular brands presented by the ad agency DDB Latvija, the business magazine Kapital  and the research firm TNS Latvia. Rimi also placed eighth on the list of Latvian com- panies with the best reputations (Reputation Top 2010). The list was compiled for the  fourth consecutive year by the newspaper Diena in collaboration with the PR firm  Porter Novelli based on consumer and business opinions of 150 companies. 100,000 customer contacts in 2010 ICAs call centers are there to maintain contact with customers, stores and suppli- ers. In 2010, the volume of calls and e-mails from customers in Sweden and Norway  reached 100,000. The questions mainly concerned our products, specifically nutri- tional information, ingredients, packaging and origin.    Customer contacts through ICAs call centers   in Sweden and Norway 2010 2009 2008 Number of e-mails  52,181 50,431 51,448 Number of telephone calls 49,981 49,554 65,238  37 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social performance  PR Codes of market communication PR6 reported PR6 reported ICA stores are not permitted to sell tobacco, alcohol or lottery or gaming tickets to  underage customers in Sweden. We inspect independent Swedish retailers using  undercover purchases to verify that they comply with the law. ICA Swedens goal is  that stores will properly check IDs at least 85 percent of the time. In 2010, The total  outcome of the inspections buying pharmaceuticals, games, tobacco and beer un- dercover was 83 percent. Inspections are made from two to 24 times a year depend- ing on the format. Evidence shows that undercover purchases are producing good  results. They remind the staff to check IDs. Through continuous information and  training for store employees, we want to maintain a high level.  In Norway, all the stores are now hiding tobacco products according to a new law.  The ICA-retailers in Sweden are discussing a similar decision at a later point.  Since 2009 there was change in the Swedish pharmacy market, which meant that  the vast majority of ICA stores decided to sell certain non-prescription drugs. During  2010 ICA Sweden also opened 30 full-scale pharmacies under the name of ICA Cura  in a number of major ICA stores around the country. In rural areas, many ICA-stores  already has a history as pharmaceutical agents, and thus already offered drugs.  The new pharmacy market offer great opportunities but also challenges for us as a  food retailers. The Medical Products Agency (MPA) has strict requirements on how  the non-prescription drugs should be exposed to prevent them from falling into the  wrong hands. During 2010 MPA notified that ICA sold and advertised nicotine re- placement products without referring to it as a drug. Steps have been taken to en- sure that this does not happen again. We have an ongoing dialogue with MPA and  see the regulations as a good starting point for the stores to ensure customer safety. In general, our sponsorships support the Groups long-term business plan and em- phasize food and health, social responsibility, the environment and sustainable de- velopment. We commit in various ways and especially in Sweden and Norway we  prefer projects that target children and young adults. The sponsorship policy and  guidelines follows the principles of the International Code of Sponsorship.   38 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance LA We develop with   our employees ICA faces high expectations as an employer. In total, the Group  employs people in over 150 different professions and 500 different  positions, from systems developer to banker and pharmacist, from  Oslo in the west to Shanghai in the east. Every day we have to adapt  our operations based on our various businesses and local market  conditions.  We continuously utilize our policies and guidelines on diversity, gender equality and  training. An important part of this work comes from leadership and the connection  to ICAs Good Business values. By maintaining a consistent approach to leadership  within the Group, we put all our employees in a better position to help us reach our  business objectives and to enjoy their work.  About ICAs employees LA1 reported LA1 reported LA2 reported Global Compact 6 LA2 reported Global Compact 6   In the immediate years ahead, our biggest challenge will be to motivate and attract  the right employees for the long term. To achieve this and further strengthen the  ICA Groups employer brand, we took several measures in 2010. In cooperation with  the ICA School in each country, we are reinforcing core competencies in sales, prod- uct selection and logistics.  CEO Kenneth Bengtsson has initiated a network of young leaders to promote ex- changes within the Group and to raise the knowledge and understanding about the  ICA Group. The network has been in existence in various forms for several years and  since 2010 is called the ICA Group Network. In 2010, ICA Norway launched a Tal- ent Program, where employees with leadership abilities receive training to become  store managers. Rimi Baltic has a Management Trainee program since seven years.  A total of 38 employees  have graduated and today works in different managers po- sitions in stores and within the company. The program has given Rimi Baltic a good  pool for internal recruiting. In total, the ICA Group employs about 28 800 employees. In 2009, a reorganization  in Sweden was done in order to decentralize the organization.   39 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance LA In addition, we have created a Group-wide leadership development program to en- sure that future managerial needs are met and to call attention to opportunities for  personal development and careers within the Group. Staff turnover and staff numbers in Rimi Baltic has declined since 2009 since the  country was strongly influenced by the financial crisis, and was marked by rising un- employment. ICA Real Estate, a relatively small organization, where a minor change  in the number of employees turns out in a large percentage difference on staff turn- over. Wellness contributes to a good work  environment LA7 reported Global Compact 1 LA7 reported Global Compact 1 A good work environment is created when leaders join with their staff to make the  workplace safe and secure. To position the ICA Group as a healthy company, we  stress early rehabilitation and prevention of disease and accidents. This improves  the health of our employees and reduces rehabilitation costs.  The sick-leave within the ICA Group is quiet stable. ICA Norway has the highest ab- senteeism but working with preventive wellness during the last year has improved  the health among the employees during 2010.

Preventing accidents and creating safe environments  is obviously critical. In Sweden, Norway and the Baltic countries, employees receive  training in fire safety, first aid and how to prevent robberies and avoid threatening  situations. Preventive measures such as neighborhood watches together with other  retailers, authorities, municipalities and schools are also important.  In Sweden and Norway, the ICA Group is in the process of implementing a common  safety standard for stores and periodically conducts safety audits. The aim is to pre- vent internal and external criminality and create a safe and secure environment.  ICA Sweden is working in several ways to support ICA retailers. All employees have  the opportunity to enroll in an interactive online course on Store Safety free of  charge. In addition, it is recommended that all stores implement a 13-point program  to prevent threats, violence and robberies. ICA Sweden has also conducted insur- ance inspections to prevent damages from fires or break-ins. A coordination center  in Sweden provides resources and crisis support round-the-clock if an ICA store is  victimized by crime.  In 2010, there was a total of 47 robberies in Swedish ICA stores, an increase of about  eight percent from the previous year. Small stores were primarily victimized, and the  most common type of robbery, and attempted robbery, involved a cash register.

The goal is that all our employees will  receive a review once a year. According to the results of the Temperature Survey in  2010, 76 percent have had a review in the last twelve months.  To ensure that all our leaders have the same platform for performance management  and evaluation, a new leadership model was integrated into performance reviews in  2010.   Diversity and gender equality initiatives LA13 reported Global Compact 1, 6 LA13 reported Global Compact 1, 6   An active approach to diversity increases our attractiveness as an employer. Every- one, regardless of gender, age, sexual preference, religion, ethnic or national back- ground, or disability should have the same chance of being hired and developing on  the job. We condemn sexual harassment and discrimination in any form. One indica- tion of the importance we attach to this issue is that the ICA Group now have diver- sity manager. Since 2009, ICA Sweden and the Association of ICA-retailers have collaborated on a  project called We can do more, which offers a number of people with functional  disabilities the opportunity to work in ICA-stores and at ICAs offices and warehous- es. The other partners are Samhall and Swedens municipalities. The goal is that be- tween 500 and 1,000 people in total will be recruited during a three-year period. By  year-end 2010, the number was over 450. We can do more begun on the initiative  of the ICA Groups CEO inspired by the Glada Hudik Theater.  The idea to help the people with functional disabilities to join the workforce origi- nated in Rimi Baltic, which has been working to integrate employees for several  years. Today Rimi Baltic Estonia has around 35 employees with functional disabilities  in its stores and Rimi Lithuania count about 70.

We require our  suppliers to meet our expectations in terms of social responsibility  and labor conditions in production. The requirements are based on  the UNs declaration on human rights, UNICEFs Convention on the  Rights of the Child and the International Labour Organisations core  conventions.        Since 2008, the ICA Group is represented by ICA Global Sourcing  in Asia. With a local presence, we now have new opportunities to  build partnerships with our suppliers and audit that the production is  done in accordance with our requirements. Our goal is that every product we sell will be produced in an acceptable manner  with respect to human rights. We will not accept discrimination, infringements on  the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, child labor or other hu- man rights violations. This is clarified in our policy guidelines and in the contracts all  our suppliers must sign.  We monitor labor conditions in the factories that produce our corporate brand  products as well as products we import directly, e.g., generic non-food items called  no-names.  In addition to the UNs Global Compact, we support and follow other human rights  initiatives, such as the OECDs sustainability guidelines for multinational companies,  the International Chamber of Commerces (ICC) Business Charter for Sustainable De- velopment and the ICCs anti-corruption and anti-bribery principles.  Social audits lead to faster improvements HR2 reported Global Compact 1–6 HR2 reported Global Compact 1–6 To monitor and help suppliers that produce our corporate brands to meet our re- quirements, we conduct social, environmental and quality audits. In 2008 and 2009,  the ICA Group opened sourcing offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Ho Chi Minh  City, staffed by teams for product quality, environmental safety and social responsi- bility. Being close to our Asian suppliers gives us better insight and valuable experi- ence that helps these collaborations. After three years, our efforts have resulted in a  greater mutual understanding and better compliance with our social requirements.  The job of our auditors is to verify human rights compliance. They also work pre- ventively by reviewing our suppliers employment routines and discussing what they  can do, for example, to avoid hiring underage workers and improve work environ- ments. The ICA Group has its own control system, ICA Social Audit, whose require- ments are based on similar criterias as the Business Social Compliance Initiative  (BSCI).  The combination of our own inspections and third-party audits has successfully  sped up the often time-consuming process of obtaining an audit from a third party.  Through the ICA Social Audit, we can help suppliers to more quickly improve human  rights in their production.  43 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance HR Our supplier inspections are focused on countries that are considered to be a great- er risk of human rights violations. The countries are classified as high-risk based  on an analysis of the Human Development Index and the Economic Security In- dex, which are updated about every second year. We also inspect suppliers in other  countries when we see a risk of human rights violations. For example, berry suppli- ers in Sweden will be closely inspected in 2011. With the help of colleagues from Asia  who speak the right languages, we will conduct social audits during berry-picking  season in the Swedish woods. Approximately two thirds of the production units, factories, farms or warehouses,  located in high-risk countries and that makes ICAs own products were socially re- vised in late 2010. In late 2009, the corresponding share was around 50 percent.  In 2011, great attention should be paid to continue to pursue this work to achieve the  goal of 100 percent of ICAs corporate brand suppliers in high-risk countries should  be socially revised.   See page 34 in the ICA Groups Annual Report regarding   where in the world our corporate brands are produced.  Share of socially audited corporate brand suppliers  % 2010 2009 Total ICA Group 68 47   Increased knowledge increase understanding   Providing our employees with training on social responsibility guidelines and rou- tines is an important measure. Internal training is offered on a continuous basis to  the organization responsible for the product assortment and sourcing.   Sharing our knowledge with suppliers is critical to improvement efforts. During the  year, we arranged a seminar on social responsibility in Shanghai. Several of our sup- pliers have also participated in four seminars arranged by the Business Social Com- pliance Initiative (BSCI). We use ICA Social Audit as a training tool as well, since sup- pliers receive support on how to rectify every violation we detect.  All employees of the Group receive training in ICAs Good Business and related poli- cies, through a web-based courses. The aim is that all ICA employees in Sweden and  Norway will complete the course. In 2010 22 percent have done so.   Stakeholder dialogue on social responsibility In November 2010, ICA Sweden invited its key stakeholders to a dialogue to discuss  sustainable development and working conditions for producers of fruit and vegeta- bles. This follows several controversial documentary films on banana and pineapple  plantations. The dialogue resulted in a concrete 10-point list of measures and activi- ties to sustain the progress that has been made on ethical and sustainability issues  affecting fruit and vegetables. Among the points are: Improve and increase information in stores and in the ICA Groups annual report  	 to emphasize improvement work. Bring up positive, concrete examples when communicating the social responsibil- 	 ity work being done in the supply chain. Clarify the ICA Groups long-term goals in terms of organic and Fairtrade labeling. 	 Focus on building capacity building rather than just inspections. 	  44 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance HR Human rights measures  HR4 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 6 HR4 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 6 HR5 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 3 HR5 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 3 HR6 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 5 HR6 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 5 HR7 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 4 HR7 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 4 We regularly buy goods from suppliers in countries where human rights are not tak- en for granted. If ICAs own auditors or third-party auditors detect violations at a  production facility we use, a concrete action plan is established and followed up in a  re-audit. The first time a supplier violates our contractual requirements, they gener- ally get a second chance to correct the problem. If they do so to our satisfaction, we  will keep working with them. If a serious offense is repeated, the cooperation with  the supplier will be terminated. In social audits conducted with our own personnel in Asia during the year we identi- fied a number of shortcomings among our suppliers. These are mainly concentrated  in five areas: 	health	and	security  	management	routines  	overtime	hours  	the	possibility	for	employees	to	join	trade	unions  	minimum	wage In twelve cases, the auditors identified serious violations in production locations  that we chose to stop buying products from them. On the other hand, several sup- pliers have received larger orders after they demonstrated positive results and im- proved working condistions in their production.    It is very important for ICA also to work with enforce and respect the fundamen- tal right for its own employees. Based on the analysis of high risk countries it is seen  that the risk of not respecting human rights is larger in some of the countries where  our products is produced and therefore the report of our work within this area is fo- cused within this area. During the year no incident regarding discrimination came to  the managements attention. Our stance on child labor  Our basic rule when it comes to child labor is that individuals younger than 15 may  not work for any of our suppliers. If national laws have stricter limits, we apply them.  In China, for example, the legal working age is 16, so there we do not allow employ- ees below this age. We also require our suppliers to give special consideration to  young workers (younger than 18) in terms of the right to limited working hours, for  example.  If we detect or suspect that an employee is not of legal age, the supplier is obligated,  through ICAs contract, to take measures to protect the best interests of that person.  Together with the supplier, we try to find the best possible solution in light of the  childs age, education and social situation.  45 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance SO ICA – part of the community  We want to be seen as a positive force in society. A strong local  presence is essential to this work. We therefore participate  continuously in debates and outside initiatives, in addition to  sponsoring and supporting various local projects in all our markets.  Guidelines for relationships with our suppliers and partners are contained in a busi- ness ethics policy. ICAs new store policy contains the fundamental guidelines on  how and where new stores are opened. Our sponsorship policy explains how we re- sponsibly manage sponsorships. A retail network in balance with local needs SO1 reported SO1 reported ICA contributes to the community in several ways. We work with municipalities, re- gions and authorities in connection with new store openings. In Sweden, there is a  connection through local ICA retailers, who own their stores and live and work in  the local area.  ICA is constantly refining the retail network it has built up over more than 90 years,  so that it remains sustainable and attractive. This means considering the local envi- ronment when deciding where to open new stores. We also try to balance customer  needs with transports to and from stores in a way that benefits the local communi- ty. For example, new stores are given priority along existing thoroughfares to avoid  increasing traffic and allow customers to get to the store on bike paths or walkways  or by using mass transit.  ICAs also tries to maintain clear-cut rules on new stores with effective decision-mak- ing channels that emphasize the autonomy of local municipalities. ICAs dialogue  and strong local connections with decision-makers, local businesses and interest  groups are important to the development of the retail network. Strong business ethics provide a foundation  SO2 reported Global Compact 10 SO2 reported Global Compact 10 SO3 reported Global Compact 10 SO3 reported Global Compact 10   ICA works systematically to prevent ethically questionable incidents and corruption.  Business ethics are covered in the ICA Groups overarching risk analysis, where every  area of operations has been analyzed.   46 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance SO Rimi Baltic in Lithuania has joined Baltoji Banga (The White Wave), an organization  promoting transparency in the local business community and fighting economic  crime. Member-companies pledge to follow specific guidelines. Rimi Baltic is a mem- ber of the organizations board of directors. The Groups business ethics policy is based on the assumption that the ICA Group  must be managed profitably and with high ethical standards. This includes how  managers and employees behave on a daily basis and in contacts with suppliers,  competitors and other parties. All employees of the Group receive training in ICAs  Good Business and related policies, including through web-based courses.  Engagement in societys decision-making  processes  SO5 reported Global Compact 1–10 SO5 reported Global Compact 1–10 The ICA Group cooperates with organizations and participates in networks focused  on social responsibility, the environment, health and food quality. Our most impor- tant partners and commitments include: We signed the UN Global Compact in 2004 and Caring for Climate in 2007. ICA has  	 also pledged to follow the European Consumer Goods Forums sustainability pro- gram. ICAs CEO is a member of its board.  ICA Norway participates in a CR network organized by the Federation of Norwe- 	 gian Commercial and Service Enterprises, HSH, where experience in the CR area  is shared with others in the retail community. In 2010 ICA Norway participated  in HSHs lobbying efforts to maintain the current law mandating temperature re- quirements for chop meat in stores. In Sweden, a similar organization, Svensk Da- gligvaruhandel, is working to protect the interests of consumers. ICA Norway participates in a network arranged by the Norwegian-Swedish Cham- 	 ber of Commerce to strengthen relationships between Scandinavia and the Bal- kan region. ICA has, among other things, hosted a network meeting on taking re- sponsibility. Rimi Baltic in Lithuania has supported local farmers in their discussions with the  	 Ministry of Agriculture to improve conditions for small businesses and has partici- pated in discussions with the Ministry of Economy on making electronic invoices  a mandatory business practice.

Annual Report appendix  www.ICA.se/AnnualReports  49 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Limited assurance report Auditors Review Report on   ICA ABs Sustainability Report This is the translation of the auditors report in Swedish To the readers of ICA ABs Sustainability Report Introduction We have been engaged by the executive team of ICA AB to review the ICA AB Sus- tainability Report for the year 2010. Our review is limited to the information related  to 2010. Our review covers the ICA Groups Annual Report pages 10–11 and pages 21– 39, and the ICA Groups GRI report 2010 disclosed on ICA ABs website www.ICA.se/ AnnualReports. The Board of Directors and the Executive Management are respon- sible for ongoing activities regarding the environment, health & safety, quality, social  responsibility and sustainable development, and for the preparation and presenta- tion of the Sustainability Report in accordance with the applicable criteria. Our re- sponsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Report based on our re- view. The Scope of the Review We have performed our review in accordance with RevR 6 Assurance of Sustainabil- ity Reports issued by Far. A review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons  responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, and applying analyti- cal and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit  conducted in accordance with IAASBs Standards on Auditing and Quality Control  and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. The procedures per- formed consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become  aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we  do not express an audit opinion. The criteria on which our review are based are the parts of the Sustainability Report- ing Guidelines G3, published by The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which are appli- cable to the Sustainability Report, as well as the accounting and calculation princi- ples that the Company has developed and disclosed. These criteria are presented on  pages 2 and 12–14 in the ICA Groups GRI report 2010. We consider these criteria suit- able for the preparation of the Sustainability Report.  50 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Limited assurance report Our review has, based on an assessment of materiality and risk, e.g. included the fol- lowing procedures: a.  an update of our knowledge and understanding for ICA ABs organization and ac- tivities b.  assessment of suitability and application of criteria in respect to stakeholders  need of information  c. assessment of the result of the companys stakeholder dialogue   d.  interviews with responsible management, at group level, subsidiary level and at  selected business units with the aim to assess if the qualitative and quantitative  information stated in the sustainability report is complete, correct and sufficient    e.  read internal and external documents to assess if the information stated in the  sustainability report is complete, correct and sufficient        f. analytical review of reported information g.  assessment of the companys stated application level according to GRIs guide- lines  h.  overall impression of the sustainability report, and its format, considering the in- formations mutual correctness with applicable criteria i.  reconciliation of the reviewed information against the sustainability information  in the companys annual report for 2010. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe  that the information in the ICA Groups Annual Report pages 10-11 and pages 21-39,  and the ICA Groups GRI report 2010 has not, in all material respects, been prepared  in accordance with the abovestated criteria.
