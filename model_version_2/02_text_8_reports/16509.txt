The path to sustainability is a commitment that we intend to  honour and that we will be glad to walk with you showing you  that, in addition to the objectivity and cold numbers that identify  our economic, environmental and social performance, we also  want to continue to be an active part in building a more inclusive,  responsible and environmentally balanced society. it was an exciting step, We faced moments of strong socio-economic constraints, of  great evolution in the area of the information and communication  technologies and huge challenges related to reconciling these  facts, with ethics in relationships, environmental preservation and  social responsibility. We updated our Code of Ethics and involved the entire value  chain in the implementation of the principles advocated. The  issues related to human and labour rights, including equality of  opportunities and gender, were further specified in this last  review, conducted between 2009 and 2010. With the evolution of the sector and, consequently, of consumption  habits, we started to look at technology not as an end but as a  means to achieve it. We tried to always adjust our activity to  improve quality of life for people, business for companies as well as  environmental balance. We changed the organizational logic of  the company to put it at the service of the interests of different  customer profiles and strategic objectives to which we are  committed. We made structuring investments in terms of next  generation networks - Fibre-to-the-Home - and broadband,  believing that we laid the foundations for a new way to interact,  communicate and work over the next 100 years.  PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 13 We changed the paradigm: we invested and innovated Over these three years, we invested significantly in what we believe are the competitive advantages that will  ensure sustainability in the future:  investment Throughout the 2009-2011, our investment was over Euro 2 billion in Portugal, which represented about 22%  of our revenues, and an unequalled investment cycle in telecommunications in Portugal and in Europe. infrastructures We built a fibre network to the home (FTTH) covering 1.6 million homes. This is one of the best and most  advanced fibre-optic infrastructures in Europe and in the world, which was recognized in February 2011 by the  FTTH Council as the best in Europe. This investment allows us to develop and deliver new services and features  to the market and thus secure a commercial offering, which is both more environmentally friendly and socially  responsible. We also pioneered in Portugal the launch of LTE - Long Term Evolution - the fourth mobile generation and have  an ambitious investment program, which guarantees not only the largest nationwide coverage as well as an  innovative and pioneering offer that enables traffic sharing between two devices. We are also building a new data centre that will not only become one of the largest in Europe, but also an  example of sustainability. It will be located in an interior area of the country where it will create new jobs and  will be air-conditioned and powered mainly by wind and photovoltaic energy. It is estimated that this new data  centre, compared to the current ones, will reduce its energy dependence by about 40%. innovation, Research & development With the conviction that innovation is and will be the main factor of market differentiation and future  sustainability, we reoriented our organization towards a culture of innovation and research & development. We  have created a program - OPEN - in which all employees are invited to participate and provide solutions based  on empirical, scientific knowledge and also the fruit of learning and sharing with all our partners - suppliers,  customers and universities. This reorientation has earned the recognition by the European Commission, that PT  is the company that invests most in R&D in the country. More environmentally and socially responsible value chain Together with our suppliers and partners, we began the development and commercialization of ICT services  and solutions that induce positive impacts on the environment and society. Home automation, remote  monitoring, virtual storage and management of data, pricing plans tailored to all customer profiles, less energy  dependence of equipment, as well as platforms and guidelines on the proper use of the new ICT related  features are the genesis of the reorientation of our commercial offering. We paid special attention to the areas related to education, health and safety.  14 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 ceo stateMent  safe ict use The issues related to data security and protection, both for persons and businesses, were also the object of  special and increased attention during this three-year period. We prepared, adopted, and extended to our  value chain an Information Security Policy adapted to all information and communication systems and  technologies. Additionally, the safe and proper use of information technologies by the young was also a priority. We prepared  a national awareness program â€“ Communicating Safely - which we released and implemented in the national  school community, and provided guidelines for use and parental control on our websites. With these initiatives,  we believe that we are contributing to the dignity of the use of services and content associated with it. digital inclusion and literacy We all recognize that digital inclusion and literacy have shown to be key pillars in fostering new socio-professional  opportunities, and consequently, in the progress of the economy and a more responsible citizenship. The widespread use of information technologies, the increasing diversity of provision of broadband solutions and  services and the programs of support to the community, in particular, the groups of citizens with special needs  continue to be the focus of the social responsibility initiatives in which we believe and engage more and more. international participations This was also a three-year period marked by the acquisition of Vivo by Telefnica and the establishment of a  new strategic partnership with Oi. This partnership, supported on the acquisition of a controlling stake of 25.6%  achieved in March 2011, will allow PT to maintain a prominent position in the Brazilian telecommunications  market and benefit from its high growth potential. At Oi, together with our partners and the local management team, we are focused on sharing knowledge,  experience and technological innovation, hoping thus to contribute positively to the challenges that we will  face and to continue to leverage the sustainability of the respective activities and stakeholders who participate,  directly or indirectly. We have been recognized, we are grateful and want to strengthen our confidence This three-year period was especially gratifying for PT. It is always with great satisfaction and a feeling of  increased responsibility that we see our commitment and results being recognized by several national and  international external entities. After a detailed and thorough assessment, conducted by the SAM Group, the sustainable performance of PT  was recognized, so we were included in 2010 in the most renowned sustainability index at international level,  the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). This recognition continued in 2011 so PT became one of five  companies in the industry worldwide to be part of this index.  PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 15 At this time, PT is the only Portuguese company in the sector included in the main international indexes and  rankings of sustainable investments, which include: DJSI, FTSE4Good, ETHIBEL Excellence, Global ESG Leaders  Index and ECPI Ethical Index. We are also regarded as one of the 500 most valuable brands in the world, according to an evaluation by Brand  Finance. At national level, we ranked in the top 10 in the Engagement Rating Portugal 2011. Also, our customers, suppliers and employees recognized the strategy followed and expressed this appreciation  through assessment studies conducted by external and independent parties. These awards, in addition to being a strong source of pride for all of us, are also an excellent incentive to  reinforce our commitment to the sustainability strategy assumed and that we want to remain part of the daily  management of the company. This Report, now in its eighth edition, aims to be a space of reflection, transparency and sharing of the impacts  of our activity on the economy, environment and society. We have had the ambition to do better each year and  to increasingly meet the expectations of our readers. So I would like once again to express my thanks to all those who have participated in the challenges that we  face and to share the summary of the progress and results achieved over the last three years, and in particular  in 2011, by publishing this Report, prepared in accordance with the most demanding level guidelines of the  Global Reporting Initiative and AA1000. We will continue to invest in the future: Portugal, the Portuguese and  society in general. Count on us, we will continue to count on you.

In 2011, operating revenues increased 65%  over 2009, driven by the growth of operating revenues in these markets and the acquisition of Oi in  Brazil. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) benefited from an increase  of 41% compared to 2009, justified by the integration of Oi and Contax.

These factors  are also increasingly determinant factors in the decision-making of citizens, customers or investors with  regard to their options in purchasing and use of their capital. PT took over with a commitment to creating shareholder value by ensuring a sound economic and  financial performance today and tomorrow. To this end, management has maintained a determined and  voluntary attitude that aimed to achieve the best possible balance between the legitimate desire to  generate profit and ethics and respect for environmental preservation and the community where it  operates. The level of achievement of this balance has been a fundamental pillar of strength in business  and worth sharing with shareholders and other stakeholders. Business ethics and the creation of shareholder value incorporate the following pillars: Environmental pillar Social pillar  Economic pillar Sustainability in business management Social responsability and company citizenship To generate simultaneously growth with proft, social progress and environmental quality The information and communication technologies are increasingly a powerful resource to bring people  closer together, to dematerialise the everyday, and help improve the lives of everyone.

Managing Risks and oPPoRtunities PT has a system for identifying, evaluating and managing risks and opportunities that may affect their  operations and implementation of the plan and strategic objectives set by the Board. This system is  based on a model of integrated and cross-cutting management that aims to ensure the implementation  of good corporate governance and transparency in communication with the market and shareholders. As a structured and systematic approach, risk management is integrated with PTs strategic planning  and operational management process, with the commitment of all employees in the identification,  reporting and implementation of measures and behaviours of risk mitigation and / or leveraging of  opportunities. The Risk and Opportunity Management is sponsored by the Executive Committee in conjunction with  the management teams of the various businesses units, nationally and internationally. The functions of Internal Audit and Risk Management, reporting hierarchically to the CEO and CFO, and  functionally to the Audit Committee, support PTs Executive Committee in implementing the system of  risk management and ongoing assessment of the risk management procedures in place in order to  ensure the following objectives: I. Implement of a corporate model of risk management in line with the strategic objectives of the  PT Group; II. Identification and analysis of the major risks to which PT and their subsidiaries are exposed  within the development and continuation of their activity; III. Identification and analysis of the major risk factors and events that can significantly affect the  normal operation of PT and their subsidiaries in the following areas: 	 Impact 	 Probability	of	occurrence; 	 Level	of	control	associated	and	responsiveness	in	crisis	situations; 	 Speed	at	which	the	risk	or	event	may	materialize; 	 Identification	of	improvements	in	the	control	and	monitoring	of	mitigation	plans	associated	with	 critical risk factors; IV.  Improving the quality of information that supports the decision-making process; V. Communication of the results of the risk management model and execution of alerts in case of  occurrence or identification of new critical risks. It is also worth noting that the entire process is monitored and supervised by the Audit Committee,  independent supervisory body composed of independent non-executive members. Within the  competence of this body with regard to monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management system,  the following tasks stand out: I. Oversee the adoption of principles and policies for the identification and management of major  risks of a financial and operational nature, or other relevant risks associated with the activity of  the PT Group or measures to monitor, control and report such risks; II. Annually review the internal procedures related to issues of risk detection and safeguarding the  assets of the Company; III. Supervise the analysis, revision and implementation of measures and plans in order to monitor,  improve and / or correct the internal control system and measures and plans proposed in the  context of the risk management systems of the Company.  36 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 ii. Managing With ethics and ResPonsibility  |  sustainability stRategy The Risk Management process implemented at PT is based on an internationally recognized methodology  - COSO II, developed by the Committee of Sponsorship Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This  approach relies on the identification and analysis of key value drivers and uncertainty factors that may  affect value creation, compliance with the plan and set strategic objectives PRocess of Risks and oPPoRtunities ManageMent Considering the need for clear mechanisms for assessing and managing risks that may affect the  business, the following components are defined in the implementation of the process:   risk dictionary to ensure the description, in a clear and objective form, of a common risk  language to be used not only internally but also in the various disclosures made to the market  on this subject;   risk Management methodology that formalizes the processes and procedures for identifica- tion, analysis, mitigation and reporting of relevant risks;   Centralized repository of all information associated with each relevant risk, simplifying the  analysis of correlation between the various risk factors recorded, as well as the prioritization of  the response and identification of synergies between the various initiatives to mitigate the risks. Note that the model set also fits the goals of corporate sustainability classified as strategic for the PT  Group, the object of analysis and benchmarking with the best practices in the industry by the Dow  Jones Sustainability Index.  Risk dictionary The Risk Dictionary allows cataloguing the risk factors that, in genera l, may affect PT and their subsidiaries,  thus contributing to a common and company-wide risk language. However, this dictionary is not  intended to be deterministic, since new risks can be identified, being updated in a systematic and  whenever necessary. This component of the risk management process is structured into three major categories of risk,  depending on their nature:  environment risks: Correspond to the risks dependent on external forces to the PT Group and  their subsidiaries, and may affect their performance, strategy, operations and organization. By  nature, the origins of the environment risks imply an adequate anticipation of the associated  impacts, and timely identification of the realization of the associated risk factors, as well as miti- gation strategies in case of crisis;  risks related to the business processes inside the PT Group: The risks of the processes result  from and are inherent to the business activities and internal processes, and management can  ensure control of the same at their origin, in a preventive way.  Risk of information for decision making: Is related to the information available, produced by  the PT Group and their subsidiaries, which will serve as a basis for the decisions to be taken by  management. These risks are segmented into risks for operational, financial and strategic decision  making. The risk of information for decision making are related to how the organization produces  and manages the information needed to manage their business and for disclosure to their  shareholders, investors and other stakeholders.

Following this analysis, the relevant risks were ranked for analysis and detailed assessment, involving 31  departments / operational areas responsible for managing these risks in order to identify the events and  factors that may affect the operations and activities of the PT Group as well as processes and control  mechanisms associated with them. For the 233 risk factors identified, the impact was measured as well as the likelihood of each risk factor  and, depending on the level of exposure or residual risks, a strategy for responding to risk was defined  namely: i) reduce the risk by implementing controls that reduce the likelihood of a risk or its impact if it  materializes; ii) accept the risk in situations where the residual risk is acceptable and the implementation of  additional controls have a cost higher than the expected benefits; iii) share the risk, reducing exposure of the PT Group through its total or partial transfer to other  entities, using insurances, derivatives or joint ventures; iv) avoid the risk, leaving the activity or processes that generate the risk (e.g. leaving a geographical  area or alienate a business). It should be noted that the implementation of the mitigation measures planned for 2011 were examined  and it was observed that all situations classified as priority in terms of risk mitigation were implemented  timely. centralized Risk Registry The implementation of a centralized repository of all information associated with each relevant risk for  the PT Group is critical for proper analysis and prioritization of response actions to the relevant risks. The  risk registry currently deployed associates to each risk:  Risk factors that, if materialized, could affect the PT Group in a relevant way;  Strategic objectives potentially affected;  Existing structures, procedures and control indicators to monitor and mitigate the risk factors;  Qualitative evaluation of the control and residual risk associated with each risk factor;  Quantitative assessment of the impact, likelihood and speed at which the risk factor can come  about;  Plans for improvement or response to critical risks. In 2012, the implementation of a new online tool for risk registration will be completed, which will create  new synergies, increase the scope of the review and streamline the process of identifying, evaluating  and updating the respective level of criticality and control.  40 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 ii. Managing With ethics and ResPonsibility  |  sustainability stRategy All the identified risks are usually detailed in the Annual Report and Governance Report. Here we will  highlight non-financial risks associated with corporate sustainability and that were subject to monitoring  during the last three years:  Risk factors Risk Management innovation  and  technology Given the history of rapid technological change in the  sector of activity of the Group, PT is at risk of failing to  leverage technological advances and developments  in its business model in order to obtain or maintain  competitive advantage. Major risk factors associated with innovation:  Incorrect identification of new technologies  Inadequate time to market in adopting new  technologies  Immaturity of technical solutions adopted  Levels of quality of service inadequate for market  expectations  Adopting inoperable solutions   Insufficient information on market trends  Not identifying opportunities to increase  operational efficiency  Not entering market trends into the business plan. The PT Group is historically one of the Portuguese  companies with more investment in research and  development (R&d). In this area, the PT Group holds  strategic assets that allow ensuring the realization  of innovative projects, which include:  PT Inovao: Company directed to the  technological development of the Groups  business, in terms of applied research,  engineering services and development of  innovative solutions and services, either in the  domestic or international markets.  OPEN Program for development and innovation:  aims at the implementation of systematic  practices of research and information  processing, with the involvement of the entire  organization for the realization of innovative  projects.  Strategic planning of the network infrastructure  and rollout of new technologies, involving the  preparation of reports and periodic  development reviews, standardization and  adoption of new technologies by the industry,  including obtaining international benchmarks.  Strategic partnerships with suppliers in terms of  technology, equipment and contents.  PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 41  Risk factors Risk Management capacity of  the   infrastructure  for continued  services  provision The ability and availability of network infrastructures  are fundamental aspects for PT to ensure continuity of  critical operations in terms of service, within the para- meters of high quality in order not only to satisfy their  customers, but also to fulfill requirements of the  regulator. For this, PT has identified this risk not only regarding  the availability of infrastructure, but also at the level of  the increased capacity of the same, in order to support  new product and service offerings to the customers,  and contribute to the development of the Information  Society in Portugal and the countries where it  operates. In this context, we highlight the following risk factors:  Lack of plans for responding to catastrophic events  or crisis  No letters of risk or weaknesses in the identification  of single points of failure  Lack of redundancy in critical components of the  infrastructure  Saturation of the infrastructure available in the  absence of plans of development or upgrade  Inadequate planning, management and monitoring  of available capacity  Obsolescence of infrastructure or weaknesses in  maintenance procedures In this context, the following actions are performed  for risk monitoring and mitigation:  Securitization of core telecommunications  network  Development of risk diagnoses for the various  technology platforms, identifying dependencies  and single points of failure;  Definition of service resumption and faults repair  plans;  Implementation of systems and processes to  ensure the levels of qoS (quality of Service) and  qoE (quality of Experience End user) defined;  Investment in next-generation networks and  preventive maintenance actions;  Investment in information systems to support  the activity of the technical teams. In February 2010, following the storm that occurred  on the island of Madeira, the resilience of PTs  network infrastructures and reaction to natural  disasters was put to the test. note that the torren- tial rains, floods and landslides weakened or  destroyed a significant part of the critical infras- tructure of the island, among which the  telecommunications infrastructure. This situation  has triggered the crisis plan and the human and  technical resources needed to quickly restore the  normal fixed, mobile, satellite and submarine  communications of the Autonomous Region of  Madeira were made available. This task force  enabled to quickly recover 85% of the mobile and  fixed communications on the island and a more  effective intervention of the authorities and civil  protection, thereby mitigating the isolation and  the impacts of the disaster on the population. It should also be stressed that in 2011 the depart- ment of business Continuity was created, in order  to assure, in a more efficient and effective way, that  processes and resiliency operations that support  the Core Services of the PT Group, in case of  incidents and disasters in the following aspects:   Prevention: Preparation of response to reduce  the impact of incidents in critical processes that  support services;  	 Response	and	Recovery:	Supported by business  continuity and disaster Recover plans to speed  up recovery of critical processes.  42 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 ii. Managing With ethics and ResPonsibility  |  sustainability stRategy sco  Risk factors Risk Management environmental The pursuit of an appropriate environmental policy  has been a concern of PT, in order to reduce the  companys exposure to environmental damage that  can substantiate as: (i) liability to third parties for  property damage, (ii) liability to governments or third  parties for waste removal costs plus any compensation. Main factors associated with environmental risk  management  Rationalization of energy consumption and GHG  emissions;  Inadequate control of waste;  Inadequate control of electromagnetic radiation  and noise;  Inadequate internal awareness level of  rationalization of resource consumption;  Incorrect assessment of negative impacts on  landscape;  Acquisition of products and services outside the EU  (in countries that do not comply with Community  rules on the environment);  Failure to comply with applicable law. In this context, PT has increased rationalization in  environmental management, ensuring the certifi- cation of associated systems in accordance with  ISO 14001 and a progressively more adequate offer  to the market. Environmental management policies and systems  focus on the following monitoring areas:   Consumption of resources;  Resources used;  Waste production and forwarding;  Air emissions;  Noise and electromagnetic fields;  Sustainable model for selection and contracting  of suppliers;  Acquisition of equipment for less energy  dependence;  Use of alternative energy  Creation of a task force to address the  optimization of energy efficiency and to  enhance a more environmentally friendly  commercial offer; Importantly, also, management models are subject  to periodic audits, internal and external, and there  is as well an ongoing assessment of impacts and  improvements to be implemented. Relationship with  stakeholders The risk of breach of trust of stakeholders, by lack of  fulfilment of the expectations created or otherwise,  with consequent impacts on their relationship with PT:  Customers  Suppliers  Employees  Analysts  Society In this context, the company develops actions with a  view to the involvement of their stakeholders, including:  Consultation with stakeholders;  Communication channels available 24 hours;  Customers: monitoring the level of customer  satisfaction and performance in customer  service, respect for customer privacy, security  and protection in relation to content;  Suppliers: ethical principles and practices of  social responsibility in the selection and  contracting of suppliers;  Employees: attracting and retaining talent;  occupational safety and health policies; internal  social responsibility program;   Analysts: to ensure adequate communication  with the market;  Society: actions to promote inclusion and digital  literacy, development of telemedicine solutions,  support for patronage and promotion of  volunteering.  PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 43  Risk factors Risk Management ethics in  business and  relationships The Code of Ethics of PT together with the relevant  national, European and American legislation are the  main guides of conduct adopted at PT, whose risk  factors identified regard:  Failure to comply with one or some of the aspects  included in the Code of Ethics, internal policies and  /or regulations;  The reputation and / or activity of the company be  affected by violations of the Code Ethics or  regulations adopted. Ethics at PT is monitored through:  Internal instruments of assessment of employees  and suppliers;  Confidential and anonymous communication  channels, offered by the company for  whistleblowing;  Dialogue with stakeholders to identify weaknesses;  Internal and external audits to the published  information to ensure greater rigour and  transparency. 2. coMMitMents and stRategic diRections foR the  futuRe The reasons which in recent years have ensured our success no longer suffice. The context in which we  live is adverse and economic and social crisis is widespread. Therefore, PT wants to continue to make  each of them an opportunity and once again set a course to continue to ensure a sustainable future. We want to be an active part in building a more balanced and happier world Our main commitment is to grow the business, helping to enhance our shareholders and the society in  which we operate. Even though we are experiencing difficult times and the world around us is  undergoing major changes, we still want to be an active part in the construction of a change for the  better and continue to deserve the confidence of all. We believe that effective and sustainable business management has been the support of our leadership,  the ability to invest in the future, to innovate and meet the expectations of our stakeholders. We also  believe that this capability is a competitive advantage that differentiates us and inspires us every day, a  greater responsibility. It is therefore essential to identify very ambitious goals for the future both in terms of business growth,  customers, employment, human rights, innovation, energy efficiency and social responsibility, and in  terms of attitude and conduct with which we shall guide this activity. Therefore, we wish to assume and share the commitments and strategic directions that will guide our  work: 1. ethics  The relationship of trust with all stakeholders should be maintained and encouraged by the continued  willingness to interact and meet the expectations of all.  44 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 ii.

These are principles relating to business ethics, compliance and environmental protection, human and  labour rights, anti-corruption and social inclusion instruments. The adoption of these principles is an  ongoing challenge, requiring a systematic identification of areas for improvement in aspects of the  groups business and their relationship with society, the promotion and adoption of improvements and  their subsequent monitoring. chaRteRs subscRibed and/ oR PRinciPles folloWed inteRnational euRoPean national  10 Principles of the Un  Global Compact  Universal Declaration of  human Rights  Recommendations of the  International Labour  Organisation  Charter of Social  Responsibility of Union  network International  Childrens rights and  enterprise principles of UnGC   Environmental and  Sustainability Charter of ETnO  Lisbon Strategy  European Road Safety Charter  Code of Conduct on Energy  Efficiency of the European  Union  European Code of Best Practices  for Women and ICT  Recommendations of the  business Council for Sustainable  development of Portugal  Code of Good Practice on  Commercial Communications to  Minors (APAn)  Charter of Commitments on  Responsible Communication of  the Portuguese Association of  Advertisers The issues on the agenda of these organizations deserve not only the active participation of PT in their  discussion, study and promotion, but they are also evaluated and interpreted by the companys  Sustainability Committee.

Rigour, honesty, integrity, transparency, correctness of information, anti-corruption, equal opportunities,  non-discrimination, environmental and health protection, and social responsibility are the main points  that link the performance of PT to society, beyond the overall alignment with applicable legislation in  force at national, European and American level. The adopted policies aim at guiding the attitude and behaviour of the entire value chain of the company,  leveraging the mobilization and participation of all beyond what is defined in the Codes of Conduct and  the contractual terms established. The Codes of Conduct and policies adopted are published and can be found on PTs website and  corporate intranet and all employees and suppliers are subject to training and/or awareness-raising  actions on their content and impact.

The sharing of these codes with society in general, reflects and helps to consolidate the strength and  alignment of values between PT and remaining audiences with whom they interact.  50 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 ii. The Sustainability Committee, part of the governance model, promotes the adoption of principles,  codes of conduct and use of communication channels among employees and in the relationship  between them and other stakeholders, encouraging a culture of dialogue, avoiding conflicts of interest  and providing anticorruption mechanisms. In this sense, PT does not develop any lobbying activity and/ or contribute monetarily to organizations that do not fit in their business management or their  sponsorship, philanthropy and patronage policies. 3.3. WhistlebloWing and alignMent MonitoRing To better identify and monitor compliance with its codes and alignment of its principles, the PT  companies in Portugal have certified information and management systems according to international  standards ISO 9001 (quality), ISO 14001 (environment), OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety),  and are completing the preparation of the necessary steps to realize the self-declaration of the newly  created ISO 26000 (Corporate Social Responsibility), which will happen during the three-year period  now begun. All employees participate in stock-raising and receive training on codes of conduct and policies adopted  and, in particular on issues related to discrimination and corruption. All codes, policies and procedures  are available on the intranet and the companys corporate website. Any violation to the Codes of Conduct, internal regulations or legislation will be identified and confirmed,  is likely to involve determining the liability of offenders under the terms and legal rules applicable to the  situation. These situations can be identified within the daily activity of the company or by complaint through  channels specifically created and made available online. These communication channels are confidential  and, if the complainant so requests, they are also anonymous. violations to the code of ethics   violations to the Code of Ethics  8 employees Zero Tolerance  8 terminations due to disciplinary procedures For anyone who has evidence of some kind of irregularity in relation to the codes and principles laid  down, PT provides tools for the complaint to guarantee the confidentiality and anonymity of the content  and its author. Enhancing the transparency of management, provided by various internal control systems - which, in  turn, are audited by external and independent companies and organizations - a System for Qualified  Communication of Undue Practices, internationally known as whistleblowing, was adopted, whose  guidelines and procedures are as follows: Communicate by electronic message, in encrypted channel, an occurrence or reasonable suspicion  based on verification of facts, by the person who knows or has reason to believe that there is consistent  evidence of the following situations:   violation of law, rule or regulation;   mismanagement;   abuse of authority;  high waste of funds.

In cases of clear violation of existing codes of conduct, the approach is  reinforced and follows disciplinary procedures with legal implications. Child labour has been identified as a possible risk, although the Portuguese law prohibits it and PT  considers it totally inappropriate. Therefore, procedures were defined in order to mitigate the impacts of  such situations that eventually might be identified in the value chain of the group. Specifically, if any  employee and/or auditor of PT identify the existence of child labour cases in the value chain of PT should  denounce them in order to be subject to the procedures defined set in terms of child support:  Analysis of the situation of the child and its environment in family terms;  Exceptionally if the childs age to allows continuity of work, the number of hours in transportation,  school and work should not exceed 10 hours/day.  Attendance / completion of minimum compulsory education;  Its sustenance, providing it with the conditions for its normal physical and psychological  development;  The procedures to be adopted are communicated to all employees and partners of the  companies;   Definition of responsible persons for implementing the respective actions and deadlines;   The effectiveness of the actions implemented is evaluated and records of evolution are kept.  In 2010 and 2011 there were not any cases of child labour detected in the value chain of the company.  52 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 ii.

The suppliers subject to the actions described are identified by the Suppliers Control Group based on  the following criteria of criticality: 	 Provision of services on behalf of the Group; 	 Provision of services at the premises of the Group; 	 The supply of products with direct integration in the value chain; 	 With control assessments with negative results; 	 Subject of complaints or denunciations; 	 Other criteria deemed relevant. The evaluation conducted on the supply chain is presented in the chapter of Involvement and  Relationship with stakeholders. 3.4. tRansPaRency and coMPliance The recommendations of international organizations, national, European and American legislation in  relation to listed companies, are carefully observed by PT and whenever there are disagreements the  company will be represented in the respective bodies to ensure the evaluation of their views. Compliance with the diversity of recommendations that PT follows, particularly in the areas of corporate  governance, is highlighted in its Corporate Governance Report and Form 20F. We will however mention here the following: Regulators and supervisors of Pts activity at a national level PT, besides the strict adherence to the existing legal framework, maintains an attitude of dialogue and  proactivity with regulators, participating in meetings to which it is invited, by collaborating with well- founded opinions and suggestions and accepting the decisions taken. The PT has, at corporate level, units that are intended to interpret the recommendations and decisions  of regulatory authorities, as well as stimulate the dialogue among all. PT has maintained an attitude of  dialogue and cooperation with these entities, participating actively in its various initiatives. In Portugal, the sector of electronic communications is fully liberalized since 2000. Therefore, the legal  framework applicable to the sector is geared to an environment of free competition, which during the  year 2008 was increased with a new operator in the Portuguese market. In 2002 we adopted a new regulatory framework applicable to networks and electronic communications  services, consisting of a set of European directives covering the telecommunications sector. These directives  have been transposed into national law by Law n. 5/2004 of 10 February (Electronic Communications  Law). Managing With ethics and ResPonsibility  |  PRinciPles, Policies and codes of conduct  PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 53 This is a regulatory framework that uses the methods of analysis associated with the principles of  competition defence, applied to a given set of relevant markets in order to determine entities with  dominant position and ex-ante adoption of a set of obligations. As a result of technological change and integrative characteristics of next-generation networks, the  European Commission started in 2005, the process of reviewing the regulatory framework - called  Revision 2006, with a view to amending the current Policy and Recommendation of Relevant Markets. In  this regard, in December 2009 was published a regulatory framework for electronic communications  within the European Union, which includes, among others, Directive 2009/140/EC (Better Regulation)  and Directive 2009/136/EC (Citizens Rights)* Entities regulating markets and trade relations in the electronic communications sector in Portugal: 	 national Communications Authority - ANACOM - whose regulatory function has the following  objectives: the promotion of competition in the provision of networks and electronic communi- cations services, the contribution to the development of the EU internal market and also to  protect the interests of citizens. 	 Competition Authority - whose main objective is to ensure compliance with competition rules  in view of the efficient functioning of markets, the efficient allocation of resources and the  interests of consumers. 	 regulatory Authority for the Media - ERC â€“ whose scope of intervention is the regulation and  supervision of all entities pursuing activities relating to the media in Portugal. 	  national Commission for data Protection - CNDP - whose main objective is the protection  and privacy of data.

The group, based on the opinion of the internal  and external legal counsel, noted provisions for these court and arbitration proceedings and tax  contingencies to deal with the likely departure of resources, as follows:        euro   2011  2010 Civil liabilities  455,240,630  18,117,450 Labour liabilities   220,946,141  4,230,646 Other liabilities  4,274,712  4,915,363 subtotal   680,461,483  27,263,459 taxes  163,444,761  54,761,153 total   843,906,244  82,024,612 The increase occurred in the exercise ended December 31, 2011 is primarily explained by the impact of  proportional consolidation of non-current and current provisions of Oi and Contax in the Statement of  Financial Position of Portugal Telecom on March 31, 2011, amounting to 213 million euros and 594  million euros, respectively, totalling 807 million euros. As at December 31, 2011, excluding the effect of proportional consolidation of Oi and Contax in the  amount of 760 million euros, the total consolidated value of lawsuits and tax contingencies would be 79  million euros, compared with 82 million euros on December 31, 2010. 4. goveRnance Model 4.1. oRganizational stRuctuRe PT adopts the model of Anglo-Saxon governance, which assumes the existence of a Board of Directors, an  Audit Committee composed by mostly independent non-executive Directors, and a Chartered Accountant,  all directly elected at the General Assembly of Shareholders. The Chartered Accountant is elected on a  proposal of the Audit Committee as required by Portuguese commercial legislation. PTs organization structure further includes a Compensation Committee elected by the General Meeting of  Shareholders, which is responsible for determining the remunerations of the members of corporate bodies. The members of the corporate bodies and of the Board of the General Meeting of Shareholders are  elected for a three-year term of office, and they may be re-elected once or more times within the limits  of the law. Managing With ethics and ResPonsibility  |  PRinciPles, Policies and codes of conduct  PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 55 The governance model of the PT can be presented in schematic terms as follows: This governance model assumes the values of efficiency, simplicity, transparency and rigour as their basic  pillars and gives PT a structure appropriate to the particularities and needs of the Company and is welcomed  by the market. In this context, PT has an Executive Committee with powers delegated by the Board of Directors of a  predominantly operational nature, being also responsible for proposing to the Board all the strategic  initiatives necessary for the proper development of the Company.

Managing With ethics and ResPonsibility  |  goveRnance Model The Board of Directors, apart from all non-delegable responsibilities under national law and company  by-laws, has the duty to supervise the performance of the Executive Committee. In support of its Corporate Governance activities, have been created within the Board of Directors two  internal committees composed exclusively of Directors almost entirely non-executive. Thus, an Evaluation Committee was created, with the main objective of ensuring a competent and  independent assessment of the performance of the executive Directors and the assessment of their overall  performance, as well as a Corporate Governance Committee, with the main objective of reflecting on the  model of government adopted and verifying their effectiveness. The organizational structure of PT also includes a Compensation Committee elected by the General  Assembly, which is responsible for fixing the remuneration of the members of the corporate bodies. The members of the corporate bodies and the board of the General Assembly are elected for a three year  term of office, renewable one or more times within the limits of the law. In the governance model adopted the separation of powers remains, as the members of the Board  delegate daily management on an Executive Committee. The Board of Directors of PT is composed of a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 25 members. Among the  elected, there are executive Directors, independent non-executive Directors and non-executive and  non-independent Directors. functions (%) EXECUTIVE       29%             NONEXECUTIVE AND NON INDEPENDENT       33%          NONEXECUTIVE AND INDEPENDENT     38%             WOMEN       5%             MEN    95%             gendeR (%)  PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 57 4.2. functions  composition Members (date of first appointment) board of  directors executive  committee audit  committee corporate  governance  committee evaluation  committee independence  (4) n. of shares henrique Granadeiro (2003)  Chairman Chairman (1) yes 150 Zeinal bava (2000) Member Chairman (CEO) Member (2) 63,161 Lus Pacheco de Melo (2006)  Member Member (CFO) 45 Carlos Alves duarte (2009) Member Member 40 Manuel Rosa da Silva (2009) Member Member 90 Shakhaf Wine (2009) Member Member - Alfredo baptista (2011) Member Member 8,193 Pedro duro Leito (2011) Member Member 758 joo de Mello Franco (1998) Member Chairman Member Member (3) yes 13,308 (5) jos xavier de basto (2007) Member Member yes - Mrio joo de Matos Gomes (2009) Member Member yes - Otvio Marques de Azevedo (2011) Member - Francisco bandeira (2008) Member 523 (6) Rafael Mora Funes (2007) Member Member 501 (7) joaquim Goes (2000) Member Member Member 2,437 Pedro jereissati (2011) Member - Gerald S.

For the assessment of the executive members, the Evaluation Committee proposes to the Compensation  Committee the relevant criteria and objectives in terms of compensation each year and for each term of  office, taking into account the plans approved by the Board. It also has advisory powers on matters of  selection of members of the Board of the most relevant companies in the Group. The Evaluation Committee has the duties, skills and responsibilities required to assist the Board in the  following areas: 	  Evaluation of the overall performance of the Board; 	 Evaluation of the performance of the members of the Executive Committee, based on criteria  approved by the Compensation Committee appointed by the General Assembly of Shareholders. Under the regulations, the Evaluation Committee is composed of the Chairman of the Board of Directors,  the CEO, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and four non-executive Directors, including at least one  independent Director, the respective mandates corresponding to term of office of the Board of Directors.

The compensation policy of the executive and non-executive Directors and chartered accountant are  defined according to the following criteria: i. Remuneration policy for non-executive directors, including members of the audit committee: The compensation of non-executive members of the Board, including members of the Audit Committee,  follows a rigid model determined by an annual compensation fixed by the Compensation Committee  (to be paid 14 times a year) without attendance. The fixed remuneration takes into account the fact that some directors also exercise their duties in any  of the committees assisting the Board, to support the exercise of its oversight function, and/or because  they are considered independent under and for the purposes of paragraph 5 of Article 414 of the  Portuguese Companies Code. In particular, the Chairman of any committee assisting the Board (not  accumulating with the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer or Chairman  of the Audit Committee) as well as the independent Members who are part of more than one committee  receive an additional pay of twice the remuneration of a non-executive Member. Similarly, this fixed compensation considers the performance of duties as a member of the supervisory  board, especially as Chairman or as financial expert within the Audit Committee, taking into account that  performing duties in this corporate body implies compliance with the Portuguese legislation as well as  the mandatory rules to which the Company is subject, while foreign private issuer with securities  admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), including those under the Sarbanes-- Oxley Act and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NYSE. The remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of PT SGPS corresponds to an annual fixed  amount indexed to the fixed annual remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer, not including a variable  component. This does not invalidate the recognized capacity of the Evaluation Committee to propose  to the Compensation Committee to award a prize to the Chairman of the Board at the end of his term,  in accordance with the Groups performance. In line with Recommendation II.1.5.1 of CMVM, even though this remuneration policy is structured to  allow alignment with the interests of society, there is no provision for any form of variable pay for  non-executive members of the board or for members of the supervisory board (without prejudice to the  possibility of awarding a prize to the President of the Board, as described in the previous paragraph). ii. Remuneration policy for executive directors: The remuneration of executive management takes into account the performance of PT SGPS, in the  short and medium term, as well as the performance benchmarking with other companies of similar size  and business. The remuneration of executive Directors is composed of a fixed component and a variable, being the  latter: (i) it is payable only if an average degree of fulfilment of objectives of 85% is achieved; and (ii) in  the case of annual variable remuneration, it may be amount up to 90% of the fixed remuneration and in  the case of the multiannual variable remuneration, it can reach up to 70% of the fixed remuneration, if  the predetermined goals are achieved for each of these situations (being the objectives relating to the  annual remuneration fixed at the beginning of each year and those of the multiannual remuneration set  at the start of the term of office), as determined by application of the criteria and parameters specified,  in b. below: Managing With ethics and ResPonsibility  |  goveRnance Model  PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 63 fixed remuneration: The value of the fixed remuneration of executive Directors was determined on the basis of a benchmark  study. In this study, companies included in PSI20, IBEX35, CAC40, DJ Eurostoxx 50 were considered, as  well as European telecommunications companies comparable to PT SGPS.  In addition, the determination of the fixed component of the remuneration of executive Directors for  the current term of office has taken into account the acceptance of the Chief Executive Officers initiative  to reduce his own fixed remuneration in 10%, as compared to the one established for the previous term  of office, in order to mobilize all Group sectors for the accrued effort that the global crisis context means  to the pursuance of PT SGPS Strategic Plan. Such reduction is applicable to all the members of the  Executive Committee. variable remuneration: The variable remuneration policy in PT SGPS is governed by the following guiding principles to ensure a  clear alignment between the interests of Executive Directors and the Companys interests in line with  Recommendation II.1.5.1 of CMVM:  The pursuit and achievement of goals through quality, hard work, dedication and business  know-how;  The policy of incentive and compensation of PT SGPS must allow the attraction, motivation and  maintenance of the best people on the market, as well as the stability of the executive team;  The implementation of a professional management philosophy and embodied in the definition  and realization control of ambitious (but achievable) goals, measurable annually and  multian- nually (term of office), thereby taking into account developments in the companys performance  and the Group;  Developing a culture of market orientation and its best practices, measured, whenever possible,  by comparing the performance of the companys goals with a group of companies and/or  organizations in its relevant market (domestic and international);  The pursuit of excellence in management through a set of business practices of reference,  enabling the company to achieve balance and sustainability of the business;   This will need to implement a management philosophy to develop its activity in three dimen- sions: economic, environmental and social. This variable component precludes share allotment or stock option plans. Annual variable remuneration: Given the tradition and the model existing at PT SGPS in the last decade, the performance evaluation of  the Executive Directors of the Group was indexed in annual terms, to the pursuit of goals at Group level. The determination of the annual variable remuneration to be awarded on account of the performance  in 2009 will be determined based on a percentage of the fixed annual remuneration, calculated using  the weighted average level of achievement of each of the following indicators, and if this average  reaches 85% of the objectives established and if the company maintains the qualification of investment  grade at the end of each year (unless the loss of such a classification is the result of a strategic decision  of the Board):  Ratio of total shareholder return (TSR) of PT SGPS, compared with the DJ Stoxx Telecom Europe  sector, TSR is understood as the sum of the change in share price with the amount of dividends  per share; 	 Dividend per share delta adjustable if the Board of Directors change the dividend policy;  64 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 ii. 	 Earning per share (EPS) growth Delta; 	 Revenue growth delta compared to a group of comparable companies; 	 EBITDA growth delta compared to the same group of companies in the sector; 	 EBITDA growth delta minus CAPEX. After determining the annual variable remuneration in accordance with this methodology, the  Compensation Committee may increase or decrease the variable remuneration of the Chairman and  other members of the Executive Committee on the proposal, respectively, of the Evaluation Committee  and of the CEO. In every case, depending on the degree of achievement of the pre-defined objectives,  that the annual variable remuneration will not exceed by more than 110% the fixed remuneration. variable multiannual remuneration The determination of the multi-annual variable remuneration is calculated on an annual basis and  cumulatively over the term of office and paid at the end to Executive Committee members remaining at  PT SGPS until the end of the mandate (this requirement will not be mandatory if the Executive Committee  member does not continue at PT SGPS at the end of term for reasons not imputable to him), if the  weighted average of all indicators throughout the term of office reaches 85% of the established goals. This calculation is done yearly and cumulatively based on the weighted average the degree of attainment  of each of the following quantitative and qualitative indicators:  Evolution of total shareholder return (TSR) compared with the DJ Stoxx Telecom Europe sector;  Dividend per share delta adjustable if the Board of Directors change the dividend policy;  Earning per share (EPS) growth delta; 	 EBITDA growth delta by reference to the figures contained in the Strategic Plan; 	 Evolution of the Sustainability Index of PT SGPS as a function of DJSI methodology; 	 Compliance with the strategic goals nationally and internationally. The methodology of annual calculation of multi-annual goals was favoured to the detriment of the  calculation of indicator values exclusively at termination of office in order to render more effective the  control of the implementation result of the corporate strategy throughout the triennium. If during any annual exercise the amount equals zero, the amounts due from previous exercises will not  be lost, if at termination of office, the result obtained from the evaluation of the multi-annual indicators  achieves at least 85% of the established goals. Otherwise, the accumulated amounts will be lost. After the determination of the Multiannual Variable Remuneration in accordance with this methodology, the  Compensation Committee may increase or reduce the variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer  and of the other executive Directors, upon proposal of the Evaluation Committee of the Board of Directors and  of the Chief Executive Officer, respectively. In any case and depending on the level of achievement of the  pre-established goals, the MVR will not exceed the fixed remuneration in more than 88%. alignment of the interests of the directors with the interests of Pt As described above, the multi-annual and annual variable remuneration of the Executive Directors of PT  SGPS in office in 2011, is dependent on their performance as well as sustainability and ability to achieve  the strategic objectives of the group, seeking this way to contribute to maximizing long-term  performance and also to align the interests of management with the interests of the Company and their  shareholders.

To do this, the companys brands are committed to give the market an effective response, adapting the  whole range of services and solutions of PT, to the needs expressed by each user, while ensuring the  continued provision of the subscribed services and customer satisfaction. The last three-year period was marked by significant improvements in the areas of customer care,  delivery/installation of services and faults, in line with the suggestions and the subsequent recognition  by the market. The increasing service sophistication and the expansion of the Groups commercial offering  triggered an  increase in the number of contacts for service subscribe, clarification, complaints and/or fault reports.  Therefore, PT has implemented a number of processes and platforms that made it possible to deepen the  knowledge about each customer, adjusting the provision of services to the responsiveness to each need. Relationship is a responsibility of all Group employees, regardless of which roles and/or responsibilities  that they hold in the organization. aReas of custoMeR focus Listen to customers      Personalise the relationship with each customer      Innovate in market offering      Offer quality services      Ensure continuity in service delivery      Ethics in the commercial relationship      Promotion of correct habits in service use Within this context, PT continued to wish to be recognized as the Portuguese company that offers the  best customer experience, having received this recognition from several entities over the last three years,  both at domestic and international level.

Therefore, it created an observatory where every case exposed in the  scope of customer service is monitored and where new problems are identified and suitable solutions  defined. This observatory, designated Tactical Centre, strongly contributed to accelerate the response to  customers and to improve the success rate in contacts made via contact centre. Goals of the Tactical Centre   focus on customer impact â€“ To improve customer experience, reducing the number of  technical calls and fault reporting  Articulation of different interventions: 	 To	articulate	the	intensity	of	interventions	with	weather	forecasts	(fault	estimate); 	 To	measure	the	impact	of	network	interventions	on	the	quality	of	service	to	the	customer; 	 To	promote	communication,	involvement	and	company-wide	participation:	customer	support,	 technical areas, operations, business; 	 Control	of	impact	on	the	customer	â€“	analytical	and	objective	quantification; 	 Continuous	monitoring	â€“	to	reduce	perception-based	analyses; 	 Service	assurance		-	provided	by	the	technical	team	dedicated	to	the	tuning	of	the	upgrade	processes. In 2011, 428 new situations were identified, distributed by the following areas: new situations identified by the tactical centre Wireline   230 Wireless   187 Common areas  11 From the identified situations, circa 90% were corrected immediately, minimising the negative impact  that these occurrences might cause to other customers and to the customer services of the company. Examples of situations identified over the last three-year period and solved in the scope of the Tactical  Centre: Common Areas: the quality of the telecommunications services is affected by atmospheric conditions,  so after a bad weather alert from the National Authority for Civil Protection (ANPC) there were a number  of preventive actions defined in the scope of the Tactical Centre, together with the technical areas in  order to minimize possible negative impacts derived from the bad weather for the days identified during  October. This operation minimized the negative impact that atmospheric conditions usually provoke on  telecommunications.  74 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 iii. involveMent With stakeholdeRs   |  custoMeRs wireline: Due to human error, the price update of the fixed telephone service of the residential segment  caused an impact on the prices of this service for the business segment. When this situation was  detected in the first billing cycle, it was solved at once, avoiding inconveniences to all the other business  customers in the remaining billing cycles in the same month. wireless: After a request from the business units, the minimum top-up values were changed. Due to  human error, the new top-up values would not update the validity of the card for another 30 days as it  should be. This correction was made in two days, avoiding an impact on more than 90% of the customers  using this service. business: Definition of the form of action in situations of spam. Sending a high amount of email by  some customers, causes that enterprise customers are left without email access. A preventive circuit of  action in these situations includes blocking (pre-emptively) email accounts of corporate clients that are  sending more email traffic than normal and providing this information to the call center for an effective  response to blocked clients. There is an ongoing project for improvement of account lockout policies,  enabling to proactively inform customers that they are going to be blocked. Customer ombudsman â€“ minimising unsatisfactory situations The customer ombudsman evaluates the complaints received from unsatisfied customers, after  unsatisfactory solutions have been presented by all the other areas of the company. During 2010, 61,143 complaints were evaluated and solved. origin of situations presented                           (n. of situations) Customers  52,384 Consumer defence organizations and other external bodies  8,759 total   61,143 Every situation presented and evaluated by the services of the Customer Ombudsman was solved in  accordance with the customers expectations in a short period of time, which varied from 4 to 24 hours,  according to an evaluation of the urgency of the situation. Performance in customer contact It is essential for PT that customers feel satisfied with their customer contact services. Being aware that the number of contacts would necessarily increase due to growing service  sophistication and diversification, the performance monitoring reached shows that the improvement  measures introduced contributed to increase PTs customer contact capacity in terms of response time  and quality.  customer contact   2009  2010  2011 Total contacts received/1,000 customers (monthly average)  219  182  160 Contacts made (monthly average)  95.3%  91.3%  95.4%   2009  2010  2011 Total complaints received/1,000 customers (monthly average)  31.7  26.6  30.7 Time spent treating each one â€“ days (monthly average)  3.9  4.1  2.2 complaints   75 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 service installation   2009  2010  2011 Total installation requests (monthly average)  72,503  67,455  63,865 Time spent installing each one â€“ days (monthly average)  10.3  8.3  9.2 faults     2009  2010  2011 Total faults reported/1,000 customers (monthly average)  33.4  29.4  24.7 Time spent repairing each one â€“ days (monthly average)  1.6  1.7  2.1 The three-year period showed an unusual capacity of PT to adapt to the market because, not only it  innovated significantly its commercial offering â€“ with the multi-platform services and expansion of the  fiber-optic network across the country â€“ but also adapted effectively its contact and care services to its  customers who legitimately increased their support requests to obtain clarification, troubleshoot faults  or have new services installed. In line with the goals set for the three-year period, the request resolution time improved on average and,  this year, the average time for the resolution of complaints was significantly reduced (47%), compared  with the previous year, compared with the previous year and (44%) over the last three years. 2.2. custoMeR satisfaction index Customer recognition demonstrated through the average score attributed to PT constitutes a strong  motivation to keep improving daily the relationship established with the market. Apart from the CRM platforms, PT has chosen to survey regularly the market to collect perceptions and  expectations concerning the activity of the PT Group. These surveys aim to assess the level of customer satisfaction and are conducted on market segments,  obeying generically with the following criteria: segMents suRveyed Residencial customers      Personal customer       business customers      suRveys conducted Global satisfaction index      Welcome call        Evaluation of complaint resolution      Evaluation of fault resolution      These surveys are conducted by external market research institutions of good repute with renowned  experience in order to give accurate, neutral and impartial information and to constitute a valid basis for  the decision-making processes and identification of corrective measures.   76 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 iii. involveMent With stakeholdeRs   |  custoMeRs The methodology adopted in these studies is based on statistically significant samples for each market  segment and the overall results assessed in three years have the following profile:  custoMeR                  2009  2010  2011  Residential customer satisfaction index (1 to 10)   7.8   7.8   7.9  Personal customer satisfaction index (1 to 10)  8.0   8.0   8.8 business customer satisfaction index of fixed service (1 to 10)   7.4   7.9   7.6  business customer satisfaction index of mobile service (1 to 10)  7.4  7.5   7.6  Sources: Residential / Personal: Marktest business:  dataE In general, the average levels of satisfaction expressed by customers throughout the three-year period  were high and therefore reveal the existence of a positive relationship between both parties. The  business market presents on average satisfaction levels below those of the residential market and these  assessments over the three-year period stood at very high levels, with improvements from year to year. The exception was the average satisfaction of the business segment area in wireline, which in 2011  declined slightly compared with the previous year, remaining, however, at a high level and in line with  the objective for this period. 2.3. data PRivacy PRotection The information Security Policy in terms of information Systems and Technologies was prepared  and launched in 2010, having most employees been subject to specific training actions and the  respective content was disclosed to both customers and users. Confidentiality and security of consumer data, access and traffic protection to database information, as  well as confidentiality of telecommunications content, are areas safeguarded by PT in order to respect  the freedom and basic rights of each individual. PT follows the national legislation scrupulously, which is very detailed and specific concerning this  subject, as well as the European and American legislation. Being listed in European and North-American  Stock Exchanges, PT is scrutinised by entities from different sectors, apart from the regular audits to all  the situations capable of rendering the protection of personal data more vulnerable with the support of  security and legal experts. When we say personal data we mean any information of whatever nature and irrespective of the respective  support, including sound and image, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person: it is the person  who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one  or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. information security Policy In 2010, PT prepared and launched its Information Security Policy in terms of the Information Systems  and Technologies. This policy contains a vast number of procedures about which most employees have  already been specifically trained.  77 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 Knowing that this is a sensitive area in which evolution is fast, PT has been participating in discussion  forums on this matter and implementing measures deemed as best practices to safeguard data  protection and customer privacy. The rules set out in this privacy policy supplement the provisions on personal data, provided for in the  contracts that customers celebrate with PT Group companies, as well as the rules laid down in accordance  with the Terms and Conditions governing the offer of various products and services, which are advertised  on the respective websites. PT provides data pertaining to its customers exclusively on request by the judicial authorities and in the  terms of the law. Participation in the 31st international Conference on data Protection and Privacy  As a sequence of the 31st International Conference on Data Protection and Privacy held in  Madrid, 50 countries came to an agreement on new common measures about data protection  and privacy, as some of the measures already developed and applied within the EU are expected  to be enforced outside its borders.   The Madrid Resolution as the document is known, seeks to establish international standards to  ensure increased privacy and reservation in the access to personal data and may originate new  legislation in this domain in countries where it does not exist.   PT is part of a working group in which representatives from circa 50 countries and companies in  the domain of the information and communication technologies are also present.   The approved document may be consulted online and defines the basic principles for the use of  personal data: loyalty, legality, proportionality, quality, transparency and responsibility. It also  recognizes the need of existence of supervisory authorities.   The principles defined in this resolution are part of the standard in force in the European Union  and in Portugal, but the authorities have been defending the importance of its generalisation to  other countries as transactions and services are each time more global, as data protection of  Portuguese citizens may be rendered more vulnerable taking into consideration the absence of  rules in other countries. A Committee responsible for the implementation and verification of the Privacy Policy applicable to the  group as well as for the definition of clear rules for processing personal data was created, ensuring that  all those who entrust us with their personal data are aware of how they are treated and what rights they  enjoy in this matter. 2.4. content secuRity Todays ease to access and to make available contents is really stimulating, no doubt contributing to  bring people closer together, and to make these more knowledgeable in diversified terms. Nevertheless,  we know that this reality causes concerns related to undue use of theses potentialities by segments of  the population with less critical and/or selection capacity to choose contents suited to their interests. Aware of this fact, PT has launched initiatives whose goal is to make the population aware of the  responsible use of contents, makes available guidelines for the use of parental control devices and  software, follows the recommendations on international bodies on this matter and signed a protocol in  2009 with a scientific computing entity to monitor contents and for network security.  78 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 iii. involveMent With stakeholdeRs   |  custoMeRs code of conduct: PT signed in 2008 the Code of Conduct for activities of delivery of content services that aims to protect  minors from harmful content when using mobile communication services. Protocol of cooperation for it security and safe use of internet PT signed a protocol of cooperation with FCCN (Foundation for National Scientific Computing) in the  domains of IT and Internet security. As to IT security, there is provision for an action or a number of actions carried out against a computer or  computer network that results or may result in the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or performance of a  data communications network or system, namely unauthorised access, information change or removal,  interference or service denial in a computing system. As to Internet security, there is provision for the identification and denunciation of illegal contents,  aiming essentially to remove and make impossible the access to content pertaining to child porno- graphy or violation of human rights, notably violence and racism. charter of principles to ensure greater security of children and young people PT is also a signatory and founder of the industry alliance that developed a number of guidelines to  ensure greater safety of children and youngsters in the use of information and communication  technologies published in January 2012 - Principles for the Safer Use of Connected Devices and Online  Services by Children and Young People in the EU, and which brings together players representing the  entire ICT value chain: operators, manufacturers, social media, gaming and content providers. communicating safely Program In order to make the school community aware of the good use of content accessible via electronic  communication devices, PT prepared, through its corporate volunteer work programs, an initiative to be  brought to a wide number of schools nationwide in a classroom environment whose goals are:  To promote the safe and responsible use of electronic content and equipment;   To make educators aware of the parental control tools currently available. This program was prepared and tested in some schools in 2009, and it is being executed all over the country. guidelines for best practices in the use of services and parental control The interactivity of the new media not only opens doors, but also, just as in other aspects of day-to-day  life, requires attention in order to preserve the safety of each individual, of their personal data and the  information or content that they want to access and share with others. It is therefore essential to know the correct and ethical ways of using these services so as to ensure that  experiences in todays digital world be more enriching and responsible. PT, aware that this path is the  best for the safeguard of their customers, particularly the younger ones, provides parents and young  people with a number of services and guidelines, which tend to promote safe use of information and  communication technologies, which can be found online on the respective website.  79 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 2.5. ResPonsible consuMPtion  For PT, it is crucial to provide customers with the necessary knowledge so that they can make their  purchase, subscription and/or use options consciously and responsibly. The increased convergence between devices and contents, between the fixed and mobile networks  and the new functionalities afforded by the fibre optic network (including FTTH â€“ Fibre-to-the-Home),  together with the consolidation of the customer management and interaction, programs for customer  service improvement and the aggregation of more sustainable attributes to the commercial offering,  were some of the issues on the management agenda of the business units of the groups companies  over the last three years. initiatives that contribute to a more responsible consumption In order to ensure the clarity of the tariffs associated with the acquisition, subscription and use of  services, PT had already launched in 2009 a new bill that presents each item more clearly to its customers  and kept the online divulgation of prices as well as simulators so that each customer may have total  control over the amount spent and may select the most convenient solutions for their specific needs  and characteristics. communication of prices and tariffs Communication of Prices and Tarifs associated with the acquisition, subscription and use of services Online Available and up-to-date 365 days a year  Price plans  Prices of service packages  Service/price simulators  Customer portal Bill Paper and online  Detailed description of each billed item user manuals that promote healthy and environmentally-friendly use of products and services   All the products and services commercialized by PT are subject to rigorous tests in order to  ensure user health and safety and, for each one, there is a user manual of procedures and/or  labels provided with the specifications on their adequate use and what to do whenever replaced  or discontinued by the users.  In addition, PT developed and promoted a mini-website with an entertaining content that  informs customers about the opportunities and risks to take into consideration in the selection  and use of ICT-related devices and services: http://sustentabilidade.telecom.pt/.  The packages of the products sold contain labels indicating the correct forwarding of the  respective waste. In 2011 there was not any controversy associated with the products and services marketed by PT.  80 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 iii. guidelines for minor protection and parental control   On the website of the company, customers will also find user guides that include not only  parental control indications as well as indications to protect the identity of each user and access  to harmful contents. Soon, we will also make available indications on healthy ways to use tele- communications equipment and services. impacts of services and products  Through case studies, published online on the website, PT informs customers about the impact of some  of its services: highlight goes to the study on the carbon footprint of the mobile service and its  comparison with the carbon footprint of other services. http://www.telecom.pt/NR/rdonlyres/0EF3D6DB-B23C-4288-86C3-046832F85D95/1458006/ MobileCarbonFootprint.pdf. Products and services that minimise customers carbon footprint  The commercialisation of services and solutions, based on the new information and communication  technologies, will contribute decisively to the energy dependency reduction of our customers and  consequent atmospheric carbon emissions minimisation. The healthcare, education, and domotics  domains have already started to become the basis of this new paradigm and although still little signi- ficant, they are already a new window of opportunity in environmental preservation. Products and services for people with special needs   The commercial offer available includes products, services and solutions for people with special needs  and offers packages adapted to foreign residents.

Through the profound knowledge about the strong and weak points of each employee and of the  organisation itself, it is possible to develop management methodologies to optimize the alignment  between personal skills and company goals and in this way contribute to aggregating value to the  respective businesses. In fact, it is people who with their attitude, skills and degree of involvement with the organisation that,  more and more, constitute the main factor of differentiation and competitiveness of the company in the  global market. PTs human asset management is done taking into consideration the universal declaration of  human rights as part of the 10 principles of the united nations Global Compact signed by PT,  also complying with the Social responsibility principles of uni (union network international)  and the Portuguese labour legislation. PT keeps being recognised as a family-friendly company by AESE (Escola de Direo de Negcios) and  Deloitte, and maintains the certification of its management systems in the Occupational Hygiene, Health  and Safety area, in compliance with OHSAS 18001. involveMent With stakeholdeRs   |  eMPloyees  87 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 PTs Human Asset organisation aims essentially to:  Promote a culture of merit and continuous development within the organisation;  Maximise employee skills and capabilities;  Ensure close and effective accompaniment of organisational structures;  Ensure excellence in execution betting on specialisation;  Promote a constructive labour relationship;  Stimulate a fluid communication throughout the whole organisation;  Include all employees in this model irrespective of work contract.

All policies that guide the companys acting advocate equal opportunities at work, irrespective of  gender, age, race, religion, disability and/or sexual orientation. In addition to integrating specifically this theme into its code of ethics, it is also a signatory to the  principles of the United Nations Global Compact and Corporate Social Responsibility Charter of UNI  (Union Network International). The processes of identifying an appropriate profile to any function, by internal mobility or recruitment of  external candidates, are based on the respective technical and behavioural skills and suitability of  qualifications and skills of the candidates, for the performance of the activity. organizational climate survey The organizational climate survey, among other topics, translates employees perception about  discrimination, where around nine employees out of ten each believe that there is no discrimination  within the company. gender It should be noted also that the proportion of women in managerial positions is aligned with the  proportion of women in the Organization.

No child labour situation has been identified at PT or in any of the companies in their supply chain, but  if there had been any report of such a circumstance, PT would have initiated the procedures defined for  the resolution of child labour situations. 3.4. attRaction and Retention of talent RecRuitMent PT wishes to continue to rejuvenate its managers seeking to identify the necessary skills to achieve its  strategic goals and identifying young talent in the main Portuguese Universities. involveMent With stakeholdeRs   |  eMPloyees  89 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 In 2011, 65 new interns initiated PTs Trainees program. This program lasts has the duration of two years  and puts the interns in contact  with the different areas of intervention of the company so that they may  get in touch with the entire business reality. The groups of Trainees annually admitted by PT deserve  being followed up and directly evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer. During 2011, in order to optimise the talent retention programs already existing in the group, the pilot  program continued to be implemented, having several actions, namely coaching and advanced training,  been conducted on 40 managers who have shown talent according to two perspectives: 	 Leadership, and  Specific technical knowledge. This project will be extended to the entire organisation during the current year.  This action has direct impact on employee retention, enabling to capitalize on the investment made,  both in terms of admission and of continued training of these employees. training and development  Employee training is considered a priority by PTs management. Only through an adequate training plan  can solutions be anticipated and value added to human resources, businesses, the environment and  society.

The model comprises a top-down analysis, self-evaluation and feedback meetings between evaluator and  evaluated person, whose result is a Personal Development Plan for each employee, in which a joint  constructive analysis is drawn up for the development and maximisation of the strong points of the  employee as well as the identification of development actions on areas to improve. The Performance Assessment is supported on an application resident on PTs internal portal, its main  features being the ease of access by all employees and execution of all associated actions. This management tool allows: To increase their knowledge of employee skills;  To increase their level of alignment with the strategy of the company;  To reinforce the orientation towards the fulfilment of goals;  To promote bottom-up and top-down communication.    the company                   A better knowledge of what the management values in their work;   Awareness of their strong points and areas to be improved;  new opportunities for direct communication with management to find the best solutions to meet the  defined goals;  The right vectors for improving their performance and development. employees to get                In order to ensure process transparency, once the conclusion of the assessments is stabilised in the  system, the self-assessments are made available on the intranet to the evaluators as well as the evaluation  and respective Personal Development Plan to the evaluees. The aim is to get feedback on the level of  satisfaction of the employee with the performance analysis process, so that during 2011, employees  should confirm their acknowledgement of their evaluation during the feedback meeting, not only to  validate that it took place, but also to express their agreement with the Personal Development Plan,  ensuring in this way the best articulation between all parties. Professional development model The telecommunications sector has evolved very rapidly in recent decades, which means successive  adaptations of its employees and management models of goals and incentives. So, in 2011, a new  model of professional development was implemented that seeks to blur the complexity arising from  previous models based on:  simplicity,  individual merit,   internal equity,   competitiveness, through compensation in line with the market, and   transversality, as it promotes mobility. This model includes five professional categories and five levels of development in the various functional  areas of the companys activity. With simple and objective rules, the new professional development model allows all employees to:   have a clear perception of the evolution of his career in the company,   know what is to be expected from their career,  involveMent With stakeholdeRs   |  eMPloyees  93 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  know that performance matters to their evolution and to  feel more motivated to work. Two movements of professional evolution are provided for:   progression that certifies the employee movement to the next development level in the same  professional category, where they continue to perform duties of similar complexity   promotion that certifies the employee to a higher professional category, as they perform duties  of greater complexity 3.5. oPen PRogRaM  |  geneRating ideas PTs Research, Development and Innovation model is based on a program where all employees are  agents that contribute actively to its implementation. In addition to technological innovation, employees  have been called upon to participate in the organizational, procedural, environmental and social areas,  especially within the framework of incremental innovation.

Through the marketplace of ideas - online platform resident on the companys corporate intranet -  employees respond to challenges, submitting, discussing and voting on solutions. About 2/3 of  employees have already participated in challenges launched by the OPEN program.  94 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 iii. involveMent With stakeholdeRs   |  eMPloyees PRogRaMa oPen  |  PaRticiPation in the MaRketPlace of ideas REGISTERED USERS 2011 2010 7,000  7,565  2,179  2,461  5  42  +8% +13% X8 IDEAS SUBMITTED IDEAS IMPLEMENTED The ideas presented in the program are subject to an assessment in accordance with the economic,  environmental and/or social impact on the company and according to their opportunity for development  or implementation.

Carried out in every PT subsidiary, the results of this survey have contributed not only to enabling the  employees to express their views in a voluntary, anonymous and confidential way but also to adjusting  the human assets management to the strategy of the Group. Performed on all PT companies, this study has allowed not only employees to express their views in a  completely voluntary, anonymous and confidential way, but also to adjust human resources  management to the strategy of the group. The enquiry implemented in 2011 included, once again, a wide range of topics relative to the concerns  and issues that involve the day-to-day lives of those who work at PT. The accessibility of all employees and the confidentiality of the answers are guaranteed, through direct  access to the website of an external, independent company. 81% 2009 2010 2011 65% 86% eMPloyees Who PaRticiPated in the enQuiRy* Over the last three years, the percentage of employees who participated in the survey increased  significantly from year to year, which indicates the recognition of the usefulness of this consultation tool  and the application of its results in human resources policies and practices adopted in the company.

However, employee  representatives for occupational safety and health, as well as all employees, are an active party in the  continuous improvement of their working conditions and respective quality of life. All employees are responsible for ensuring safety and health at workplaces, and in particular through  participation in hazard identification, risk assessment and on the definition and adoption of control  measures appropriate to each situation. To better anticipate industry trends in this area, PT actively participates in ETNOs work group Good  Work Good Health.

Therefore, the supplier selection and contracting model is based on rigorous principles of transparency,  honesty, equality of opportunities, fairness and confidentiality and is managed by a business unit â€“ PT  Compras.  104 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 iii. electronic platform for supplier pre-selection  All suppliers are subject to a pre-selection phase. An electronic platform was created for this purpose  that specifies the policies, requirements and values that guide PTs actions and has fields to fill in and  include documents to prove the capacity of response and ethical alignment of each one. This platform has been improved over the years through the implementation of new features, which  help to reduce the time limits in which the respective processes run to increase information confidentiality  and security and to dematerialize everyday life and the environmental footprint in this organizational  relationship. 2011 saw the creation of the Club of Suppliers to facilitate the strategic alignment and the relationship  between suppliers and PT: a unique space where PT suppliers can in fully equal terms coexist in a  community whose values, goals and interests are potentially common. It is a space for best practice sharing where any supplier can sign up and join. For PT, it is a complementary  relationship mode that will help to highlight the advantages of ethical, environmental and social  alignment between its members and thus deepen partnership relations among all. supplier evaluation and selection PT adopted regulations that ensure that along its relationship with suppliers, there are always systems  and processes that promote and assess ethical conduct and social responsibility, notably in terms of:  Supplier acquisition Our code of ethics signals our a priori position and requirement in terms of ethics, environmental  protection and social responsibility for all suppliers wishing to interact with PT. Supplier registration Supplier registration includes a questionnaire containing detailed questions on the policies  followed in terms of quality, environment, social responsibility and occupational health and safety. Consultation Each supplier must deliver, together with their proposal, a document which states that they  respect and comply with, within the framework of their activity, the fundamental human rights  within the community and in the workplace, in particular those provided for in the Code of  Conduct of Social Responsibility, (fundamental rights, principles and standards applicable in the  field of environment, and occupational health, safety and hygiene at workplaces). The supplier must also submit the documents proving the existence and compliance with  applicable environmental legislation, in particular with regard to waste management. Selection The level of social responsibility and environmental protection ensured constitute, among  others, evaluation criteria for eventual selection and/or later contracting. Contracting The contractual minutes negotiated with suppliers specify their compliance with environmental  legislation applicable to the activity developed under the contract in question, as well as the  laws and regulations concerning occupational safety, hygiene and health.  Suppliers not meeting the requirements included in the selection platform shall be automatically  rejected. involveMent With stakeholdeRs   |  eMPloyees  105 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 4.4. tRansPaRency and anti-coRRuPtion in the PRocuReMent PRocess Apart from being governed by PTs Code of Ethics and Sustainability and Social Responsibility Policy, the  application of PTs Procurement Model to the bargaining relationships with suppliers is translated into  the following practices divulged and verified with all interested parties: Transparency All the information should be made formally available to the potential suppliers during a  procurement process, ensuring full transparency in information access. equality of opportunities During the bargaining process, the equality of opportunities is guaranteed to all suppliers that  meet comparable requirements, enabling the groups openness to all suppliers. Access to information Suppliers will be able to have access to all the information and clarifications that they need on  any matter of the negotiations in course, in a clear, complete and cordial form. reciprocity and rigour All conditions relative to the delivery dates, prices, conditions of payment, conditions of  acquisition and attribution of responsibilities should be defined in detailed form, by both parties. loyalty Employees intervening in the negotiation must take into account the companys objectives,  trying to meet its needs in the most credible and advantageous form. reciprocal Procurement Reciprocal procurement should not condition or interfere with the result of any bargaining  process. Confidentiality Both PT and suppliers should keep secrecy on all the information exchanged during a  procurement process. Likewise, the following behaviours from suppliers in their relationship with PT are deemed unacceptable:  Use of less competitive prices in direct adjustments or situations of sole supplier;  Use of low prices during the negotiations, to win the contract, with the intention of increasing  them when the contract is won;  Request for price increases throughout the duration of the contract;  Request for information on other competitors;  Use or proposal of ambiguous conditions with the intention of gaining advantage over other  competitors;  Lying or purposeful induction in error during the bargaining process;  Commitment above their capacities;  Exaggeration in the gravity of a problem to get bargaining advantages. code of conduct of social Responsibility of Pt The Code of Conduct of Social Responsibility of PT advocates, among other fundamental rights, freedom  of employment, non-discrimination, prohibition of child labour and respect for fundamental rights at work. It has been a constant concern of PT to get the alignment of suppliers with this code by means of the  declaration of acceptance of the respective charter of principles.  106 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 iii. This process started in 2010. All corporate suppliers registered from 2010 were subject to successive  awareness actions. The acceptance of the charter is from 2011 indispensable condition for new suppliers  to join the Supplier Club, thus qualifying to take part in the purchase processes.

It is essential to make an annual assessment to measure the level of alignment between PTs sustainable  procedures and policies and those of their suppliers so that as a result of the findings it is possible to  identify the path that ensures an increased, continued approximation of those with a profile less similar  to that of PT. assessment of sustainable practices of suppliers Continuing with their assessment of the sustainable practices of suppliers, PT Compras conducted the  third wave of the sustainability survey in 2011. involveMent With stakeholdeRs   |  eMPloyees  107 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 The 2011 survey showed once again a high level of response, from 535 suppliers, with a positive  evolution of the average score, which stood at 75.3 (scale 0 to 100). The performance displayed in the chart below indicates a high level of alignment in most suppliers. assessMent of alignMent betWeen suPPlieRs and Pt (%) % 0 10  20  30  40  2009 2010 2011 EXCELLENT ALIGNED TO BE IMPROVED AT RISK TO BE IMPROVED GOOD REASONABLE 50  60  70  BAD Among the PT supplier base in terms of alignment, only about 1% is considered to be at risk to be  controlled. In general, the average evaluation has improved over the last three years, and PT believes that this is due  to the approach adopted: successive approximation and identification of areas for improvement with  advantages for all. So far, PT has not identified the need to reject suppliers after being pre-selected and  accepted through the registration procedures defined and required in the existing electronic platform. However, and following the individual feedback action to be undertaken, PT will raise the awareness of  the entities assessed in order to consolidate their position or, as the case may be, to evolve to levels of  greater alignment in order to meet the goals pursued by the company. %  80 74 70 60 90 50 2010 2011 75 LABOUR POLICY & BEHAVIOUR OCCUPATIONAL HYGIENE & SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATE PROFILE AVERAGE SCORE evolution of the levels of alignMent of each cRiteRion included in the evaluation of suPPlieRs  108 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 iii. involveMent With stakeholdeRs   |  eMPloyees initiatives foR suPPlieR contRol and RelationshiP ManageMent 2011 control initiatives Aligned suppliers 71% Exchange of experiences and good practices     Random  face-to-face  audits Suppliers in need of  improvement 28% Feedback and identification of improvement areas Suppliers at risk to be  controlled 1% Control and suggestion of improvement areas In connection with the supplier assessment during the last three years, there were additional 24 face-to- -face audits conducted by the supplier control team of the PT group, in order to monitor compliance  with human and labour rights, particularly in terms of health and safety, labour policy and working  conditions. 24  face-to-face audits to RandoMly selected suPPlieRs   theMes: health and safety,  labouR Policy and  WoRking conditions future perspectives  In the scope of the development of the supplier selection and hiring model, from a continuous  improvement perspective, PT Compras identified the following opportunities to be implemented in the  near future: Sustainability  Supplier monitoring:  Continue supplier interaction in the scope of improvement in terms of  sustainability and of supplied services and/or equipment evaluation, aiming not only to reinforce mutual  knowledge, but also to contribute to constructive evolution of the partnership relationships with PT. Audits: to promote a new wave of face-to-face audits within the framework of Corporate Social  responsibility (CSR) continuing the process begun in 2010. Supply evaluation: PT is developing, with implementation scheduled for 2012, a new supplier  assessment platform, focused on the supply side, in order to assess supplier performance in this context,  in a transversal way and based on criteria deemed critical: quality of supply, meet SLA compliance,  proactivity, etc. This tool will not only contribute to procedural transparency in supplier contracting, but also through  actions of systematic feedback, make a contribution to the positive development of suppliers with direct  impact on performance improvement and development of partnership relations. Conflict minerals: PT will develop actions with their suppliers in order to minimise the risk of equipment  acquisition from conflict regions, where human rights and international law are violated, that might  incorporate the following minerals and metals: tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, commonly referred to  as Conflict Minerals 3TG.  iv.

Therefore, PT has identified this  issue in day-to-day management, anticipating strategies that contribute to preserving this balance  between environment and society at large. Technological evolution, lower energy-dependency of the new equipment, progressive introduction  and availability of renewable energies, remote control through domotics, waste segmentation and  collection and its more adequate routing for reuse or recycling are now enabling PT to optimize the  relationship between their environmental impacts and the delivery of each time more sophisticated  services to the market over the last three years. On the other hand, the new information and communication technologies and next generation  networks already allow us to deliver services to the customers that contribute to reducing their  environmental impact, namely carbon dioxide emissions and in this way, also contribute indirectly to  ecosystem balance. We know that the systematic search for solutions that minimise the impacts of our activity on society,  together with the contributions that the new information and communication technologies may induce  in our customers, will certainly promote better environmental quality in the future. However, this balance is not acquired overnight. It is a path whose results are neither linear nor  immediate. The telecommunications industry is in profound change, and not all operators are offering  the same type of services: PT, besides offering triple play services â€“ TV, internet and voice â€“ for IPTV  (requiring a large amount of information storage), also offers Smart Cloud services, which in turn require  data centres, with increasingly bigger capacity and consequently with increased energy needs to  provide adequate power and cooling for the respective equipment. 1.2. stRategic diRection in the last thRee yeaRs Over the last few years, PT dedicated itself to promoting the implementation of good environmental  practices within its organisation, with suppliers and customers, having defined a policy and environmental  management system that deserved the recognition and the progressive certification of each one of its  business units in compliance with international standard ISO 14001. In the last three years, the environmental strategy adopted by the company aims to implement a  number of measures to rationalise the energy-dependency of its activity and its customers, and  consequently reduce the impacts of the CO2 emissions related directly or indirectly to the services  delivered to the market.   111 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 Principles and knowledge that guide our practices PT subscribes, applies within the company and participates actively in the promotion of the principles  of sustainability and environmental responsibility recommended by national and international organiza- tions with which the management company identifies itself:  10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact;  Environmental Charter and Sustainability Charter of ETNO (European Telecommunications  Network Operators);  EUs Codes of Conduct of Energy Efficiency in the ICT sector;  Recommendations of the Business Council for Sustainable Development in Portugal;  Participation in the Green Touch initiative. The Green Touch initiative, presented in the UK, constituted by a consortium of industry-leading partners,  research institutions and non-governmental organizations, aims to reduce by 1000 times ICT energy- consumption and respective carbon footprint. The telecommunications sector has a marginal contribution (about 1%) to the total current CO2 emissions;  however it may have a key role in the overall reduction of national emissions. According to the study  SMART 2020 Portugal1, the indirect impact expected for this sector alone will fulfill the objectives set by  the European Union, and this impact represents approximately ten times the direct carbon footprint of  the industry. The studies carried out indicate that the adoption of services based on the new features of the next-  -generation networks, intensify the reduction of total CO2 emissions by about 15%. The areas of health  care, education and home automation have already begun to form the basis of this new paradigm and,  though still little expressive, are already a new window of opportunity for environmental preservation. 1.3.  stRategic aPPRoach foR the next thRee yeaRs The three-year period, which we have already started, will be marked by a paradigm shift where we want  to place ICT at the service of the environment. It will be a long path, whose effects will feel over the next  several years: to contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions and energy consumption of our clients,  seek to do more with fewer resources and assess the impacts of each initiative, product or service, are  the main designs adopted.

PReseRving the enviRonMent | innovation | ecological PRoducts and seRvices In this context, we highlight some of the measures implemented over the last three years and, in  particular, in 2011:   green it â€“ through virtualization: PT has been increasing the internal virtualization indexes  through the massive use of virtual information storage, cloud solutions, in order to achieve signi- ficant gains in terms of energy efficiency and, in this area, the virtualization index increased from  34% in 2010, to 42% of the total number of servers in 2011.   copyPoint: through the consolidation of print and fax equipment onto a centralized manage- ment service, it was possible to achieve efficiency gains. This project allowed in the first half-year,  after its implementation, a reduction in paper consumption by 12,5%, 49% in consumables, and  66% in energy consumption of the equipment.   More efficient air conditioning: Replacement of older and therefore less efficient air-condi- tioning machines, by others with proper refrigeration suited to existing loads, thus more  energy-efficient. It is worth pointing out that the vast majority of these machines already have a  free-cooling system, with a reduction of approximately 187 tons of CO2 emissions in 2011.   installation of led lamps: replacement of existing fluorescent bulbs in PT buildings with  lamps with LED technology, thus allowing for a consumption reduction in the order of 94% and  an increase in the useful life of the same.   efficient use of lighting in buildings: obligation to turn off the lights of the corridors of  buildings during the weekends and holidays.    Monitoring and detailed analysis of energy consumption: detailed presentation of energy  consumption data in real time. Allows performing diagnoses and determine improvement  actions in order to reduce electricity consumption in some places and spaces of the company,  as for example, in the use of elevators, where there has been a reduction in energy consumption  by around 30%, during a campaign held in the last three year period.     autonomous photovoltaic solution: development of an innovative autonomous photovol- taic solution to overcome the energy inefficiency of the system then existing. This action results  in an annual energy savings corresponding to 15,277 kWh, with consequent reduction of  emissions at about 7.18 ton of CO2.    efficient gardens: placement of decorative stones in the companys gardens to support the  reduction of water consumption and costs associated with the maintenance of plants. Additio- nally, was implemented a process to relay the water used in washbasins and rain water to irrigate  gardens and that also contributes to the reduction in water consumption. 2.2. enviRonMental sustainability in netWoRk infRastRuctuRe   in the fixed network, Portugal Telecom expanded, in 2011, its fiber-optic coverage (FTTH),  having currently more than 1.6 million homes passed and ensuring the permanence of Portugal  in the European leadership in terms of implementation of a fiber network. Furthermore, the  FTTH network was reinforced with new ONT features â€“ Optical Network Terminal - monitoring  equipment of the fiber-optic infrastructure.    in the mobile network, took place an important modernization of the TMN mobile network  with the adoption of multi-standard equipment, with improvement of the quality offered to  customers and adoption of more efficient and environmentally sustainable technologies. Finally, PT has taken important steps in mobile network infrastructure optimization to develop solutions  for passing seamless mobile network traffic to WiFi networks.  PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 115 2.3. enviRonMental sustainability in the neW data centRe In 2011, PT began the construction in Covilh of one of the worlds largest Data Centres, which will come  into operation at the end of 2012 and will be supported by a network of high-speed fiber communications  that will connect it to the major global communications networks. Representing an investment of Euro  90 million in the first two phases of the project, the new PT Data Centre will occupy more than 75,500  m2 and will have a capacity of over 50 thousand servers with 30 Pbytes, allowing the export of data  storage capacity of European companies and technological services. The project will enable the creation  of more than 1,400 direct and indirect, skilled, specialized jobs, making Covilh one of the cities that  most contribute to the economic development of the country. The new PT Data Centre will differentiate itself by high levels of sustainability and energy efficiency, with  savings of 144 thousand tons of CO2 and 40% in energy consumption. The commitment to Covilh is also brings about the creation of partnerships with several local agencies,  in particular with business (INDIGO and NERBAC) and academic associations (University of Beira Interior  and Student Association of the University of Beira Interior). 2.4. enviRonMental sustainability in the coMMeRcial offeR PTs commercial offering of PT contains services that save time, unnecessary movements, fuel expenses  and materials.   Machine-to-Machine solutions - Important steps were also taken towards the consolidation  of a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) offer, by providing a set of solutions that enable interaction,  without human intervention, between assets/devices/machines and information systems that  support the management of such assets.

The consumption of materials registered a decrease in 2011. The decrease in paper consumption in 2011  was due to a great rationalisation in merchandising material. A new plastic packaging for TMN products  was also introduced, reducing the need to purchase cardboard packaging (boxes). Due to these changes, there was an increase in the consumption of plastics.  Materials from recycling PT has been replacing the use of recycled paper for FSC-certified paper (a paper that promotes the  sustainable management of the forests from which their raw materials are extracted), for being an  economically advantageous option and having at the same time benefits for the environment. However,  and in addition to this widespread practice in PT companies, in PT Inovao the purchase of recycled paper  is still significant, having been consumed during the year of 2011, 75% recycled paper compared to the total. 3.2. diRect consuMPtion of eneRgy, segMented by PRiMaRy souRce Overall, energy consumption showed a 2% decrease compared to 2010. The decrease in consumption  was due mainly to savings achieved by adopting measures of rationalization of energy consumption  and energy efficiency, such as the replacement of obsolete equipment, with freecooling and with  shutdown and replacement of equipment from the mobile network. This year, and due to the weather  conditions, only 26% of the electrical energy consumed originated from renewable energy sources.

There were no  values outside of the parameters established by law. All measurements were sent quarterly to ANACOM, Ministry of Health and local councils. PT is a member and supports the Telecommunications Institute of Instituto Superior Tcnico -  independent entity â€“ which studies issues related to electromagnetic radiation and that regularly  publishes the results not only from random measurements that it performs as well as the results of  studies that it follows on this matter. The respective results are published at http://monit.it.pt/ noise The noise sources susceptible to cause nuisance are varied in nature and intensity. According to the  World Health Organization, regular exposure to high levels of noise may have negative impacts on  public health. Aware that telecommunications stations cause noise and that may have impact on the quality of life of  the surrounding communities, PT performs noise monitoring randomly. In the course of 2011, PT  monitored the noise of 30 TMN stations and 51 PT Comunicaes sites. Whenever there are levels of discomfort and complaints, due to higher values than what is legally  defined, PT prepares contingency plans for mitigation of the respective impact. landscape impact PT has sought to make a harmonious integration of their buildings, telecommunications stations,  antennas and overhead cables, in rural and urban spaces, interpreting the organization of the landscape  and even the history of each location. To do this, it develops partnerships with local authorities and other  competent authorities that aim to identify the solutions best adapted to landscape harmony. In this context, the following impact mitigation initiatives should be highlighted:  Installation of towers disguised as trees;  Antenna sharing with competing operators;  Installation of masts on rooftops concealed with chimneys;  Installation of hidden / underground container solutions;  Conversion of container solutions into multi-purpose cabinets with use of solutions with remote  carriers installed on masts of antennas. In 2011, PT dissimulated 19 sites and shared 44 new sites with other operators, thus avoiding use of new  areas. translocation of stork nests In partnership with the Institute for Nature Conservation and Biodiversity, PT relocated three stork nests  on average per year, since telecommunications antennas and masts are not ideal habitat for this species,  and stork nests hinder access and technical maintenance of telecommunications masts.  120 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 iv. natural disasters Summer fires, winter storms and other natural disasters have significant effects on PTs activity: they  destroy communications equipment installed in the affected areas and restrain the population from  communicating. Therefore, PT has developed services and plans to minimize the consequences of such phenomena: natural disasters Minimize the occurrence of natural disasters . Tele-surveillance service that allows monitoring  the landscape and detecting fire outbreaks Resume communications in the shortest time . Partnership with district and national Civil  Protection authorities . Provide technical and human resources required  to re-establish normal fixed, mobile and satellite  communications quickly - disaster Recovery  and business continuity solutions In this three-year period, in 2010, the Madeira Island faced the worst storm of the last years and,  subsequently, the whole country was plagued by several fires. To minimize the severity of the  consequences of these disasters, PT has made available additional human and technical means and  speedily restored normalcy in fixed, mobile, satellite and submarine cable communications, ensuring an  effective intervention by the authorities and Civil Protection, ensuring communications inside and  outside the affected regions to combat the isolation of populations. Firefighters associations, hospitals  and Civil Protection authorities are the priority targets of these interventions. 3.6. total diRect and indiRect eMissions of gReenhouse gases, by Weight     2009  2010  2011 Scope 1        direct (petrol)  1,902  852  728    direct (diesel)  15,585  16,381  16,122 Scope 2        Indirect (electricity)  138,306  122,144  151,403 Scope 3          Indirect (consumed by suppliers)  22,407  26,243  49,232 total  177,390  165,620  217,486 co2 emissions                                (t) The emissions of Greenhouse Gases had an irregular behaviour over the last three years, since they  depend more on the weather conditions than on the energy efficiency of the companys activity. In fact,  in years with more wind and rain, the mix of energy consumed (wind- and water-generated) is more  favourable and consequently with lower levels of emissions. Therefore, the correlation between energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions is very low in this  case.  on the other hand, the traffic amount for each joule of energy consumed has increased by 89%  during the last three years period, which clearly reveals the energy efficiency of PT.

The intervention model followed is in accordance with their activities  in the following areas:: Intervention areas to ensure digital inclusion and literacy Internal areas External areas Networks Equipment Information systems Services Contents Behaviours Suppliers  NGOs and other  institutions Universities Customers Society in  general The generalisation of the use of the information and communication technologies, the increasing range  of solutions and broadband services, as well as the programs of support for the community and groups  of citizens with special needs, are examples of PTs involvement in the construction of the Information  and Knowledge Society. The application of new technologies and, in particular of the new fiber-optic network, to the universe of  education, health and digital inclusion, enables the creation and use of solutions that promote social  sustainability. To facilitate access to knowledge is essential for PT as an ethical, cultural, social and economic value. Thus, in the last three years, the investment in PTs initiatives to stimulate and promote the information  society amounted to Euro 283 million, divided as follows: investMent in the PRoMotion of the infoRMation society (euRo Million PeR yeaR) 63.2 170.7 2009 2010 2011 49.1  136 PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 03 v. cReating value foR society | stRategy foR digital inclusion and liteRacy investMent in the PRoMotion of the infoRMation society (% by aRea in each yeaR) 50 29 62 6 3 34 2 64 1 33 2 14 2009 2010 2011 HEALTH AND SAFETY EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE SPECIAL NEEDS BROADBAND  283 MILLLION  INVESTMENT IN INFORMATION SOCIETY  (2009-2011)  49.1 MILLION  INVESTMENT IN INFORMATION SOCIETY  (2011) More information on this subject at:  http://www.telecom.pt/InternetResource/PTSite/UK/Canais/Sustentabilidade/knowledge_society/digital_inclusion/ 3. digital inclusion 3.1. fRaMeWoRk and iMPact at national level Portugal is one of the European countries with better access to broadband infrastructure, fixed and  mobile, telephony, internet and television services, accessible from different devices: mobile phone,  television, PC, Tablet, etc. PT has contributed heavily to this reality, since, being the leader in cross-platform in broadband internet  access, it has maintained a high level of investment in the network upgrading and the launch of services  tailored to the different consumer profiles. And this, in turn, has contributed to the accelerated growth  of users and the use that each one makes with these new information and communication technologies. Today, Portugal is the sixth country in the European Union with a higher penetration rate of broadband  over 10Mbps in the population, standing above the European average.

It is worth noting a high rate of internet penetration among young people (between 80 and 95% for the  various levels of schooling). For this reason, it should be highlighted the e-Schools Program to which PT  joined via their mobile operator â€“ TMN -, distributing more than 780 thousand laptops with mobile  broadband connection at subsidized prices (25% of market value). Similarly, internet penetration in the group that covers persons between 55 and 74 years of age has also  increased. In 2011, the percentage of the population between 55 and 74 years of age that used the  internet was around 50% among those who received basic education, 77% in people with secondary  education, and 85% among the population with university education. cReating value foR society  |  digital inclusion  PORTUGAL TELECOM  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 139 inteRnet useRs, by age gRouP and level of schooling coMPleted % of total population in each group 0 10  20  30  40  50  60  1624 YRS 70  80  90  100  2554 YRS 5574 YRS 1624 YRS 2554 YRS 5574 YRS 1624 YRS 2554 YRS 5574 YRS BASIC EDUCATION SECONDARY EDUCATION UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 2006 2008 2010 2005 note: data for the first quarter of each year.
