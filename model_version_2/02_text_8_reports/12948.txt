This was no exception for Pulmuone. However, even in those tough times, our employees have come together to wisely overcome the troubles in both inside and outside of the company. As a result, we were able to achieve various financial results in becoming a global LOHAS company includ- ing enhancement of profit structure as well as our base stamina for overcoming risks. Moreover, we were able to establish the foundation for Global DP5', Pulmuone's vision, through development of new products, differentiation strategy, and enhancement of global organization capacity based on activities relating consumer happiness management.

Pulmuones CSR Activities Definition of CSR Activity Many companies are promoting diverse CSR activities, but not all of these efforts are being conducted in a productive manner. There are many cases where CSR activities are fragmental or disconnected with the business strategies as a corporation pursues conventional methods without taking it into consideration its corporative circumstances, not fully reflecting on inter relationship between business and society. Pulmuone places efforts to use CSR activities as an engine to surpass the level of cost or charity actions and attain new opportunity, innovation, and competitive advantage by analytically and strategically approaching the relationship between social responsibility and corporate strategy. Pulmuone has introduced Responsive CSR and Strategic CSR to promote sustainable management in a more systematic manner. Responsive CSR refers to activities being promoted to cope with important social issues or stakeholders requests and Strategic CSR refers to activities being strategically promoted to reach the vision of LOHAS Company, cares for both human and nature.

Disclosure of production history information, Provision of Transparent and Reliable Information  To ensure the consumers right to know, Pulmuone is trying to build up customer trust by providing trans- parent and reliable information through disclosure of production history information. Disclosure of production date, to Provide Products at Their Freshest State Pulmuone has voluntarily introduced the Disclosure of production date not only to supply its products at their freshest state to consumers by labeling the production date along with the expiration date, but also to fulfill the consumers right to know relating the expiration period by providing more detailed production date information.

Quickly start 'Tree Planting' About 30 Pulmuone volunteers who chose to rush  to Incheon World Peace Forest, giving up sweet weekend break. After receiving 300 pine trees and  being instructed on how to plant them, the volunteers started planting the pine trees one by one with  great care and a love for the earth. "Hey! Try treading on the ground like this." Even the children that came out with  the volunteers seemed rather serious. For the sake of the children's hands  planting tree seedlings,  even the earth seems to recover  it's old green look. In the spirit of caring for both human and nature', Pulmuone, a corporate with utmost effort to provide best products and services to customers, is leading the way saving nature, the source of life while dreaming of green planet. We know that human can live like human when saving nature as it is. Green  Dream Nurturing Story Environment Management  Pulmuone Sustainability Report 2010 51 50 Groundwork for Environment Management While providing healthy foods, the fruit of nature, Pulmuone promotes environment management under the belief that 'human beings will be healthy only if the environment is healthy.' Without environmental awareness and specific practices, a corporate is not able to protect or improve environment. Therefore, from production to distribution, Pulmuone has been fulfilling specific environmental strategies and envi- ronmental visions in accordance with global standards. 2013 Environment Strategy In order to reflect and practically accomplish environment management in the given industrial practices, Pulmuone has established and has been promoting missions, core values, and strategies. For example, Pulmuone has been striving to establish a quantitative environmental goal of 10% reduction in water use, and has been putting efforts to achieve that goal. Although Pulmuone exceeded its goal of reduction in car- bon dioxide emissions, water usage did not meet the expectation due to increase in new product items and related production process along with increased use of cleaning water. Therefore, Pulmuone is currently considering the establishment of recycling facilities as a means to reduce water use.

After green purchase voluntary agreement with the Ministry of Environment in 2007, Pulmuone established green procurement policies and started to purchase more eco-friendly products: office supplies, equip- ments and facilities. As a result, the green purchase amounts increased by 10 times from 25 million Korean Won in 2007 to 272 million Korean Won in 2009. The green purchase agreement was renewed in June of 2010, and Pulmuone plans to expand the purchase of eco-friendly products throughout the entire company. Activities Related to Production Use of Renewable Energy At Pulmuone, geothermal heat, which is a type of renewable energy, is utilized to heat and cool educational facilities and horticulture systems. As a part of the government's dissemination of geothermal heating project to horticulture green house facilities, Pulmuone completed enclosed vertical heat pump installation in its greenhouse in March of 2010. The change from the previous gas oil-based greenhouse energy system to eco- friendly heating energy system enabled the reduction in heating costs by 78.5% compared to gas oil based heating system. As opposed to the previous gas oil boiler, which was only used for heating and therefore was useless during summer, the newly installed enclosed vertical heat pump can heat and cool by using geother- mal heat 150 meter below ground, with the annual average temperature at around 17. This therefore enabled year-round operation of greenhouses. Currently, greenhouse is under pilot operation at a scale of 0.3ha out of the total area of 1ha, and 14% of the greenhouse heat pump capacity is being put into use. Efforts to Reduce Greenhouse Gases Eumsung noodle factory switched from Bunker A to liquefied natural gas(LNG) in 2007, which was regis- tered as a business of domestic greenhouse gas reduction. 2,627 tons of greenhouse gas has been reduced for 2 years(2007.7~2009.7) after the registration and the certification for the reduction was received. In June 2010, the government purchased the total amount of reduction and then the profit of 13.6 million Korean Won was created.

The tofu factories in Eumsung, Chuncheon, and Uiryeong were able to cut down waste heat and water use with indirect cooling water reuse in equipment cleaning process. Previously, cooling water used during the standard tofu making process was discharged into the waste water disposal treatment facility, yet as a recycling method, Pulmuone collected the indirect cooling water in water catchment tank and pro- vided it to be used as cleaning water that needs certain amount of heat. Such reduction in energy required for heating enabled the reduction of water use by 56,000m3 and LNG use by 58,922kg annually. Transportation and Shipping Activities Expansion of Eco-Drive Exofresh Logistics, which is responsible for the transportation and shipping of Pulmuone products, operates an average of 526 vehicles per month. In order for the eco-friendly safe driving, it also conducted a compulsory eco-drive education course for all its drivers in collaboration with Korea Transportation Safety Authority.

Especially, since noodle products can distinguish from their packaging, Pulmuone integrated the internal packaging when applicable and simplified the color of internal packag- ing. Such efforts reduced packaging materials by 23%. Efforts to Protect Ecosystem Diversity LOHAS Academy that strives to conserve the environment Located in 54th street, Pyungdan-Li, Cheongcheonmyun, Geosan-Gun, Chungbuk, Pulmuone LOHAS Academy has landfield site with a total area of 13ha which includes training facility, farm and youth training center. Since LOHAS academy is located in forests surrounded by two mountain ridges and beautiful natu- ral environment streching to the Songnisan National Park, it enjoys diverse ecological environments such as forests, farmland, wetlands, and boulder stone areas and ecological diversity on the forest boundaries. LOHAS Academy uses a heating and cooling system that does not use any fossil fuels at all in order to pre- serve the nearby ecosystem. It is also striving to achieve the coexistence and harmony with nature through educational programs such as feeding wild animals during winter time, removing kudzu vines, making biotopes, hanging birdhouses, and realizing the benefits of forests.
