The industry also needs a  grid to distribute and transmit electricity. Korea highly depends on overseas markets for energy (97%) and its  geographically-isolated grid system makes it impossible to import electricity from neighboring countries. In  addition, long-distance transmission is required because production is concentrated in the south while most of  the power is consumed in the northern part of the country. Furthermore, demand is very difficult to control, and  considerable time and massive investment is required to secure supply capacity.  The six power generation companies (GENCOs), independent power producers (IPPs) and community energy  system (CES) providers generate electric power and sell it to KEPCO on the Korea Power Exchange (KPX).  KEPCO, in turn, sells electricity to general customers through the transmission and distribution network.  Competition in the sales sector of the industry is increasing as large-volume customers (more than 30,000kW)  are allowed to buy electric power directly from producers, and each CES provider is allowed to supply electric  power in a specific district.

In line with such global trends, KEPCO is expanding their overseas business presence, and  preemptively securing green technologies and increasing the synergy effect of the Groups businesses. With global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the energy industry is required to shift swiftly  toward a low-carbon system. In addition, competition for resources is intensifying among nations, and  stakeholders demand for corporate social responsibility such as ISO26000 is soaring. KEPCO will continue  to respond proactively to such environmental changes to ensure sustainable growth, and fulfill social  responsibilities to grow along with stakeholders.  Management  Condition by Area Increased demand for  electricity mostly in  developing countries with  resources, and intensified  competition for prior  occupation of green market Expand business areas  including overseas power  plants and resource  development Strengthen green management  capacity and development  of eco-friendly electric  technologies Pursuit of shared growth with  interested parties, mutual  management and partnership  with partners Lay foundation for development  and commercialization of  green technologies through  Smart Grid, IGCC, CCS and etc. Establishment of transparent  site selection system and operation of eco-friendly  electric facilities Enhancement of social  contribution activities and Introduction of Global  Standard-Level Ethical  Management System Increased demand for  social responsibility  of corporation  by the stakeholders Realizaion of carbon control and Increasing needs for  management of energy efficiency Environment Society Economy Responses   17 board of Directors Remuneration of  Directors Audit Committee  The CEO of KEPCO is referred by the Nomination Committee, consisting of non-standing directors and non- government members, approved by the resolution of the general shareholders meeting, requested by the  Minister of Knowledge Economy and finally, appointed by the President. The tenure of the CEO is three years.  Standing directors other than the CEO are appointed by the CEO on the agreement of the general meeting of  shareholders. Non-standing directors are appointed by the Minister of Strategy and Finance with the referral  of the Nomination Committee and the resolution of Steering Committee of Public Enterprises. Chairman of  the board of directors is one of senior non-standing directors appointed by the Minister of Strategy and Finance  through voting process of the Steering Committee of Public Enterprises.  In order to keep independence of the BOD, stakeholders who have special interests in a company cannot be  appointed as non-standing directors. In accordance with the Act on the Management of Public Institutions,  tenure of directors other than the CEO is two years, and can be appointed for consecutive terms in a row, on a  one year basis every time. In 2010, the BOD met 16 times to address a total of 64 agenda items. Significant matters, which were not on  the agenda list, were separately reported to the BOD. If necessary, the BOD can invite experts or any person  interested in hearing their opinion, and any director who has special interest in a specific agenda is not allowed  to vote on the agenda. In addition to the agenda, significant matters regarding economic, environmental or/ and social performance are separately reported to the BOD pursuant to the articles of incorporation and the  regulations of the BOD.  Following consultations with the Nomination Committee, the CEO signs a pact with the Minister of Knowledge  Economy with respect to management objectives or key challenges to be achieved or addressed during his or  her tenure. Every year, the progress made on the implementation of the pact is reviewed by the Performance  Appraisal Board for Public Enterprises, which is composed of experts from various fields. Standing directors  other than the CEO are required to set management objectives and sign a pact with the CEO every year and are  evaluated by taking into consideration quantified performance on management objectives and the outcome of  the Government Management Evaluation. The directors are paid under a remuneration ceiling determined by  a resolution at the general meeting of shareholders. Non-standing directors are paid an allowance for work  activities. KEPCO established a committee comprised of three auditors who are responsible for independent audit and  inspection of its business and accounting practices. Two of them are non-standing directors, and the chair is  assumed by a non-standing director. One of the three auditors is an accounting or financial expert in accordance  with the enforcement decree of the Commercial Act. The work performance of the standing auditor is evaluated  by the Performance Appraisal Board of Public Enterprises.

Jobs to be rotated are specified, particularly in the sectors of finance, procurement,  transmission & substation, distribution, construction and quality inspection. An IT-based intelligent monitoring  system is operated to monitor 30 indexes in various areas as cases that are repeatedly detected by audit,  marketing, financial accounting, purchased materials and so on. In particular, an unusual transaction scenario  was additionally developed in 2010 in order to standardize risk indexes (from 15 to 20).  KEPCO employees continued to receive training on integrity & ethics to foster a corporate culture of integrity.  In March 2010, KEPCO and its Audit Office encouraged their willingness for integrity by conducting Visiting  Integrity Training towards 240 branch offices in 46 business areas across the country. Meanwhile, KEPCO  Academy runs an Integrity Promotion Class, a training curriculum specialized in anti-corruption to allow  persons responsible for pursuing integrity at their offices to participate in to increase the effectiveness of  integrity training. In addition, in June 2010, a cyber training course called Code of Conduct for Public Servants  through Cases was opened. With a total of 19,764 employees taking integrity training on- & off-line, annual per  capita training time rose 48.1% from 8.13 hours in 2009 to 12.1 hours in 2010. KEPCO has four levels of disciplinary actions to take with employees involved in corruption: (1) reprimand,  (2) salary reduction, (3) suspension from duty and (4) dismissal. In November 2010, relevant regulations were  revised to introduce a Three Strikes & Out rule which allows the company to dismiss employees who have  engaged in corruption such as, demands for bribes, gifts, embezzlement three times to apply the criteria of  punishment in a strict way. KEPCO established proactive action plans to pursue company-side anti-corruption and integrity strategies.  Effectiveness of ethical guidelines has been enhanced through various activities such as revision of ethical  guidelines. In addition, pre-control activities against corruption have been carried out by running a cyber ethical  consulting center, monitoring use of corporate credit cards and operation of KEPCOs 2nd ombudsman office.  As a result, KEPCO was selected as the No. 1 company among 21 public enterprises in the survey of integrity  on public bodies organized by Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Committees, and also the company was positioned  itself as the highest for 5 consecutive years in the evaluation on policies about anti-corruption.

In addition, KEPCO is moving towards a global energy company through overseas resources  explorations and diversified overseas businesses such as nuclear power plants, hydro-thermal plants and  renewable energies.     28 KEPCO Sustainability Report 2011 28 Domestic Business Showing KEPCOs competence on creating high added value by supplying high-quality and  stable electricity and a variety of customer-oriented services. Sales Thanks to economic recovery, KEPCOs 2010 sales hit 434,160GWh,  10.1% up from 2009 and its profit posted a 13.4% increase year-after- year to KRW 37.6842 trillion. Despite the group-level belt tightening  in cost savings, it recorded a net loss of KRW 61.4 billion due to  energy cost hikes. While its business environment even in 2011 is  expected to be unfavorable because of energy price increases and  growing competition in the energy industry, KEPCO will make all-out  efforts for outstanding business performance through continuous  cost-saving activities, management efficiency and so on.  Transmission and Substations For high-quality and stable electric power supply, the completion  of 96 projects, including the 765kV Shinanseong~Shingapyeong  transmission system, has made the 585c-km transmission lines  and 8,540MVA main transformers ready on time. In order to make its  transmission system projects objective and transparent, KEPCO has  largely used its effective location selection system involving interested  parties like local residents, local experts and local governments.  In order to address civil complaints, KEPCO has deployed its risk  management experts on the main construction sites. Furthermore,  KEPCO has installed 430Mvar condensers for less loss and better  efficiency of existing transmission lines and better electric reliability.  Its construction of undersea cables and substations has just kicked  off for the second Jindo-Jeju transmission network.  For prevention of large-scale failures, KEPCOs efforts have  continued: a monitoring system which is up and running in the urban  areas where multi-loop transmission systems lie underground,  additional installation of 3,117 sets of 154kV lightning arresters, a  plan to operate the integrated prevention and diagnosis system for  substations on a trial basis and development of the warning system  of heavy equipment access to transmission lines.  Distribution KEPCO has expanded power distribution systems to secure stable electric  supply by recently deploying 9,502 automatic switches and carrying out  529 new projects such as distribution automation systems and broad  distribution control centers. KEPCO has developed and used high- efficient and low-loss equipment like power cables and transformers,  so that it has achieved a world-class level of transmission loss rate  of 3.99% compared to other OECD economies.

By doing so, KEPCO has maintained a  global level of electric quality with the blackout time per household of  15.15 minutes in 2010, down 2.8% from 15.59 minutes in 2009. KEPCOs efforts do not stop here: for the sake of preventing system- breakdown-related blackouts, it plans to provide thermal imaging  monitoring services for high-voltage customers, to create equipment  monitoring centers for each operation, to train monitoring personnel and to  develop cutting-edge monitoring equipment.             Customer Service   SySTEM IMPROVEMENT KEPCO continues to improve its customer-oriented operating system  to satisfy customer needs. By lowering the baseline of low-voltage  supplied customers from below 100kW down to below 50kW, the  customers pay less for power supply systems and are given wider  options to choose from. While electricity reserves were only allowed  for high-voltage supplied customers in the past, any customers, if  they want, can now be given electricity reserves.  KEPCOs customer-oriented operating system continues to evolve:  new power supply available within a shorter period of time than before,  no surety is needed when credit-healthy customers apply for electric  uses and so on. KEPCO will endeavor to respond to changes and satisfy  customer needs.     IT-bASED CuSTOMER SERVICE  KEPCO offers various IT services for the sake of customers  convenience. As a growing number of smart phone users need  a ubiquitous environment, KEPCO has established mobile cyber  centers in which customers can make customer service requests  and get access to information any time and any place.  Now any customer who wants electric services can apply online in  less time and for less money. Online applications for electric services in  2010 out of total applications stand at 32%.

Its future growth can be made overseas in the areas of thermoelectric power plants, nuclear power plants, renewable energies, resources  explorations, transmission systems, smart grids, and so on. KEPCOs 2020 target for overseas business is to attain USD 26 billion, or 30% of its  total sales target.    Nuclear Power On December 27 2009 for the first time in its history, KEPCO made  an 18.6 billion dollar nuclear power plant project deal with Emirates  Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC). Under the project, four Korean- type 1,400MW reactors will be built starting with No.1 reactor on May  1 2017 ending with No.4 reactor by 2020.   KEPCO has been gearing up for a successful completion of the  project since making the UAE nuclear deal: in 2010 it launched  UAE nuclear project task force to make contracts with private  companies and subcontractors, made UAE-customized designs,  embarked on making and purchasing main equipment, carried out  site-related activities like acquisition of permission, completion of  the construction site survey and building of construction offices and  supporting facilities, and applied for construction permission of UAE  Federal Authority For Nuclear Regulation (FANR).      On March 14 2011, KEPCO held a groundbreaking ceremony at the  site for UAE power plants.  Birds Eye View of UAE Nuclear Power Plants Advanced Power Reactor-1400 Overseas Business Continuously driving KEPCOs growth engine through  diversified overseas businesses.  31 ECONOmIC PErfOrmANCE   In the area of thermoelectric power in 2010, KEPCO won Mexicos  Norte II project which Mexicos state-owned power utility,  Commission Federal de Electrician (CFE), has awarded and will  be a 433MW combined-cycle power plant (CCPP). That is the first  project that KEPCO won in Central and South America. In the UAE  market, which is probably the most competitive market in the world  for private power builders, KEPCO won the UAE Shuweihat S3 CCPP  project. Now it has established itself as a global private power leader.  In the area of renewable energies, KEPCO acquired wind power  projects of Inner Mongolia, China with a 975MW capacity in 2009 and  an additional 246MW capacity in 2010. That proves to the world how  competitive KEPCO is in the wind power market.  Three overseas projects of about KRW 200 billion in sales in 2010  are expected to contribute not only to KEPCOs profitability but also  to its brand image as a global power builder. The expansion of the  Neimenggu wind power project has secured a 10 billion won carbon  credit per annum, which prevents global warming. UAE and Latin  America projects involving other Korean companies have created new  jobs related to construction and operation of power plants.    In the areas of thermoelectric power and renewable energies as of  2010, KEPCO operates 7 plants with a capacity of 2,602MW in China,  the Philippines, Lebanon and other countries, achieving KRW 659.9  Thermal and New & renewable Power  Generation  billion in sales with a 17% growth year after year.  KEPCO will try to focus on renewable energies with great growth  potential like wind power, photovoltaic power and geothermal power  while minimizing carbon emissions. KEPCO will also commercialize  technologies of eco-friendly thermoelectric power plants like  IGCC and CCS and be active in the hydroelectric power market  by capitalizing on affluent water resources of Latin America and  Southeast Asia.

For example, in 2010, KEPCOs six major initiatives including a  takeover of the Bylong mine in Australia have secured 24 million  tons of bituminous coal per year and another four projects including  acquisition of stakes in Canada-based Denison have acquired in  1,040 tons of uranium per annum, which has made KEPCOs self- sufficiency rate go up to 28%, 11% up from 17% in 2009.  Resource explorations offer a stable supply of fuels for power  generation and create extra profits arising from takeovers of  overseas mines.  KEPCOs resource explorations aim at KRW 5.4 trillion in sales, or a  60% self-sufficiency rate of bituminous coal and uranium by 2020.  In  order to get there, KEPCOs move will go beyond minority ownership,  operating mines by itself and investing not only in Australia and  Indonesia but North America for flaming coal and not only in Canada  but Africa, Europe and Central Asia for uranium. For the good of  stable resources supply and project risk management, the optimum  portfolio will be created per each investment area and each mining  development stage of exploration, development and production.

KEPCO, according to its vision, established development strategies  and a road map for major green technologies in order to lead a low  carbon green technology industry, and is committed to proactively  responding to climate change and to creating a new growth engine in  the electric power industry. In that regard, KEPCO plans to achieve goals of KRW 9 trillion  in sales in 2020, securing the worlds best 25 core technologies,  and CO2 reduction of 30% compared with the year 2000. To do  that, KEPCO will do its best to secure green technologies in their  early stages and successfully commercialize them by strategically  investing money of approximately KRW 3 trillion and by encouraging  researchers to do their jobs. To obtain the core technologies in the earlier stage, KEPCO is  intensively controlling project progress rate regarding technology  development. Consolidated progress rate in 2010 was 21.15% (29.3%  accumulated), and regular rolling about specific strategies is being  made through strategically-organized meetings for technology  development every quarter. In addition, for some tasks which technologies have already been  secured, such as developed infrastructure for battery charge  in electricity vehicles, we will set a specific business plan, and  furthermore, explore a new business item related to green  technologies.  Securing 25 World's best Technologies Achieve New Sales of KRW 9 trillion Reduce CO2 by 30%  compared with that of 2000   41 ENvIrONmENTAL PErfOrmANCE KRW 4,142.9  billion in Total  2.4% 0.9% 23.8% 72.8% KEPCO pushed forward an effort to substantially save energy in  accordance with the governments policies on energy reduction in  2010. To encourage employees to have energy-saving habits, weve  emphasized the importance of energy saving. For example, weve  designated certain periods for reducing energy consumption during  summer and winter. More specifically, we came up with improvement  measures through diverse activities including putting Eco-Life  Style in place (for example, compliance with an appropriate indoor  temperature), and detection of energy usage in offices so that we have  the foundation on which systemization of an energy saving scheme  and upgrading of energy efficiency can be possible. In addition, we  will gradually replace approximately 30% of all lighting facilities with  high-efficient LED-based lighting facilities by 2012. In line with the  replacement, entire lighting systems using incandescent and halogen  lights, which have the lowest energy efficiency will be replaced first,  and fluorescent lighting systems, mostly installed in offices, are being  replaced with LED according to the companys annual plan.  Environmental Impact of Company vehicles  KEPCO took steps to mitigate the environmental impact of company  vehicles. In 2010 the vehicle fleet totaled 3,178, up 21 vehicles from  the previous year. Of these, 1,738 were passenger cars, and 1,420  (81.7%) of these cars were eco-friendly models such as light and  hybrid vehicles. At least 80% of all newly purchased vehicles will be  light or hybrid models. Fuel consumption for company vehicles in  2010 was 7,163,000 liters, and fuel economy was 7.13 km/l. ENERGy & WATER SAVING EFFORTS IN 2010 Better Environmental Efficiency KEPCO always tries to improve environmental efficiency by joining forces to reduce energy consumption by  all employees while at the same time complying with laws and regulations related to the environment. Environmental Spending In 2010, total environmental spending calculated in accordance with  KEPCO's environmental accounting system was KRW 4,142.9 billion,  equivalent to 10% of total sales. Much of the outlay was intensively  invested in the procurement of construction of eco-friendly power  facilities and new & renewable energy equipment. In 2011, the  environmental accounting system will be firmly in place and be used  strategically, allowing top management and stakeholders to use  environmental accounting data in the decision-making process and  improve environmental value. Energy & Water Consumption reduction In 2010, KEPCO consumed 78,045TOE of energy and 1,014,000  tons of water in total. Thanks to the wider use of high-efficiency  equipment and more efficient use of facilities, we achieved the  energy intensity (energy consumption/electricity sales) of 0.195TOE/ GWh, which was a 0.001TOE/GWh lower than the target of 0.196TOE.  Water intensity was 2.58tons/GWh, down 0.02ton/GWh from 2009,  and no water was recycled; all was discharged.

ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENT The GENCOs acquired the ISO14001 certificate for all locations of  operation in 2009 and made environmental investments totaling  approximately KRW 460.6 billion in 2010.     CONSTRuCTION OF FACILITIES IN HARMONy WITH LOCAL  COMMuNITIES The GENCOs assess in advance how the construction or expansion  of power plants will impact the natural environment and traffic.  They also conduct post environmental impact assessments for five  years after construction is complete, reporting the results to the  government every year.   IMPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCy The GENCOs expanded the use of clean energy and operating  systems to reduce emissions of SOx, NOx and dust from the power  generation process.  The GENCOs has operating facilities that physically and chemically  treat wastewater for reuse or discharge. Moreover, 100% of the de- sulfurized gypsum generated from coal-fired power plants was  reused in cement. Efforts like these help encourage recycling in  society. In 2010, GENCOs installed de-NOx, de-sulfurization and dust  collecting facilities on every generator to minimize air pollution.  Therefore, CO2 emissions fell 5.9% year after year. Turning to water  quality, chemical oxygen demand (COD) decreased by 14.4% and  suspended solids (SS) fell by 14.7%. -14.4% COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) Reductions -14.7% SS (Suspended Solid) Reductions  SOx Unit: g/MWh 2008 179 2009 168 2010 159  NOx Unit: g/MWh 2008 308 2009 308 2010 295  Dust Unit: g/MWh 2008 10 2009 8 2010 8   AIR POLLuTANT EMISSIONS   COD Unit: g/MWh 2008 0.088 2009 0.160 2010 0.137  SS Unit: g/MWh 2008 0.041 2009 0.068 2010 0.058 WATER POLLuTANT EMISSIONS 2008 2010 2009 457 492 463 -5.9% CO2 Reductions CO2 Emissions Unit: kg/MWh  44 KEPCO Sustainability Report 2011 Transmission KEPCO constructed transmission and distribution facilities necessary  for a stable electric power supply and runs them in an effective  way. Also, diverse efforts are being made. For example, having  objectivity and transparency of site selection for electric facilities  in order to pursue an eco-friendly process of the transformation  of electricity, expansion of construction of eco-friendly electric  facilities harmonizing with local communities, reduction in loss rate  through transmission & distribution, protection of ecosystem, and  management of the magnetic field.   ObJECTIVE & TRANSPARENT SITE SELECTION PROCESS To increase objectivity and transparency of site selection for  construction of transmission & substation facilities, we expanded  the scope where sophisticated scientific techniques are needed, and  all construction businesses can be started after considering results  from a site selection survey conducted by residents since Jan. 2009. Objectivity and transparency are secured when it comes to decision  on site selection that is made in Site Selection Committee by local  residents, local government, district council, experts and etc. In addition, beginning in 2008, a presentation for residents prior to  starting a construction should be made, and expanding its targets  into all business projects just for  businesses that an environmental  impact assessment is required.  The Open House system was implemented in September 2010.   This system is designed for additional presentations for some  residents who do not attend the first presentation.   ECO-FRIENDLy CONSTRuCTION OF ELECTRIC POWER FACILITIES KEPCO continuously expands construction of eco-friendly electric  facilities by developing eco-friendly materials and construction  methods harmonized with the surrounding environment. By applying  the Spacer Wiring Method and Ground Method, we were able to  contribute to beautification of the environment thanks to reduction of  occupied areas where wiring is covered. And we make contributions  to protect the environment that was contaminated due to chemical  insulating oil using plant-based insulating oil transmission. In  addition, weve tried to revise construction laws and regulations,  especially by making space inside architectures on the ground to  improve the efficiency of resource utilization. By doing so, we were  able to eliminate obstructions to walking caused by equipment  installed on the ground, and improve landscape at the same time.  In addition, we implemented a Clean-Up Day campaign, cleaning  electric facilities on the ground to make a contribution to eco-friendly  operations of electrical facilities.   EFFORTS TO LOWER T/D LOSS By developing and distributing high efficiency devices and equipment  such as low loss wiring and transmitters and by maximizing capacity  of transmission and distribution lines, we are doing our part to  reduce the loss rate of electric power. As a result, we reduced the  loss rate of transmission and distribution to 3.99%, the lowest in the  world, and the need for construction of the additional generation  facilities, while at the same time contributing to reduction in the  emissions of green house gases.    ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD AND ECOSySTEM PROTECTION As electromagnetic field generating from electric facilities has  low frequency of 60Hz, it does not deliver electricity far away, and  electric power is sharply lower depending on distances. KEPCO,  for the sake of operation of the safe electric facilities, operate them  with a relatively low level, one sixth of that set in electric industry in  Korea. In addition, to relieve conflicts and anxiety against safety of  the electromagnetic field, and to provide exact information for the  people, we run a webpage (www.emfsafe.kr) about the industry and  Understanding Promotion Hall, and implemented a Measurement  Service System about the electromagnetic field. In addition, we  do continuous research to discover scientific findings about the  electromagnetic field, manage their policies in a systematic manner  and gather opinions through diverse channels. The total area of  electric power facilities in ecosystem protection areas is 48km2, and  we banned the construction of new transmission lines in designated  ecosystem protection areas to help maintain bio-diversity. 38  Environmental Management Expectations 39  Environmental Management System 40  Development of Low-Carbon Green Power Technologies 41  Better Environmental Efficiency 42  Eco-Friendlier Power Supply Chain 46  Resource Recycling and Hazardous Substance Control 47  Response to the Convention on Climate Change 49  GHG Reduction Efforts    Downtown Underground Transmission Facilities  Unit: % 2008 97.4 2009 97.7 2010 97.4  Underground Distribution Facilities  Unit: % 2008 13.3 2009 13.8 2010 14.3  T/D Loss  Unit: % 11.40 1971 2010 2001 1991 1981 6.69 5.46 4.50 3.99  45 ENvIrONmENTAL PErfOrmANCE Sales KEPCO has been committed to the stable supply of electric power  through proactive and systematic demand control and endeavored to  raise the efficiency of equipment, contributing to the nation's energy  conservation policies. Through demand control, KEPCO reduced or  distributed 3,151MW during peak demand; a figure is equivalent to  the construction of three 1,000MW nuclear units and covering 86% of  the nation's total demand.   EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PEAK DEMAND We designate 15 days for controlling the demand for electricity for  a certain period when demand for electricity is high. As a result,  we reduced 1,648MW on Friday 29th August, 2010, the peak day  of all seasons and 956MW per day on average by implementing  a Period Forecast System for the first time in January, 2010. In  response to changed circumstances on supply and demand, we  introducedFlexibleOperationSystemforForecastTargetthat control operational factors such as implementing timing and the  required amount of reduction thereby increasing effectiveness of load  management. Also, when it comes to managing  electric demand  in an efficient manner, we accomplished a goal of reduction of  3,151MW in total by expanding distribution of remote control system  for heating and cooling inside the building.   HIGHER ELECTRICITy uSE EFFICIENCy As part of the efforts to achieve low-carbon green growth, KEPCO  expanded the use of new high-efficiency equipment such as LED  lighting. In 2010, we started to introduce LED illumination and LED  emergency lighting and expand an intelligent illumination auto- control system. We also strengthened our targeted marketing to  integrate eco-friendly high-efficient devices in the design from the  beginning of construction based on closer relationship with public  enterprises in the construction industry. With the wider use of high- efficiency devices, we lowered power consumption by 378,613MWh,  translating into a reduction of 160,529 tons in CO2 emissions. In the future, we will continue flexible demand control in connection  with the electricity reserve and establish a web-based system for  regular demand control. We will also remain committed to the wider  use of eco-friendly, high-efficiency devices.

This is part of an  ongoing effort to address global environmental issues, fulfill social  responsibilities for environment preservation. Most waste materials  are from the transmission and distribution sector, and include  concrete power poles, transmission towers, insulators and electric  cable. They are highly valuable as resources. Currently we maintain  100% recycling rate and will continue to find new ways to recycle  waste equipment and materials.   GREEN PuRCHASING Purchasing eco-friendly products is a priority. In 2010, we purchased  KRW 7.2 billion worth of eco-friendly products, accounting for 91.5%  of total related supplies. Going forward, we plan to add additional  items to eco-mark labeled suppliers in the pre-qualification process  and expand green purchasing in various ways.   CONTROL OF PCbs KEPCO deals with accumulated quantities of wasted transformers  by forming an additional task force team to completely eradicate Poly  Chlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), and establishes a PCBs controlling  program to handle it safely. The accumulated amount of 500,666  fleets to be analyzed, and 153,209 fleets to be dealt with has been  done. Therefore, almost of all of the piled waste transformers has  been controlled. We will continue to make this effort to manage  PCBs in a safe and thorough manner ranging from removal, storage,  analysis, disposal, selling of transformers. 91.5% Puechasing Portion of Eco-Friendly Products Resource Recycling & Hazardous Substance Control KEPCO fulfills its responsibilities to respond to environmental regulations and conserve the environment  through recycling of resources, purchasing of green products, and control over hazardous materials.

However, Korea can now  be included among the Annex 1 countries under the post Kyoto  climate regime, which becomes effective from 2013. The electric  power industry accounted for approximately 29% of CO2 emissions. If  Korea is obliged to reduce GHG emissions, it will have a huge impact  on KEPCO operations. Against this backdrop, KEPCO and the six  GENCOs are considering the change as a new opportunity as well as  an operational risk; striving further to ensure effective response. KEPCO and the GENCOs re-organized and expanded the existing  Climate Change Collaboration Committee to form the Technology  & Climate Change Collaboration Committee. This is part of the  efforts to be proactive in preserving the earths environment and  establishing a sustainable energy system in line with a changing  energy paradigm (Jun. 2008). The Committee is chaired by the CTO  of KEPCO and attended by top management of the GENCOs. Two  working-level groups on climate and environment change, and  renewable energy are in place under the Committee.  In July 2005, KEPCO and the GENCOs signed an agreement with the  Korean government regarding the supply of renewable energy. The  agreement called for a KRW 520 billion investment in renewable energy  facilities with a 63MW output equivalent over 3 years (2006-2008).  During the second term of the contract (2009-2011), we will invest a  total of KRW 1.2 trillion in facilities with a total capacity of 503MW.

The CDM program registered by KEPCO is the 1st of its kind in the power distribution category among the 3,497 CDM programs currently  registered with the UN. SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) gas is mostly used in circuit breakers and switches found in power transmission or distribution networks because of its excellent  electric insulation property. It is harmless to human beings but accelerates global warming with global warming index that is 23,900 times greater than CO2.  The CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) program aims to earn marketable carbon credits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Distribution Sector  SF6 Gas Emission Reduction CDM Program seeks to retrieve at least 97% of SF6 gas, which used to be released into the air when distribution switches were  discarded, and recycle it after refining it to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically. KEPCO expects revenue of KRW 30 billion from carbon credit sales  for the next 10 years by reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 150,000 tons every year with SF6 gas retrieval/recycling technology. Likewise, refined SF6 gas  can be recycled into gas-insulated distribution switches, etc., which will translate into the further reduction of SF6 gas procurement costs by KRW 2.5 billion.  The CDM program is made more meaningful by the fact that KEPCO implements the program exclusively with home-grown technologies without relying on  technology or funding from other developed countries and owns 100% of the carbon credits to be earned.  In the meantime, KEPCO plans to utilize the CDM program not only to avoid management risks resulting from the greenhouse gas emission reduction  obligation following 2013 but also to make a dent in the global CDM market such as Southeast Asia, based on its CDM implementation know-how and lead the  CDM business with SF6 retrieval and recycling technology. KEPCO intends to develop a master plan to ensure a systematic CDM implementation and establish  a working group by allowing both in-house and global experts in power transformation and distribution to participate in, and come up with mid- to long-term  strategies covering CDM program development in Korea and elsewhere in the world, carbon asset management system, and carbon credit trading.

In 2010, GHG emissions from the KEPCO group, which includes the  six GENCOs, totaled 182 million tons, 2 million tons of which came  from KEPCO. KEPCO's emissions are mainly direct SF6 emissions  and indirect emissions from T&D loss. In 2007, we established a GHG Emission Data System in accordance  with international standards and in October 2008 system reliability  was verified through the GHG inventory on emission statistics  control and emission volume (KEMCO GHG Certification Office). For the first time as a public enterprise, we acquired a carbon  footprint certificate from the Ministry of Environment, showing the  CO2 equivalent for GHG emissions from T&D lines. Meanwhile,  KEPCO has been operating an online GHG control system at the  group level in a bid to collect and provide accurate GHG emission  data since February 2010.  KEPCO is also promoting the CDM business at home and abroad as  a way to proactively cope with the Convention on Climate Change. For  example, our wind power business in China has brought a carbon  credit of 940,000 tons. In Korea, we acquired a carbon credit of  150,000 tons per annum through gas-recovery equipment to reduce  SF6 used for switch insulation.

We will do our part to give more satisfaction to  customers, provide a good working environment for executives and employees, try to establish a future- oriented relationship between labor and management, and more importantly, we will play a key role in  strengthening relationships with partners for mutual cooperation and common growth, and in reaching out to  the needy in local communities to make a better society to live in together.    52 KEPCO Sustainability Report 2011 Protection of Customer rights and Interests KEPCO runs a Customer Satisfaction Advisory Committee, a  Customer Panel and an Advisory Committee to protect the rights and  interests of customers and to manage its businesses based on the  needs of customers. To facilitate such committees, we communicate  with customers through a regular dialogue channel to build close  relationships with customers.  With regard to a stable use of consolidated VOC system, we  introduced the VOC operational index by each business area, and an  alarm system to analyze VOC daily/monthly/quarterly/yearly so that  we reflect the needs of customers on a regular basis. In addition, we  run a Customer Suggestion program in a cyber office all year to live  up to current IT trends such as use of the Internet, spread of mobile  devices and do on. In 2010, we accepted 175 cases of customer  suggestions so that we were able to improve our sales system  accordingly. In the meantime, we operate a Power Consumption Consulting  System (PCCS) to provide information on electricity consumed in  real time and how to analyze for high-voltage supplied customers. In  2011, we expanded the use of PCCS to operate the i-SMART system  so that we are able to provide information on the consumed amount  and fares, thereby inducing efficient electricity use and fare saving. KEPCO conducts its own customer satisfaction survey two times  a year to provide high quality services for customers. The results  and feedback of the survey have been utilized in improving the  quality of services. In addition to that, we reflected the changed  conditions related to services on the site. For example, we improved  the monitoring system measuring services on the customer level,  improved the environment where electricity services are provided so  that we were able to satisfy customers needs. As a result, KEPCO  has gained a reputation of the highest level for 12 consecutive  years in the survey of customer satisfaction in the category of public  enterprises, presented by the government in 2010. Shareholder value management KEPCO posted a record USD 61.4 billion net loss in 2009 and 2010, as  the management of the environment aggravated such as increased  fuel costs according to a series of hikes in energy prices. Therefore,  we were not able to pay a dividend for 3 years in a row despite a high  dividend payout ratio of 20% in the past. However, we made great  efforts to meet the shareholders right to know and to recover our  corporate reliability by conducting diverse IR activities regarding  our management status, such as IR by management, investment  presentation, conference calls to announce performance results,  interviews with investors and so forth. As a result, KEPCO was rated  A1, the same rating as the Korean government, by Moodys in April  2010. KEPCO Cyber Branch Strengthening Partnership with Stakeholders  KEPCO commits to pursue a sustainable development in our society by considering  the ways to achieve a win-win growth in cooperation with interested parties in every activity.

To  this end, we make public key information in various ways, including  management disclosure, integrated disclosure, corporate disclosure  and information disclosure.   CORPORATE DISCLOSuRE We pursue proactive corporate disclosure in order to meet the  principle of Meeting Right to Know in line with strengthened rights  to speak by minority shareholders, and to respond to the changing  trend of corporate disclosure that contributes to investor protection  and a fairness of stock price. KEPCO was selected as Excellent  Enterprise in Corporate Governance organized by Korea Exchange  and Korea Corporate Governance Service for 3 consecutive years  from 2008 to 2010 by playing a leading role in contributing to creating  an environment for faithful disclosure.   INFORMATION DISCLOSuRE  KEPCO will commit to promoting the peoples right to know by  improving customer reliability based on a transparent working  process, having a guarantee of peoples right to know, and through  active information disclosure. In 2010, a total of 327 requests were received for information  disclosure and 283 of these were accepted.  The remaining 44 requests were subjects that should be confidential  in accordance with Public Information Act law of public institutions. Win-Win Growth with Suppliers KEPCO is strengthening our mutually-beneficial collaboration with  SMEs in an attempt to improve global competitiveness and pursue  win-win growth.   SuPPORT FOR ExPORT by SMEs As a result of intensive export marketing towards overseas offices,  KEPCO achieved contracts worth approximately USD 19.14 million  for construction projects in 12 countries including UAE, Finland and  others in cooperation with as many as 112 small and medium sized  companies in winning the contracts. This accomplishment was 4  times greater compared with that of USD 4.77 million in 2009. In  addition, we are now conducting a business of installing manhole  surveillance systems through a supply line to the National Assembly  in the USA in association with export businesses of research  results done by SMEs in a cooperative way. In addition to that, we  are expanding a basis for export by SMEs by utilizing the brand  image of KEPCO, for example, we helped 3 companies conclude  contracts of MOU for exports worth of USD 5 million as a result of  support for international exhibition in the area of electricity, and  holding the Inward Export Mission (IEM). KEPCO is now intensifying  the promotional effort about our export support business of SMEs  by exploring cooperative development business items, holding  presentations (2 times, for 165 companies) about SMEs-led projects  such as overseas marketing, holding presentations (4 times, for 190  companies) promoting support for overseas expansion by SMEs,  gathering bidding information on overseas initiatives, and operating  an English web site about supplier information and so on.

We take the lead  in promoting win-win growth with SMEs by efficiently utilizing the  Public Procurement System and by establishing a common growth  management system through expanded procurement targets, for  example, products worth about KRW 4 trillion (increased KRW 107.6  billion compared with the previous year) developed and manufactured  by SMEs, by supporting KRW 327.9 billion for production fund such  as the Network Loan in 2010.     IMPROVED SuPPLIER SATISFACTION KEPCO strives to improve the satisfaction of partners by  supplementing plans and systems by gathering various opinions  from equipment suppliers. In 2010, we provided quality consulting  services for the manufacturing plants of 8 suppliers to teach them  about the ISO9001 Upgrade, quality control methods and others. We  also improved a system to offer every facility for users by applying  an interface system for procurement prices between ERP and  SRM, automatic conversion system for EDMS standardization, OTP  certification (tightened security, output and etc.), and by installing  multidirectional dialogue channels (like SMS, E-mail and etc,).  Therefore KEPCOs partners satisfaction has been increased since  2007. In particular, satisfaction in the working process in 2010  was 95.1 scores, up 0.6 from 94.5 in 2009. The result of partner  satisfaction surveys is reflected in the working process thereby  leading a cooperative system for win-win growth.  In addition, amid increased demand to join efforts to enhance the  human rights of employees of partners, we include audit items about  human rights into the list that is used for partners evaluation while  the bidding process is done. In 2010, the number of cases of human  rights evaluations was 506, accounting for approximately 10% of all  4,924 cases. Also, when we evaluate competency of partners, we give  partners, showing excellent performance, 2 extra points by evaluating  employment performance on the vulnerable, including the disabled  and women workforce partners.        FAIR CONTRACTING PROCESS  To eradicate irrationalities in the process of signing contracts in  advance, and to create a transparent contract culture, KEPCO is  improving systems continuously. In 2010, we established a system  with which real-time monitoring and surveillance over partners  who engaged in unfair business practices while a qualification  audit about bidders is done and contracts are written in order  not to sign a contract with partners that got punished against  unfair trade practices within 2 years. To prevent bidding collusion,  we implemented systems of 1 person to 1 company bidding  representative and an identification process through fingerprint  verification using an electronic bidding system with the Public  Procurement Service. And we also implemented a system to liquidate  damage against bid-rigging for the first time in January 2011. By  doing so, we are not able to sign a contract with unfair companies  so that we can establish a transparent contract culture, and prevent  possibilities of corruption in advance. In addition, we made progress  on improved customer satisfaction by resolving inconveniences that  bidders could face the process of using the electric bidding system.   120 Financial Supports for SMEs (KRW 100 million) 52  Strengthening Partnership with Stakeholders 56  Social Contributions 59  Respect for Human Rights 60  Employee Safety and Welfare 61  Human Resource Development  Financial Supports for SMEs  Unit: KRW 100 million Supportive Areas 2008 2009 2010 Joint R&D 52 41  35 Quality Competitiveness 2  3  1 Overseas Marketing 12  5  9 Management Support 10  12 11 Information Technology Development 35  2  -  Heavy Electric Equipment Technology Development Fund Loan 91  105  64 Total 202  168  120  Supplier Satisfaction  Unit: Points 2008 93.3 2009 94.5 2010 95.1  E-Procurement Trend Unit: % 2008 98.8 2009 99.1 2010 99.7  No. of Screenings of Human Rights  Item  2008  2009  2010  No. of PQs  6,289  5,802  4,924  No. of Screenings  789  717  506  Rate (%)  12.5  12.4  10.3   55 SOCIAL PErfOrmANCE Contributing to the Nation & Society KEPCO is fulfilling its responsibilities for the nation and society by  sincerely paying taxes, creating new jobs, and establishing a fair  trade culture.  First of all, we are actively participating in initiatives pursued by  the government such as continuous job creation as part of solving  unemployment among young people, expansion of women and the  disabled in the workforce. In 2010, we hired 132 new employees and  1,008 for internships, and the numbers of displaced workers was 32.  In the meantime, salary of the newly-employed workers against legal  minimum wage in 2010 was approximately 237% (excluding annual  leave and a portion of annual salary based on performance).   KEPCOs amount of tax payment in 2010 was KRW 34.4 billion, not  including donated amounts to political parties and organizations, and  grants received from the government.  KEPCO complies with laws and regulations related to a fair trade  to establish a fair and free trade order, and no punishment such as  penalty or non-financial restriction has been imposed according to  violation of relevant laws.  Joint Growth of KEPCO Group Companies KEPCO Group companies pursue win-win competition based on  decentralized, accountable management. They have established a  collaborative system for domestic and overseas projects that require  synergy within the electric power industry.  We are also seeking an economic supply of power generation fuels,  closer R&D collaboration, joint participation in overseas projects and  joint response against climate change to ensure a stable supply of  electricity and enhance the capacity of all group companies.

We are  also fulfilling CSR as a global company by sponsoring free medical  services, scholarships and providing support for communities near  power plants. In the Philippines, KEPCO has been involved in a project to promote  electrification in agricultural and fishing villages, a priority of  the Filipino government. To accelerate progress, we support line  extension from the on-grid side and photovoltaic power generation  from the off-grid side.  KEPCO has continuously worked to provide fair opportunities to  local workers in terms of employment and promotion, and we  are committed to respecting the human rights of employees in  accordance with local laws and regulations. 3 2 1 1  Free Medical Service in the Philippines  2  Taekwondo Training Service in the Philippines 3  Marine Environmental Clean-up in the Philippines 32,179 Participants for Social Contributions (Persons) 52  Strengthening Partnership with Stakeholders 56  Social Contributions 59  Respect for Human Rights 60  Employee Safety and Welfare 61  Human Resource Development   Wages of Local Employees and the Ratio of Local Managers     in the Overseas  Item Country 2008 2009 2010 Legal Minimum Wage/  Initial Wage  (KRW 10 thousand/month) Philippines 19/32 23/44  24/32  Jordan  -  26/163  26/163  Ratio of Local Managers (%) Philippines 43.8 47.3  50  Jordan  -  11  11  Status of Local Employment  Unit: Person Item 2008 2009 2010  Philippines 277 305  314  Jordan  -  9  11  Philippines Item 2008 2009 2010 Medical Service 8 times (9,210 persons)   10 times (7,162 persons)   13 times (8,596 persons)  Scholarship 33 schools (7,210 students)   51 times (11,470 students)  66 times (12,888 students)  Support for Power  Plant Neighborhood 98 times (25,910 persons)  173 times (22,135 persons)   285 times (28,871 persons)     Project for Promotion of Electrification in Agricultural and Fishing Villages  in the Philippines  Item  Result  On-grid (Line Extension)   484 Project completed (Jan. 2011)  Off-grid (Photovoltaic Power Generation)  270 Project completed (Jan. 2011)  59 SOCIAL PErfOrmANCE   DISCRIMINATION ERADICATION We have pledged not to discriminate on the grounds of gender,  educational background, religion, age, and disabilities in Chapter  5 (Employee Ethics) of our Code of Ethics. We also faithfully abide  by ILO Convention No. 111 Concerning Discrimination In Respect  of Employment and Occupation. None of our operations inside  or outside Korea have a record of human rights violations or  discrimination on grounds of gender or disabilities.   GENDER EQuALITy KEPCO is working towards gender equality in various ways such  as eliminating discriminatory factors in terms of employment  and promotion, and operating a Counseling Center for women  employees. We have a quota for women employment, and 42% of all  persons hired in 2010 were woman, raising the ratio of women in the  workforce. Moreover, the number of women employees with the rank  of assistant general manager or higher rose from only 7 in 2000 to 78  in 2010. We strictly comply with ILO Convention No. 100 Concerning Equal  Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value.     SuPPORT FOR COExISTENCE WITH WORK AND HOME KEPCO pushes ahead to improve the quality of life of its employees  by implementing diverse systems like family-friendly programs such  as promoting child birth and child raising, family support and family  harmony campaign, and by providing benefits for employees so  that our companys goal of becoming a good corporate workplace,  contributing to creating an environment where work at the company  and building a good family can be possible. In particular, for the sake  of resolving the problem of low birth rate on the national level, we  establish a Pool System for substitute personnel against those who  apply for maternity leave for child birth and child rising to encourage  employees to enjoy maternity leave. More specifically, we allow  our employees to arrange their commuting time, to reduce their  working time during the caring for their child. And having a couple  of days off for prenatal diagnosis and taking a leave of absence from  work because of sterility are given to our employees. Through such  exceptional benefits that are much higher than that guaranteed by  law, we had the rate of leave for child-caring of 73%, and birth rate of  1.63 in total of KEPCO in 2010 so that we realize good results when it  comes to creating a family-friendly climate.    Respect for Human Rights KEPCOs pursuit of protection of human rights and gender equality and  leader in realizing a fair culture without discrimination.   HuMAN RIGHTS EDuCATION KEPCO provides education on human rights issues to irregular  and newly-hired employees to foster a corporate culture based on  respect for people and non-discrimination. In 2010, a total of 19,433 employees including 683 irregular and newly  hired employees attended this education, and all employees have  classroom or online training at least once a year. In addition, human  rights education was given to all 486 counselors working in the  branch offices through professional training or itinerant education.  We will continue to provide training and education to ensure gender  equality and respect for human rights.   HIRING THE VuLNERAbLE TO EMPLOyMENT KEPCO hired 520 workers with disabilities in 2010. Workers with  disabilities receive 10% additional points in the employment  process. We will continue to increase the number of employees  with disabilities, for example, by enhancing working conditions for  the disabled and by developing an occupational range specifically- designated for the disabled.    At the same time, we give preferential treatment in hiring those who  major in science and engineering to achieve a target set since 2004.  The employment rate for workers in science and engineering was  72.7% in 2010.   PREVENTION OF FORCED LAbOR AND CHILD LAbOR KEPCO abides by the Labor Standards Act, ILO Convention No. 105  Concerning Abolition of Forced Labor, and the Labor Standards, one  of the UN Global Compact's 10 Principles, and no operation has a  record of forced labor.   DEALING WITH EMPLOyEE GRIEVANCES In line with improvement of the quality of life by resolving grievances  at work, KEPCO established diverse communication channels  including the On-line HR Grievance Handling System, CEO Hotline,  Labor-Management Grievance Handler System and Women  Workforce Support Portal. In 2010, 103 cases were reported in total  through the HR Grievance Handling System, 97 of them were dealt  with.   CuSTOMER PRIVACy PROTECTION We have implemented technical security measures such as web  firewalls and system access control to protect customer privacy  information and prevent illegal data leaks. We also provide regular  education on the importance of privacy protection.  60 KEPCO Sustainability Report 2011   MuTuAL TRuST bETWEEN LAbOR-MANAGEMENT KEPCO believes in labor relations built on mutual trust and respect. We promoted communication between labor and management  through the Labor-Management Council (four times) and laid the  foundation for mutual trust by delivering a presentation on the  company status 232 times at the branch level and providing key  management information to the labor union weekly. KEPCO complies with ILO Convention No. 87 Concerning Freedom  of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize and ILO  Convention No. 98 concerning the Application of the Principles of the  Right to Organize and to Bargain Collectively. In 2010, 14,892 (75.6%)  employees out of a workforce of 119,710 belong to the union. The  collective agreement is renewed every two years and applied to all  employees.   SAFETy AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT KEPCO convenes the Occupational Safety and Health Committee,  which is composed of 10 labor and management representatives.  We also strive to achieve the goal of zero industrial accidents and  improve the health of all employees through field-based safety  management. In addition, we control overall affairs regarding safety management  thanks to diverse channels. For instance, by developing advanced  new types of safety devices and equipment, by introducing  Occupational Health & Safety Management System (KOSHA18001  and etc.) and expanding its application.  In 2010, one employee was involved in an industrial accident (a  0.005% accident rate) and no cases of occupational illness were  reported.   CuSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETy  KEPCO works to strengthen preventive campaigns in construction  sites along with promotional activities concerning electrical safety  aimed at all citizens by using advertisements such as CATV or  outdoor billboards using LED lights. To urge customers to safely use  electricity, we prevent the possible occurrence of electrical fires and  electric shock by detecting electrical facilities that customers are  using. We will diversify our safety activities to protect both customers  health and their wellbeing.      HEALTH MANAGEMENT We have operated a prevention-focused health management  program to improve the employee health and ensure vitality in the  workplace. The program is also applied to the families of employees.  A total of 10,188 employees and 659 spouses took a blood test and  thorough medical checkup in 2010. In addition, vaccinations against  influenza were provided to 7,001 employees.  We provide employees with a health consultation program after the  medical checkup.   bETTER bENEFITS KEPCO makes an effort to increase welfare satisfaction of executives  and employees to facilitate vitality of the organization. We upgraded  our loan system of livelihood stabilization into an urgent loan system  in which employees can respond to urgent situations such as natural  disasters, rare diseases, traffic accidents, etc. Even for employees  facing natural disasters, we decided to improve compensation plans  and scheme by increasing our limit of compensation amounts. Also,  we conduct a survey on welfare satisfaction on a regular basis to  reflect the needs of employees. Therefore, the result of the welfare  satisfaction survey targeting employees in 2010 was 70 out of 100.    OuTPLACEMENT  Korean society is aging, and life after employment is emerging as  a social issue. In line with this, KEPCO has provided outplacement  training consisting of seven programs, 26 subjects that cover  change management, asset management and business startup for  employees slated for retirement. The programs are provided both  on-and off-line to ensure accessibility and efficiency, significantly  helping employees be prepared for their life after leaving KEPCO. A  total of 153 retiring employees took this program in 2010. Employee Safety and Welfare  KEPCO makes efforts to build close labor relations based on mutual trust and respect,  and to create a corporate culture of communication and harmony.

These qualities were incorporated with  company-wide competencies, leadership competencies and  strategic job competencies. Nine core competencies have been  identified, including an achievement-oriented attitude, flexibility,  and teamwork. Company-wide competencies are identified as  execution, professionalism and collaboration. KEPCO will take such  qualifications as a standard for hiring personnel and development of  human resources.    HRD ROADMAP KEPCO set up a roadmap for nurturing the right people for global  operations by 2020. To this end, we have devised a mid-/long-term  plan for human resources development as part of efforts to secure  talented people. RedefinitionofKEPCOIdealEmployee EstablishmentofCompetencymodel& Competency-based HRD System     -  Common Competency, Leadership  Competency, Strategic Job  Competency DefinitionofProfessionaltalent,Core talent and recruiting process, etc.     -  Overseas Business/Green Growth/ Domestic Business Professionals Establishmentofplantosecure talented people RedesignofTrainingCoursestoSecure Global Talent EnhancementofCoreValuesEducation, Leadership training and Learning  Organization  ImprovementofKEPCOAcademy curriculum HRD PLAN Vision Ideal Employee HRD Goal HRD Task Global Talent with Ability to Create the Future Global Top Green & Smart Energy Pioneer Building Talent &  Performance-based HRD Establishing Enterprise-wide  HRD System Learning System Redesign Human Resource Development Through evaluation, rewards, a fair competition based on competencies and performances,  KEPCO is committed to nurturing globally-specialized human resources combining passion and executive talent.  Workshop for New Employees       62 KEPCO Sustainability Report 2011   EDuCATION AND TRAINING KEPCO has created a talent pool dedicated to overseas projects to  nurture global professionals, providing them with apprenticeship- based OJT and a year of full-time education (IB-MBA). In addition, we  are operating programs to enhance job competencies and improving  the mentoring system and strengthening the simulation training  program. Meanwhile, we have expanded our blended-learning, which combines  on- and off-line programs to ensure efficient education and training.  We have provided information on major training & education  programs and feedback on performance through a training portal  system.   PERFORMANCE EVALuATION KEPCO has evaluated the performance of all employees per year and  paid a performance bonus based on the outcome of the evaluation.  We also adopted an open competition-based placement system  that fills available positions with successful applicants via open  competition.  KEPCO will commit to strengthening employees capability  through a fair assessment about their performances and capability  development and to creating a performance-based corporate culture. +17.7 Education & Training Hours (yoy, Hour/Person) 1  KEPCO Academy e-Learning 2  New Employee Training 3  Job Training 2 3 1 52  Strengthening Partnership with Stakeholders 56  Social Contributions 59  Respect for Human Rights 60  Employee Safety and Welfare 61  Human Resource Development  Training Courses  Item  Internal Training Professional  Training  Total   Classroom  Online  No. of Courses  202  81  191  474  No. of Persons 9,198  163,076  4,021  176,295   Training Budget and Hours Item 2008  2009  2010  Education & Training Expense Relative to Total Sales (%) 0.16 0.15  0.13  Education & Training Hours a year (Hour/Person) 92.8 62.6  80.3  APPEnDIx  64   Third Party Review 67   GRI Index 70   ISO26000 Index 71   Financial Information 72   KEPCO Group Companies 74   Power Grid Map 75   Awards Received & Initiatives Joined 75   National & International Memberships in Associations 76   Glossary 77   Global Network 78   Additional Information  64 Third  Party  Review    Steady and further progress has been made regarding contents and formats of Sustainable  Management Report  KEPCO has continuously made efforts to enhance the quality of the Sustainable Management Report, especially in its content  and format by reflecting advice and recommendations received from external experts, therefore great progress has been made.  Suggestions from experts are reflected in this years report and furthermore, other content is significantly improved, indicating  that KEPCOs efforts to pursue sustainable management are not going to stop. In other words, KEPCO can be a good model  to other companies that do not yet publish their Sustainable Management Reports. However, to make these strenuous efforts  lead to sustainable and practical results, we believe that a certain organization or division needs to be formed as a permanent  body to push forward its clear vision and commitment to a sustainable management system.     KEPCOs philosophy and vision about sustainable management become clear and find their right  direction.  In this seventh report published by KEPCO, its clear philosophy and vision towards sustainable management structure are  described as one of the world class electricity companies. In that regard, we look forward to more clearly establishing KEPCOs  own management philosophies in the eighth report next year. In addition, KEPCO, as a leading company, will commit to  enhancing ethical standards of global corporate management by proposing heightened goals and performance targets from  environmental and ethical management perspectives.        KEPCO plays a leading role in pursuing labor-management culture based on gender equality and  mutual reliability. KEPCO realizes the concept of gender equality inside the organization through expansion of new recruits in the female  workforce and promotional benefits, and makes a road to establishing a family-oriented corporate culture by strengthening  financial support necessary for childbirth and child-rearing. In addition, a trust-based labor and management culture  established over a long period of time represents KEPCOs pride. We believe, therefore, that KEPCOs cooperative and  mutually-friendly labor relations can be served as a good model for all corporations.     Efforts to secure safety of nuclear power plants should be strengthened. Alerts and concerns over potential risks of nuclear power plants are getting attention around the world partly due to the  massive explosion of nuclear power plants in Japan. The accidents were a good chance to realize possible consequences we  face if proper control and management is not done, even if nuclear power plants have advantages, for instance, generating  significant amount of electricity with relatively less costs. Since nuclear power plant businesses require long-term periods to  make plans, for example, several decades, serious consideration and thorough plans should be prerequisites to secure safety  of nuclear power plants at home and abroad.

In particular, we believe that KEPCOs economic, environmental and social performance are described in the simplest way by  pointing out important issues compared with its previous report. The following shows strengths of this years report. First, seriousness assessment procedure organized to identify issues of interested parties has been done in an objective  manner, and the issues selected through the procedure reflected requirements of the parties concerned.    Second, from an environmental performance perspective, it is positively viewed that progress from diverse aspects has been  made, for example, quantitative measurement of environmental costs based on a newly-introduced environmental accounting  system, measurement of performance on eco-friendly electricity supply chain. Third, we believe that social performance achieved through a strengthened partnership with interested parties showed  KEPCOs efforts focusing on public interest, and the results are appropriately reflected economic performance.    KEPCOs Sustainability Report that intends to become a Global Top Energy Corporation has  competitiveness as a global-scale report in terms of its format and structure, while at the same time it should  be supplemented as follows.  First, diverse efforts and performance should be supplemented and upgraded, for example, scope of management risks,  management system, and responding organizations that are supposed to include a globally-recognized sustainable  management framework.   Second, from the aspects of corporate governance and sustainability, assessment results from internal and external  organizations, for example, Corporate Governance Service, represent the reports objectiveness and comparability with other  global companies. Therefore, proactive utilization of such assessment organizations is recommended.   Third, it is recommended that resources invested in the process of pursuing green growth policies and their results should  be compared and analyzed by each business area, and specifically reflected in the report. We are certain that if global-level  activities in such areas as labor, human rights, anti-corruption and ethical management are supplemented, a Sustainable  Management Report with more sharpened competitiveness can be published.

Since KEPCO joined UN Global Compact in 2005, this is the 7th Sustainability Report to be published. We have committed  to fulfilling our responsibilities as a corporate citizen based on financial growth, ethical management, win-win growth and  social contribution. Such strenuous KEPCO efforts have been recognized all over the world. In particular, our performance  in sustainable management has been proven. For example, our report was selected as UN Global Compact Notable COP for  2 consecutive years (08 to 09). Now as a company contributing to active communication with society and improvement of the  quality of life based on our sustainable management capacity, KEPCOs commitment and efforts are well described in this 2011  Sustainability Report.   More efforts should be made to move forward with society and to give more benefits to people. Through this advisory process, we were able to see how strong KEPCOs commitment and efforts are as a company living with  society. KEPCO has already acquired world class level of technological prowess and management capability and has played a  leading role in strengthening our industrial competitiveness, and more importantly, has established a sustainable management  system equivalent to a global standard. However, we would like to call on KEPCO to make heightened efforts to carry out  their responsibilities. We look forward to seeing that KEPCO demonstrate its unprecedented roles and leadership from the  sustainable management and social contribution perspectives.      We hope that KEPCO contributes to make a bright World with Light and a Happy World with Love. It is well known that KEPCOs efforts regarding customer satisfaction and social contribution activities have been nothing  like other companies. KEPCOs sustainable management include not only basic factors like technology, environment and  management, but also emotional feelings like hopes and dreams that can be prevailed both with customers and society. We  believe KEPCO will present a higher standard of sustainable management as a company that wants to grow along with society.  We are certain that KEPCOs vision of Global Top Green & Smart Energy Pioneer will be fully accomplished.
