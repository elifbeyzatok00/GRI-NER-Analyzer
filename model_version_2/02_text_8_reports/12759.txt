The prize recognises that MHI had made significant progress in securing and building export markets and exports 80% of its  organic and premium salmon to Europe, USA and Japan. Jan Feenstra, Managing Director of MHI received the award from  the Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation. Marine Harvest Ireland employs 255 staff, mainly in rural north-west  Ireland and is proud to support rural coastal communities. Its main products are:  .  The Organic Salmon Co. brand, sold as head-on gutted, fillets and portions, either fresh or frozen. Also available in  retail-ready packaging  .  Donegal Silver brand premium Eco-Labels salmon, sold as head-on gutted, fillets and portions, either fresh or  frozen. Also available in retail-ready packaging        WELCOME TO MARINE HARVEST        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  Introduction  by our Chief Executive, Alf-Helge Aarskog  Welcome to Marine Harvests Update on Progress. This year for the first time we are using two documents to tell our  stakeholders how - as the worlds leading seafood company - we have improved our sustainability performance in 2010. In  this document our focus is on the facts and figures of sustainability performance. If you are looking for a broader  discussion on how we are handling the sustainability issues that matter to our industry, please take a look at Sustainable  Seafood: the Marine Harvest way published in May 2010. Our commitment to sustainability is deeply embedded into the  way we operate both in our internal processes and in our external relationships. As a signatory to the United Nations  Global Compact, we believe that the long-term sustainability of farmed salmon and wild fish stocks is only possible by  considering them at the same time as healthy environments, strong and stable communities and economic success.   This report covers global concerns and we are proud of our recent successes and improved performance. As you can see  on the previous page, our sustainability performance is often recognised in the awards we win and by year-on-year  improvements in our performance. Our sea lice management performance has been a challenge this year that we have  sought to address by a concerted effort to gradually reduce dependence on veterinary medicines. Fish health remains an  area where our integrated approaches and consistent efforts continue to be rewarded. Also in 2010 we recorded  improvements in our safety satistics, but further improvement is needed. This year we also invested in our sustainability  measurement systems and we are pleased to be able to report our energy and carbon in more depth.   At Marine Harvest were proud of the role our sustainability reporting  plays in facilitating engagement with the people that matter most to us.  Wed like to invite you to take part in the wider dialogue on the  sustainability of our business. I look forward to hearing from you and to  reporting back next time on how we have advanced.                      Note. Sustainable Seafood: the Marine Harvest way is available at  http://www.marineharvest.com/en/CorporateResponsibility/  3       WELCOME TO MARINE HARVEST        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  Marine Harvest in brief  As the worlds leading seafood company we service over 50 markets worldwide. Our 2010 production of 296,000 tonnes  makes us the biggest producer of farmed salmon with approximately one-fifth of global production. In addition to fresh and  frozen salmon, we offer a wide range of value-added products such as coated seafood, ready-to-eat meals, delicious  finger food and smoked seafood. Though salmon is the main farmed product, we also farm our own Sterling White halibut.  We employ 5,000 people worldwide and have operations in 21 countries. Our salmon farming and processing activities are  found in Norway, Chile, Scotland, Canada, Ireland and the Faroes. Value-adding processing activities take place in the  USA, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Japan and Chile. In addition we have sales offices worldwide. Our head  office is located in Bergen, Norway and our shares are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.   Until March 2011 our operational structure was based on a group management team of seven. In addition to the CEO,  CFO and Director of Corporate Development, the managing directors of Norway, Chile, VAP Europe and Group  Operations Canada, Scotland and Others were represented. This structure has now been simplified based on group-wide  Farming and Sales and Marketing functions.  At Marine Harvest, we believe that sustainability is a precondition for creating long-term competitive results. Our ability to  fund our business hinges on our profitability, our long-term value creation and our financial solidity. We see increasing  interest from our shareholders and potential investors in discussing different issues related to sustainability. Corporate  governance and investor communication impacts our funding through investors' and bankers' trust in our management and  company, as well as their ability to make their own assessments of future value creation and risks related to our business.   Our sustainability approach is defined by our corporate vision of Seafood for a better life and our four closely inter-related  guiding principles. Ultimate responsibility for sustainability rests with the Board of Directors. Follow-up and implementation  is carried out by the Group Management Team and the heads of our Business Units. Employees trained in relevant  disciplines, supported by a small group directorate, then manage individual aspects of sustainability.  Our Vision and Principles                          4       WELCOME TO MARINE HARVEST        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  Group economic results 2009/ 2010  2010 was a good year for Marine Harvest, with improved performance in  Norway and return to profitability in Chile.  2010 was a good year for Marine Harvest and global demand for our product was strong. Our net profit was NOK 3108  million in 2010, compared to NOK 1302 million in 2009. The improved profitability was a result of strong global demand for  salmon combined with limited global supply and improved prices achieved at Marine Harvest Norway where we are also  on course to reduce costs. We have returned to profitability in Chile with a downscaled organisation adapted to the current  situation in the Chilean industry. At this stage, it is more important for us to maintain good biological conditions in Chile,  than to grow quickly.

Food safety  Our fundamental objective is to produce safe and nutritious food. We achieve good food safety through three main  overlapping product assurance programmes: control of undesirable substances, control of food-borne pathogens and  tracking and tracing. Procedures and systems are ready and waiting to handle non-conformities, including corrective  actions, rapid alerts and product recalls no matter how insignificant. In 2010 we continued to implement our common  incident-reporting system introduced the year before. This gives an even greater focus on the importance of incident  reporting, alert reactions and handling of incidents. As a result, the number of incident reports has gone up to 43 in total. A  higher number of reported incidents is mainly a result of improved reporting. However, the number of incidents upgraded  to our crisis status remains low. Of these only five related to food safety issues and only minimal volumes of product were  eventually recalled or withdrawn. These related to product labelling issues and Marine Harvest-initiated microbiological  monitoring.  Undesirable substances  These may be present at trace levels in the environment or in the raw materials used in fish feed. Examples include  dioxins, PCBs and heavy metals which accumulate in the marine environment and therefore are present in seafood, as  well as residues from medicines used to treat disease. Around the world we operate an extensive control programme to  ensure safe feed and food including a monitoring programme for undesirable substances using approved laboratories  applying accredited methods. Our monitoring (summary outputs are shown in our charts on the next page) confirms that  any traces of undesirable substances are far below scientifically established statutory limits worldwide. Occasionally,  medicines are prescribed for our fish by veterinarians in accordance with legal requirements. We strictly observe the  specified withdrawal periods and fish are checked for any residues before harvest.  Food-borne pathogens  We have detailed systems for monitoring and controlling pathogens such as micro-organisms (bacteria and viruses) and  parasites. Our sampling procedures, the methods of analysis and the notification and handling of non-conformities are all  laid down in company operating procedures.  Tracking and tracing  On the rare occasion that an adverse incident occurs, tracking and tracing is an important tool to pinpoint the set of factors  leading to the event. All our production and processing facilities keep records of all deliveries, from fish eggs and feed, to  ingredients for value-added processing and packaging material. Every production step is recorded, which means it is  possible to trace any product back to its origins. Every box or package of fish delivered from our processing plants has a  batch number on the label, which is the key for tracing purposes.  6         FOOD SAFETY        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  Food quality  Marine Harvests objective is to deliver food with high technical and nutritional quality to meet customer requirements and  consumer expectations. Technical quality means the food conforms to the specifications agreed with customers.  Nutritional quality relates to the role of fish and fish products as natural healthy food. Fish, and specifically fatty fish like  farmed atlantic salmon, contain nutritious and easily digestible proteins and are rich in important minerals, vitamins and  the long chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. Important minerals found in fish include iodine and selenium. Key  vitamins in fish are vitamins A, D, E, B1, B2, B3, B6 and B12. Sustainable Seafood:  the Marine Harvest way has more  detail on how we manage food safety and quality including our interactions with clients and external quality certification  schemes.

Meaningful work   At Marine Harvest we aim to be an open, positive and supportive working community which shows respect and support for  individuals and the diverse cultures where we operate and from where our employees are drawn. Our Code of Conduct is  our principal guide for how we work together.  Communicating with stakeholders   Marine Harvest encourages all employees to voice opinions and bring disagreements into the open â€“ in a respectful and  solution-oriented manner. We encourage our employees to:    Support Marine Harvests open and positive culture    Create best practice networks    Improve internal active sharing of news and information  Electronic communications are an important way for a global company like Marine Harvest to keep in touch. Our intranet  has a corporate section for where we publish news, new employee information, media stories on the company, and  technical information on subjects such as fish health, new technology and innovation. In addition, all Business Units have  separate sections where they publish local news in their local language. The intranet is also the main channel for our CEO  when communicating with all employees. As around half of our 5,000 employees do not use a computer at work, the  Business Units also circulate local newsletters at sites and factories to ensure all employees stay informed. Our  Norwegian operations are connected via our Harvest magazine published quarterly in hard copy and electronic formats.  To understand what kind of improvements external stakeholders expect of the salmon industry, we engage in direct  discussions with organisations, including customers, suppliers, government agencies, researchers and NGOs.   Employee breakdown   The fish farming industry has traditionally been an industry with a majority of male employees. As of end 2010 the  proportions of male and female employees were 68% and 32% respectively. In 2010, the Group had female managers in  the senior management teams of most subsidiaries. The Group continues to work actively to promote diversity in senior  management positions globally. In 2011, the top management team of Marine Harvest will be changed. Going forward, the  team will consist of four members, one of whom is a woman. Of the 10 members in the Marine ASA Board, there are five  women.  8         PEOPLE        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  Labour conditions   Engaging in open and free dialogue with employees concerning labour relations is enshrined in our Code of Conduct. We  believe all our workers have the right to freely form and join groups for the promotion and defence of their occupational  interests, including the right to engage in collective bargaining by joining a trade union. We are committed to the abolition  of child labour, and all forms of forced or compulsory labour. We will not employ anyone under the age of completion of  compulsory schooling as set by national law, and, in any event, not less than 15 years of age. We support and comply with  all applicable laws and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and require a similar commitment from participants in  our supply chain. An important prerequisite of compliance is the awareness of the potential risk of human rights violations  â€“ whether due to local  conditions, custom, practices or otherwise. As with any potential contravention of our Code of  Conduct, risky situations or allegations of human rights violations are investigated and followed up. Many of our operations  have whistleblower protection programmes in place.   Employee diversity 2010    Training and development  To remain a leader in aquaculture we require our employees to be at the top of their game. Development and training are  important facilitators of these skills and abilities whether taken formally through training courses or on-the-job experience  which broadens and deepens practical understanding. All our operations support opportunities for development, training  and education. In 2010 2,867 operative level employees and 739 sales, administrative and management staff attended  training (these figures include multiple counts for people that attended more than one training course).  Temporary employees   Around the world, our businesses occasionally need to hire temporary workers for a number of reasons, such as seasonal  demand or lack of native workers with the essential expertise. Our local HR departments are committed to following  national and international recruitment laws and requirements. Over and above these, the temporary workers we employ  have the same benefits and conditions as local and native workers, including equal pay for equal work. When hiring, we  always first attempt to find qualified native workers before hiring foreign personnel. We also search our internal database  for qualified transferable employees in other Business Units. In 2010 we discovered unsatisfactory working arrangements  tied to the use of temporary workers hired from three different contractors at one of our processing facilities in Norway.  This led to changes in use of contractors, and new and stricter contractual demands for use of temporary workers.                            9         PEOPLE        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010    Safety performance   In 2010, the group recorded 123 lost time incidents (LTI), down from 219 in 2009. Our ambition for 2010 was to cut the  2009 number by more than half. Despite missing our target we were successful in cutting the number of incidents by over  43%. This was achieved by additional training and the embedding of our integrated safety management system. We are  reinvigorating training by our commitment to undertake a major new initiative, focusing on individual attitude and  responsibility for safety. There were no fatalities on 2010.  Our highest sick leave and injury rates are the cuts and strains found in the harvesting and processing plants. Strains are  also the main cause of long-term sick leave in the company. We are working to prevent such injuries and provide  alternative work in cases where this is necessary. Various measures and awareness schemes, such as job rotation and  competence development, have had a positive effect. The overall absentee rate in 2010 was 3.8% compared to 4.1% in  2009.  10  Chilean Business Unit leads the way   In December 2010, Marine Harvest Chile received SOFOFAs Corporate Social Responsibility Award, recognising the  outstanding contribution made by the company to the community and its workers.  Employment programmes for former  employees, training abroad and a healthy lifestyle programme are among the efforts implemented over the past few  years. Earlier in the year Technical Director, Berta Contreras, was named Patagonias Best Female Executive in an  award given by the local newspaper El Llanquihue.         ENVIRONMENT        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  Environment  We work hard every day to ensure our fish stay healthy and that our  production leaves minimal environmental footprints.    Net maintenance  Net fouling is a serious concern as it reduces the free flow of water through the pens if permitted to accumulate, potentially  resulting in oxygen reduction and stress to the fish. Net fouling is also believed to increase the sea lice occurrence in our  farms. Our industry has historically used copper-based substances to control fouling. However, it has been criticised as a  source of persistent marine pollution and concentrations are strictly regulated by all local authorities. In some regions, the  move away from copper has been achieved through frequent replacement of nets. In other regions, fouling control is  maintained by training technicians to use dedicated net cleaning procedures and equipment. It is our intention to continue  to replace anti-fouling chemicals with more environmentally friendly alternatives.  Treatment of nets 2008-2010                      Fish escapes  Reducing the number of fish escapes is an important focus for us. Escapes may potentially affect the integrity of low- numbered wild fish populations and may also be expensive if large numbers of fish are involved. Escapes from fish farms  can happen in a number of ways including human error, equipment failure or predator attack. In every case, it is our  responsibility to ensure our fish stocks are kept safe and secure. In collaboration with equipment suppliers, we are actively  pursuing new technologies and improved specifications in netting material and pen, net and mooring design.     2010  2009  2008  Business Unit  % nets treated  Ireland  0  0  0  Sterling White Halibut  100  0  0  Chile  59  100  100 in  summer  / 60 in  winter  Norway  90  93  67  Canada  4  69  92  Scotland  26  5  23  Faroes  100  53  65  11         ENVIRONMENT        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  Escape incidents reported      Stocking densities  We stock our fish at densities that balance welfare, reduce the risk of disease and enhance stock performance. Specified  maximum stocking densities for salmon at harvest range between 14 and 31kg per cubic metre, depending on territory. At  maximum stocking density our fish occupy less than 3% of the available cage volume and have more than 97% of the  space to move freely and express normal behaviour. During poor weather conditions, and in the interests of welfare,  harvests can be delayed, which may lead to stocking densities temporarily exceeding the target maximum. Stocking  density performance at Marine Harvest Ireland continues to reflect the shifting local licensing regime. We are working  closely as an industry and individually with the Irish Government to update licencing arrangements to meet recent EU  regulations, technologies and practices. Our decision to double the number of pens for the same biomass has secured our  organic status within existing permissions. 12          2010      2009      2008  Business  Unit  Activity  Number  of  escape  incidents  Number  of fish  lost  Estimated  average  weight  Number  of  escape  incidents  Number  of fish  lost  Estimated  average  weight  Number  of  escape  incidents  Number  of fish  lost  Estimated  average  weight  Ireland  Broodstock  and  juveniles  0  0  0  0  0  0  0        On-growing  2  85,073  1kg  0  0  0  0      Sterling  White  Halibut  Broodstock  and  juveniles  0  0  0  0  0  0  0        On-growing  0  0  0  1  100  5 kg  0      Chile  Broodstock  and  juveniles  0  0  0  0  0  0  0        On-growing  0  0  0  1  71,066  2.7 kg  0      Norway  Broodstock  and  juveniles   1  15  130 g  1  19  5 g  2  500  0.1 kg    On-growing  2  663  3.3 kg  2  1,000  2.5 kg  2  45  0.8 kg  Canada  Broodstock  and  juveniles  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  20  juveniles    On-growing  4  43,623  2.4kg  4*  50,059  4kg*  3  108,589  2 kg  Scotland  Broodstock  and  juveniles  1  10,775  80 g  0  0  0  0        On-growing  3  336  2 kg  5  11,478  3.6 kg   2  7,444  5 kg  Faroes  Broodstock  and  juveniles  0  0  0  0  0  0  0        On-growing  2  3,535  2 kg  1  50  125 g  1  2,000  3 kg  TOTAL    15  144,020    15  133,772    11  118,598    *NB Canadian datapoints restated for 2009         ENVIRONMENT        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  Stocking density reported for sea, lake or loch farms in kg/m3      Fallowing and coordinated approaches  Leaving a site empty between production cycles â€“ known as fallowing â€“ is an integral component of good farming practice.  It allows for the resting or restoration of the local environment and reduces the risk of re-infection of disease and parasites.  We promote co-ordinated fallowing and synchronised production with industry peers to further reduce biological risks  within operational areas.

For salmon  production, total live-weight produced in 2010 was 376,576 tonnes, resulting in a group-wide average of 28.2 g per tonne  compared to 37.9 g per tonne in 2009. This reduction was mainly due to lower usage in Chile and Ireland where the  majority of antibiotics were used. In Chile we reduced the volume of antibiotics used from 2009 to 2010 by over 35%. This  compares to Marine Harvest Norway, where antibiotic use continued to be extremely low with only 0.003 grams used per  tonne of production.   Antifungal products are used in some hatcheries and freshwater production to control fungal infections of eggs, fry and  after vaccinations. In 2010, a total of 27,875 litres were used in our operations (29,317 litres in 2009). Stable usage of anti- fungals has been achieved by producing good quality eggs and smolts in our operations and maintaining standards of  hygiene and biosecurity to reduce the impact of fungus.   Our approach to sea lice management  Sea lice are naturally occurring external parasites that feed on the mucus and skin of marine fish but are harmless to  humans. High numbers of sea lice can also stress the fish, affect growth and generally reduce the fish quality. We  regularly monitor the occurrence of sea lice on our fish, checking that numbers are below trigger levels for treatment.  Trigger levels vary depending on the type of lice, time of year and local differences in lice species as well as the presence  of wild fish species. To control sea lice we have tried and tested operational standards in place. Experience tells us that  the most effective approaches integrate both medical and non-medical routes. Non-medical methods include use of  cleaner fish such as the ballan wrasse and feed supplements, as well as good production management such as  synchronised fallowing, attention to clean nets and adjusting stocking densities.  Sea lice trends  We measure sea lice occurrence in terms of the mean number of sea lice per fish, compared to local trigger levels set by  the authorities to minimise risk for negative impacts on wild salmon. The main goal of these trigger levels, which regulates  when salmon must be treated, is to ensure a low number of mature sea lice during migration of wild salmon smolt. As the  graphs show, our success in managing sea lice numbers continued during 2010.   Our main sea lice challenge is reduced sensitivity of sea lice to specific veterinary medicines. Although our integrated  approach to sea lice control includes medical and non-medical controls, medicines will remain a necessary component.  Taking a long-term view to protect sensitivities to medicines in Norway, in 2008 we took one of our key medicines out of  regular use. Trigger levels for sea lice treatment were also raised during the autumn and winter from September 2009. The  joint effect of this was a higher sea lice level on farmed fish during the autumn-winters of 2009 and 2010. Since that time  14         ENVIRONMENT        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  we have gradually achieved a lower sea lice level also in Norway. Our broad long-term efforts to maintain a low level of  sea lice for the years to come, are described in Sustainable Seafood: the Marine Harvest Way.          15  MH Faroes mean number of sea lice 2010    MH Ireland mean number of sea lice 2010           ENVIRONMENT        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010    MH Canada mean number of sea lice 2007â€“2010                                  MH Norway mean number of sea lice 2007â€“2010                                      MH Chile mean number of sea lice 2007â€“2010                                   16         ENVIRONMENT        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  MH Scotland mean number of sea lice 2007â€“2010                            New developments in sea lice control  We take a strategic and integrated approach to managing sea lice which seeks to maintain control at low levels by using  the most sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches. As well as using medical approaches we are constantly  seeking and developing new non-medical approaches through our R & D programme while retaining the use of medicines  as contingency within a rotating treatment system. Recent non-medical treatments include the use of cleaner fish (ballan  wrasse) and increased efforts to farm them. We have also installed lice filters at all processing plants, invested in sea lice  gene sequencing research and intensified efforts to co-ordinated delousing and including working with our neighbours on  zonal and synchronous approaches. Within the arsenal of medical approaches we call upon a variety of licensed  medicines. We used 414 kg of oral active ingredients in 2010 (down from 1,471 in 2009). Sea lice control is also  dispensed using medicinal baths. In 2010, we used 774 kg of active ingredients (510 kg 2009). A specialist form of  treament is the use of hydrogen peroxide baths. In 2010, 1,930,519 litres were used compared to 275,104 in 2009.  Variations in the amounts of individual treatments reflect their suitability to the pattern of sea lice infestation as well as  aspects of the sea lice life cyle.  Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) outbreaks in Chile stabilising   Throughout 2010, we continued to apply the strict vigilance, monitoring, contagion and risk management tools at our  disposal, integrating these with new controls and regulations. We believe that the ISA situation in Chile is stabilising as a  consequence of the reduction in fish stocks, implementation of strict sanitary measures and procedures, improved  husbandry and management, heightened surveillance, coordinated zone production and fallowing, and vaccination.  Throughout the recent outbreak, we have maintained a transparent and open dialogue with the industry, sharing  knowledge, experiences and practices to mitigate.

Disappointingly, incidences in the Norwegian industry increased over the year with a total of 88 cases (diagnosed  and suspect) in 2010 compared to 74 in 2009 (19% increase). Similarly, in Marine Harvest Norway the number of cases in  the PD-affected zone (South and West regions) increased by 17% (from 12 in 2009 to 14 in 2010).

Nonetheless, we are working across our business using a life cycle assessment approach to become more  energy-efficient. This will not only cut costs but reduce the environmental footprint of our operations which often rely on  energy from non-renewable sources that emit carbon dioxide.  During 2010 we devoted considerable effort in improving the capture and robustness of our energy information. One  consequence of these more effective processes is a small rise in the total energy we have used (7.6%). Of our 984.3  terajoules total consumption, energy we generated accounts for 509.4 TJ and energy we bought in 474.9 TJ. Most of the  energy we use comes from electricity we buy in. This is mainly used at our processing, sales and distribution centres. We  also use large amounts of natural gas for heating. Significant amounts of diesel and petrol are used at our production  facilities where transportation is an integral part of operations.   Going forward, we expect our energy management programmes will deliver improvements in our performance even  though we continue to invest in energy intensive processing capacity. From a life cycle perspective increased processing  capacity, such as in filleting, is more energy efficient overall as it reduces energy consumption in the transportation  undertaken by our customers.  This year for the first time we are reporting the Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with our operations.  Energy we generated (Scope 1) accounted for 38,752 tonnes CO2, while energy we bought in (Scope 2) was 25,043  tonnes CO2. Together this equals 63,795 tonnes CO2. This was prepared using the WRI/WBCSD approach. As many of  our farming operations are based near mountainous areas much of the electricity we purchase comes from renewable  hydro-electric sources.

At MHI 21% of waste is rendered  Waste water  In 2010, we discharged 1,927,713 m3 of water from our production facilities down 25% from 2009. Waste water from our  processing facilities contains organic matter and may potentially carry fish pathogens and so needs treatment before  returning to the natural environment. Our waste water is transferred to water treatment works for purification, which may  include disinfection as required by local legislation before discharge, often to the sea. We are in the process of installing  disinfection systems in all our processing facilities, even where this is not required by law.

New reporting structure   Following stakeholder feedback, this year we have taken a dual approach to our sustainability reporting communications.  Our Update on Progress looks into our sustainability performance in 2010 and revisiting the data covered in our 2009  Sustainability Report. Accompanying this report is Sustainable Seafood: the Marine Harvest wa y. Published in May 2011,  this 44-page document takes a question and answer approach to discussing the big issue as we see them in seafood  sustainability. Both documents are available as hard copy and downloadable pdfs.  Report coverage    Our Update on Progress 2010 covers all parts of the  fish farming to food product value chains where Marine Harvest  companies are active. These include breeding, hatcheries, farming of juveniles and adult fish, harvesting and processing  of fish, sales and  distribution, and value-added processing of seafoods  with associated sales and distribution. Since our  last sustainability report in 2009, there have been no significant changes in our size, structure or ownership. In this report  we are restating five economic indicators in line with our Annual Report. These are; Operational EBITDA, Operational EBIT,  Cash flow from operations revenue and Net cash flow.  While we continue to develop our performance reporting systems, this annual update shares the same scope of reporting  as previously. It covers all Marine Harvest businesses, except jointly owned businesses where we do not have a   controlling interest. This report and its data covers the calendar year 2010. Financial information in this report is taken from  our audited annual report and accounts. At this time we do not consider external third-party assurance of the sustainability  report will add significantly to our internal assurance processes.  Materiality process   Public scrutiny of the potential negative impacts of food production are increasing and aquaculture is no exception. Our  stakeholders increasingly demand openness and transparency on production practices and our reports are an important  way to reach the most relevant stakeholders. In determining the content of the report, we have referred to stakeholder  feedback received following our previous reports and our recent engagements with employees, investors, customers,  consumers and suppliers. We expect these to be the main audiences for this report. These audiences have been selected  as they are essential for facilitating and defining our success. International standards, principally the Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI) were also considered  in determining report content and approach and are the basis of our potential  environmental impacts table which can be found on page 30 in our Sustainable Seafood:  the Marine Harvest way  brochure. This report is self-assured to GRI Application Level C. It also constitutes our United Nations Global Compact,  Communication on Progress (CoP). Our CoP index and GRI table can be found on the inside back cover.   21         ABOUT OUR 2010 REPORTS        UPDATE ON PROGRESS 2010  Global Reporting Initiative Index                                                                      *This indicator is particularly relevant to our United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 22  Indicator  Summary indicator description   Sustainable  Seafood: the  Marine Harvest  way  Update on  Progress  Annual Report   2010  1.1  Statement from CEO  1  3    2.1  Name of the organization.      16  2.2  Primary brands, products, and/or services  14-15      2.3  Operational structure       8-10, 61-62  2.4  Location of organization's headquarters  2  Back cover    2.5  Major operation  2      2.6  Ownership and legal form      16  2.7  Markets served   2, 15      2.8  Scale of the organization    5    2.9  Changes in size, structure or ownership    21    2.10  Awards     2, 9    3.1  Reporting period     21    3.2  Date of previous report    21    3.3  Reporting cycle     21    3.4  Contact point     Back Cover    3.5  Process for defining report content    21    3.6  Boundary of the report     21    3.7  Specific limitations on the scope or boundary     21    3.8  Basis for reporting     21    3.10  Re-statements of information     21    3.11  Changes in the scope, boundary, or  measurement     21    3.12  GRI Table    22    4.1  Governance structure of the organization      16-20  4.2  Chair also an executive officer       22  4.3.
