Contents  1 1 Sustainability Report 2011 Letter from the Chairman  2 3 Sustainability Report 2011 3 Letter from the  Chairman Ladies and gentlemen:  I am writing to all of you to  present to you the main events  that have marked the performance  in the 2011 financial year of the  Group I have had the honor to  head for 25 years. A financial year  that celebrated the centennial  of the creation of OHL, as 100  years have passed since the  incorporation of Obrascn, its  parent company, whose initial  appears first in the acronym OHL. In a year 2011 of world growth  with very different profiles -close  to 4% for the world economy  overall, driven by the emerging  countries, but considerably lower  for the developed countries and  with minimum growth in Spain,  the OHL Group has obtained  the best result in its 100 years  of history.  EBITDA grew 23%, a  percentage that coincides with  the figure registered in terms of  the compound annual growth  rate (CAGR) since 2002, the  financial year when we launched  our new strategy of abandoning  residential building construction,  of diversification in concessions,  of internationalization and  financial security and which,  yet another year, has proved  to be a very wise decision. The  net attributable profit increased  14.2%, while the short-term  backlog stands out with a growth  figure of 57.8% and an accrued  annual rate of 28.2% since  2002. Finally, OHLs turnover was  placed at 4,869.8 million euros,  slightly higher than the figure  obtained in 2010. The brilliant performance of  the Concessions division,  which achieved growth in  Sales and EBITDA of 9.1% and  24.2%, respectively, has made  a significant contribution to  these excellent outcomes. OHL  Concessions is the Groups main  division, concentrates 81% of its  total investments, contributes  the largest proportion of funds  generated, specifically 76.1%  of EBITDA and, as of today, is  already an independent business  line, both organically as well as  financially. Once again in 2011,  OHL Concessions continued  to be positioned among the  top ten concession companies  in the world, according to  the prestigious Public Works  Financing ranking.  The 2011 financial year bore  witness to the integration into  a single Construction Division  of the two former Domestic  and International Construction  Divisions, in order to achieve  greater efficiency in the available  human and technical resources,  take advantage of all of the  synergies and optimize the  operation of the construction  business from a joint and global  market perspective.  The new division has been highly  successful in winning awards,  among which three railway  contracts of an extraordinary  magnitude stand out: the  Mecca-Medina high-speed  railway in Saudi Arabia; the  Marmaray railway link between  the European and Asian sides  of Turkey in Istanbul and the  Ural Polar project, the largest  Juan-Miguel Villar Mir Chairman of the Board of Directors  of the OHL Group. construction project ever  contracted by the Group with  a 1,500 million euro budget,  in Russia. Another three major  awards are added to these three  outstanding railway projects: the  CHUM Hospital in Montreal, the  extension of the Toronto subway,  also in Canada, and an 11-km- long elevated urban viaduct in  Kuwait City. These awards add  around 4,000 million euros to  the divisions backlog, thereby  placing it at an all-time record  of 8,741 million euros, 1.6 the  size of the backlog in 2010 and  equivalent to 36 months of sales. In this context, reference must  also be made to the performance  of the OHL Industrial Division,  created in 2008 with a significant  international projection and  which has ended the financial  year by multiplying its sales by  three and one-half times. The good outcomes obtained  by the Group have merited the  recognition of the securities  markets. If we look at the trend  in the OHL share price since  2002, the year when the Groups  current strategy was defined,  through to December 31, 2011,  we find that the value of the OHL  share grew at an accrued rate of  19.1%, while the IBEX-35 did so  at 4.1% and the average for listed  construction companies was 4%.  Within the financial scope and  in line with the current strategy,  the effort made to achieve the  internationalization of the Group  was undertaken on the basis  of criteria of financial prudence  and operational certainty. The  OHL Group enjoys significant  prestige in the financial world  and fluid access to the full  range of banking, corporate and  project financing sources, as  well as to the capital markets.  A good example of this is the  success of the bond issue,  worth 425 million euros, made  in March 2011 and maturing in  March 2018, and the equally  successful straight bond issue in  the amount of 300 million euros,  made subsequently to the 2011  financial year, in March 2012,  and maturing in 2020. The OHL Group maintains a  significant and stable position of  recourse liquidity, totaling 1,465  million euros, and has made a  substantial effort in the reduction  of its indebtedness, enabling it  to attain the announced target of  reducing net recourse debt over  recourse EBITDA from 3.5 times  in 2010 to 3 times in 2011. This  has been due mainly to:  non-recourse leverage  transactions in OHL  Concessions in the amount  of 350 million euros, backed  by part of the shares of OHL  Mxico, in order to return funds  to the parent company;   divestment of non-strategic  assets, such as the sale of its  Environment Division for 231  million euros in equity value in  November 2011 and,  the financial independence  of the Concessions business for  making its investments.  4 4 Sustainability Report 2011 Sustainable Development Again in 2011, the OHL Group  progressed in the attainment of  the targets set in its Corporate  Social Responsibility Plan 2010- 2014. Accordingly, together  with its commitment to value  generation and within the scope  of sustainability, the OHL Group  renewed in 2011 its presence  in the FTSE4Good Ibex index,  which singles out the company  as a committed security and  of particular interest for those  investors who combine their  profitability objectives with  their concern for the ethical,  social, environmental and good  governance aspects of business  management. The effort and commitment  of the Group in working towards  a low-carbon economy has led  us to obtain a High score in  the classification made by the  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)  2011 and to be included within  the Carbon Disclosure Leadership  Index group. And precisely in the context  of sustainability, an important  development was the recognition  of the Mayakoba resort by the  World Tourism Organization and  the Rainforest Alliance through  their top awards: the Ulysses and  the Sustainable Standard-Setter  awards, respectively, making the  resort a major reference among  environmentally sustainable and  responsible tourist destinations  on an international level.  The pursuit of more  demanding management in the  furtherance and monitoring of  compliance with best practices,  principles and values in good  governance has continued in  2011. For this reason, after  approving the OHL Group Code of  Conduct in March 2010, during  the 2011 financial year the  companys Board of Directors  decided to assign the duty of  implementing and controlling  the Groups Corporate Social  Responsibility policy to its Audit,  Compliance and Corporate Social  Responsibility Committee. I would also like to highlight  the important achievements  in the field of R&D&I that have  enabled the Group to become  a benchmark in Europe within  the concession and construction  sector. This outstanding work  merited significant recognition at  the 39th International Exhibition  of Inventions of Geneva,  considered as the largest of its  kind in the world, where, with the  Cubpodo, we obtained a gold  medal with honorable mention  and the prize to the best Spanish  invention. The Groups commitment to  its employees is reflected in  the 11.4% increase in staff with  respect to 2010. Permanent  jobs account for 71% of this  new employment and, with  respect to training, once again  the Groups effort was reinforced  with the figure of 574,921 hours  of training provided in 2011,  representing 36.3% growth over  the previous year. In this same context, and  with respect to occupational  risk prevention -one of the top  priorities of the OHL Group in  its pursuit of the major goal of  zero accidents, important  progress has been made both in  training, with a 149% increase  in the number of hours, as well  as in terms of the reduction  of the Occupational Accident  Incidence Rate in all of the  divisions of the Group. Other significant milestones  in the financial year include the  new Responsible Procurement  Policy, the approval of the  new Harassment Protocol  applicable to the entire Group,  the start-up of the Environment  and Energy Master Plan 2011- 2015 and the updating of the  Groups Community Involvement  Framework Plan. In these times of uncertainty  and economic difficulties, OHL  maintains a strong, stable and  solid position with a capacity for  growth. And in the financial year  of the Groups 100th birthday,  the wisdom of the strategy that  we decided to apply as from 2002  has been confirmed. A strategy  and a wager renewed year after  year on a sustainable, balanced  and harmonious development  that will enable us, from our  position of world leadership in  several construction fields, to  look at the future with optimism.  These results would not have  been possible without the trust  and ongoing support of our  shareholders, to whom in my  own name and in the name of  the Board of Directors, I wish to  express my deepest appreciation.  An appreciation that extends to  our customers for the confidence  that they have shown us,  together with my most sincere  congratulations to the Groups  excellent team, whose effort,  professionalism, dedication and  spirit of achievement have made it  possible to attain the sustainable  development targets that we set  for the  2011 financial year. The Chairman of the Board of  Directors Juan-Miguel Villar Mir  / Letter from the Chairman  5 5 Sustainability Report 2011 OHL, a global  company [1]  6 7 Sustainability Report 2011 [1] OHL,  a global company The OHL Group is one of the  largest international concession  and construction groups in  the world. Its business model  incorporates ethical, social and  environmental criteria into the  management of the business  in a balanced manner, in order  to contribute to enhancing the  wellbeing and progress of present  and future generations, both in its  immediate environment as well as  on a global scale. In 2011, its centennial year,  the Group ended one of its most  brilliant financial years since,  one decade ago, it set in motion  the strategy that has made it a  major international transportation  infrastructure concession and  construction group. In addition to consolidating  the business activity of OHL  Concessions through, mainly, the  management of transportation  infrastructures under concession  in Brazil and Mexico, the most  significant milestones of the  Group during 2011 were reached  by the OHL Construction division,  on contracting several landmark  projects in the international  market that have enabled the  penetration of the Group into  the new markets  of Canada,  Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Russia  and Australia, and reinforced its  presence in Turkey and Poland. With the objective of optimizing  the use of human and technical  resources in its construction  operations from a global  perspective, in the first quarter  of 2011 OHL announced the  unification of its international and  domestic construction divisions  into a single division: OHL  Construction.  On another front, in November  of last year the Group signed  an agreement for the sale of its  subsidiary OHL Medio Ambiente  Inima to the Korean company  GS Engineering & Construction  Corporation, for an equity value of  231 million euros. This transaction  is set within the framework of  the plan announced by OHL for  the divestment of a non-strategic  division in order to reduce net  recourse debt. Following the agreement for  the sale of OHL Medio Ambiente  Inima, that division has now  been entered as a discontinued  operation in the annual accounts  for 2011. Nevertheless, in view  of the social and environmental  aspects of the division, it was  considered appropriate to  include it within the scope of this  sustainability report. As a result of these changes  with respect to 2010, the Groups  core business activity became  structured at the end of 2011  into the following divisions: OHL  Concessions, OHL Construction,  OHL Industrial and OHL  Developments. The mission of the OHL Group is to create value on the basis of conditions of economic, social and  environmental sustainability, catering to the specific interests of its investors, customers and employees, as well  as of all of the individuals and entities interested in its successful operation. The OHL Group in figures  Presence in 34 countries  on all five continents. 89% of  EBITDA outside of Spain.  Significant presence in  growing markets (Brazil and  Mexico account for 73% of  EBITDA).  Primary private investor  in infrastructures in Latin  America.   76% of EBITDA in  Concessions.

With  operations in seven countries, the  divisions backlog is comprised  by 28 principal concessions, 23  of which are toll road concessions  –with a total of 4,417 km-,  in addition to one airport,  two seaport and two railway  concessions.  Through its subsidiaries, OHL  Brasil and OHL Mxico, listed  on the stock exchanges of their  respective countries, the Group  leads the toll road market in  Brazil in terms of the number of  kilometers under concession,  3,226 km, as well as in the  metropolitan area of the Valley of  Mexico, where its share extends  to 72% of the 216-km-network of  urban toll expressways promoted  by government administrations.  Overall, OHL manages 359 km of  toll roads in Mexico through six  concession companies. Milestones in the 2011 financial year  First year of financial autonomy. A decade after its creation and with its two main  subsidiaries -OHL Brasil and OHL Mxico- listed on the stock exchanges of their  respective countries, the capacity of OHL Concessions to confront its future development  with a strategy of financing without recourse to its parent company and in local currency  in each of the countries where it has a presence was one of the key messages at the  annual presentation of the company to financial analysts in April 2011.  Conclusion of financing arrangements in Brazil and Mexico. Con el apoyo del banco  pblico brasileo BNDES, OHL Brasil ha cerrado en 2011 el pWith the support of the  Brazilian public bank BNDES, in 2011 OHL Brasil concluded the long-term financing  plan designed for the development of the five federal toll roads it manages: Fluminense,  Ferno Dias, Rgis Bittencourt, Litoral Sul and Planalto Sul. At the same time, OHL Mxico, through its respective concession companies, concluded  the financing of the Superva Poetas and Urbana Norte toll roads, through long-term  loans in the amounts of 4,000 and 7,440 million Mexican pesos, respectively. The  company also obtained financing through a bond issue in the amount of 1,700 million,  for the re-financing of the debt associated with the Puebla-Perote toll road.  New concessions in operation. In April, OHL Mxico opened to traffic the last sections  of Phases II and III of the Circuito Exterior Mexiquense, a strategic infrastructure for the  development and integration of the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico. Also, in  October and November, it opened the first two sections of the Urbana Norte toll road. The  first of these sections culminated the connection of the second levels of the two federal  entities, the Federal District and the State of Mexico, which comprise the metropolitan  area of the Valley of Mexico.  In Chile, during the month of September, Section 1 of the east sector of the Los Andes  toll road commenced operations. With a length of 19.5 km, this section connects with  the main border crossing into Argentina, Paso Los Libertadores, and forms a part of the  Cristo Redentor Bi-Oceanic Corridor, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through  Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Furthermore, on May 9, Terminales Martimas del Sureste inaugurated the solid bulk  terminal at its port facilities in Alicante. The company has also underpinned its coastal  and international traffic with 138% growth in the movement of TEUs with respect to the  previous year.  OHL Mxico, in the IPC. On the first of September, OHL Mxico was included in the ndice  de Precios y Cotizaciones (IPC), the principal index of the Mexican Stock Exchange,  comprised by the 35 listed companies with the highest market liquidity.  Standard Toll System. OHL Concessions successfully completed the first implementation,  on the Autopista del Norte (Peru), of the Standard Toll System (SEP), its new toll  management product, which it has developed in record time with state-of-the-art  technology.  Largest ITS system in Brazil. With an investment due to exceed 100 million reais, OHL  Brasil has initiated the implementation on the toll roads it manages in the federal  network of what will be the most extensive intelligent transportation system (ITS) for road  surveillance and control in the country and one of the most  important worldwide.  Electronic toll collection services market. On October 31, OHL Mxico announced the  commenced the operation of the new technological platform, Televa, with which the  Group has entered into Mexicos market of electronic toll collection services. Markets of OHL Concessions  Strategic countries: Brazil, Mexico and Spain  Other countries with operations: Argentina, Chile, Peru and India.  Countries with projects under study: United States, Canada, Colombia,  Eurozone and China. OHL introduced the Standard Toll  System on the Autopista del Norte  toll road, in Peru, during 2011. New business line of OHL  Concessions The companys wager  on research and the new  technologies, together with  the experience accumulated  over more than a decade, has  enabled it to consolidate a  new business line that offers  –both to investors and public  administrations as well as  to the concession  sector -  transportation infrastructure  operation and maintenance  services under any modality  whatsoever: consultancy,  supervision and coordination  or integrated management. OHL Concessions has  designed and developed  management systems of  its own in an advanced  technological environment,  enabling it to guarantee the  control of operations and  to effectively manage the  contractual risks. The systems are applicable  to any kind of concession  agreement and to the full  range of infrastructures,  providing the operator  company with all of the  relevant information: traffic,  ITS and user information. Management systems developed in-house  Integrated Control Center. Web platform in its final stage of integration, completely  modular, for the management of the information on the infrastructure and its elements.  Provides ITS information in real time, analyzes high accident locations and enables  queries on accident rates, in addition to facilitating the graphical and analytical  representation of works, investments, traffic and inventories.  Traffic Management Tool. Analyzes all of the information originating from traffic and  generates reports automatically and configurably.  Investment Monitoring Model. Software tool for the technical and economic control of  major maintenance and investments.  Unified Operating Data Model. Enables the monthly monitoring of the data budgeted,  both with respect to operations as well as to revenues, costs and results.  Standard Toll System. State-of-the-art product with a set of functionalities that make  it unique: maintenance application integrated with the tolling and video, validation  of anomalies and generation of reports in real time, maximum traceability of all of the  information and mechanisms for the eradication of fraud, and full configuration of users,  rates, all kinds of reports and toll control.  Integrated Pavement Management. In the process of development, this system makes  it possible to program future major maintenance of road surfaces–with the particularities  of design and traffic of each infrastructure and the different regulations existing in each  country– seeking the optimization of solutions, maximum durability and lower cost of  maintenance. The wager on R&D&I and its experience as an operator have enabled  OHL Concessions to launch a new business line that offers infrastructure  operation and maintenance services under any kind of concession  modality  Toll station on the Circuito Exterior Mexiquense, a toll  road built and operated by the Group. [1] / OHL, a global company  12 13 Sustainability Report 2011 OHL Construction In its first financial year,  this division attained the most  significant milestones of the  Group in the international market  during 2011, on contracting  landmark projects, both in terms  of the amounts involved as well as  for having enabled the division to  enter and commence construction  operations in markets as relevant  as those of Canada, Kuwait, Saudi  Arabia, Russia and Australia, and  on having reinforced the presence  of OHL in Turkey and Poland. In  addition, the division opened an  office in India. In Spain, the construction  sector has once again experienced  a severe decline in activity (7.4%  nominal), reducing its contribution  to Spains GDP to 14.2%, 1.3  percentage points less than in  2010. The measures adopted by  the central government, regional  governments and town councils  to control the public deficit have  had an immediate impact on  public works. Consequently, the  total amount of public tendering  in Spain during 2011 dropped  47.3% with respect to 2010, being  placed at only 13,818 million  euros. This situation, foreseen by  the Group, has forced it to make  the necessary adjustments in  the cost structure of this area of  business in order to maintain its  profitability in the context of a  lower volume of activity. Milestones in the financial year  USA. In the Northeast region (New York), Judlau Contracting completed its first year as a  subsidiary of the Group and a significant backlog of projects.

During 2011, Ingesan  continued its strategy of sustained  and profitable growth that it has  maintained since it became a part  of the Group in 2007.  Despite the  weak economic situation and the  budget cutbacks, both by public  as well as private customers, the  company increased its invoicing  by almost 43%, placing its  turnover at 53.5 million euros. This subsidiary has reinforced  its strategy with fresh contracts  that have consolidated its  presence in the cleaning segment  of the transportation sector  (Terminal T1 and the cleaning  of runways at the Barcelona  airport, the Alicante airport, Line  1 of the Barcelona subway) and  the healthcare sector (Bellvitge  Hospital, Barcelona, and Josep  Trueta Hospital, Girona). In  the area of integrated building  maintenance services, the  most outstanding awards were  related to transportation (Line  9 of the Barcelona subway)  and administrative buildings  (University of Barcelona and  the Ciudad de la Justicia court  complex in Almera).   The forecasts for 2012 reflect  a growth in sales along the lines  of the performance in 2011,  with particular  incidence on  new sectors with a very positive  outlook for future growth and  higher returns, such as the fields  of efficiency and energy saving  and social services. Sacova (Novaire). The OHL  Group participates in the  business of managing care  facilities for the elderly in  the Community of Valencia,  through the company Sacova  Centros Residenciales with its  brand name Novaire (www. novaire.es).

OHL, a construction and infrastructure management group  Infrastructures, as one of the basic engines of economic growth, constitute a key factor for the  enhancement of the wellbeing and the progress of a society. In this sense, OHL plays an important  role in the economic activity of the countries where it engages in its business as a construction and  transportation infrastructure management company –roads, freeways and railways- and services  -hospitals, universities and schools, administrative buildings and sports facilities, among others-. These projects are performed as a construction company under contracts with government  administrations or by participating in the financing of such projects through Public Private Partnership  (PPP) formulas that make it possible to have access to the resources necessary for the modernization of  infrastructures and services, thereby overcoming the limitations of public financing. Beyond the generation  of economic value, the OHL  Group also contributes to the  generation of a business fabric  and to the creation of direct and  indirect employment in the local  environments in which it operates.  In this way, during 2011, the  Group generated a total of 18,082  local jobs in countries other than  Spain (international direct local  employment). Overall, the Group  had 25,145 employees at the end  of 2011. Moreover, during the past  year the Group generated a total  of 37,427 induced local direct  jobs, 74% of which were in its  international business activities. Finally, the new Responsible  Procurement Policy establishes  that the OHL Group is committed to  the promotion and encouragement  of purchases from local  suppliers and contractors as a  way to drive the development  of the business fabric and the  creation of employment within  the communities with which  it interacts. This practice was  already being applied in all of  the companies in the Group.

The company has always  felt that investing in the adoption  of the best corporate governance  practices and discipline in the  entrepreneurial management  of the values of transparency,  prudence and honesty is  beneficial for the company and,  indirectly, for its shareholders.  Although it is not always easy to  measure the economic returns  produced by these practices, the  strengthening of these values  has been one of the pillars of the  success achieved by OHL during  this financial year. In 2011 the company  maintained its determination to  pursue increasingly more stringent  management in its monitoring  and promotion of compliance with  good governance best practices,  principles and values. For this  reason, following the approval of  the OHL Group Code of Conduct  in March 2010, the companys  Board of Directors decided in the  2011 financial year to entrust the  task of promoting and controlling  the OHL Groups Corporate Social  Responsibility policy to the Audit,  Compliance and Corporate Social  Responsibility Committee. In addition, the entry into force  of the Sustainable Economy Act  has placed listed companies  under the obligation of preparing  an individualized annual  report on the compensation  of their directors, with respect  to the 2011 financial year, to  be submitted to the Ordinary  General Shareholders Meeting  on a consultative basis and as  a separate point on the agenda.  In the case of OHL, the Board  of Directors has been preparing  a report of this nature and  submitting it to the Ordinary  General Shareholders Meetings,  also on a consultative basis  and as a separate item on the  agenda, since 2007. These reports  show how the OHL directors  compensation policy in the period  between 2007-2011 was based  on standards of rationality and  rigor and, as such, the directors  compensation has remained  stable throughout all of this time.  In conclusion, improvement in the  systems of corporate governance  has been and continues to be  present at OHL as a pattern of  regular conduct, by constantly  adopting measures of progress  referred at all times to the good  governance standards applicable  to listed companies. More information of the  Groups management team  in the:   Regulatory provisions  Annual Corporate  Governance Report The company publishes  and consistently updates the  composition of the Board  of Directors, of the Audit,  Compliance and Corporate  Social Responsibility Committee  and of the Appointments and  Compensation Committee,  through its website (www.ohl. es), indicating their respective  powers and responsibilities.

On that  same date, Alberto Miguel Terol  Esteban, also an independent  director, was elected as the new  Chairman of the Committee. This Committee met on ten  occasions during the 2011  financial year.  Appointments and  Compensation Committee The Appointments and  Compensation Committee,  chaired by an independent  director, is comprised by external  directors, the majority of whom  are independent directors.  The  Committee meets as often as the  Board, or the Chairman of the  Board, requests the issuance  of a report or the adoption of  proposals and, in any case,  whenever advisable for the proper  discharge of its duties. One of its meetings is devoted  to preparing the information on  the directors compensation,  which the Board of Directors must  approve and include in its yearly  disclosures.

The Boards Rules of Procedure  also regulate in detail those  situations in which, due to the  existence of a possible conflict  of interest, directors must report  to the Board of Directors any  circumstance of direct or indirect  conflict with the interests of the  company and must abstain from  attending and taking part in  the discussions and voting that  affect the issues associated with  the conflict. Consequently, the  directors may only be involved  in professional or commercial  transactions with the company  in those cases where a prior  situation-of-conflict report,  approving the transaction  in question, is issued by the  Appointments and Compensation  Committee. [1] / OHL, a global company  26 26 Sustainability Report 2011 Risk control system The OHL Groups governance  model, based on criteria of  transparency and anticipation,  includes risk management  and internal control among its  fundamentals for the purpose of:  Ensuring compliance with  current legal provisions and  with the internal standards and  procedures of the Group.  Preventing and controlling  the risks that could affect the  attainment of the targets set by  the Group as well as its net assets.  Guaranteeing the reliability  and integrity of the accounting  and financial information. With the objective of  strengthening the integration of  risk management into business  decisions, in 2011 the OHL  Group continued to introduce  improvements into its global  risk control system and in the  organizational structure entrusted  with managing risks, to ensure  that the people in charge of all  of the business activities adhere  to the same corporate principles  and base themselves on uniform  policies, processes and models. The Audit, Compliance and  Corporate Social Responsibility  Committee regularly monitors the  most relevant risks included on  the Groups Risk Map through the  Corporate Risk Indicator Report.    With the aim of improving the  level of compliance and to adapt  its system of control over financial  reporting to the guidelines  proposed in the Guide for the  Preparation of the Description of  the System of Internal Control over  Financial Reporting published  by the National Securities  Market Commission, during the  2011 financial year the Group  undertook the risk analysis of the  reliability of its economic-financial  reporting in even greater depth  and has strengthened its model of  supervision in this regard. Moreover, following the entry  into force of the reform of the  Penal Code, the OHL Group has  implemented a criminal risk  prevention and detection system,  supported on the basic principles  of behavior described in the Code  of Conduct and supervised by the  Prevention Committee. Likewise, and as a part of the  CSR Master Plan 2010-2014,  the OHL Group has continued to  improve the management of the  reputational risks associated with  its business activities and with the  countries where it has a significant  presence, through the upgrading  of the controls in the areas of  greatest risk and the improvement  of the accessibility of the Code  of Conduct consultation and  reporting channel through the  website.

This commitment is  evidenced most clearly by the  accession of the company to a  range of initiatives and action  guidelines led by eminent  international organizations such  as the UN or the OECD. His institutional commitment  translates into a real willingness  to manage not only the business  activity carried out by the  Group, but also the social  and environmental challenges  associated with such activity.  The commitment to creating  Corporate Social Responsibility  policies and management  measures applicable to the  various work environments  where these challenges emerge  emanates from this willingness.  This report narrates all of  these efforts, which have as  their starting point the creation  of a structure and a management  activity that effectively drive CSR  as a philosophy of work for the  entire company. This facilitates,  in each case, the inclusion of  the social and environmental  challenges to be taken up in the  various management areas. The tool currently guiding  OHLs activities in this regard is  the CSR Master Plan 2010-2014.   The CSR Master Plan 2010- 2014 is a strategic tool that  is alive and active. Designed  between the end of 2009  and the beginning of 2010,  from its very origin the Plan  took into account the Groups  sustainability context and its  business strategy. Moreover, it  In this way, the CSR Master  Plan 2010-2014 became  consolidated in 2011 as the  instrument for articulating the  management of CSR in the  Group, at the same time as a  positive level of progress was  achieved in the implementation  of the lines of work included  therein. Of the 33 lines of action  determined in this strategy,  23 have been successfully  activated, with significant  advances in aspects such as  the responsible management  of human resources or of the  supply chain. Details of these  advances will be provided  in the course of this Report,  although we would like to  highlight the most relevant  actions here. These are,  principally, the approval of the  Responsible Procurement Policy,  the updating of the Code of  Conduct, the consolidation of a  management structure for CSR  on an international scale, the  conclusion of the stakeholder  survey project 2010-2011, the  creation of a working group for  the responsible management  of human resources and the  adaptation of this Report to  the stated purpose of more  effective communication of the  companys management focus in  the context of sustainability. The alliances and the  cooperation arrangements the  Group maintains with other  non-business organizations are  a reflection of the increased  activity and of the involvement  of the Group in CSR. These  enable OHL to achieve a greater  impact in the performance of its  projects, as such organizations  are highly aware of the social  and environmental issues that  the company wishes to address.  In this regard, particularly  outstanding projects in 2011  include the RC Outlook project  led by the Fundacin Entorno  or the new alliance which the  Mayakoba resort development  contains the road map for the  management of CSR at OHL,  through which the Groups  contribution to the collective  challenge of sustainable  development is articulated.   However, it is not only the  outcome of a process of work  and reflection undertaken  at a specific moment in  time.  It is also subject to an  ongoing process of review and  adjustment to adapt it to the  changes taking place in the  Group and in the markets where  the Group operates. At the end  of 2011, an internal review  process was undertaken for the  purpose of guaranteeing the  strategic adequacy of the Plan  and its capacity for attaining  the targets set, which has  necessitated the introduction  of fresh lines of work and the  consideration of new projects. companies belonging to OHL  Desarrollos have established  with the Rainforest Alliance  for the development and  certification of more sustainable  tourism practices, in terms of  the protection of Human Rights,  as can be seen in the chapter  entitled A shared culture in this  Report. With respect to alliances  and cooperation arrangements,  others should also be  mentioned which, although  not new developments  in the  year, are highly relevant in the  Groups management of CSR.  In this regard, outstanding  examples include the alliances  the Group maintains within  the area of R&D&I activities  with organizations such as  the European Construction  Technology Platform,  the European Network of  Construction Companies for  Research and Development  (ENCORD) or EurekaBuild2; the  alliances with organizations in  the social environment such as  Fundacin Konecta, Fundacin  Adecco and Fundacin Integra in  the development of community  support policies and the  alliances with the U.S. Green  Building Council (USGBC) or  the WWF, World Wide Fund  For Nature, in the area of  environmental management.  Moreover, the Group  maintains a stable  commitment to other  initiatives in the management  of CSR, such as the Global   Compact –through membership  and participation in the  Spanish Network of the Global  Compact (ASEPAM) and the  progress reports the company  has been submitting annually  since 2005– , its participation  in the Congreso Nacional del  Medio Ambiente (CONAMA  – National Environment  Congress), the  voluntary report  by the Group to the Carbon  Disclosure Project, the reference  entity in the management  of information concerning  greenhouse gas emissions by  businesses, or OHLs active  participation on the  Corporate  Responsibility committees  created in Seopan (association  of construction companies  on the national level), in la  Confederacin Nacional de la  Construccin (CNC – National  Construction Confederation)  or in the Asociacin Espaola  para la Calidad (AEC -  Spanish  Association for Quality). From a forward-looking  perspective, the management  of CSR should continue giving  support and cover to the  introduction of the management  philosophy described in  all of the companys work  environments and contexts. In  order to do so, the Master Plan  considers the following three  lines of action in this scope. Social and  environmental  commitments subscribed  to by the OHL Group  United Nations Universal  Declaration of Human Rights.  United Nations Global Compact.  United Nations Millennium Development Goals.  Tripartite  Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational  Enterprises and Social Policy of the ILO.  Guidelines of the OECD for  Multinational Enterprises.  Global Reporting Initiative. Responsible human resource management  with an international focus stands out  among the priority goals of OHLs CSR  Master Plan. In the photo, operators of a  tunnel boring machine on an OHL USA  construction site in Miami. Lines of work of the OHL Group in  relation to the  management of corporate social responsibility  Widening of the scope of CSR policies.  CSR management increasingly more strategic.  Communication of the advances in the management of  sustainability. The OHL Group has been working since 2003 in the management of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).  Throughout this time, the Groups CSR Service, located in the companys Innovation and Sustainability  Management Area, has maintained the ultimate objective of providing the company with the management structure  and tools necessary for developing its commitment to sustainability.  Starting from this premise, the CSR Master Plan 2010-2014 was approved in 2010 and, since then, has structured  all of the companys efforts aimed at ensuring that its business activity is carried out in accordance with the  principles of CSR, in the diversity of areas where it operates and in its relations with all of its stakeholders.  30 31 Sustainability Report 2011 [2] / Managing sustainability at OHL Revision of the Code of Conduct The OHL Code of Conduct was approved in 2010 by the Board of Directors of the Group, marking an  important milestone from the point of view of the management of CSR in the company. Applicable  to all of the people belonging to the OHL Group, the Code constitutes an express statement of the  companys corporate values and develops the guidelines for the ethical and professional conduct that  the Group expects of its employees. Moreover, this instrument establishes the monitoring and control  mechanisms necessary for guaranteeing compliance, the most important of which is the Code of  Conduct Reporting and Consultation Channel, designed to enable employees and other stakeholders to  submit queries or to report conducts as necessary, always under the premise of absolute confidentiality. As evidence of the relevance of the Code within the company and of the companys efforts in keeping  it up to date, a revision of the Code was made during 2011. This revision was approved by Audit,  Compliance and CSR Committee, in January 2012. Another significant development also took place in January 2012 when the Audit, Compliance and  CSR Committee approved two procedures in relation to the Code and to the Code of Conduct Reporting  and Consultation Channel, specifically the OHL Group Code of Conduct Dissemination, Distribution  and Training Plan and the Procedure for the OHL Group Code of Conduct Reporting and Consultation  Channel. Both procedures are available on the corporate intranet in the Groups five main languages. The Audit, Compliance and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee is the body entrusted with  ensuring compliance with the Code of Conduct. However, the revision of the Code undertaken in 2011  introduced a new body providing additional safeguards: the Prevention Committee. This committee,  which will give support to the work of the Audit, Compliance and CSR Committee, will be the reference  body for the ongoing improvement and implementation of the OHL Groups crime risk prevention  and detection system. In this regard, the Prevention Committee will draw up and keep the Groups  criminal risk map updated, proposing whatever measures and controls it deems necessary to the Audit,  Compliance and CSR Committee.  We also wish to highlight the preparation, at the end of 2011, of a training course on the Code of  Conduct that will be ready for being offered on-line in the first four months of 2012 and will contribute to  raising the awareness of all of the Groups employees on the usefulness of this key tool.  Finally, we should likewise mention that during 2011, a total of two reports of conduct were received  through the Code of Conduct Reporting and Consultation Channel, both of which cases were closed  without further action following a thorough investigation. Widening the scope of CSR  policies The OHL Group is a global  company and, for this reason,  its economic, social and  environmental dimension is broad  and diverse. Progressing in the  management of sustainability in  this context involves a gradual  expansion of CSR policies and  practices to reach all of the teams  and companies comprising the  Group. An ambitious undertaking  in which the start-up and  consolidation of an international  structure for the management and  coordination of CSR is essential.  From this point of view, year  after year, fresh advances are  achieved that evidence the  dimension of the challenge. In  2011, the most outstanding  achievements included:  The consolidation of the  CSR coordinators group, a highly  significant step forward within the  company enabling a horizontal  and international management  effort. This group is made up by  the heads of the corporate areas  connected with the management  of  CSR ( Investor Relations,  Human Resources, Legal Services,  Occupational Risk Prevention,  Training, R&D&I, Quality,  Procurement, Environment,  Community Involvement) and  by the CSR coordinators of  the various business lines  (Concessions, Construction,  Industrial and Developments).  Moreover, starting from the CSR  coordinators of each business  line, an entire international  network is developed for  each division and in each  country in which the division  operates. Finally, this network  for the management of CSR is  also extended to each of the  companies of the Group in each  country, which also designate the  users of the CSR reporting tool.   The first steps towards  creating a more global  management of the supply chain.  The Responsible Procurement  Policy, approved at the end of  2011, involves the provision of an  important common framework to  the management of procurement  in all of the countries and through  all of the companies in the Group.  This initiative is explained in  detail in the chapter, OHL and  its suppliers, together in facing  the challenge of sustainability,  included in this Report.

Start-up of the internal and external dissemination actions agreed  at the coordinators group meetings in the context of CSR and  sustainability.  The advances in achieving  a more global focus in the policy  for the integration of people with  disabilities into employment in  the Group. At the present time,  targets have already been set  for the hiring of people with  disabilities in countries such as  Mexico, Brazil, the United States,  the Czech Republic, Canada,  Chile, Argentina and Peru. More  information on this subject can  be found in the chapter of this  Report, A shared culture.  The progress made in providing  the company with global guidelines  on equality and on the fight against  harassment for regulating these  aspects in all of the companies  of the Group. The same as in the  preceding case, more information  on this subject can be found in the  aforementioned chapter, A shared  culture. Outstanding among the  alliances and cooperation  arrangements initiated during  2011 was that established  between OHL Desarrollos  and the Rainforest Alliance  for the certification of more  sustainable tourism practices  at the Mexican resort of  Mayakoba.  32 33 Sustainability Report 2011 Architecture of policies and management tools for the commitments acquired by the OHL Group  OHL is gradually building a framework of action of its own that will enable it to adapt the postulates of  CSR to its specific context and, in addition, to address such adaptation through a global focus.  The construction of this vision brings with it the need to transform the commitments acquired into a  philosophy of work specific to the company. The policies connected with CSR created by OHL are the  expression of this strategic focus.  In 2011, the set of policies that enable OHL to materialize its commitments as actions was reinforced by  the Responsible Procurement Policy, to which will be added, during 2012, the new Human Rights Policy  the Group plans to approve in the first half of this year. As an example of the  capacity of the Groups CSR  management to adapt to the  range of countries where it  has a presence and to very  different business activities,  we can highlight the CSR  management model developed  by OHL Concesiones. Keeping  within the framework of the  OHL Groups CSR Master Plan  and of the commitments  entered into on this level, OHL  Concesiones assumes Corporate  Social Responsibility as a part  of a business management  model that is defined by  the creation of value under  conditions of sustainability, the  establishment of an ethical and  transparent relationship with  all of its stakeholders and the  responsibility of contributing  to the integrated development  of the communities in which it  operates. Thus, the commitment to  local and regional development  by OHL Concesiones is  evidenced through concrete  initiatives that adapt to the  particular characteristics of the  transportation infrastructure  concession business and of its  stakeholders. In this line of work, during  2011 OHL Concesiones put into  place its own CSR Framework  Plan 2011–2013, which defines  targets, strategies and lines  of action to be implemented  by the concession companies  in the various countries where  they operate. These lines of  action are developed mainly  in the areas of Education,  Health, Environment, HR and  Sponsorship, donations and  patronage. The achievements  obtained in each of these  environments by OHL  Concesiones will be described  progressively in the course of  this Report.  Within OHL Concesiones,  OHL Brasil set in motion its  Three-Year Corporate Social  Responsibility Program 2011– 2013. The targets set included  strengthening the programs  already in progress, increasing  the areas of action and placing  OHL Brasil and its subsidiaries  in a prominent position, always  in the framework of sustainable  business management.  Advancing towards an  increasingly more strategic  CSR management    As in the rest of the areas of  our business activity, in Corporate  Social Responsibility we propose  to reach the highest levels of  performance to the benefit of  our business and of the people  surrounding our business  activities. To this end, we work  to adjust and tie the decisions  on CSR issues to the strategy of  growth and competitiveness of the  OHL Group.  Ever since OHL began to work  in the area of CSR, its goal has  always been that of ensuring that  these activities are not carried  out in an isolated manner, but  rather that CSR would form a  part of the companys strategic  vision. For this reason, the  Sustainability Committee was set  up in 2003 and, today, continues  to be the top management  body for the coordination of  the CSR policies in the Group.  The Committee is chaired by  the Corporate General Manager  and, in addition to the corporate  areas directly connected with CSR  management, such as Human  Resources, Investor Relations,  R&D&I, Environment, Legal  Services, among others, all of  the operating divisions of the  Group are represented on the  Committee at the highest level.

A task  that included, among other  responsibilities, the following  duties:  Review and keep the Groups  Sustainability Policy updated.  Be familiar with, drive, guide  and supervise the actions of the  Group with respect to CSR and  sustainability, and report on these  actions to the Board of Directors.  Oversee compliance with  the Groups Code of Conduct and  manage the Conduct Reporting  and Consultation Channel.  Review and submit the  Annual CSR Report. Therefore, thanks to this move,  the strategic sense of the Groups  work in CSR has been reinforced  and, with this, the strength of  OHLs commitment in this area is  protected.  The most relevant actions by  the Committee on CSR issues  since this change took place  include:  The preparation of the 2010  Annual CSR Report  The initiation and  management of the reforms of the  Code of Conduct introduced at the  end of 2011  The monitoring and  management of the Code of  Conduct Channel.  Moreover, the assignment  of the aforementioned  responsibilities to the Audit,  Compliance and CSR Committee  has involved changes in the duties  allotted to the Sustainability  Committee since 2003 and   has established the following  connection between the two  governance bodies:  The Audit, Compliance and  CSR Committee has delegated to  the Sustainability Committee the  CSR management responsibility  for the implementation of the  OHL Groups Corporate Social  Responsibility policies.  The latter Committee will  submit a report to the former on  its activities and the status of CSR  in the OHL Group at the end of  each half of the year. In addition, the Group has  other committees that support  and supplement the work of  the Sustainability Committee,  by developing a number of the  specific areas that comprise  the work of CSR in the company  and, consequently, are strategic  for OHL. These are primarily the  Quality & Environment Committee,  the Safety & Health Committee  and the R&D&I Committee.

For 2012, the Groups  Sustainability Committee has  established several targets for the  purpose of continuing to advance  towards an increasingly more  strategic management of CSR  —goals that are in consonance  with those set by the Master Plan  for this period. These consist  of the preparation and start-up  of a Sustainability Balanced  Scorecard and the performance  of an analysis of the status of  Human Rights compliance in the  Group in order to verify the degree  of alignment of the management  of the various business activities  to the CSR policy and to the 10  Principles of the United Nations  Global Compact.  Communicating the  progress of OHL in  the management of  sustainability  Communication is a mainstay  of the management of Corporate  Responsibility not only because  it signifies the consummation  of a work process, but also  because it takes us closer to our  stakeholders and leads us to  ongoing improvement. For this  reason, the OHL Groups CSR  Master Plan includes several lines  of work centered on strategic  communication that share a  willingness to advance towards an  increasingly broader dialog and  towards a supply of information  that will fully meet the needs of  the stakeholders surrounding the  company. In this regard, the activity  undertaken in 2011 was  focused on two key elements  of communication and dialog  with stakeholders relevant  to any company: the CSR or  Sustainability Report and the  surveying of stakeholders. In  both cases, work was undertaken  to carry over to the context of  CSR management the significant  changes brought about in the  implementation of the Corporate  Social Responsibility Master Plan  2010-2014 and to introduce the  new challenges and aspirations  marked by this strategic tool.

The Report includes  the bulk of OHLs sustainability  communication and reflects the  transformations experienced by  the company in this regard. For  this reason, in 2011 we decided  to include the process of strategic  immersion which, from the CSR  perspective, is being developed  by OHL, more clearly in the Report  content. This decision brings  with it the focusing of the effort  being made towards a working  methodology better adjusted to  the needs of the company, of its  stakeholders and of the social and  environmental context in which it  operates.  The Sustainability Report  has gone on to be structured  around the Groups CSR Master  Plan and has a strong impact on  the progress made in the lines  of work contained in the Plan.  Likewise, an effort has been made  to reinforce the accessibility of  information (from the point of  view of clarity and the degree of  thoroughness with which contents  are set out) and to pursue in  depth those matters that may  be of greater relevance for OHLs  stakeholders.  To achieve this, not only has  greater effort been invested  in preparing a more succinct  and concrete text, but also the  formats for the dissemination  of its content have been  diversified for ease of reading  and understanding.  In addition  to the Executive Report, which  has been published regularly for a  number of years, the OHL Groups  Sustainability Report 2011 can be  found in an html format through  www.ohl.es, with the possibility,  as usual, of downloading the  pdf copy with the complete  information. OHL recognized in 2011 for its transparency Since  OHLs listing in 2008 on the Spanish reference stock market  index, the Ibex35, the CSR Observatory includes the Groups Annual  Sustainable Development Report (or Annual CSR Report) among the  reports analyzed in Observatorys own report, CSR in the Annual Reports  of the Ibex35 Companies, which evaluates the quality of the information  provided in reports of this kind.  In the course of these years, OHL has been steadily climbing to higher  positions, to the extent that, in the last report published in by the  Observatory in early 2012 (but referred to the annual reports published  by companies in 2011 on the 2010 financial year), the Group was placed  18th in the global ranking, holding second place in its sector in the general   ranking  and first place –also within the sector– in the  specific ranking for  the quality of the information provided on management systems. Also worthy of note in this regard is the recognition given by the  Informe Reporta 2011. To the work of management and dissemination  of information on the activity of the Group. The Report, which analyzes  the information provided by the companies listed on the  General  Index of the Madrid Stock Exchange (IGBM), positions OHL as the top  construction company in terms of the quality of the mandatory and  voluntary financial and non-financial information provided by companies  to the market last year. These advances provide  a response to the demand  expressed by customers and  by the social, environmental  and scientific and technological  organizations with which the  Group cooperates, in the survey  made at the end of 2010, in  which they requested OHL  to communicate the annual  advances obtained in CSR  in a more concise, clear and  streamlines manner, and in more  dynamic and easier-to-browse  formats. Also, from an internal point  of view, this progress has been  possible thanks also to the  systematization of the process  used by OHL for the preparation of  the Annual CSR Report, seeking to  improve the flows of information  and to enhance the review  and monitoring of information  controls on an internal scale.  This work will deliver an increase  in the response capacity and  transparency of the contents  provided by the company on  sustainability.  Moreover, this fresh drive  to the CSR Report has been  inspired and supported by the  active involvement of the Audit,  Compliance and Corporate Social  Responsibility Committee which,  for the second year in a row,  has taken the responsibility for  preparing the OHL Groups Annual  CSR Report, ratifying the change  in focus of the contents included  herein. Similarly, the strong  commitment of all of the  professionals of OHL involved  in the preparation of the CSR  Report should be highlighted. The  construction of a document of this  nature calls for the coordinated  contribution of many individuals  who, in the case of a multinational  company such as the OHL Group,  are located in a variety of working  and geographical environments.  A team made up by 177 people  who work with a computer  application containing a total  of 691 indicators linked to 14  subjects or areas of information.  Their proactive attitude and will  to improve make the existence of  this document possible year after  year. The Sustainability Report is  the most important the channel  of information that the OHL  Group places at the service of its  stakeholders, however, it is not  the only one. Throughout this  document details are provided  with respect to the most important  channels of contact and dialog  available to these groups.  Nevertheless, it is appropriate to  note here a number of the most  significant new developments  occurring in 2011 in this aspect:  Tecno and Mosaico move to an  electronic format Tecno and Mosaico are the two corporate magazines that OHL publishes  for its employees. In 2011, with a view to encouraging the use of the new  technologies and avoid an unnecessary environmental impact, both are  now distributed by e-mail. Moreover, they will continue to be available for  consultation on the intranet and the OHL website. In 2012, both publications have begun to be published in English also:  Mosaico through two independent newsletters and Tecno in a bilingual  edition. All of the offices of the Group have a limited number of copies on paper for  reading, and a stock of copies is available in the general archives, to which  access can be obtained on request, by applying through the corporate  intranet, OHLFinet. Conference Calls  for the quarterly presentation of results In 2011, OHL began to hold conference calls in English for the quarterly  presentation of results in order to facilitate access to the information by  analysts, investors and shareholders, and to promote a more open and  flexible dialog with them.  During these calls, the Economic-Financial General Manager leads the  presentation and answers the questions of all who wish to participate,  with the support of the chief financial officers of OHL Concesiones and OHL  Construccin, as well as the Investor Relations Manager More information:  Channels of Communication  and Dialog with  Stakeholders [2] / Managing sustainability at OHL  38 39 Sustainability Report 2011 Survey of stakeholders in 2011 In 2010 the OHL Group decided  to shift the focus of the surveys  of stakeholders undertaken  yearly since 2006, with a view to  including in them the significant  changes introduced by the  company in its management of  CSR. OHL felt that the strategic  shift in direction marked by the  Corporate Social Responsibility  Master Plan 2010-2014 called for  an appropriate verification of the  information with these groups,  in order to thereby ensure an  alignment with their demands.  Therefore, to the usual objective  of learning the expectations of  stakeholders, the Group has  now added that of evaluating the  matching of the strategic lines  of the Master Plan with their  expectations.  The survey project was carried  out in two stages. The first stage  took place at the end of 2010  and was aimed at the employees  of all of the divisions of the OHL  Group, to the customers of OHL  Concesiones, OHL Construccin  and OHL Desarrollos in Spain,  Mexico and Brazil and to civic  organizations associated with the  environment of the Group in these  three operating divisions and in  the three countries mentioned.  The results obtained and the  response planned by OHL in order  to address the relevant matters  identified, can be consulted in the  Sustainable Development Report  2010, and sets out in detail the  expectations expressed by the  various players in each of the  chapters of this Report.  Likewise, the working  group is addressing other  aspects connected with the  implementation of the Groups  CSR Master Plan in the area of  human resources management,  in order to align the response  to the expectations of the  employees surveyed with the  lines of action defined in the Plan  and considered strategic. In the  chapter, A shared culture, of this  document –a chapter devoted  to the employer-employee  relationship– more details are  available with respect to the  outcomes obtained by this  working group in the course of  the year. Finally, and given the success  of the employee survey initiative  carried out at the end of 2010,  the Group will survey this group  again in 2012, addressing  issues connected with the  measurement of the work  climate and with the intention of  obtaining a deeper knowledge of  staff expectations with respect  to those issues where a greater  gap was detected between the  evaluation of the management  by OHL and the significance  given by the employees to them  in the 2010 survey. The second survey stage  took place at the end of  2011 and involved suppliers  and subcontractors of OHL  Construccin and OHL Industrial  in Spain, as well as investors  and analysts in Mexico, Spain  and Brazil. The objectives  set by the company in this  case were the same as in the  previous stage, and the survey  methodology consisted of ad hoc  interviews and questionnaires  with a view to obtaining a high  degree of representativity.  This second stage succeeded  in involving more than 80  participants, between suppliers  or subcontractors and investors  and analysts of the Group. In the survey of suppliers and  subcontractors, it was found  that a number of the issues  indicated as relevant coincided  with those identified in the  survey of employees, customers  and civic organizations, as well  as with the priorities of OHL.  The company is aware that the  management of the supply chain  is a matter of essential relevance,  particularly those aspects bearing  a relationship to the dimension of  management and compliance with  Human Rights. In this regard, and  as mentioned earlier, in December  2011 the company approved  the Responsible Procurement  Policy, thereby aligning itself  with the primary demands of this  stakeholder group in view of the  results of the survey.   Similarly, and in order to  address the rest of the issues  considered important by suppliers  and subcontractors, the target  set by the company for 2012 is to  create a working group comprised  by representatives of the various  procurement management  departments in the divisions of  the Group and of the CSR Service,  for the purpose of identifying  and assessing new actions to be  undertaken in the context of the  responsible management of the  supply chain. It is important to highlight that  in response to the demands and  expectations expressed by the  employees who participated in  this first stage of the survey, in  September 2011, a working group  made up by all of the Groups HR  managers and the CSR Service  was set up. This working group  originated with the main objective  of deciding on and prioritizing  which action should be set in  motion by OHL in order to provide  a response to what the Groups  employees had expressed in  view of the result of the survey  made, primarily in those aspects  where the gap between the  relevance given by the employees  and the evaluation of OHLs  management of such aspects is  greater. As a result, the issue of  equal opportunities and non- discrimination has been identified  as an area of priority action for the  working group, as the employee  survey showed that there is still  room for improvement from the  management point of view. Relevant issues identified by the OHL stakeholders in the first survey stage Employees Customers Civic Organizations Eradication of child labor Ethical and transparent  management of the business,  avoiding all forms of corruption   and bribery  Job stability Customer relations and customer care Customer or end-user satisfaction  Occupational risk prevention   Legal and regulatory compliance Environmental management  systems Customer satisfaction Training Occupational safety Human capital Regulatory compliance  Community Involvement  Environmental management Occupational risk prevention  Equal opportunities Ethics and transparency (*) Arranged in order of importance [2] / Managing sustainability at OHL  40 41 Sustainability Report 2011 In the process of the survey  of investors and analysts, an  effort was made to obtain the  participation of the principal  financial analysts who follow  the activity of the OHL Group.  Accordingly, the people who  participated were able to  contribute highly representative  information, given their capacity  to agglutinate the demands of a  multitude of shareholders and  investors. In this regard, the  survey has served to identify  the issues valued most by these  groups in relation to OHLs non- financial performance as well as  which channels of communication  they find most useful in their  relations with the Group.  Moreover, it has been found  that this group of stakeholders  rates both the companys risk  management and its systems of  Corporate Governance positively. Main relevant issues identified by the OHL stakeholders in the second survey stage Suppliers and subcontractors Investors and analysts Eradication of child labor Ethical and transparent management of the business,  avoiding all forms of corruption and bribery  Compliance with contract terms & conditions  Occupational Risk Prevention  Elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor Technical training for job performance Corporate Governance Risk management Transparency Strategy Environment HR management (*) Arranged in order of importance OHL in the public debate on CSR At OHL we feel that a means  for contributing to the progress  of Corporate Responsibility as a  strategic activity is through active  participation in the public debate  on this issue. For this reason,  in 2011 OHL –together with  Campofro, Cemex, Elcogs, Ence,  Endesa, FYM, Gamesa, Holcim,  Indra, Red Elctrica Espaola  and Solvay– joined the RC  Outlook project of the foundation,  Fundacin Entorno.  This project  is a communication initiative  that seeks to align Corporate  Responsibility policies with the  priorities and needs of todays  society, in such a way as to make  a real contribution to sustainable  development. In this way, the participating  companies, all strongly committed  to Corporate Responsibility, share  their reflections and acquired  knowledge in this field through  a periodical publication in an  electronic form called RC Outlook.  Two communications were  disseminated in 2011, with the  participation of the OHL Group.  The first included a paper by Luis  Garca-Linares, Corporate General  Manager of the Group, entitled  Liderar hoy la RSC para seguir  liderando el mercado maana  (Leading CSR today, to continue  leading the market tomorrow),  together with an exposition of  the OHL-Universities Alliance  for research in the ecological  restoration of areas affected by  civil works, presented by Manuel  Villn, Innovation & Sustainability  manager.  Key data on the RC Outlook companies Integration of CR  83% have global CR policies that are mandatory in the countries  where they operate.  67% have a specific CR committee.  75% include CR aspects in their scorecards. Extension of responsibility  83% establish CR clauses in procurement and contracting  procedures. Business ethics  92% have a code of conduct and have corporate anticorruption and  anti-bribery policies in place. Transparency and reporting  67% include CR indicators in their financial report. The second communication  was devoted to the Integration of  CR and Integrity and published  a paper by the OHL Groups  Legal Services General Manager,  Jos Mara del Cuvillo, entitled  La gestin en valores, garanta  de fortaleza y competitividad  (Management in values, a  guarantee of strength and  competitiveness). This second  communication also included the  exposition of a case study on the  management tools and structure  necessary for an international and  diversified group such as OHL to  be able to promote and share the  values and principles comprising  the corporate culture of the Group.  This case study was explained by  Rosa Alberdi, Head of the Groups  CSR Service. Finally, mention should be  made that the third and last  communication connected  with the RC Outlook project  was published in February  2012. On that occasion, the  title of the communication was  Respuesta empresarial a los retos  ambientales (Business responds  to environmental challenges)  and included a paper by lvaro  Gamarra, Head of the Quality  Service of OHL Industrial, La  importancia de crear valor en  condiciones de sostenibilidad  (The importance of creating value  on the basis of conditions of  sustainability). OHLs participation  in this communication also  included a case study made by  Ricardo Muoz, R&D&I and CSR  coordinator of OHL Industrial,  on thermal solar generation at  the Puerto Errado 2 plant, as  a practical example of R&D&I  focused on sustainability. OHL feels that the public debate on Corporate Responsibility contributes to  the progress achieved in this area. For this reason, in 2011, the company  participated in the RC Outlook project led by Fundacin Entorno OHLs risk management is one of the aspects highlighted most consistently by all  of the stakeholder groups.

The long-term vision of the  OHL share price on the Madrid  Stock Exchange reflects that the  Stock Exchange has recognized  this value generation and  commitment, which, despite  the depreciation registered in  2011, remain firmly in place.  Accordingly, the trend in the  share price from the end of 2002,  the year in which the Groups  current strategy was defined, up  to December 31, 2011, evidences  the significant generation of value  for the companys shareholders: The OHL Group in the FTSE4Good Ibex index     This stock market index, created by FTSE Group y Bolsas y Mercados Espaoles (BME) in 2008, is the sole  Spanish index made up by securities belonging to BMEs Ibex 35 index and to the FTSE Spain All Cap  index, on complying with specific good practice criteria in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Our presence and permanence in this index connects OHL with the Socially Responsible Investing (SRI)  market, setting the company apart as a security of interest for those investors and managers who combine  their financial objectives with their concern for the ethical, social, environmental and good governance  aspects of business management.  The difficult economic, social and environmental situation we are currently experiencing ensures the  future growth of this investor profile and contributes to driving the efforts in CSR being made at OHL. Thus, according to the most recent data published by Eurosif in 2010, SRI now constitutes a market that  manages assets in Europe for an estimated value of close to five trillion euros and of more than two trillion  in the United States. In Spain, according to figures provided at the end of 2011 by the ESADE Socially Responsible Investing  Observatory, this market grew significantly during 2010. Overall, the assets managed under SRI criteria  in Spain at the end of that year amounted to 15,231.251 million euros, with a total of 1,136,735 unit- holders. These figures represent an 8% increase in assets with respect to the previous year and a 40%  increase in unit-holders. At the present time, SRI in Spain is basically an institutional market led by  employee pension funds that have approved SRI policies and by pension funds which, although not  having adopted SRI criteria, exercise voting rights and vote at shareholders meetings. Institutional SRI  accounts for 99% of the capital managed under these criteria in Spain. The Liability Management  Deal of the Year award and the  evaluation by the Informe Reporta  2011 of the information that  the OHL Group provides to its  shareholders stand out among  the new developments in the year  with respect to the markets. In February 2011, the  Association of Corporate  Treasurers (ACT) granted the   Liability Management Deal of  the Year award to the swap offer  included by OHL in its Eurobond  issue in April 2010, for the early  redemption of bonds issued in  2007.  The OHL share has grown over  the last nine years at a cumulative  annual rate of 19.1%, while  the Ibex 35 grew 4.0% and the  average for the listed construction  companies, not including OHL,  was 4.1%. This means that, in the course  of this none-year period, the  Group has generated for its  shareholders 8.7 times more  value than the average obtained  by the rest of the companies in the  sector. Together with the commitment  to value generation, in terms of  sustainability the OHL Group  renewed its presence during 2011  in the FTSE4Good Ibex index of the  Madrid Stock Exchange, for the  fourth year in a row. In March 2011, the company  made a fresh issue of Eurobonds  in which it obtained 425 million  euros, with an 8.75% annual  coupon, payable every six months  and maturing in March 2018. That  issue was intended to refinance  the 421.6 million euros from the  2007 bond issue, maturing in May  2012. OHL made a simultaneous  buyback offer for the outstanding  2007 bonds, which was taken up  by 55.5% of the bond-holders, for  an amount of 234 million euros.  These transactions have been  a positive development for OHL,  because they have enabled the  company to lengthen the maturity  profile of its debt and to move  ahead in the Groups financial  policy, based on meeting its  permanent needs through long- time financing. Likewise, the  transactions have reinforced the  significant presence of OHL in  the international capital markets,  giving the Group greater financial  flexibility. 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1,000 12-31-02 6-30-03 12-31-03 6-30-04 12-31-04 6-30-05 12-31-05 6-30-06 12-31-06 6-30-07 12-31-07 6-30-08 12-31-08 6-30-09 12-31-09 6-30-10 12-31-10 6-30-11 12-31-11 Shareholder value creation  Performance of the OHL share since 12/31/02 CAGR OHL: +19.1%  CAGR Avg.

In general, and with a global A  rating, OHL is placed 11th among  the 113 companies listed on  the Madrid Stock Exchange that  were assessed in the report. The  Informe Reporta methodology  is based on three principles:  transparency, adequacy and  accessibility, which are rated  on the basis of 21, 3 and 6  indicators, respectively. The  maximum score is 100 points,  70 of which refer to transparency,  15 to adequacy and 15 to  accessibility. OHL obtained A  ratings in transparency and  accessibility and B in adequacy.  From a forward-looking  perspective, we are conscious  that to attain our economic  and business objectives, we  must offer our shareholders  and investors transparency in  management, confidence in our  decisions and vision for facing  the challenges to come.  For this reason, we work  actively to convey to analysts,  investors and shareholders our  efforts, results and commitments  to the future of the company  and to the social and physical  environments in which OHL is  present.  Active, effective and  ongoing communication with  those who follow the performance  of our business is a priority of our  Corporate Social Responsibility  Master Plan 2010-2014. OHL in the markets The OHL Group is present in  Spains securities market, where  its parent company, OHL, is listed  on the Stock Exchange, as well  as in the markets of Brazil and  Mexico, where OHL Brasil and  OHL Mxico, subsidiaries of OHL  Concesiones, are traded. These  two Latin American countries  are the key markets for the  transportation infrastructure  concession business.

The dividend-per-share policy  has been maintained, as in  previous years, at around 25% of  the net profit per share, calculated  on the basis of the consolidated  profit for the year attributable to  the parent company.

Its stock  market flotation was the largest  transaction on the Mexican  securities market in the last 10  years and the third largest in the  transportation   infrastructure  sector worldwide in the last five  years. Since September 2011,  OHL Mxico has been included in  the ndice de Precios Cotizados  (IPC), Mexicos principal stock  exchange index, although its  share price declined 9.08% in the  financial year, ending the year at  21.62 Mexican pesos.

These teams manage  the Groups communication with  shareholders, investors and  analysts with a clear objective:  maximum transparency in the  disclosure of the business  information of relevance to these  stakeholders. To do so, in the course of  the year the Group promotes a  number of face-to-face meetings   and provides several channels of  communication. In 2011, OHL conducted  several road shows, locally and  outside of Spain, participated  in forums and seminars and, as  is its usual practice, organized  the annual presentations of the  Groups results for the financial  year and the specific presentation  on OHL Concesiones, together  with the General Shareholders  Meeting.  Webcasting is used in  order to facilitate the following of  these three annual presentations  by the various groups of  stakeholders. In terms of the communication  of the policies and advances  in the management of CSR, the  face-to-face meeting where this  information is provided is the  General Shareholders Meeting,  at which the actions taken in this  regard are reported through an  exposition of the most important  milestones and achievements  attained in the financial year.   With respect to  written  communications, the annual  accounts, comprised by  the Annual Report and the  Sustainability Report, comprise  OHLs primary publication and,  as such, include information of  relevance to shareholders and  investors on the companys  ethical, social and environmental  performance in the year of  reference.  In addition, shareholders and  investors can find information  geared more specifically to their  demands in the quarterly reports  on results that the company  submits to the Comisin Nacional  del Mercado de Valores (CNMV  – National Securities Market  Commission), which reflect the  position of the company, including  financial statements, performance  by business activity and share  price performance.  As required by the Securities  Market Act, these documents  include balance sheet, statement  of income and cash flow  statement figures, compared to  the figures registered in the same  period during the previous year  expanding this information in  the second and fourth quarters.  Moreover, the CNMV is also sent  any corporate presentation that  includes new developments  affecting the figures submitted  previously. Those shareholders  who have expressed an interest  in the information submitted  to the CNMV are provided such  information once the Commission  has published it.   More than 20 financial  analysts monitor the company  on a regular basis, and the  Investor Relations department   maintains a continuous flow  of information with them in  response to the needs of  investors and of the market. Also, starting in 2011, OHL  has begun to hold conference  calls in English for the quarterly  presentation of results. During  these calls, the Economic- Financial General Manager leads  the presentation and answers the  questions of the participants, with  the support of the chief financial  officers of OHL Concesiones and  OHL Construccin, as well as the  Investor Relations Manager. During the rest of the  year, the communication  with analysts, shareholders  and investors is ensured  through the e-mail address  relacion.accionistas@ohl.es  and the shareholder services  telephone +34 91 348 44 71.

Survey of analysts 2011 In 2011, the OHL Group  surveyed a group of analysts  who regularly follow the business  activity of the company. The  aim of the survey was to learn  what their priority interests and  demands for information are,  within and outside of the scope of  sustainability. Significant among the  results obtained is the fact that,  among all of the analysts who  participated in the survey, all  stated that they take into account  in their analyses other aspects in  addition to the strictly economic  and financial points. The majority  evaluate positively the Groups  presence in sustainability indexes  and the existence of a CSR  strategy in its companies. These and other assessments,  together with the suggestions  made by this group of OHL  stakeholders, will serve to  improve our performance in the  environment of the relationship  we maintain with analysts,  investors and, therefore, will be  taken into account for attaining  the goals set in the OHL Groups  CSR Master Plan. Among the supports and  channels of dialog made available  to analysts by OHL, the ones rated  highest included the  Investor  Relations department, the  monographic presentation on OHL  Concesiones, the road shows,  the conference calls  for the  presentation of quarterly results,  the meeting for the presentation  of the results for the year and the  regular visits and conferences with  analysts. [3] / Value creation through commitment  52 52 Sustainability Report 2011 A shared  culture [4]  53 54 Sustainability Report 2011 [4] A shared culture 2011 has been a period of  progress but also of adaptation for  the OHL Group. As a consequence  of the strong international  expansion experienced in the last  few years, as well as the strategic  and operational planning of the  OHL Groups businesses, during  the past year a new organizational  model was developed and  implemented, marked particularly  by the unification of the  International Construction and  Domestic Construction divisions  as a single Construction division,  OHL Construccin. In addition, the difficult  current economic situation has  forced us to address a number  of eventualities, such as the  reduction in public tendering in  Spain.  In this context, the application  of a range of adjustment measures  and changes became necessary  in the course of the year, from  the point of view of human  resource management in Spain.  The creation of employment in  the construction sector declined  and, yet, the emergence of new  businesses within the Group,  such as facilities management,  have made it possible to maintain  the total staff establishment in  the country on levels similar to  those of previous years, although  changing its composition.  In contrast, the growth of  the international business has  brought about a significant  increase in the number of  employees of the Group outside of  Spain, consolidating the trend of  international expansion that was  already evident in previous years. With respect to the responsible  management of human resources,  the main milestones in the year  are associated with the work  carried out in order to further  equal opportunities and Human  Rights compliance among the  people comprising the OHL Group,  highlighting the following: Approval of a Harassment  Protocol applicable to the entire  OHL Group. Approval of the analysis  of the recruitment and hiring  processes in all of the companies  of the Group to detect whether  discriminatory practices exist in  such processes.   Implementation of a plan  establishing targets for the hiring  of people with disabilities in the  countries where the Group has a  permanent presence and no legal  requirement exists in this regard. Another important  development, in a complex year  due to the organizational changes  and the global economic situation,  is the increase in the participation  of OHLs employees in corporate  volunteering activities, with groups  organized in Spain, Brazil and  Argentina, as well as the demand  arising in those countries where  volunteering had not yet been  introduced, such as in Mexico  and Chile.  In this way, corporate  volunteering has become  consolidated as an important  area of action of the Group, within  the scope of its commitment  to society, and has now been  included in its CSR Master Plan  2010-2014 and is considered a  significant element in its human  resource management policy. Responsible human resource  management is, therefore, one  of the crucial dimensions of  CSR management in the Group.  The CSR Master Plan, together  with the results of the processes  of ongoing dialog with our  employees, reveal the areas where  we need to focus our efforts to  ensure that OHL perseveres in  consolidating a shared culture  and continues to be a good place  to work.

We  are a large community of people devoted to different business lines and activities but with a common set of goals  and values, based on respect, trust, loyalty, transparency and security.    Our corporate culture makes us strong and makes OHL a good place to work. For this reason, each year, we propose  targets that will help us to cultivate and improve this way of growing a company. Recognition of the Best Commitment-to-People Initiative in 2011   Awards for Corporate Social Responsibility given by the Fundacin  Construccin y Madera In the month of December the Awards of the Fundacin Construccin  y Madera to the most outstanding construction companies in terms  of CSR were presented for the first time. These awards single out  performance in three categories: commitment to people, commitment  to society and commitment to the environment. OHL was given the award in the category of Commitment to People.  The prize recognizes OHLs firm determination to create a stable  framework of relations with its employees, at the same time as it  promotes training in Human Rights, without relaxing its vigilance of  occupational risks in those countries where it operates, together with  its policies of equality between men and women. The award was presented to Luis Garca-Linares, Corporate General  Manager of OHL, by Manuel Gonzlez Blanco, manager of the Madrid  territorial council of the Fundacin Laboral de la Construccin.  Consolidation of the decentralization model for human resource  management  During the last few years, the international expansion of the Group  and its entry into new businesses has been accompanied by a  necessary process of decentralization of the corporate apparatus. The  management of human resources has not been an exception and,  starting three years ago, the HR Department has been developing a plan  for the decentralization of the human resource management function. As a result, in 2011, the HR Department became the Corporate HR  Management area of the Group, and the human resource managers of  the divisions went on to depend hierarchically on the structure of each  division and functionally on the Corporate General Management of the  Group, through the Corporate HR Management area. In line with the targets set in the decentralization plan, in 2011 the  process for the selection and training of human resource managers  to fill positions in the new operating divisions continued, with the  application of internal promotion criteria as far as possible. In this way,  a model of operational decentralization has been consolidated for the  management of people. The new structure has reinforced the human resources function in the  Group and facilitates the application of common policies and guidelines  of a general nature for all of the Groups business pursuits, particularly  in regard to aspects as important as the creation work environments  that will guarantee the dignity of the individual, equal opportunities and  non-discrimination, diversity management, career development, health  and safety and the right to collective bargaining.   55 56 Sustainability Report 2011 [4] / A shared culture Characteristics of the OHL Group workforce at december 31, 2011 Distribution of the workforce by Division. trenD over the last three years 2011 2010 2009 OHL Concesiones 9,205 7,378 6,396 OHL Construccin (*) 10,100 11,726 13,141 OHL Industrial 589 386 270 OHL Desarrollos 1,603 2,502 1,465 OHL Medio Ambiente 351 335 317 Corporate areas 3,297 (**) 253 282 total 25,145 22,580 21,871 (*) The domestic and international construction divisions merged in 2011.

The OHL Group maintains  and furthers an equality and  non-discrimination policy based  on respect for its employees,  independently of their religion,  sexual orientation, gender, race  or age. In this framework, the  Corporate HR Management area  carried out a number of actions  during 2011 with the aim of  continuing to guarantee equal  opportunities in all of its work  environments.  From the perspective of gender  equality, these actions included  the broadening of the scope of  action for the application of the  OHL harassment protocol, in  force in Spain since 2009, to all  of the countries where the Group  has a permanent establishment.  In the course of the year, the  working group comprised by the  various HR areas of the Group and  coordinated by the Corporate HR  Manager and the CSR Service,  drew up a new Harassment  Protocol (Group Protocol for  situations of Sexual, Moral or  Gender-Based Harassment)  that has been approved by the  Sustainability Committee and is  applicable throughout the OHL  In 2012, the targets set under  the Equality Plan include a review  of the measures contained in  the Plan and negotiations for  its renewal for a further period,  as well as the continuation of  the organization of day-long  awareness-raising meetings at  work centers.  With respect to actions  undertaken outside of Spain  during 2011, the HR-CSR working  group made an analysis of the  legislative framework applicable  with respect to equality in those  countries where OHL has a  Equality Plan   Applicable to all of the  construction work centers and  subsidiaries in Spain Guiding principles of the equality plan:  Equal treatment between men and women.  Non direct discrimination by reason of a persons sex.  Non indirect discrimination by reason of a persons sex.  Prohibition of sexual harassment.  Prohibition of sexual harassment by reason of a persons sex.  Indemnity against reprisals. areas of action:  Equal opportunity culture and policies.  Impact on society and CSR.  Communication, image and language.  Gender representativity.  Recruitment, training and promotion.  Pay policy and structure.  Health and risk prevention.  Reconciliation of work and private life.  Harassment and discrimination.  Monitoring and assessment.   Men and women sharing  the control of one of OHLs  Brazilian toll roads. The equal  opportunities policy promoted  by the Group places non- discrimination on the ground of  a persons sex in the forefront of  all of its activities. Group. The new protocol, which  provides a response to a number  of the expectations expressed by  the employees surveyed at the  end of 2010 by OHL, is currently  being conveyed to all employees  through cascade distribution,  for which purpose it has been  translated into the five main  languages of the Group. In Spain, the Equality Plan  signed by the company in 2009  and applicable to the employees  of OHL Construccin, will continue  in effect up to the end of 2012,  and the half-yearly meetings of its  Monitoring Committee were held  as usual during 2011. In addition,  two day-long awareness-raising  meetings were held in Madrid  and Barcelona to deal with issues  such as the proper identification  of discriminatory conduct and  situations of harassment in the  workplace or the acceptance of  sexist stereotypes in the work  environment. stable presence, together with  the measures already being  applied by all of the companies  in the Group. For the purpose of  guaranteeing that the Groups  business activities transpire in  an environment of maximum  respect for equal opportunities,  internal processes and tools were  designed in 2011 for detecting  possible discriminatory practices,  from the point of view of gender  equality, in the recruitment and  hiring processes of all of the  companies in the Group.  The application of this internal  system commenced on January  1, 2012 and extends to all  of the recruitment processes  undertaken as from that date. The  information extracted, thanks to  the indicator suite designed, will  be received and reviewed by the  Corporate HR Management area  on a quarterly basis. With respect to remuneration,  base salaries are linked to job  categories and are identical for  all of the employees in each  category, independently of sex,  nationality or any other personal  characteristic.  2011 2010      M: Men  -   W: Women up to 30 between 30-45 between 46-55 56 and over total m %m w % w m w m w m w m w total m % m w % w managers           367            333  91%             34  9%            3             1         105           15         116           13         109           5     406            373  92%             33  8% Graduate degree  holders 2,871        2,067  72%           804  28%        311        222     1,151         497         421           77         184           8  2,816        2,005  71%           811  29% undergraduate  degree holders 4,566        2,899  63%        1,667  37%    1,061        884     1,265         675         402           99         171           9  4,376        2,851  65%        1,525  35% non-graduate  technicians 2,515        1,764  70%           751  30%        322        184         767         347         420          189         255        31  2,686        1,893  70%           793  30% clerical staff 2,396        1,143  48%        1,253  52%        302        440         507         551         210          191         124        71  1,916           990  52%           926  48% rest of personnel 12,430        9,748  78%        2,682  22%    3,234        409     4,148         956     1,619          830         747      487  10,380        8,169  79%        2,211  21% totals for the Group 25,145     17,954  71%        7,191  29%    5,233     2,140     7,943     3,041     3,188     1,399     1,590      611  22,580     16,281  72%        6,299  28% Distribution of employees by job cateGory, aGe anD seX at December 2011 Parapro Program: integration into the workforce of people with  disabilities in Brazil  In December 2011, the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee  of OHL Brasil approved the start of the Program for the inclusion of  people with disabilities. Its main objectives, in addition to compliance  with the relevant local legislation, include the consolidation and  rooting of a culture of diversity in the company and the promotion of  actions that will contribute to the personal and career development  of people with disabilities and make an impact on the social  transformation of the immediate environment.  The implementation of the program will take place in accordance  with a plan designed in four phases and in cooperation with Plura, a  company specialized in social inclusion projects.   In the first phase, work has commenced on the identification of  employees with disabilities, as well as on the preparation of a  diagnosis of job needs depending on cognitive level, mobility,  physical strength, eyesight and hearing requirements. Moreover, the  program intends to set in motion an on-the-job health project and to  prepare a roster of candidates for each locality.  The presence of women in OHL rose in 2011 to  29% of its workforce. [4] / A shared culture  59 60 Sustainability Report 2011 The OHL Group has already  been working for a number  of years in favor of the social  inclusion of people with  disabilities through a range  of activities. Integration into  the labor market is one of the  most important aspects in  relation to this group, and the  company decided to broaden  its commitment in this regard  during 2011, thereby providing  a response to the demands  expressed by the employees  surveyed at the end of 2010.  Accordingly, in December 2011,  the Sustainability Committee  approved the start-up of a Plan  for the Hiring of People with  Disabilities and at Risk of Social  Exclusion to be implemented  outside of Spain as well,  establishing explicit commitments  to the contracting of people with  disabilities in the countries where  no specific regulation exists and  OHL has a permanent presence,  such as Mexico, the United States,  Canada, Chile, Argentina and  Peru. In these countries, the aim is  for 1% of the staff establishment  to be made up by people in this  group within a maximum period of  three years. In Spain, this plan has been  in effect since 2006 and, as an  outcome of its implementation,  12 people with disabilities and/ or at risk of social exclusion  were engaged in 2011, for which  purpose OHL has cooperated  with entities such as Fundacin  Integra, Fundacin Adecco and  the Madrid Down Syndrome  Foundation. For 2012, the target  set is to hire a total of 13 people  with disabilities and/or at risk of  social exclusion, by cooperating  with organizations specialized  in the integration of these  groups into the workforce and  by organizing awareness-raising  actions geared to HR managers.  Working group for the responsible management of human resources An internal working group was created in 2011 under the leadership of  the Corporate HR Management, with the participation of the CSR Service  and the community involvement area of the Group, in addition to the  various human resource areas of the business divisions. The basic objective of this ad-hoc working team is to analyze the  most adequate response to be given to the expectations expressed  by employees in the survey carried out at the end of 2010, as well to  continue to drive the pursuit of the targets of the CSR Master Plan 2010- 2014 associated with responsible human resource management, also  taking into account the results of the survey. The initial results obtained in 2011 by this working group evidenced  its effectiveness for driving a range of relevant measures and actions  and, consequently, it has been set up as a permanent team. The  team is made up by a total of nine members and has been meeting  monthly since September 2011. Its fundamental objectives include the  following:  Create a permanent channel of dialog and cooperation among human  resource managers and establish synergies in the framework of the new  divisional organization of the Group.  Continue giving impetus to the pursuit of the targets defined in the  CSR Master Plan in relation to the employees.    Guarantee compliance with OHLs commitments within the area of  human resource management, particularly in relation to Human Rights  and equal opportunities.    Develop the initiatives necessary in order to provide a response to the  concerns detected through the various channels of communication and  dialog with employees.  During the first year of operation of the working group, measures as  relevant as the new Harassment Protocol or the plan for the hiring of  people with disabilities in countries where the Group has a permanent  presence, both described in the course of this document, were  successfully introduced. From left to right, Ignacio Cano, Mara  Ruspoli, Joaqun Castro, Emilio Gmez,  Arturo Pousa,Francisco Mallol, Rosa Alberdi  and  Carmelo Ferrndez, members of the  human resource working group. Ethical conduct and Human  Rights The respect for and observance  of Human Rights is a basic  aspect of responsible business  management. A large part of the  voluntary commitments acquired  by the OHL Group recognize this,  and we are determined to ensure  that the protection of these rights  will be evident in the day-to-day  management of the company.  To this end, at OHL we are taking  significant steps in order to integrate  this priority into all of our activities.  In 2011 the OHL Group Code of  Conduct continued to be the basic  tool for the protection of Human  Rights within the company, as  it carries the commitment to  these rights over to the way our  employees conduct themselves,  through the establishment of  common values, principles and  standards of behavior for the  entire workforce. In addition, the Group  organizes training activities  in ethics and Human Rights.  A highlight in 2011 was the  preparation of training courses  on the proper application of the  OHL Code of Conduct and on other  aspects associated with Human  Rights compliance and the United  Nations Global Compact. These  courses will be available to all of  the Groups employees for the first  time in 2012, through the on-line  learning modality. The courses on Corporate  Social Responsibility, together  with the welcome courses, were  also updated and continued  during 2011. Both include  aspects relating to Human Rights  compliance and ethics in the work  environment. In 2011, throughout the Group,  a total of 32,274 hours were  taught in the Integration Course,  which groups together the CSR  and Welcome training areas. For the purpose of continuing to  advance in this direction, for 2012  the target set by OHL is to develop  an analysis of the status of Human  Rights compliance in the Group  in order to ascertain the degree  of alignment of the management  of its range of business activities  with its CSR policy and the  10 Principles of the United  Nations Global Compact. The  implementation of this monitoring  project has been approved by  the Sustainability Committee,  which considered that the most  appropriate way to perform  this analysis would be through  the Internal Audit department,  whereby this proposal was  brought before the Audit,  Compliance and CSR Committee.  In the first quarter of 2012, the  Internal Audit department, with  the support of the Corporate HR  Management area and the CSR  Service, has been working on  the preliminary methodological  design, and it is expected that the  audits themselves will commence  in the second half of 2012. OHL Desarrollos has undertaken  a very significant initiative in  defense of Human Rights in 2011.  The Mayakoba Resort, which  belongs to OHL Desarrollos and  is located on Mexicos Riviera  Maya, has acceded to The Code. org or the Code of Conduct for the  Protection of Children from Sexual  Exploitation in Travel and Tourism.  This initiative is promoted by  the organization, ECPAT (End Child  Prostitution, Child Pornography  and Trafficking of Children for  Sexual Purposes), a network of  organizations and individuals who  work together for the elimination  of child prostitution, child  pornography and the trafficking  of children, young girls and  adolescents for sexual purposes.  The network is present in 70  countries in all parts of the world  and is supported by organizations  such as the United Nations  Childrens Fund (UNICEF) or the  World Tourism Organization (WTO).   In 2011, the Mayakoba resort, which belongs to OHL Desarrollos, acceded to The Code. org, the Tourism Sectors Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual  Exploitation. [4] / A shared culture  61 62 Sustainability Report 2011 The signature of this code  introduces a new element into  the OHL Group for mitigating  a specific social risk in the  tourism sector and in the  territory where Mayakoba is  located. The signature of the  Code, in December 2011, was  accompanied by the drawing-up of  an action plan to be set in motion  by the Mayakoba companies over  the new few months. This action  plan includes specific activities  and measurable targets in the  following areas:  Establishment of an ethical  policy regarding the commercial  sexual exploitation of children,  young girls and adolescents.  Training of personnel both  in the country of origin of tourists  and travel destinations.  Introduction of a clause in  contracts with suppliers, stating  a common repudiation of the  commercial sexual exploitation of  children.  Provision of information to  travelers by means of catalogs,  brochures, notices in the  programming of in-flight TV/ video, ticket-slips, company  websites, etc.  Provision of information to  local key persons in the country  of destination.  Annual assessment and  reporting. During 2012, the Mayakoba  companies will work particularly  on the first and second points,  focusing their efforts on training  and raising the awareness of their  personnel adequately, to ensure  that the actual application of the  Code of Conduct will be feasible  and effective.  Participation by the social partners Collective bargaining is a particular manifestation of management-labor  dialog and is considered to be a fundamental right basic to collective  industrial organization. This freedom is guaranteed worldwide by the  ILO Conventions 98 and 154. The OHL Group, independently of the business activity involved or of the  country where it operates and pursuant to the commitments acquired  -such as in the United Nations Global Compact-, maintains the strictest  respect for the freedom of association and for the effective recognition  of the right to collective bargaining.  The OHL Group maintains different modalities of agreements with  its workers, the most significant being the sector-wide collective  agreements, the company-wide or work center collective agreements  and the company agreements.

The support and direct  involvement of the Chairman  of the Group and of senior  management ensure that  each and every one of OHLs  employees receive the training  and awareness-raising courses  necessary for preventing  accidents.  During 2011, OHL continued to  work intensively in the framework  of its Occupational Risk Prevention  (ORP) policies and management  systems. The training of the  Groups team in a culture of  prevention is a strategic priority  and is today strongly rooted in  the company. This enables us  to continue to improve accident  rates year after year, in addition  to obtaining multiple recognitions  of the work performed from the  management standpoint. The Groups Joint Risk  Prevention Service (SPM)  continues to be the body  entrusted with the management  of ORP in Spain. During the 2011  financial year, the SPM provided  service to 24 different companies,  including 781 work centers, 7,182  workers of its own and more  than 4,000 workers belonging  to subcontractors, in addition to  servicing a total of 48 Temporary  Joint Ventures, in which OHL  holds an interest. The Joint Risk  Prevention Service, through its  members accredited by the labor  authorities, performs its tasks  through four specialized areas:  Workplace Safety, Industrial  Hygiene, Applied Ergonomics and  Occupational Health Monitoring  (the last mentioned outsourced to  a Prevention Company). An overview of all of the sectors  of activity of the OHL Group with  respect to the last three years  reveals a 3% downward trend  in the incidence rate, a trend  which has become stable over  time, reflecting the satisfactory  management of occupational risk  prevention in the company. Furthermore, the Joint Risk  Prevention Service is responsible  for drawing up the SGPRL or Risk  Prevention Plan. The Service  also develops a Strategic Risk  Prevention Plan for the entire  Group, which in 2011 completed  its eighth year of application.  The activities under the Plan in  2011 were focused on a review of  the permanent strategic lines of  action and on the consolidation  of ongoing improvement in  occupational risk prevention.  The SGPRL Handbook was  updated during the year, in line  with the specification OHSAS  18001/2007 with respect to its  nineteen mandatory requirements.  Moreover, the procedures relating  to procurement and subcontracts,  preventive non-conformities,  the SGPRL internal audit and  emergency plans and actions were  revised and approved.  A collective  protection system (SPB), designed  to meet the standard UNE-EN  13374, was also implemented  during the year, with an estimated  level of compliance of 80%, and  is expected to reach all of the  divisions in the course of 2012. In 2011 the number of hours of training in ORP increased 149% with  respect to 2010   OHL Group. Occupational Accident Incidence Rate.

A good example of the effort  of the Group in order to instill a  culture of prevention and maintain  a position of leadership in ORP is  the Golden Month of Prevention  initiative.  This campaign is  organized annually during the  month of October and was held  in 2011 for the eighth time. The  campaign concluded with a  day-long technical meeting, an  event that was held this year in  Barcelonas Gran Teatre del Liceu,  a landmark theater rebuilt by OHL  following the fire that destroyed it  in 1994. The names of the prize-winners  in the 2011 campaign were  announced at the closing session,  attended by the Corporate  General Manager of the Group  and presided over by the Director- General for Labor Inspection of  Catalonia, who congratulated the  OHL Group on this initiative. The Golden Month of  Prevention awards were presented  in November 2011 by the  Chairman, Juan-Miguel Villar Mir,  at Torre Espacio, the Groups  corporate headquarters in Madrid.  The awards, each endowed with  a 3,000-euro cash prize, are  given to the operating, works and  design managers who contributed  in the course of the financial year  to the continuing improvement of  ORP, meeting the targets set.  In 2011, OHL continued  working to implement ORP  management systems in the  various divisions of the Group,  both in Spain as well as abroad.  Accordingly, the Group has chosen  to obtain global certification  to OHSAS 18001 in all of the  countries where it operates, in  order to identify and assess the  risks in the workplace and to  adapt risk management to the  requirements of the legislation  applicable in each country. In this  context, the Group has defined the  policy, organizational structure,  responsibilities, functions,  planning of activities, processes,  procedures and resources  necessary for developing,  reviewing and maintaining these  management systems.  In its operations outside  of Spain, the Groups  implementation of ORP  management systems depends on  a number of factors, particularly  Participation of the SPM in forums on Occupational Risk  Prevention in 2011  4th ORP Congress, Castilla y Len Regional Government (Len, Spain)  Day-Long Technical Meeting at INSHT on ORP regulations (Madrid,  Spain)  Second European Colloquium on Coordination of Safety and Health  in  Construction (Madrid, Spain)  Day-Long  Technical Meeting at COICCP on Excellence in Safety and  Health (Madrid, Spain)  EOI Day-Long Technical Meeting, ORP Innovation (Madrid, Spain)  Business Forum on Safety and Health at INSHT (Madrid, Spain)  Day-Long Technical Meeting at OSALAN on Prevention Resources  (Bilbao, Spain)  Chair of the AENOR 115 Committee on Machinery for Public Works  (Madrid, Spain)  Members, ORP Committee of SEOPAN (Madrid, Spain)  ORP Day-Long Technical Meeting with ITC at the Liceo Theater  (Barcelona, Spain) the specific legal context and the  training of the local employees  assigned to the management of  ORP, or the  compatibility of the  Groups management system with  the in-house systems of major  multinational customers. Thus, OHL continues working  to extend the model for success  achieved in Spain to the rest of  the countries where it operated,  through the policies defined and  adapted to the reality of each  country. In this context, mention  should be made of the significant  progress obtained in OHL  Concesiones, OHL Industrial and  OHL Construccin. OHL Concesiones received a  new Risk Prevention Management  Handbook for implementation  in Brazil, together with a list of  general procedures that need  to be amended and adapted by  the designated ORP coordinator,  in conjunction with the risk  [4] / A shared culture  67 68 Sustainability Report 2011 prevention technicians assigned  to all of the concessions operated  by the OHL Group in that country.  Brazil was chosen as the  prototype for the introduction  of the Handbook because it is  the country with the highest  concentration of concession  operations and with the largest  ORP team, thereby making it  possible to extract the necessary  experience in the development of  the risk prevention system. OHL Industrial was also  provided the Risk Prevention  Management Handbook in 2011,  together with a list of general and  specific procedures, safety and  health protocols and instructions  relating to its business activities  and the Groups ORP Management  System formats and forms. This  policy materializes the decision  to introduce an ORP Management  System in all areas and in all of  the countries where OHL Industrial  operates.  In addition, OHL Construccin  has developed an Integrated  Safety, Quality and Environmental  Management System of its own,  which is currently operational  in Argentina and Mexico and  is being implemented in Chile  and Peru.  Another highlight was  the development of a Safety  Management System for OHL USA  during 2011. Furthermore, the obtaining of  ORP certifications in 2011 has  been a priority management  target, set by the OHL Groups  Safety and Health Committee, the  most senior management body in  terms of ORP in the company.   Since 2001, when the Joint Risk  Prevention Service (SPM) initiated  the process for the certification  of the five companies of the  Group at that time, a multitude  of companies have been added  to the  OHL Group and have  progressively joined  the SPM,  adopting its management systems  and practices. (ORP Certification  Audits 2011). During the 2011 financial  year, the Group has succeeded  in unifying the expiry dates of  the two certificates issued by the  relevant audit firms: the voluntary  certification, OHSAS 18001/2007,  and the mandatory certification  required on the national level,  thereby significantly facilitating  and enhancing management  efficiency. Finally, outstanding milestones  in 2011 in terms of the  management of ORP certifications  in the Groups international  operations include the renewal of  OHSAS 18001 certificates in Chile  and Peru, the certification of the  Madrid ORP Department for the  international area by AENOR and  the VPP certification, equivalent  Golden Month of Prevention Awards 2011 the award for preventive management was granted to Pablo Escoda  Villacorta, general manager of the concession company MLO, Metro  Ligero Oeste de Madrid, for optimizing the application of the Risk  Prevention Plan at the light rails operating centers, integrating ORP  into the companys production management. the culture of prevention award went to Jess Elizalde Salvoch, for  his 24-year track record with the OHL Group, in which his conduct  and attitude towards prevention stand out in the exercise of his  profession, leading the implementation of safe practices among his  fellow team members in the application of the ORP Management  System during those years. the award for preventive innovation was obtained by Jos  Ricardo Rodrguez Ruiz for his performance as site manager in the  improvement and implementation of safe working procedures during  the construction of the Canary Island freeway GC-2 on the Santa Mara  de Gua-Pagador section.

Looking towards 2012, the  Group proposes to continue  moving ahead in the same line of  action, with the fundamental goal  of working to reduce the number  of accidents, by eliminating or  minimizing existing risks, to  maintain the ongoing process  for the updating of the ORP  Management System (SGPRL),  to continue holding internal and  external audits and to continue  raising ORP awareness among the  employees of the Group.  With respect to accident  rates, the OHL Group has set  the following targets for 2012 in  Spain:  Accident rate in construction,  below the SEOPAN rates and 50%  lower than the construction sector  overall. The incidence rate will be  taken as the reference figure.  Accident rate of the industrial  division, below 50% of the activity  rate of the industrial sector. The  incidence rate will be taken as the  reference figure. 800,000 accident-free hours worked in Chile, with special mention by  Chiles Institute of Occupational Safety (OHL Construccin) 15 million hours worked in the SIDRA (Qatar) project with the result of 0  incapacitating accidents (OHL Construccin) key inDicators in occupational health monitorinG (fiGure for spain) total  no. initial regular prior Specific return to  work special examinations 4,285 751 3,451 22 40 17 2 var. 2011 / 2010 31% 72% 24% 10% 67% 183% 100% Source: Fremap Annual Report 2011, workers in companies under the Joint Prevention Service, OHL Group in Spain. Award to OHLs Medical Services for their work in ORP OHLs Medical Services were singled out in 2011 by the Castilian  Occupational Medicine and Safety Society (SCMST), in the companies  category, in recognition of their work in furthering the implementation  and dissemination of Occupational Risk Prevention. The Corporate HR manager received the  award at the closing ceremony of the 2011  Occupational Health and Occupational  Risk Prevention Congress, organized by the  SCMST, a society founded in 1956 that has  a current membership of more than 3,000  professionals in the field of occupational  medicine and occupational risk prevention.  For the services area,  experiencing constant growth,  the target set is to reduce the  incidence rate by 10% with  respect to the figure in 2011. More information:  CSR management bodies in the OHL Group   Corporate Policies  ORP website [4] / A shared culture Besides these general OHL  Group targets, additional specific  targets and programs may be  determined in view of the results  obtained from the monitoring  and measurement of the risk  prevention performance in the  various companies and work  centers.   69 70 Sustainability Report 2011 Training, career  development and  reconciliation of work and  private life OHL seeks the very best  professionals available for  carrying out its range of business  activities. To this end, it strives  to reinforce the possibilities of  training, career development and  the reconciliation of work and  private life of its employees, in  an awareness that these efforts  have a direct influence on the  companys capacity to attract and  retain the best talent.    The Groups training strategy  did not undergo significant  changes during 2011, beyond  the necessary adjustments in  order to adapt to the Groups new  divisional structure. Consequently,  the accurate detection of needs  in all of the countries where the  Group is present, the design  and planning of training actions  on the international level, the  diversification and specialization  of the training provided and the  promotion of e-learning continue  to stand out among OHLs  strategic goals. With respect to the  management of training, a  significant development during  the past year was the change in  location of the Training Service  on the Groups organizational  chart, as the Service is now within  the Corporate HR Management  area. This change signifies a  broadening of the scope of the  Service, which is now entrusted  with overseeing the uniformity of  the criteria referring to the training  and career development of all of  the employees of the Group. Also,  the management tools associated  with training have been increased  to enable them to perform  additional functions. During 2012 the target will be  to establish specific channels  of coordination with the Group  managers in the various countries,  in order to draw up and manage  an effective Training Plan that  will provide a response to the  range of different needs of OHLs  employees.  With respect to training  contents, a highlight in 2011  was the increase in the number  traininG in the ohl Group DurinG 2011 Number of participants in the 2011 Training Plan  120,868 Number of course hours taught in the 2011 Training Plan  574,921 Number of hours of training per participating employee 4.76 Total number of courses  9,280 Number of companies of origin of employees 158 Average degree of satisfaction (on a scale of 1 to 10) 8.55 Resources used in terms of cost of personnel attending courses () 6,733,864 Resources used in terms of cost of training staff involved, etc. () 6,288,189 Institutional financial aid received as support for training () 977,080 of specific training options  for the employees of OHL  Industrial, with particular  emphasis on the courses  geared to project management.  Similarly, the number of hours  devoted to language training  continued to increase. Another  important development was the  promotion of training in specific  methodologies, such as mind  mapping, and the use of computer  tools tied to the implementation  of this methodology, such as  Mindmanager or Mindconnect  among others.  The inclusion in the Training  Catalog of courses associated  with the CSR dimension, such as  the new courses on the Code of  Conduct and Human Rights, and  the complete revamping of the  Welcome and CSR courses are  also significant developments in  the past year. The subjects with the largest  number of participants were  Occupational Risk Prevention  (56,045), Environment (11,659),  Quality (7,780) and Skills (6,293).

A highlight in 2011 in  this context was the creation of  the new Manager Development  Service, under the Corporate HR  Management area. This Service,  which has commenced work in  2012, will be entrusted with the  identification of individuals with  high managerial potential within  the Group and will develop a  customized career plan for each  of them, in coordination with the  Training Service and other human  resource management areas. As  a result, the necessary resources  are now in place for coordinating  the processes of generational  replacement within the Group in  the best possible way, in addition  to meeting the new needs  connected with the business.  Moreover, this Service will able be  responsible for the management  and career development of the  current managers of the company. The Group has kept its  Hiring of Recent Graduates Plan  active. This initiative seeks to  capture qualified talent through  cooperation with professional  societies, business schools and  universities. In Spain, a total of  23 cooperation agreements with  organizations of this kind have  continued in effect, and 22 young  people have performed practice  work in the Group, acquiring a  unique on-the-job experience in  combination with the theoretical  training they had been receiving. [4] / A shared culture  71 72 Sustainability Report 2011 Finally, with respect to the  reconciliation of work and private  life, OHL has undertaken a number  of initiatives designed to facilitate  this balance for its employees so  necessary for ensuring a good  quality of life. Among the most  significant of these initiatives are  the possibility of establishing  flexible working hours and of  splitting vacation periods, the  possibility of applying for a  reduction in the workday in cases  where employees have family  responsibilities, childcare checks  for workers with children under  three years of age or the Employee  Support Program (PAE), which  provides assistance to employees  in handling routine administrative  matters, legal problems or  other practical issues within the  personal sphere. Another point to be mentioned,  also with respect to Spain, is the  continuation of the Family Plan  initiative which, in collaboration  with the Fundacin Adecco, is  intended to provide support  to family members of Group  employees with disabilities, to  facilitate their true integration  into the working and social  world real through five areas of  action: medical, family, social,  training and employment. Eight  cases received assistance in the  Community of Madrid, Andalusia  and the Community of Valencia  during 2011.

In 2011, the company took the  initiative of offering those workers in the Circuito Exterior Mexiquense  maintenance area, who had not completed their basic primary and  secondary education, the training necessary in order to do so. The  objective was to reinforce their employability, open the way to new  opportunities for them and raise the level of qualification of the team  responsible for the maintenance of the road. In this initiative, Opcom has collaborated with the National Institute  for Adult Education (INEA), a body dependent on the Federal  Government. Two teachers from the INEA taught classes attended by  16 Opcom employees during the month of October. As a result, all of  the participants passed the official examinations and obtained the  certificate issued by the Secretariat of Public Education showing that  they had successfully completed primary and secondary education  under the current studies plan. For 2012, plans are in place to continue  with the educational program, on this occasion for the personnel who  have not obtained a high school diploma. More information:  GRI Indicators  Chart of fringe benefits and  other initiatives for  employees  Personnel covered by life and accident insurance Common culture and  innovation At OHL we are proud of our  work in innovation. We strive  to have innovation become a  cohesive and differentiating  element of our corporate  culture and have established  the objective of strengthening  the involvement of all of our  employees in the dynamics that  derive from this way of working.   OHL works towards the goal  of situating the processes of  innovation and the efforts devoted  to these processes in the various  corporate and business areas as  differentiating elements of the  corporate culture of the Group.  Similarly, the company also strives  to make innovation become one  of the guiding forces that will  facilitate, as far as possible, the  integration of new companies  and groups of employees  into the Group, contributing  to streamlining the complex  processes of human, operational  and technical integration derived  from these situations. OHLs Research, Development  and Innovation Service stands out  in this context, as it provides the  necessary support to the various  divisions for the identification  of innovative ideas among their  employees, the preparation and  execution of R&D&I projects and  the obtaining of returns from the  outcomes of such projects.  In 2011, these challenges  translated into a number of  activities, notably the Second Forum  of Innovative Ideas. This initiative  was open to all of the employees  of the Group, who were able to  participate by contributing ideas for  the development of R&D&I projects.  The basic objective of the Forum  is to foster the creativity of our  employees and thereby increase  the productivity and efficiency of  construction works and processes  through research, development and  innovation.  On the occasion of this second  Forum, more than 30 ideas were  submitted and will compete for the  OHL Prize to the Best Innovative  Idea.  With a view to disseminating  the most relevant internal and  external activities in R&D&I  among the employees of the  Group involved to a greater or a  lesser degree in projects of this  kind, the distribution of the R&D&I  electronic newsletter, a regular  internal communication project  instituted in 2010, was continued  during 2011.  In addition, for the purpose  of storing, transferring and using  the individual and collective  knowledge of the Groups  employees effectively and  efficiently, making it available  whenever needed for problem- solving and the improvement  of processes, OHL has other  tools in place such as the  Experience Database or the  internal magazine, TECNO.  Designed also as a vehicle  for communicating the most  significant R&D&I-related projects  and initiatives undertaken by  the Group, providing information  and technical training to OHLs  workers, the Tecno magazine  continued to fulfill its purpose  throughout 2011. Tecno is  published quarterly and is  available on the intranet and on  the OHL website. Since 2012 also  available in English. Finally, the work carried out  by the R&D&I Service in order to  identify, secure and obtain returns  from the innovations developed  by OHL professionals in the course  of their work on construction sites,  in concessions and projects in of  the Group in all parts of the world.   In 2011, the Cubipod and the Sotograb enjoyed their  year of success on obtaining international recognition as  award winners at the Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva,  demonstrating their leading roles in the application of  innovations developed by OHL. [4] / A shared culture  73 74 Sustainability Report 2011 Corporate volunteering Over the last few years, the  Group has been consolidating  spaces of cooperation and dialog  between its employees and the  communities in which they work.  Corporate volunteering signifies  an open door at OHL and has  been gaining increasingly greater  weight in the framework of the  Groups management policies  with respect to human resources  and community involvement.  Volunteering now ranks as a  crucial element of OHLs corporate  culture.   Through their volunteering  activities, the employees of the  Group can place their professional  and personal capacities, that is,  their talent, at the service of the  community. From the perspective  of internal organization, corporate  volunteering is managed by  the Corporate HR Management,  through the Community  Involvement area. However, in  Brazil, the CSR Committee is  the body responsible for the  OHL Brasil volunteers, given the  specific weight of the work carried  out by OHL Concesiones within  the scope of volunteering and, in  general, in the field of Community  Involvement.  At the present time, OHL has  volunteer groups in Spain (Madrid  and Barcelona), Brazil, Mexico,  Argentina, Chile and the United  States. In 2011, a total of nine  volunteering projects were carried  out in Spain by employees of the  OHL Group, two more than in  2010, with the participation of  around 500 employees. Outstanding new  developments included the  creation of a working group for  the design and implementation  of the upgrades necessary  on the volunteers website.  With respect to the website,  looking towards 2012, work is  being undertaken to achieve  the AA level of accessibility.  Moreover, during the year, the  participation of volunteers was  encouraged through this channel  by means of contributions of  personal testimonies following  the conclusion of a number of  volunteering activities.  During the year a working  group of volunteers was also set  up in Spain for promoting the  creation of groups of volunteers  in other countries where OHL  has a stable presence. Likewise,  support was given to the APTIVO  project, which consists of a  specific methodology, developed  by FUNDAR in conjunction with  the Universidad CEU-SAN PABLO  and recognized by the SERVEF, to  enable persons with experience  as volunteers, particularly young  people seeking employment,  to obtain recognition of their  achievements through a specific  process of validation of the  personal skills acquired in the  course of their voluntary actions. Finally, mention should be  made of the satisfaction surveys  carried out for each of the  volunteering activities organized,  gathering many suggestions and  proposals. The level of satisfaction  was very high, with the last  survey made showing a level of  satisfaction of 9.25 out of a total  of 10 points. In 2012, the volunteer groups  in Spain and the Community  Involvement area have fresh  targets in view. The intention  of carrying out ten volunteering  projects, with an increase in the  participation of employees from  OHL Industrial, stands out among  the major targets set. In addition,  work is underway to launch the  Volunteers website translated  into English and Portuguese,  to encourage communications  among the many volunteers of the  Group in all of the countries where  programs are organized. An effort  will be also made in this direction  to support the creation of  volunteer groups in Mexico, Chile  and the United States, as well as  to support the consolidation of  the volunteer group in Brazil and  Argentina, operating since 2011. This volunteer group – the one  formed in Brazil- was provided  training during the past year in the  framework of the Three-Year CSR  Program 2011-2013 developed  by OHL Concesiones in that  country. The OHL CSR Committee  in Brazil made an analysis of  the initiatives that were being  undertaken in the companys  subsidiaries on an independent  basis. After identifying these  Volunteers of OHL USA. OHL, Premio Ciudadano 2011 for its corporate volunteering OHL received the Premio Ciudadano (Citizens Prize) in 2011 from  the Asociacin Premios Ciudadanos and the Foro Debate Ciudadano  for its commitment to improving the quality of life in society. This  award is especially relevant, as it coincides with the European Year of  Volunteering. OHLs Corporate General Manager received the award, presented by the  Director of the European Commissions representation in Spain. The  Prize was handed over during the eleventh Premios Ciudadanos Awards  Ceremony, in the presence of representatives of OHLs Volunteers Group  and of the President of the Asociacin Premios Ciudadanos. Luis Garca-Linares, Corporate General Manager of OHL, expressed his  gratitude for the prize, stating that, for the Group, the award represents  a stimulus to continue working with strength and enthusiasm, imbued  by the values that inspired the introduction of the volunteering program:  the creation of a space open to dialog and cooperation between the  company, the employees and society. initiatives, the Committee decided  to integrate, regulate and continue  to further them, in such a way  that a corporate volunteering  project could be consolidated.  Accordingly, during 2011, the  projects to be undertaken were  selected and are scheduled to  commence in 2012, for which  purpose, the volunteer group will  have a specific annual budget  managed by the Corporate  Volunteering Committee,  integrated into OHL Brasils CSR  Committee.  The volunteering initiatives  will include visits to hospitals,  childcare and senior citizens  centers, blood donation  campaigns, donations for welfare  programs and once-off solidarity  campaigns in emergency  situations. For the first year of  operation, the program has set for  itself the challenge of performing  at least one voluntary action each  month. Finally, another new  development in the year was  the creation of a corporate  volunteering program in Argentina.  Similarly, in the OHL Concesiones  companies operating in this  country, the program makes an  appeal to the concession company  employees willing to contribute  their knowledge and experience  to the organization, in order to  cooperate with the community  along four basic lines of action:  education and childhood, health  and work climate, environment  and donations.

For this reason, year after year,  we continue to work to reinforce  the channels and tools of  communication and dialog with  the employees of the entire Group.   OHL has multiple channels  of internal communication in  each company and country  where it works. The project for  the broadening of the scope of  application of the channel for  reporting situations associated  with the Groups new Harassment  Protocol deserves mention as a  new development in 2011. Furthermore, the survey of  employees made at the end of  2010 is particularly significant  as an invaluable aid in the  management of CSR and HR.   The survey is scheduled to be  repeated in 2012 and on this  occasion will include issues  relating to the measurement of the  work climate. A total of 1,642 employees,  originating from the entire  scope of action of the Group,  participated in the survey.  This is  the highest rate of participation  in an inquiry of this kind, since  OHL initiated the project for  conducting an annual survey of its  stakeholders. In percentage terms, the  participation represents 8% of the  Groups personnel, although it is  important to note that the survey  was made on-line, whereby the  real percentage of participation  should be calculated with respect  to the number of employees who  have a terminal at their work  station.  This group is estimated to  be on the order of 30% of the total  establishment, in which case, the  actual participation rate would be  26%, a figure we consider to be  highly satisfactory. In terms of the  distribution of the participation  by country, Brazil stands out  with 15%, followed by the Czech  Republic with 12% and Spain with  4%. (Percentages calculated on  the total number of employees). management of human resources  and CSR.  In order to address  these issues in the best possible  manner, a working group was set  up and is described in greater  detail in the Equal opportunities  section of this same chapter. In addition, participating  employees had the opportunity  to evaluate the channels of  communication with the Group.  This evaluation was positive in  general. Accordingly, participants  assessed all of the channels of  dialog provided by the Group with  an Average/High significance,  indicating, as the most frequently  used, the corporate intranet  (OHLFINET), the regular internal  publications, the training  satisfaction questionnaires, the  welcome courses, the Sustainable  Development Report and the  regular communications with  the Employees Committee. In  contrast, other channels, such as  the e-mailboxes, were found to  be channels scarcely used by the  employees.

The  Group is aware of this situation  and at the present time is  working to improve access by the  employees of other countries to  the channels already established,  as well as in the definition of  new channels. For 2012, the  Corporate HR Management  has set the target of examining  the possibility of adding new  internal communication channels  based on the use of the new  technologies, as a number of  employees suggested in the  survey, referring particularly to  the social networks and on-line  communications systems and  instant messaging. OHLs employees value  the contribution of  the regular in-house  publications highly as a  channel of dialog in the  company, for example,  Mosaico, which is now  also published in English. 1           JANUARY 2012 Contracts in  Gdansk and  New York for 403  million OHL Construccin has added two new  international contracts to its portfolio, one  in Gdansk (Poland) and another in New York  (USA).

It was in the 2011 financial year,  also in consonance with the new  legal provisions and the revision  of the 2007 OHSAS specification,  when it became possible to  unite the expiry dates of the two  certificates issued by the audit  firms, that is, the voluntary OHSAS  18001/2007 certificate and the  national legally required certification,  thereby facilitating and enormously  increasing the productivity and  management efficiency associated  with a single date. Accordingly, from now on, the  OHSAS voluntary audits, performed  by the firm SGS for all of the  companies in the Group, will take  place every 3 years, and the legal  audits, made by Crossber Audit,  every 2 or 4 years, pursuant to the  provisions contained in the current  regulation established by Royal  Decree 604/2006, which amended  Royal Decree 39/1997 on the Risk  Prevention Services Regulation.  177 178 179 Sustainability Report 2011 Fringe benefits and other initiatives for  employees 2011 SPAIN (For the entire workforce: permanent employment contracts as from the category of foreman)  Life and accident insurance  Updating and access in real time to personal and employment-related data.

Bosque de las Capacidades The OHL Volunteer Group in Barcelona, together with the Adecco and Ms rboles foundations, congregated close  to 80 people in the month of November to participate in the creation of the Bosque de las Capacidades (Forest of  Abilities), a project that promotes the elimination of social barriers with respect to disabilities, at the same time as it  works to reduce concentrations of CO2. The OHL-Fundacin Adecco Forest has been created in a natural area in Prat de Llobregat.   A total of 30 people  with disabilities participated in its creation by planting trees and exchanging knowledge and experiences with  the other participants, including a group of 45 people -between OHL volunteers and their families, in addition to  representatives of Adecco and Ms rboles. Both OHL as well as Fundacin Adecco have acquired the commitment of planting 300 trees in this forest, which will  be used by people with disabilities for receiving pre-workforce training, for participating in gardening workshops and  in other tasks connected with environmental protection. Participants in the creation of the  Bosque de las Capacidades   (Forest of Abilities).  77 77 Sustainability Report 2011 Forward-looking  infrastructures  [5]  78 79 Sustainability Report 2011 [5] Forward-looking     infrastructures  Although 2011 has been  a complicated year on the  macroeconomic level, OHL  succeeded in growing 23% in  terms of EBITDA and 14% in Net  Profit. Sales totaled 4,869.8  million euros, representing an  increase of 2.1% with respect to  2010, and we obtained four billion   in new construction backlog  through major international  contracts, significantly increasing  our international presence. In order to obtain these results,  OHL has had to work in close  contact with its customers, with a  difficult challenge as its starting  point: the size and diversification  of the OHL Group, signifying that  its markets and customers have  highly different profiles and,  therefore, each division requires  its own specific and adequate  management focus.  In the pursuit of this objective,  the efforts of OHL in the area of  quality and innovation play a  fundamental role. Both lines of  work contribute definitively to  attaining high levels of ongoing  improvement and excellence.  2011 has marked several  significant milestones in this  context.  The company has maintained  a strong investment effort in R&D,  which has translated into 7.61  million euros invested in research  projects, the majority of which  were co-financed with public aid  and with close to 4 million euros  in on-site innovation activities.  According to the EU Industrial  R&D Investment Scoreboard,  which reports on the top thousand  European and the top thousand  non-European companies with  the highest level of investment  in R&D, OHL would hold third  place among Spains construction  companies and rank tenth among  sector companies in Europe.  In 2011, OHL Industrial joined  the companies of the Group with  an R&D&I Management System  certified to the UNE 166,002  standard. OHL, OHL Concesiones,  Asfaltos y Construcciones ELSAN,  Sociedad Annima Trabajos y  Obras (SATO) and OHL Medio  Ambiente Inima had already  obtained this certification. At  the same time, the scope of the  certificates has been expanded  in order to accredit the Groups  research capacity in a larger  number of areas of knowledge. The services we offer cater to the needs of our customers and are the key to our growth and access to new  markets. The way we conceive and develop them should set us apart, to enable us to continue along this line  of progress. This is why we take up the challenge of sustainability in this scope as well, from the perspective of  ongoing improvement, innovation and excellence in management.  Quality management  Furthermore, the OHL Group  encourages its companies to  implement systems that enable  the efficient management of the  quality and environmental aspects  of the services it provides in all of  the countries where it operates.  Evidence of this is the large  number of companies and centers  belonging to the Group that  have certified their management  systems according to international  standards (ISO 9001, ISO 14001,  EMAS, etc.) where such factors  are considered an added value  to the benefit of customers, as is  the case in Spain, Brazil, Chile or  Central Europe.

The divisions main customer is the public sector (the  government administrations granting the concessions), however,  the users of toll roads, commercial ports, airports and railways are  eminently private. Toll roads are the divisions primary business line,  in which it operates a total of 4,417 km with an average traffic flow of  2,648,204 vehicle equivalents. OHL Construction integrates the two former domestic and  international construction divisions. This division has a permanent  presence in areas such as Eastern Europe, the United States and  Canada and is present through the performance of landmark projects  in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Kuwait or Qatar, which  constitute an important channel of growth looking towards the years  to come. In 2011, the division was active in 28 countries, 49% of its customers  were in the public sector and 51% were private entities.  OHL Industrial is focused on the engineering and construction of  process plants in the oil & gas and petrochemical, energy, solids  handling and fire protection sectors. One hundred percent of the  divisions customers are private, both in Spain as well as abroad, and  at the present time, it is involved in operations with 290 customers in  11 countries, with 14.9% of sales originating abroad. OHL Developments is specialized in the development of mixed-use  real estate projects operated by super luxury hotel chains on an  international level. The Mayakob Resort on the Riviera Maya, Mexico,  concentrates the major part of the divisions activity. It is estimated that  around 75,000 people have been guests of these hotels during 2011.  In those countries where  other quality and environmental  standards are valued or required,  OHL uses systems appropriate  to each specific case. This  occurs in the operations carried  out, for example, in the United  States, where OHL participates  in obtaining  LEED certificates,  in the Brazilian concession  companies, which have adopted  ISO 9004 -not certifiable-, or  in  the Mayakoba Resort, which  has attained the top rating in  verification by the Rainforest  Alliance, applying the Global  Sustainable Tourism Criteria  (GSCT). In other markets, such  as Canada, Qatar, Turkey, among  others, the Group promotes  the implementation of quality  and environment plans with the  same minimum requirements,  even though the plans are not  certified. In addition, the specific  requirements contractually  stipulated by customers -both  management as well as technical  requirements- are incorporated  into the relevant projects.   80 81 Sustainability Report 2011 [5] / Forward-looking infrastructures  Targets set for the quality management  systems in 2012 OHL Concessions   Obtain certification of management systems in at least two more  companies.  OHL Construction    Obtain quality certification in companies in Mexico and Argentina.  Obtain quality certification at the Centro de Justicia in Santiago de  Chile for the cleaning and maintenance services of the facilities.   Implement management systems in Peru and Australia.   Maintain 100% of the sales with ISO 9001 certificates in the Spain  area.  Continue moving forward with the documentation for the  management of Project Management systems and the start-up of  training courses for site technicians. OHL Industrial   Definition and implementation of the quality management systems  for the new business activity of Operation & Maintenance of  industrial plants. A horizon of two years is planned for certification.  Implementation and certification of quality management systems  in the subsidiaries located in Mexico and the United States within a  period of two years. OHL Developments  Seek the tourism environmental quality certification granted by  PROFEPA.  Continue with the Rainforest-Marti initiative. With respect to the Groups  activity in terms of environmental  management, more information  can be found in the chapter of this  Report, Moving forward, keeping  the environment in mind. In the  context of quality, an aspect that  will be dealt with in this chapter,  the OHL Group has a well-defined  policy for the management of  its operations according to the  most highly recognized standards  in this regard, including ISO  9001. The OHL Group holds 38  certificates under this standard for  its divisions, in different countries  and with scopes that cover most  of the business activities in  which it engages. The certified  management system ensuring  the operating efficiency and  environmental management of  office buildings and centralized  services such as the vehicle fleet,  travel or telephony, obtained by the  General Services and Regulations  Department of the Group, sets  OHL apart in the infrastructure and  construction sector.  During the 2011 financial year  at the OHL Concessions division,  the concession companies  operating the Southeast Marine  Terminal (TMS) (Spain) and the  Toluca Airport (AMAIT) (Mexico)  obtained certification to ISO  9001. In the division of OHL  Construccin, one subsidiary  in the United States, three  subsidiaries in the Slovak  Republic and one in Bulgaria  had their quality management  systems certified.  In addition, OHL Medio  Ambiente Inima added the  operation and maintenance of  desalination stations in Spain  to its scope of certification. And,  finally, Novaires eleven residential  facilities for the elderly also  achieved ISO 9001 certification. In order to obtain certificates  and maintain management system  certifications already granted,  in 2011 OHL was successful in  passing more than 170 external  audit days and certification  processes and performed more  than 444 internal audits. Once again in 2011, OHL  successfully passed the Madrid  Excelente audits and, at the  present time, all of the Divisions of  the Group hold that accreditation.  Madrid Excelente is the guarantee  mark of the Government of the  Community of Madrid (Spain) for  recognizing and certifying quality  and excellence in management  of companies, with a view to  furthering the competitiveness of  local businesses. Similarly, an integrated  management system – based  on the  quality (ISO 9001),  environmental (ISO 14001) and  risk prevention (OHSHAS 18.001)  management systems – has been  implemented in 2011 for the OHL  Construction division in Mexico,  Peru, Argentina, Australia and the  Centro de Justicia court complex in  Santiago de Chile. The construction  subsidiary in Chile, which already  had these management systems  in place and certified, has initiated  the process for migrating to the  integrated management system. The development of in-house  documentation was also initiated  in this division for application  in Project Management and in  the training of the technicians  responsible for this area. OHL Group Quality Certifications in 2011 Standard/ model No. certificates ISO 9001 38 Madrid Excelente 1 TOTAL 39 Awards to innovation The Fundacin Garca-Cabrerizo has granted the Garca-Cabrerizo  Award for the best Spanish invention to SATO for the Cubipod:  an element for the formation of the armor layers of breakwaters.  This invention was presented at the International Exhibition of  Inventions of Geneva (Switzerland) held from the 6th to the 10th  of April 2011, where the Cubipod received a gold medal with  honorable mention and the SATOGrab was awarded a silver medal.  This exhibition is considered to be the largest and most important  of its kind in the world. Patented by the Universidad Politcnica de Valencia and licensed  by SATO, the Cubipod is a new element for the construction of  breakwaters and harbor defense structures. It is designed to  maintain the advantages of the conventional cube, such as its  strength and ease of placement, but corrects its disadvantages,  preventing the tendency of conventional cubes to rearrange  themselves face to face. In addition, the Cubipod is easy to  produce, store and install and represents a cost savings in  materials. Also in 2011, the Port Authority of Malaga received the National  Innovation Award, granted by the Ministry of Science and  Innovation, in the category of Innovative Public Procurement, for  the first actual application of the Cubipod in the project for the  Rehabilitation and Upgrading of the Outer Dock and Breakwater of  the San Andrs Harbor in the Port of Malaga, which constituted an  innovative public procurement experience in Spains port system, a  model to be followed thanks to its unique characteristics, opening  up the possibility in Spain of variations in the morphology of the  elements forming the principal armor layer of breakwaters. OHL holds 38 certificates ISO 9001 for its divisions, in different countries  and with scopes that cover most of the business activities in wich it  engages During 2011, the process  for the quality certification of  Group companies continued  to progress, as was the case  with the Toluca International  Airport, in Mexico.  82 83 Sustainability Report 2011 The Quality and Environment  Service is responsible for the  quality management systems at  OHL, following the guidelines set  by the Quality and Environment  Committee, the Groups most  senior executive body in this area.  OHL promotes the activity under certified Quality Management Systems The operations of the OHL Group performed under a certified Quality Management System account for 55% of  the total activity, representing an increase of eight points with respect to the previous year.  It should be noted that these figures increase up to 100% in the case of OHL Construction Spain area and OHL  Industrial. In other business lines these percentages are lower, due fundamentally to the fact that in a number  of countries or for certain activities, other kinds of management systems are generally used and are also  implemented by OHL.  Likewise, it is important to highlight the fact that at all OHL work centers and construction sites, compliance  with the regulations and standards in force in the country of location is strictly controlled. Moreover, the work  centers monitor the relevant indicators, reporting information to the parent company yearly in relation to  quality (complaints, results of surveys, etc.) and environment (inputs, emissions, penalties, actions taken,  etc.), necessary for decision-making and the definition targets for improvement TurNOver CerTIfIeD TO ISO 9001 (% / TOTAL) OHL   Concessions OHL   Construction OHL   Industrial OHL   Developments (*) OHL   environment Total   OHL Group 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 37% 32% 61% ND 100% 100% na na 51% 44% 55% 47% (*) The business activity of OHL Developments has a management system specific to Sustainable Tourism in place and certified More information:  Quality and Environmental Policy  Quality and Environment Committee   List of certified companies in the OHL Group  GRI Indicators Quality is the essence of Judlaus work  A practical example Judlau Contracting is an OHL Group company, headquartered in  New York, concerned with the construction of infrastructures and  specialized in underground public works, water supply and sewerage  systems, construction of roads and structures, among other areas. At Judlau Contracting the quality system is fully integrated into the  organization and its processes. Accordingly, at the start of each  project, a preliminary examination of the contract drawings is made  by the Site Manager and the Quality Manager, to confirm that the  drawings conform to the actual conditions of the terrain. This review is  submitted to the customer for approval. The operations that will govern the performance of the project are  defined in the construction phase plan, developed by the Site  Manager, the Quality Manager and specialized personnel. The  Quality Manager calls a preliminary meeting of all of the personnel  involved, to present and discuss the activities, problems and risks.  The suppliers contribution takes place within the environment of  the factory operations, including internal quality control plans and  objective inspections by an external entity, prior to the delivery of  materials to the site. On commencement of the work for the erection of the metal  structures, the Quality Manager verifies that the drawings approved  are those used on the construction site and that the materials are  inspected, approved and accepted, in addition to analyzing on- site, confirming and documenting the proper implementation of  the principles defined in the construction phase plan. The Quality  Manager and the Site Manager analyze possible difficulties and  work together with the Technical Office to solve them. The inspection  and testing process is carried out according to the requirements of  the project terms and conditions, and the results are logged and  analyzed. The outcome of this management process is a situation  where no adjustments or changes are necessary, there are zero  repairs and the project is completed on schedule.  In the coming years we propose  to continue to imbue all of the  units of the organization with our  commitment to our customers and  to sustainability, to which end we  are working in three specific areas  that are developed below. Lines of work of the OHL  Group in relation to its  customers  Establish  value-based business relationships  Innovate for generating value   Dialog with customers New York, Judlaus territory  of action. [5] / Forward-looking infrastructures   84 85 Sustainability Report 2011 Establish value-based  business relationships  At OHL we are committed  to offering our customers the  very best products and services  and to cooperating with them  from a position of respect,  professionalism, ethics and  sustainability.  The OHL Group seeks to attain  the highest levels of quality in  its products and services. For  this purpose, the Group makes  available to its employees its best  and most advanced technical  knowledge, the best technologies  and material resources possible  and encourages the involvement  of employees in the dynamics of  innovation.  In this context, we strive to  maintain a proactive attitude  towards our customers, in order to  elicit possible environmental and  safety enhancement proposals,  performing our business  activities at all times with proper  objectivity and professionalism  and with strict observance of the  contractual requirements and  the relevant legislation in each  country. Furthermore, and as mentioned  earlier in previous chapters, OHL  revised its Code of Conduct during  2011. Among other aspects, the  purpose of this revision was to  broaden the scope of the Code  to include, as far as possible,  OHL investee companies and the  companies or professionals who  maintain a business relationship  with the Group.  Outstanding among the R&D&I  activities of OHL in 2011 were the  trials involving shoulders without  barriers and with embankments for  increasing road safety, carried out in  the framework of the OASIS project. More information:  OHL Group Code of Conduct Innovate to generate value  Our investment effort in terms  of R&D&I has as its final goal the  generation of value for the users  of our products and services.  When at OHL we add innovation  and sustainability together, we  have a very clear target in mind:  to strengthen the development  of innovative solutions focused  on efficiency, the improvement  of processes and the obtaining of  new products and services that  will contribute to generating value  for our customers.  In 2011 the OHL Group  invested more than seven million  euros in R&D&I, focusing this  investment on the priority lines  identified by the Innovation  and Sustainability Department  in conjunction with the various  divisions of the Group.  These  lines are set out in the R&D&I  Master Plan 2010-2015. In terms of innovation, OHL  applies many innovative solutions  in the course of its projects  and estimates the value of the  investment made in this context at  four million euros. The reduction in the investment  made in R&D during 2011 with  respect to 2010 –less than 3%– is  due mainly to the change in the  general economic situation in  recent years, which has created  a much less promising scenario.  INverSIN eN I+D 2011* 2010 2009 Investment in R&D  (millions of ) 7.61 7.83 7.65 % international  investment 13% 9% 14% (*) OHL Industrial investments 2010 are included. However, in terms of investment  effort, calculated as the ratio  between this investment and the  total Gross Value Added (GVA)1    generated by the company, OHL  is placed, again in 2011, above  the average for the Spanish  construction sector. Moreover,  the human effort represented by  R&D&I at OHL translates into the  involvement of more than 130  employees overall in the various  projects. For this reason, and with a  view to increasing its wager on  R&D&I activities,  OHL works in  two areas: the internationalization  of the investment effort  and a  more extensive application of the  outcomes. Over the last few years, the  OHL Group has made a significant  effort in the internationalization  of its innovation activities.  Accordingly, 40% of the 45 major  R&D&I projects on which it has  been working during 2011 have  been undertaken outside of Spain  and account for 13% of the total  investment. In this effort, the OHL  Group cooperated in 2011 with  41 research bodies in more than  ten countries. During 2011, the  three most outstanding projects  with OHL Group participation on  an international scale are FOTSIS,  NETTUN and Roada. In orden to increase its commitment on R&D&I activities, OHL works in  two areas: the internationalization of the investment effort and a more  extensive application of the outcomes The Groups Code of Conduct  regulates the principles and  standards of conduct that are  to guide the behavior of all of  the individuals belonging to the  Group in their relations with the  markets.  1  The GVA represents the economic value generated by a production unit and is obtained as the balance of the production account, that is,  by means of the difference between the production of goods and services and the intermediate consumption LINeS Of reSeArCH 55% Linear infrastructures Sustainable building 7% 13% Marine works Materials 9% 9% Water resources and  environment Information and  Communications Technologies  applied to OHL processes 8% % of investment by line of research [5] / Forward-looking infrastructures   86 87 Sustainability Report 2011 In the international sphere, the Group is also present on the governance bodies of the most important sector- wide initiatives in support of R&D:    NeTTuN – New Technologies for Tunneling and  underground Works fOTSIS – european field Operational Test on Safe,  Intelligent and Sustainable Highways Operation OHL Construction participates as a partner in the  NETTUN Project. This project is focused on the  development of new technologies in the field  of the construction of tunnels and underground  works.  The main goals of the project are to:  Develop a ground prediction system integrated  into the tunnel boring machine  Automate the process of inspection and change  of drag bits and disc cutters.  Design cutter tools with increased lifetime.  Develop a prediction system for controlling the  impact of tunneling on surface structures.  Improve the current risk and cost measurement  systems.  Develop a decision support system for the  maintenance of the tunnel boring machine.  This project, co-funded by the EU through the  Seventh R&D Framework Program, has a total  budget of 14 million  and a duration of four and a  half years. The NETTUN Consortium is made up by 21  partners, both from the academic as well as  from the business world, belonging to 9 different  countries. OHL is the sole Spanish participant. This project is co-led by OHL Concesiones and is  the continuation of the OASIS project (Operation  of Safe, Intelligent and Sustainable Highways), the  objective of which was the definition of a highway  with higher levels of safety, service to road users  and sustainability in its operation.  This project is intended to verify the operation  under near-real conditions of the technologies  researched in OASIS, thereby identifying the  validity of the real applications of the various  technologies in the fields of safety, mobility and  toll collection.  The project commenced in the first quarter  of 2011 and is supported by the EU Seventh  R&D Framework Program. Together with OHL  Concesiones, 23 partners from 8 European  countries participate in the Consortium. rOADA OHL Brasil and OHL Concesiones initiated the  Roada research project in 2010. The purpose  of the project is to develop an integrated  environmental management system for the  vegetation in the spaces adjacent to their roads  and for the reduction of upkeep and maintenance  costs. During 2011, in conjunction with the University  of So Paulo, the projects general information  platform was launched, and progress was made in  the analysis of the use of plant-growth inhibitors. 	  European Construction Technology Platform – A European technological platform  dedicated to the analysis of the principal challenges facing the construction sector in  terms of society, sustainability and technological development. 	  European Efficient Buildings (E2B) – This European public-private initiative is focused on  the development of R&D projects for the improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings  and neighborhoods. 	  European Network of Construction Companies for Research and Development – Principal  industry-led forum on a European scale devoted to research, development and innovation  in the construction sector. In addition, the Groups  commitment to innovation is also  evidenced by its chairmanship  of EurekaBuild2, a sector- level umbrella of the Eureka  intergovernmental network and  one of the most relevant forums  in the field of R&D&I in the  European construction sector.  The main development in relation  to this initiative in 2011 was the  organization of an international  event by OHL in Barcelona during  the month of March, with the  Innovations Group implemented in 2011 The Cubipod, a construction element for the formation of the armor  layers of breakwaters invented by the Universidad Politcnica de Valencia  and SATO (an OHL Group subsidiary), was used for the first time at a  Spanish port in 2011.  It has an international patent and provides very  significant advantages over the cubic block: it is easy to produce, handle  and store; it presents outstanding strength and structural resistance;  prevents the tendency of conventional cubes to rearrange themselves  face to face and has greater hydraulic stability, lesser overspill and greater  structural resistance, in addition to generating significant savings in  material, thereby achieving cost savings and ecological footprint reduction. The application of outcomes of the GECMOLSIG project commenced on  OHL worksites in Spain and in a number of other countries during 2011.   This new methodology for the management, control and measurement  of linear works developed by OHLs surveying services will achieve  significant cost savings in the performance of surveying operations,  together with enhanced effectiveness and flexibility. The commercial implementation of multilane free-flow toll gantries on  toll roads operated under concession by OHL Concesiones in Mexico has  continued during 2011.  The first installation and start-up of the new Standard Toll Collection  System (SEP) took place in Peru in early 2011. This system is an in-house  technology developed by OHL Concesiones in record time. The SEP  answers all of the needs observed in the different tolling systems used by  the Group and standardizes the processes and tools, besides adding new  functionalities.  participation of more than 80  entities, among companies,  SMEs, technological centers and  universities from ten European  countries.

Our goal is to progress in the  effectiveness of the spaces for  contact and dialog that we share  with them. Due to the diversity of activities  and scenarios in which the OHL  Group is present, our dialog  with customers is managed  independently in each division.  The data collected through the  channels of communication with  this group of stakeholders is  managed by following procedures  designed to extract all items  of information that will enable  us to improve the provision of  our services and at the same  time progress in meeting their  expectations. In this context, the  Group works on the management  of two differentiated aspects:  the measurement of customer  satisfaction –through surveys  and other studies and analyses-  and our customer care systems  –through which complaints,  suggestions, and the like  are gathered and are given a  response–. In relation to the first aspect,  customer satisfaction, the  concession companies of OHL  Concessions have a quality  management system in place.  The results of the customer  satisfaction studies during the  2011 financial year undertaken by  the concessionaires are shown on  the table to the right. In the case of OHL Construction,  the company makes surveys of its  customers to assess the degree of  their satisfaction with the services  provided, by analyzing the final  quality of the completed project,  compliance with the contract  obligations, the qualification and  communication of the technicians,  the attention received since the  tender submission phase, among  others. Moreover, claims in  relation to projects in the after- sales stage are logged.    In Spain, the survey is made  of the customers whose projects  are more than 50% completed  or have been finalized in the last  twelve months. For this purpose,  an on-line platform is used that  facilitates the confidentiality  and statistical processing of the  information. In the evaluation  referring to 2010-2011, the rate of  customer satisfaction was 80%,  increasing 2% the percentage of  Very satisfied customers with  respect to the previous evaluation.  Likewise, 77% of the customers  indicated that they would contract  OHL again and 79% would  recommend the company.  OHL S, A.S. and PSV,  Group subsidiaries in the  Czech Republic, also carry out  surveys, and the effectiveness  of the actions undertaken for  improving customer satisfaction  are evaluated, in specific cases,  directly with the customer. The  overall assessments are above  90 out of a maximum score of  100. In Chile, the last customer  satisfaction rate was obtained in  July 2009 with an overall score of  70, also out of a possible 100.  In the area of the United States,  OHL Construccin evaluates  customer satisfaction throughout  the performance of its projects  and on completion of the work,  as reflected on the certificate of  conformity issued by customers.  At OHL Industrial the relevant  managers of the customers  organization are interviewed  personally by the OHL project  managers, for the purpose of  evaluating satisfaction with the  range of aspects established in  the quality management system.  In the most recent assessments  made, in effect in 2011, the  degree of customer satisfaction  was over 80 percent in all of  the OHL Industrial companies.  Likewise, 100% of the customers  felt satisfied (75% in the case of  Chepro, one of the companies  belonging to OHL Industrial)  and all of the customers would  contract again and recommend  the service provided by OHL  Industrial.  Customer satisfaction surveys  are also carried out at OHL  Develompents Mayakoba Resort.  Accordingly, the El Camalen Golf  Course sends its customers a  satisfaction questionnaire asking  about their stay and the golf  services. Operadora Hotelera del  Corredor Mayakoba, the company  operating the Fairmont Hotel,  sends monthly questionnaires to  its guests (mainly those belonging  to the Fairmont Presidents Club),  the results of which are analyzed  and a final evaluation is obtained.  If the satisfaction score is less  than 70 (out of a maximum of  100), the customer care service  contacts the guest who made the  assessment directly. The result  of the overall satisfaction rate in  2011 was 90 out of 100. Satisfied  customers accounted for 93%,  while 44% would use the service  again and 74% would recommend  it. Islas de Mayakoba, the  company operating the Rosewood  Hotel, sends a satisfaction  questionnaire automatically  through the Market Metrix  measurement tool. In 2011, a  100% positive rate of satisfaction  was obtained and, in addition,  100% would return to the hotel  and would recommend it. At the  Banyan Tree Hotel, operated by  the company Mayakoba Thai,  customer satisfaction is evaluated  by means of questionnaires on  paper or electronically, using  the CMR system, into which the  guests replies are entered and  calculated. The report is monthly  and enables monitoring of the  GSI or Guest Satisfaction Index.  In 2011 the result obtained was  a 91% positive satisfaction rate,  while 95% of the guests would  return and would recommend the  hotel. With respect to OHL  Environment, 77% of its  customers reported that they  were satisfied, 85% would use  the service again and 87% would  recommend it. The overall rate of  satisfaction was 78 out of 100.

In 2011 the  company made an on-line survey  of prescribers, obtaining an  average score of 7 out of 10, rated  as very good. The survey of  families and residents was made  in 2010.  Finally, and also in Spain,  Ingesan structures its surveys  under two categories: services  contracted and other services,  such as sales and general  image. With respect to the  Cleaning Services Department,  customers gave a higher score  to the aspects referring to the  services contracted, with contract  compliance in first place. Insofar  as the Maintenance Department,  customers also rated the  aspects concerning the services  contracted higher, with the  provision of information receiving  the best score.   In the context of the customer  care systems, it must be  noted that all of the claims or  complaints are handled through  the same channel as that used  to lodge them –by telephone,  e-mail, regular mail, through the  Internet, etc.-, following up each  communication and ensuring  proper processing and an answer  within a previously established  time limit. In the services provided directly  to users, as in the case of the  management of transportation  infrastructures or care for the  elderly in residential facilities or  with respect to hotels, the means  necessary for lodging a complaint  are made available (complaints  book, customer care telephones,  websites, reply letters, etc.) at  readily accessible locations, such  as toll road collection booths, card  or ticket sales windows, reception  desks in buildings, among others.    At OHL Concesiones road  users have access to a claims,  complaints and suggestions  service managed through  customer care centers, telephone  lines and the websites of each  of the concession companies,  thereby facilitating an analysis of  the areas for improvement and the  opportunities for enhancing the  quality of the service. An important fact to be  highlighted is the low percentage  of complaints and claims received  each year by the concession  companies in relation to the  volume of vehicle traffic. During  the 2011 financial year, there  were around 8% fewer claims than  in 2010. If we take into account  the increase in traffic flows on  the toll roads, the percentage of  claims with respect to the volume  of traffic decreased by 18% during  2011. OHL Construction registers  claims for each construction  project in its after-sales phase  in the case of Spain, obtaining  a claim rate with a value that  depends fundamentally on the  kind of project involved. In 2011,  the average response time was  five days. The claims registered in OHL  Developments in 2011 were minor  and were mainly associated with  the maintenance of the hotels,  the check-out service, restaurant,  odors or systems failures  (Internet). These complaints were  attended to immediately and were  handled adequately. In the case of OHL Industrial  and OHL Environment, these  divisions received no claims or  complaints whatsoever in 2011. Finally, we should point out  that at Novaires residential  facilities for the elderly, all of  the complaints or claims are  classified (attention and hygiene,  medical care, psycho-social  care, meals, cleaning, etc.) and  are investigated, and a reply is  given within a maximum time  limit of 15 days for the individual  centers and 30 days for the  central headquarters. In 2011,  44 complaints or claims were  handled, and 100% of these were  attended to within the established  time limit.

Customer complaints are managed through the channel used for lodging  them, by following up each communication and ensuring that complaints  are dealt with properly and given a response within the established time  limit [5] / Forward-looking infrastructures  More information:  Quality and  Environmental Policy  GRI Indicators  94 94 Sustainability Report 2011 Survey of stakeholders:  customers All of these studies are  supplemented by the data  obtained by the OHL Group in  its initiatives for analyzing the  expectations of its stakeholders  and through the studies  provided by the government  administrations that are OHL  customers. The expectations of  the Groups stakeholders are  analyzed by means of regular  surveys, and our customers are  counted among them.  Starting in 2010, the company  has kept a survey project active  that was initially designed in two  phases. The first phase took place  at the end of 2010 and targeted  several groups of stakeholders,  including customers of OHL  Concesiones, OHL Construccin  and OHL Desarrollos in Spain,  Mexico and Brazil.  The purpose was to identify  what issues were considered most  relevant by our customers in the  framework of the companys CSR  policy. In order to do so, several  analyses were made –analysis  of bidding terms and conditions,  analysis of satisfaction surveys,  CSr ISSueS Of reLevANCe fOr OHL CuSTOMerS Public Administrations  Customers and users of services Business partners Legal and regulatory compliance Customer satisfaction  Environmental Management Systems Environmental Management Systems  Training Human capital Occupational safety Quality of the service  Ethical and transparent management  of the business, avoiding all forms of  corruption and bribery Human capital Management of suppliers Community involvement complaints received, benchmark  analysis of sector companies  for identifying the issues of  significance for the customers of  other companies, thereby enabling  a comparison with those detected  in the survey of  OHLs customers-,  in addition to interviews and  questionnaires targeting relevant  customers.  The customer stakeholders to  whom the 2010-2011 survey was  directed were classified into three  groups: Public Administrations,  customers and users of services  and business partners. The  relevant issues identified are set  out on the table included below. More information:  GRI Indicators Positive environmental  management has  significant priority both for  its commercial partners  as well as for the public  administrations surveyed by  OHL.

OHL Group certificate list    (continue 4/4)  95 95 Sustainability Report 2011 OHL and its  suppliers,  together   in facing the  challenge of  sustainability  [6]  96 97 Sustainability Report 2011 [6] OHL and its suppliers, together in facing the  challenge of sustainability  In 2011, the OHL Group took  a very significant step in this  regard through the creation of a  Responsible Purchasing Policy.  This is a major milestone in the  application of Corporate Social  Responsibility criteria in supply  chain management, given that it  establishes our commitment to  ethics and sustainability in the  framework of our relation with our  suppliers and subcontractors. In this way, this new policy lays  the foundation for developing a  management system which has  a greater awareness of the social  and environmental risks which  may arise in the framework of this  relation as well as for establishing  a richer, more in-depth  collaboration with the companies  supplying us with products and  services. Approved in December 2011,  the Responsible Purchasing Policy  will be applied to all purchases  of products and services by any  of the OHL Group companies or  entities, with three objectives in  mind: 1. Establish and promote  awareness of the Group  commitment to its suppliers and  contractors. 2. Encourage compliance by  them with the standards or basic  criteria related to human rights  and workers rights, the health  and safety of its workers on the  job, respect for the environment  and ethical conduct. 3. Disseminate and ensure  awareness and application of the  principles of the United Nations  Global Compact in the supply  chain.    By means of this, OHL  Construction will obtain greater  contracting power for certain  typical global market supplies,  and will improve its working  processes with suppliers, from  selection right up to contracting.  Changes which will become even  more evident in the organization  of singular works, particularly in  logistics and major supplies.  Also noteworthy in 2011 is  the effort made by the three  hotels located in the Mayakoba  tourist complex which OHL  Developments has in the Mexican  Riviera Maya. The Fairmont,  Rosewood and BanyanTree  hotels train their purchasing  managers in environmental  aspects to enable them to  choose products which are more  respectful of the environment,  and maintain a green purchasing  policy which, whenever  possible, promotes the purchase  This milestone coincided in  2011 with sweeping changes in  the OHL Group business structure,  evidenced by the merger of  the divisions of International  Construction and Domestic  Construction into a single division.  This transformation has given rise  to a project of full integration of  the purchases in OHL Construction  at the international level with the  following objectives:  Creation of a system to  promote awareness of the local  markets comprising the global  market.   Intervention of purchasing  management in those purchasing  processes in which this proves  advisable given the type or cost  the of product.   Introduction of the  Computerized Purchasing System  (CPS) in all the geographical  areas.   Classification and approval of  suppliers and contractors in each  market.  Unification of ways to act  in purchasing planning and  processes.  of biodegradable cleaning  products, non-waste generating  inputs, energy-efficient  equipment and local products  which promote immediate  economic development, such as  handicrafts. In 2011 all of these practices  were analyzed and verified  by the Rainforest Alliance  organization in order to audit  their development and grant the  sustainable tourism practices  certification in accordance with  the Global Sustainable Tourism  Criteria (GSTC). Mayakoba and  its three hotels already display  the logotype of the Rainforest  Alliance sustainable tourism  program. The sustainability of the  natural environment  in the development  of Mayakoba: from its  conception and design  through to the final  inputs of the hotels. The responsible  procurement  policy, approved  in December 2011,  includes a system  for familiarization  with the local  markets where OHL  is established. The  photo shows road  surfacing operations  on the Autopista del  Norte toll road,   in Peru. Based on the CSR 2010-2014  Master Plan, the OHL Group has  a working strategy to tackle the  key aspects of responsible supply  chain management. This strategy  defines a series of lines of action  which make up and consolidate  the CSR best practices of the  company in relation to suppliers  and subcontractors. An in-depth  analysis of the strides made  during 2011 in each of these can  be found below. OHL Group lines of work in relation to its supply chain   Purchase using sustainability criteria   Dialogue with suppliers   Prevent social and environmental risks  As a global company, at OHL we have a highly varied international supply chain, in line with the principal activities  of the business, which define the profile of our demand for products and services. This situation poses a numerous  challenges, a good number of which are related to sustainability.  We are aware that it is our responsibility to see  to it that the companies with which we establish supply relations manage in a responsible manner the resulting  social and environmental effects of these relations. For this reason, for the coming years we have a clear objective  in mind: to establish relations of collaboration in terms of sustainability with our supply chain.  98 99 Sustainability Report 2011 [6] / OHL and its suppliers OHL Group Supply Chain Features  Each one of the OHL Group operating divisions, as well as the corporate apparatus,  manages its purchases  autonomously, so that consequently the modes and means of management are brought in line with the needs  of the various business activities of the OHL Group. This distinction is defined by the various features of each  supply chain. are high-cost, require extensive  manufacturing time, or use raw  materials subject to significant  change, are considered to be  especially critical for the activity. The bulk of OHL Industrial  suppliers are located in  Europe, primarily in Spain,  where over 75% of the division  supply chain is found. Total  purchases expenditure by OHL  Industrial in 2011 amounted to  211,049,003.97 euros. Outside of Europe, the most  extensive network of OHL  Industrial suppliers is located  in Peru, owing to the process of  opening out to countries abroad  undertaken by this division in  2011.  This process has made  it necessary to use suppliers  with more extensive distribution  networks, especially with  destination in Peru and other Latin  American countries. Principal products and services which OHL Construction purchases in Spain  Materials Services Aggregates  Earth movement  Paving Bitumen  Masonry  Painting  Cement Carpentry Sanitation Concrete Foundation laying  Glasswork  Prefabricated  materials Roofing  Air-conditioning  installations  Steel Demolitions  Heating and A.C.S.  installations  Ceramic materials Drainage Communication  installations    Paving materials Form work  Electrical installations   Wood Roadway equipping  Plumbing and sanitation  installations  Installation materials  Structures Sanitation installations  Additives  Roadbeds  Water treatment plants  Fuels Waterproofing  Ventilation installations  Roadway equipment  Piling Surveillance and control  installations  Railway materials  Marine works  Machine rental  Pipes  Underground works  Auxiliary equipment rental  OHL Industrial Suppliers (2011 Total: 845) Type % Construction 11.8 Materials  66.2 Services 22.0 The OHL Construction supply  chain is basically comprised of  two types of suppliers: those  supplying materials without  contributing manpower, and  subcontractors, involving any  modality of labor, with or without  the supply of materials. In greater detail, the following  are the suppliers with which it  works in the Spain Area:  Suppliers: supply solely  materials.  Subcontractors: solely  contribute manpower and, if  needed, small machinery in order  to execute the work.  Industrialists: contribute  manpower, materials and/or  machinery.  Rentals: especially machinery  and auxiliary equipment.  Service provision: at the  worksite and outside of the  worksite. In 2011, this classification  encompassed a large number of  products and services,  depending  on a purchase object or given  type of product or service, with  respect to which these suppliers  must be authorized. A database  exists for this purpose, containing  approximately 6,200 purchase  objects, and continues to grow. >> Moreover, owing to the  start-up of new activities and  the commencement of the  construction of thermo-solar and  photovoltaic plants, in 2011 the  variety of supply chain suppliers  was extended in order to acquire  the equipment required for these  projects. The OHL Concessions  supply chain is especially  characterized by the contracting  of services, among which are  noteworthy those of legal,  fiscal, financial and juridical  consultancy; highway traffic  and toll system consultancy;  the purchase of traffic,  statistical and market studies,  as well as opinion surveys, in  addition to the contracting of  layout, systems auditing and  computer development services.  Consequently, the overall profile  of OHL Concessions suppliers  is that of highly specialized  professional firms, having  international experience, whose  fundamental contribution  is excellence in the matters  in which they provide their  services. This division does not  have a centralized purchasing  management department, with  each concessionaire company  being responsible for its own  management. Outside of Spain it is aimed  to achieve the same level of  detail, taking into account the  particularities of each one of the  countries.  The total number of OHL  Group suppliers in the division of  Construction, Spain Area, during  2011 amounted to 7,882, without  including joint ventures (UTE).  These collaborations have given  rise during the year to a total  expenditure of 686,552,695.22  euros, with 62.40% corresponding  to purchases from local suppliers,  within the region itself. On its part, in 2011 OHL  Industrial collaborated with 845  suppliers. These can be classified  into suppliers of materials,  equipment and services, for  engineering, assembly and  construction. Among all of these,  those supplying equipment and  materials which, owing to their  singularity or technical complexity,   100 101 Sustainability Report 2011 Products and services which OHL Environment purchases Materials Equipment Installations and  Maintenance  Services Water filtration aggregates Motor pump groups  Water treatment plants  Project engineering work  Water treatment additives  Ultrafiltration and osmosis  membranes  Desalination plants  Software applications  Chemical products for  analysis  Motors Electrical equipment supply  and installation  Electromechanical  equipment inspections  Gas for sludge drying  Lightweight steel and plastic  boilerwork  Control systems supply and  installation  Analysis campaigns  Plumbing, drysaltery and  hardware products  FRP roofing  Electromechanical  equipment maintenance  Construction project drafting Work clothes and protective  clothing  FRP storage tanks  Assembly supervision   National and international  transport Local instrumentation  Plant waste management  Metal and plastic pipes  Pressure and microfiltration  filters  Air-blowers and  compressors Chemical proportioning  equipment  Orbal process discs Treatment equipment spare  parts  Plant operation fuel OHL Environment Purchases in 2011 Number of  Suppliers  Expenditure  () % Services contracting  43 1,357,468.85 32.8 Construction contracting  56 1,175,647.11 28.4 Materials and equipment  contracting  95 1,603,321.92 38.8 Total contracted amount  194 4,136,437.88 100.0 Organization and General Services Management Suppliers in 2011 Type Number Expenditure () Offices                                   160 25,293,370.40 Mobility and Communications  24 23,604,199.05 Other Services  30 1,014,719.62 Total 214 49,912,289.07 Information Systems Management Suppliers in 2011 Division tended to Number Expenditure () Construction and corporate  59 5,967,385 Industrial 18 2,174,974 Concessions 4 352,348 Environment  4 286,803 Total 85 8,781,510 OHL Environment makes its  purchases in accordance with the  regulations of OHL Construction  in force, using its official contract  forms and validating the  original documents in the same  management system. Although its volume is not  comparable to that of the business  divisions, the purchases made  from the corporate apparatus,  especially in Spain, must also  be highlighted. These purchases  are channeled through the  Organization and General Services  Management and the Information  Services Management, and  significant efforts are being  made, especially by this first  Management, in order to introduce  sustainability criteria into supply  chain management, as will be  seen throughout this report. In 2011 the Organization and  General Services Management  had 214 suppliers. Of all of  these, from the perspective of  Corporate Social Responsibility,  those most sensitive to social  and environmental risks are the  suppliers of surveillance and  security services, suppliers of  energy and fuel, and suppliers of  office materials and furniture.  On its part, the Information  Systems Management manages  the purchases of computer  equipment, licenses and  services for the various divisions  and for the corporate areas in  Spain. In 2011, it had a total  of 85 suppliers, with its global  expenditure volume amounting to  nearly nine million euros, 99% of  which corresponded to domestic  suppliers. The volume of purchases made  in 2011 by  Inima has called for a  total of 322 contract documents  and relations with a total of  194  suppliers, most of which are  Spanish. The supply chain of  this division is characterized  by the purchase of specific  products, especially materials  and equipment, the contracting of  services and the subcontracting of  construction activities.  OHL Group Supply Chain Features    (continue) >> OHL Developments has a  small supplier network in Spain,  whereas most of its supply  chain is in Mexico, made up of  the providers of ordinary hotel  services and inputs.  In 2011, this  type of supplies generated for the  division an expenditure volume of  over 50 million euros. The total cost of procurements  by the Group in 2011 amounted  2,691.1 million euros. [6] / OHL and its suppliers  102 103 Sustainability Report 2011 Purchasing with  sustainability criteria  In the OHL Group we are  working  to incorporate the  principles of Corporate Social  Responsibility into purchasing  management. We seek to  collaborate with our suppliers and  subcontractors to build a tradition  of sustainability in the framework  of our relations. And in this regard,  in 2011 we had an ambitious  goal: to create a responsible  purchasing policy applicable to  the entire Group. OHL respects the business  and professional project which  its suppliers and contractors  legitimately and independently  personify; however, it wishes  to progress in its relation with  them in order to promote the  business success of both parties,  avoiding social, economic and  environmental risks, and building  a bond based on:  Mutual respect and trust.   Dialogue and exchange of  clear information.  A common interest in  promoting and developing  innovation applied to improving  the quality of life, the quality of  work and sustainability. The new OHL Responsible  Purchasing Policy  reflects this  new work philosophy. This Policy  gathers common criteria for  use in developing  responsible  purchasing management  throughout the Group. The four  divisions comprising the company  find here basic references to  activate initiatives to promote  sustainability and ethics in the  framework of this management. In its Ethics Code, OHL already  established, among other  aspects, that employees dealing  in purchasing management in the  company are to ensure  that all  the processes for selecting Group  suppliers and contractors are  carried out  under conditions of  impartiality and objectivity, and  likewise when choosing suppliers  are to consider whether these  suppliers uphold the ethical  principles defended in the Code. The Responsible Purchasing  Policy comes to reinforce this  internal requirement, establishing   the OHL commitments with  respect to its suppliers, at the  same time indicating the company  expectations in regard to their  social and environmental conduct. In the first case,  OHL  establishes that all of its  purchasing managers conduct  themselves in an upright  professional manner, free from  any type of corruption; that  the company promote stable  commercial relations that  will facilitate  the sustainable  exercise of the business activity  of its suppliers, and that will  promote the development of the  business sector  and the creation  of employment wherever it  operates, through local supply  contracting. Moreover, the  Group will promote contracting  processes which can be freely  attended, and with this aim  in mind, it will provide clear  information regarding the  conditions for participation  and evaluation criteria, and will  create the conditions which will  allow the selection process to  be carried out using objective,  transparent and balanced  criteria. Lastly, the OHL Group  undertakes to maintain  confidentiality when dealing  with suppliers and contractors,  and to protect the personal data  shared in this context, as well  as to provide them with timely,  clear and truthful information on  matters in which these suppliers  and contractors have a direct  interest. OHL expects that its suppliers  and contractors observe at  least certain basic guidelines  of ethical behavior and respect  for human rights and workers  rights, certain conditions of  health and safety for their  employees and  a management  which takes into account respect  for the environment. The OHL objective for 2012 is  to disseminate its Responsible  Purchasing Policy to all Group  purchasing departments and  managers, and, subsequently,  to all company suppliers  and contractors, in order to  familiarize them with the new  framework of relations which  OHL seeks to build.  In addition, a working group  will be created, comprised of  representatives from the various  purchasing teams existing  in the OHL divisions and the  CSR Service. This group will  take charge of analyzing and  defining the evolution of the  Responsible Purchasing Policy. It  will consequently be a work space  aimed at obtaining a more detailed  knowledge of the opportunities  and social and environmental  risks occurring in the Group supply  chain, in order to move towards  an increasingly sustainable  development of this chain. The OHL Responsible  Purchasing Policy is a major  milestone in the CSR  initiatives  which the Group aims at  suppliers, but there were  already a number of other  policies with this same aim in  mind. For instance, since 2009  the Organization and General  Services Management has  been applying environmental  criteria  in its habitual purchasing  management and when supplying  office centers. These criteria are  reflected in a preference for:  What OHL expects from its suppliers  Ethical conduct based on integrity and professional ethics, avoiding any type of corruption and unfair competition  Respect for basic human rights  and workers rights  Respect for the environment  Health and safety conditions on  the job for its employees    Fight against forced and  compulsory labor   Prohibition against harsh or  degrading treatment   Elimination of child labor   Regulated employment   Respect for freedom of  association and the right to  collective bargaining   No discrimination  Payment of decent wages    Non-excessive workday    Strict compliance with  environmental legislation   Commitment to environmental  protection    Provide a safe and healthy work  environment   Effective accident-prevention  measures   Reduction of worksite risks   Regular worker information  and training in safety, health and  hygiene   Suitable protective equipment   Access to potable water and  clean rest rooms   Suitable and safe  accommodation when required   Rules and procedures for the  management of waste, emissions,  landfills and hazardous materials   The company will assign health  and safety responsibilities  to a  manager having sufficient category  in the company organization chart OHLs Responsible Procurement Policy establishes the companys  commitment to its suppliers, as well as its expectations with respect to  their social and environmental conduct  Wherever it operates,  OHL requires its  suppliers to ensure a  safe and healthy work  environment.

[6] / OHL and its suppliers More information:  Code of Conduct  Responsible Purchasing  Policy   OHL Group certificates  GRI Indicators  104 105 Sustainability Report 2011  Buildings and premises  which are more energy efficient,  which have emergency protection  systems and which promote  employee mobility.  Flight operators (travel  management) having public  information on greenhouse gas  emissions (GGE).  Hotel, telephony, vehicle  rental and fuel suppliers, and  intermediary operators which  have introduced environmental  management systems.  Industrial vehicle rental  operators having a hazardous  waste management plan.  Telephony products and  terminals which contribute to  reducing consumption and waste  generation.  Vehicles which have reduced  consumption and emissions. A form of purchasing which, in  addition, is reflected in specific  initiatives aimed at reducing  consumption and emissions. One of the objectives of  Organization and General Services  consists in improving OHL Group  mobility, reducing global emissions  of CO2 into the atmosphere per  kilometer traveled by the fleet.  In 2010, this management set  for itself the objective of replacing   6% of the most highly polluting  vehicles of the OHL fleet. By  the end of 2011, 10.4% of said  vehicles had been replaced. This  initiative, together  with the fleet  reduction already begun in 2009,  has made it possible, from that  time forward and until the end  of 2011, an average theoretical  reduction of CO2 per vehicle of  19,988 (g/km), equivalent to  14.3%, has been estimated.  Along these lines, in 2011,  an agreement was signed with  Opel/BBVA Autorenting for the  gradual substitution over the  next two years of the 807-vehicle  fleet the company has under  operating leasing, which would  result in a 2.1% reduction in fuel   consumption (2,825 liters/month)  and a 2.4%  reduction in CO2  emissions (8.6 T. CO2/ month). Building management also  forms part of this environmental  impact reduction strategy. The  OHL Group office buildings comply  with the regulations on thermal  installations in buildings (RITE)  to improve energy efficiency and  reduce greenhouse gas emissions  (GGE). At the head offices in  Spain, consumption in 2011  amounted to 2,611,253 kWh, a  reduction of 0.347 GJ/m2, with the  goal set for the year consequently  being reached. Currently, 16  energy suppliers collaborate with  the company in these objectives. Likewise encouraged in 2011  was the consumption of green  products, such as paper from  sustainable forestry management  and, in general, products having  some type of eco-labeling.  Currently, the Organization and  General Services Management has  841 products in its catalog of non- strategic purchasing materials,   30% of which are eco-labeled   or considered recommendable  in view of their respect for the  environment. Moreover, in the  purchasing platform used by  this service, these products are  identified in green text and have  an eco-label designed by the  European Union, accounting for  9.8% of all purchases made. On  the other hand, products which  are not recommendable owing  to their environmental impact  are identified in red text, with  the product label containing a  question mark of the same color  as that of the text.  Lastly, and from a social  perspective, this management  contributes to the placement of  disabled persons, collaborating  with companies such as ESCID,  of the Sifu Group, a series of  Special Employment Centers   (SEC) having over 17 years of  experience in the job and social  placement of persons with  physical, psychological, mental  or sensorial disability. ESCID has  supplied office materials to OHL  throughout 2011 in the amount of  nearly 50,000 euros. In addition  to the purchases from SEC by this  management, other purchases are  made in the Group from similar  types of organizations, mainly  products and services related  to training, surveillance and   merchandising, among others. Furthermore, it should be  highlighted that in seeking an  active management of respect  for human rights, security service  suppliers in Spain are requested  to accredit certification of  adhesion to the Global Compact. Dialogue with suppliers   Our supplier network is  essential for the development  of our activities in all OHL Group  business lines. Our interest is to  use this network as a space for  cooperation, so that consequently  both parties can enjoy more  numerous and improved business  opportunities. In this regard,  dialogue is an essential tool.  OHL  wishes to establish channels of  dialogue with the various supplier  groups which will make it possible  to transmit the OHL commitment  to sustainability and will allow the  supply chain to collaborate with  these objectives. The new Responsible  Purchasing Policy recognizes  the importance of dialogue with  suppliers and contractors in  OHL management. In this policy  This consultation aimed to  learn how this group evaluated  CSR management in OHL as well  as their own management of  social and environmental aspects  in their business activity.  A total  of 71 suppliers participated,  mostly subcontractors and  product suppliers having a  commercial relation of over five  years with the company. The consultation revealed that  55% of the participants carry  out some type of sustainability  initiative. In these cases, they  normally have an environmental  policy or code of ethics. Among  the certifications they hold,  mention should be made firstly of   ISO 9000, secondly of ISO 14000,  and lastly of OHSAS 18001.  the company undertakes to  develop fluent communication  with its suppliers and  contractors, seeing to it that  they receive timely, clear and  truthful information. It likewise  undertakes to receive any claims  and suggestions which they wish  to communicate to it.  In 2011, through this policy,  these practices were renewed,  this time, however, with special  emphasis being placed on a  willingness to build a more  open and enriched relation with  suppliers and contractors, with  dialogue being given an important  role in this new approach.  The  consultation made of suppliers  and contractors by OHL in 2011  was already conducted along  these lines.  Important CSR matters in the supply chain according to OHL  suppliers and subcontractors  Most important matters  Matters best managed by OHL  Eradication of child labor  Ethical and transparent business  management, avoiding any type  of corruption and bribery  Compliance with contract  conditions  Occupational health and safety Elimination of any type of forced  and compulsory labor  Eradication of child labor  Occupational health and safety Elimination of any type of forced  and compulsory labor Customer or final user  satisfaction with OHL Group  services/products  Ethical and transparent business  management, avoiding any type  of corruption and bribery The replacement  and reduction of  the vehicle fleet  has enabled OHL to  achieve an emission  savings of 14.3% in  two years. A total of 71 suppliers with a business relationship of more than five years  with OHL participated in the 2011 survey of suppliers and subcontractors,  revealing that 55% of them carry out sustainability initiatives [6] / OHL and its suppliers  106 107 Sustainability Report 2011 This initiative has also revealed  the CSR management aspects  considered most important by  suppliers and subcontractors, in  accordance with any social and  environmental impact which the  companies may have.  In regard to this point, their  impressions have provided   valuable insight into how OHL  efforts in CSR management are  being received within its supply  chain. As a result, the Group  now has a better understanding  of those areas in which its  performance is best recognized,  as well as of its opportunities for  improvement. The Responsible  Purchasing Policy comes as a  response to certain expectations  voiced by this group,  and deals  with certain areas of management  which suppliers and contractors  consider to be important  but  which they feel are not being given  sufficient consideration by the  company. The consultation has also  served to evaluate the importance  given to and use made by OHL  suppliers and contractors of the  communication channels with  which the company provides  them, with the company receiving  suggestions on new channels  which would facilitate contact  between both parties, such as an  online purchasing channel, the  holding of periodical conventions  Preventing social and  environmental risks   In a supply chain as extensive   as that of the OHL Group, it is  necessary to work actively in  order to prevent the occurrence  of undesirable social and  environmental impacts. At OHL  our objective in this regard is  twofold. On the one hand, to get a  more in-depth knowledge of and  to better detect the economic,  social and environmental risks  related to the supply chain;  and, on the other hand, to  ensure compliance with our own  sustainability commitments  throughout this chain. OHL has already taken  significant steps in preventing  the social and environmental  risks associated with the supply  chain. As a global group, it is  aware of the challenges and  risks inherent to its activity, and  is firmly committed to seizing  any opportunities which arise  in order to prevent any social or  environmental damage. The 2011  Responsible Purchasing Policy is  a step towards excellence in our  management model. How OHL suppliers use and evaluate dialogue channels  Dialogue Channel Usage%  Importance  (from 1 to 5) Construction managers  94% 4.37 Purchasing management  84% 4.49 Process of approval, monitoring  and  evaluation of suppliers   68% 4.00 Area management  59% 4.22 Guidelines for best work practices  51% 3.78 Stakeholder consultation annual  project  51% 4.49 Environmental management and  OHS guides 29% 3.85 Training programs  19% 3.61 Ethics Channel  13% 3.58 Sustainable Development Annual  Report  10% 3.41 with suppliers and the purchases  area, or a centralized channel for  administrative aspects. Some  of the initiatives which OHL has  underway are in answer to these  demands and, in any event, all of  this information is being analyzed  by the Group and will serve to  inspire its future initiatives in  regard to responsible supply chain  management. OHL Construction and the CPS  OHL Construction has developed a Computerized Purchasing System (CPS) to make its purchases. Since  2010 this computer application is being implemented in newly awarded works, and is contributing important  novelties and advantages to procurement management.  The system facilitates more efficient internal operating procedures, given that the action of purchasing is  simplified, the various types of management are reduced and, as a result, the number of documents generated  in the company is likewise reduced, by some 60,000 documents /year.  Moreover, the purchasing manager is  able to incorporate invited (non-authorized) suppliers during the purchasing process up until the time of award  and organize the times and documents related to the purchase, enabling the manager to know, at all times, the  state of development of the documents, where they are and who is in charge of them. It also offers the works  the basic information which OHL has regarding its authorized suppliers, classified by purchase objects, and an  updated authorized supplier database. With respect to suppliers, a more transparent purchasing process is attained, affording greater communication  possibilities, since the system incorporates an individual web page, OHL-Supplier, which allows for  communication in real time and the possibility of storing the history of the interactions carried out by both  through emails with self-encrypted files. In 2011, the CPS has incorporated all of the works in the Spain Area awarded during the year, and one works in  the North American Area. By means of this policy,  the company shares with its  suppliers and contractors its  expectations in regard to conduct  towards all members of its  supply chain, and consequently  defines a standard which will be  reflected in purchasing activities  and management criteria in the  coming years.  Meanwhile, the OHL Group  has in its business divisions  certain requisites and procedures  within its purchasing processes  and supplier and subcontractor  relations aimed at preventing any  social and environmental risks  which may be generated in the  supply chain.  In many of the OHL Group  companies, purchasing  management is found under  the quality and environment  management systems, and is  developed in accordance with  UNE-ENISO 9001 and 14000   standards or other standards, and  certified by external accrediting  entities (OHL Group certificates).  As part of the management  system, in the supplier evaluation  and selection process value is  placed on aspects related to  quality and the environment,  and in the authorization process  company certification in UNE- EN ISO 9000 and UNE-EN  14001,among other processes, is  taken into account. Furthermore, the company has  communication initiatives aimed at  extending sustainability practices  to its supply chain. By means of  these initiatives, it facilitates to  workers of collaborating companies  the documentation required for  better compliance with the specific  management plans of each works,  as well as file cards, specific  instructions for best practices in  the workplace and environmental  and occupational safety guides,  and develops training programs  through talks and meetings  aimed at raising environmental  and social awareness. Worthy of  note among the aforementioned  guides is Environmental Conduct  for Suppliers and Subcontractors,  published expressly by the Quality  and Environment Service in order  to raise awareness and facilitate  training in environmental matters  for Group subcontractors and  collaborators. [6] / OHL and its suppliers  108 109 Sustainability Report 2011 Once the time comes to  make the purchase, all standard  contracts include a clause on the  commitment of the supplier or  collaborator to comply with the  United Nations Global Compact,  through the introduction of its 10  principles based on human rights,  labor standards, the environment,  and the fight against corruption.  Moreover, this will be one of  the mandatory requirements for  authorization of suppliers in OHL  Construction. This division has  designed a new global regulation  on purchasing, which provides  for an authorization procedure for  each country or geographical area.  These authorization procedures  will contain certain requirements  which are mandatory and others  which are called for at given  times, among which are included  criteria related to the social and  environmental conduct of the  companies. Once authorization  has been granted, those in charge  of the contracted works, service or  product will conduct a follow-up  upon finalization of each one of  the services provided. This procedure will begin  operating in Spain in 2012  through a regulation specific for  said country. It will be applied to  all suppliers starting an activity  with the Group, and to suppliers  whose authorization has expired,  with the objective being set  to have all suppliers in Spain  authorized in accordance with the  new regulation in the maximum  term of five years. In order to  introduce this procedure into the  rest of the countries where OHL  Construction is present, work is  being carried out to adapt the  regulation to the local legislation  in each case.  In conjunction with this, it  should be pointed out that given  that construction is an activity  which is subject to certain social  risks, at the worksite the most  suitable prevention measures  are taken to verify at each center  who is providing the services  and under what conditions,  calling for accreditation of  social security, payroll, work  permits and all documentation  required for proper compliance  with labor and social security,  or similar obligations. In Spain,  the contracting of collaborating  companies and their personnel  is overseen, with said companies  being required to provide Social  Security registration slips for each  worker. In the rest of the countries,  control is carried out to ensure  that all personnel contracted at  the first level are affiliated with  the social security system of the  country in question, that said  personnel have health coverage  and that their wages correspond   at least to the countrys legally  established minimum wage. At the worksite, the supplier,  industrialist or subcontractor  adheres to the OHL Group  management systems and is  therefore required to comply  with the stipulations of the  corresponding plans: quality,  environment, and occupational  health and safety.   On its part, OHL Industrial also  carries out special control and  monitoring measures in relation  to the environmental conduct of  its suppliers. Such supervision  at the worksite is carried out by  the head of Safety, Health and  Environment, who has as one of  his principal responsibilities the  approval and custodianship of the  Safety, Health and Environment  Plan associated with each project. Control at the worksite is  carried out by requiring waste  control and waste monitoring  certificates issued by an  authorized manager,  non- hazardous waste management  invoices and landfill receipts, and  this management is monitored  monthly by means of a report  drafted by the head of Safety,  Health and Environment.  Furthermore, verification is made  of compliance with all labor and  fiscal legislation, and of the  required solvency and knowledge  in matters of occupational health  and safety and environmental  management.  The new global  procurement  regulations include  a type-approval  procedure for  each country or  geographical area.  The photo identifies  the hard hat used by  OHL S, the Groups  subsidiary for Central  and Eastern Europe. Health and safety in subcontracted works   OHL maintains strict control over its collaborating companies in order to comply with the Health and Safety  Plan and to enforce in Spain Law 54/2003, on the Reform of the Occupational Risk Prevention Regulatory  Framework  and Royal Decree 171/2004, in matters of business activity coordination. Consequently, it requires  of Group collaborators the presence of at least one assigned worker having at least basic level training to  oversee compliance in matters of prevention by the subcontracted works unit, notwithstanding maintaining the  mandatory prevention resources as specified in each Health and Safety Plan, in terms of the size and hazards  posed by the works and services. Although the training of subcontracted personnel in Spain corresponds to their own company, in other countries  this responsibility is transferred by law to the company executing the project. Therefore, in companies such as  Algeria, Argentina, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru and the USA,  OHLs own safety officers take charge of training all  personnel, whether OHL workers or subcontracted workers, entering the worksite. Additionally, those in charge of  safety for each project identify additional training needs, based, among other things, on aspects such as changes  in operations (new processes, machinery, etc.), the results of periodical working condition controls, any accidents  or incidents which occurred, and the periodical training of all personnel. The introduction of these actions makes it possible to monitor legal compliance in those countries which transfer  the ultimate responsibility to the project executor and to guarantee the universal right of the workers to be  informed of the risks to which they are subject in carrying out their work (a right provided for in article 5 of ILO  Convention 155). Information on prevention at the worksite in Spain  Information on prevention is the principal activity complementing OHS training. By organizing and developing  talks at the various work centers, information is provided on certain work procedures to be developed and the  safety measures to be taken in said regard. Aimed at both its own personnel as well as at collaborators involved  in the process, each talk lasts between 15 and 60 minutes, and is carried out prior to the start of the activities  concerned.  These actions, which are known internationally as Tool Box Meetings, are carried out by risk prevention  technicians assigned to each work center, and may also be given by technicians who are specialized in explaining  the work procedure to be carried out, the construction manager himself and the general foreman or the  technicians of the Group Joint Prevention Service (JPS).  The information and awareness measures furnished in these talks are provided in conjunction with specific  printed information on the work method to be executed, consequently raising awareness and competence in  order for the task to be carried out safely. In 2011 over 2,600 Tool Box Meetings were recorded in Spain, with the participation of more than 12,000  operators.

This strategic  tool, within the context of the  Corporate Social Responsibility  Master Plan, establishes as  its principal lines of action a  low-carbon economy, energy  efficiency, and ecosystem  conservation. It also serves  to integrate and coordinate  the efforts of all of the Group  operating divisions, guaranteeing  the development of their  environmental commitments in  each one of the businesses which  they carry out. The management  of the significant environmental  aspects of the activities, the  identification of risks and the  environmental opportunities of  the business, and the specific  characteristics of the territories  in which they are carried out  are  provided for in the various lines  of action. Moreover, during the year a  number of significant initiatives  have been put into practice  with respect to environmental  protection in alliance or  cooperation with several  entities of recognized prestige  in this area. The agreements  signed with the Madrid (Spain)  Town Council in regard to the  contracting of sustainable  forestry products and energy  efficiency (Pro-Climate Forum),  as well as Group participation  in the Madrid Compensates  project, are an example of such  initiatives. Further information  on these projects can be found  in the section  Sharing our  environmental protection efforts  and progress in this chapter. In 2011 Group environmental  performance  has once again  been recognized by prestigious  outside entities. Worthy of  mention among the various types  of recognition received is the  LEED Gold certification for the  building UM Alumni Hall of Miami  executed by the OHL Construction  division, through its subsidiary  OHL USA, as well as two  important awards granted to the  Maykoba Tourism Development    (OHL Developments, Mexico).  Firstly, the 2011  Ulysses  Award granted by the World  Tourism Organization (UNWTO,  a United Nations agency in  charge of promoting responsible,  sustainable and accessible  tourism for all) in the category of  Business Innovation. This award  is granted to initiatives and  projects of public institutions,  tourism companies and non- profit making organizations  which have made an important  contribution to advancing tourism  through innovation in line with  the United Nations Millennium  Development Goals. The Sustainable Standard- Setter award,  granted by  Rainforest Alliance to the  Mayakoba Tourism Development  and its three hotels.  OHL  Developments and Rainforest  Alliance together with Marti  have been working since 2010  on developing a model of  sustainable practices specifically  for the Mexican tourism  sector, a model which is being  pioneered in Mayakoba and  which establishes certain control  specifications which comprise  the Global Sustainable Tourism  Criteria (GSTC). These awards are in  conjunction with other  recognition granted in previous  years to Mayakoba, which  attained the maximum evaluation  granted by the Mexican  environmental authorities.  The Environment and Natural  Resources Secretariat  has  recognized Mayakoba as an  environmental reference model   for the tourism sector of that  country. By means of project development and infrastructure construction and management, we wish to contribute to the  transition to a low-carbon economy and to ecosystem conservation. With this aim in mind, we have set ourselves  a series of demanding goals and modes of working which will make it possible to combine the various business  goals with a respect for communities and the surrounding areas.

Moving forward, keeping the  environment in mind   113 114 Sustainability Report 2011 [7] / Moving forward, keeping the environment in mind Arellano Construction and LEED Certification  The UM Alumni Hall project in Miami, constructed by OHL USA, has  obtained LEED Gold certification LEED, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design is a  demanding program developed in the United States, having  wide international recognition, which values the environmental  responsibility of certain projects  – mainly buildings. The category  of the certification is granted after evaluating five critical areas of  a project and assigning a series of points or credits to each one:  sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy efficiency, sustainable  building materials and indoor environmental quality, and an  additional area of Innovation in Design. Once the construction of  the building has finalized, one of the following ratings is obtained:  LEED Certified, LEED Silver, LEED Gold or LEED Platinum.  In the face of a growing demand for sustainable construction  projects in the United States, in 2011 Arellano Construction, an  OHL Construccin subsidiary in that country, created the figure of   Sustainability Manager, whose function is to take part in the stages  of the preliminary project and design, in this way generating value  added within the plan of measures to be taken in accordance with  LEED. At the construction stage, the Sustainability Manager also  plays an active role, studying the possibilities of obtaining the  highest number of LEED credits (consulting with subcontractors  for sustainable alternatives, for instance, and obtaining local and  recycled materials for the project development). In 2011, the University of Miami Alumni Center in Coral Gables  (Florida) succeeded in earning the LEED Gold certification  after  having previously obtained the LEED Silver category, certification  granted by The United States Green Building Council (USGBC), with  Arellano Construction having developed a valuable collaborative  alliance with the customer and the architect  in order to obtain  this important certification. The contribution of the OHL Group  technicians, highly qualified and with previous experience in the  application of the LEED system, has been fundamental in this  award.  Complying from  Management with  Environmental  Commitments  Year after year, OHL  continues working to improve  its environmental performance,  especially in relation to a low- carbon economy and ecosystem  conservation, fundamental  aspects of its commitment to the  environment. Through the effort  of all of the persons comprising  it, the Group works to provide  an adequate response to all of  the environmental commitments  taken on and consequently make  its mission a reality: the creation  of value under conditions of  sustainability. Commitments Taken On 2011 is the year in which  the OHL Group 2011-2015  Environment and Energy Master  Plan has been first introduced.  Approved in 2010, this strategic  tool is aligned with the company  CSR Master Plan and entails the  development of the commitments  set out in the Declaration of  Quality and Environment Policy,  the Quality and Environment and  Environmental Actions Policy,  the Commitment to Fight against  Climate Change and in the  adhesion to the Global Compact  and to the United Nations  Millennium Development Goals.  Its principal goal consists,  therefore, in developing the  OHL Group commitment to the  environment, based on the  specific nature of its activities  and its business objectives.  The Plan is structured into a  series of operational projects  backed by transversal projects  which support their development.  Among the transversal projects,  mention should be made of the  full integration in 2011 of the  responsibilities and functions  of the OHL Group management  personnel in a new edition of the  Functions and Responsibilities  Manual which also affects  environmental management and  the objectives related to a low- carbon economy which OHL has  set for itself. The adaptation and  introduction of the Environmental  Management System has  also continued in the various  activities and countries, with the  novelty of the development of a  safety, quality and environment  integrated management system. In order for OHL to make  progress along the lines of  continual improvement in matters  of environment and contribution  to more sustainable development,  we are working in three different  areas. In this chapter detailed  information is provided on the  advances made in 2011 and the  future goals posed. OHL Group  lines of  action in environmental  matters  Comply from management with  environmental commitments   Innovate to contribute to  sustainability   Share our efforts and progress  in environmental protection  Associated with the  introduction of the Master  Plan is the continuity of the  training plan which in 2011 has  included training in sustainable  construction, and a series of initial  courses in LEED certification and  integral project management,  training actions which in the  2012 plan will take the form of   in-company courses to be given  by instructors recognized by  the USGBC, in the case of LEED  certification, and by the PMI in the  case of project management, in  order to promote the attainment  of the corresponding accreditation  by the Group technicians.  Other initiatives considered as  transversal projects of this Plan  are the creation of an internal  platform for environmental  know-how management, the  development of an external  communication plan and the  reinforcement of institutional  alliances allowing the OHL Group  to make significant contributions  to environmental protection. More  detailed information on these  latter two initiatives is provided  in the section Sharing our  environmental protection efforts  and progress. More information:  OHL Group corporate  policies  115 116 Sustainability Report 2011 Committed to a Low-Carbon Economy  In 2011 the fight against climate change had its principal  encounter in  Durban (South Africa) where the 17th Conference  of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change (COP 17) was held. There has been a discrepancy  of opinion in regard to the results that were obtained there, but  these results can be summarized in three fundamental points: the  establishment of a formal process for adopting a legal framework  (Durban Platform), prior to 2015, applicable to all of the countries,  which could become effective as from 2020; the immediate putting  into operation of a Green Climate Fund and the continuation of the  Kyoto Protocol through a second commitment period. The European Union was one of the fundamental players in  encouraging these negotiations to attain a legal framework  in   the fight against climate change by 2015, an effort which is in  consonance with the EU strategy in the fight against climate change.  In order to contain climate change to under 2 C, in February  2011 the European Council reaffirmed the goal of reducing  greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2050 by between 80%  and 90% with respect to the levels of 1990, in the context of the  reductions which the inter-governmental group of experts considers  that all the developed countries must make.  These intentions are reflected in the Europe 2020 strategy and  in the European Commission communication of March 2011 A  roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050,  which sets out the key steps which action against climate change  must take in order for the EU to become a competitive low-carbon  economy by 2050.  This is based on the idea that  innovative  solutions are required to mobilize investments in energy, transport,  industry and information and communication technologies, and  likewise that it is necessary to place greater emphasis on energy  efficiency policies. Companies have an important role to play in the fight against  climate change and in building a low-carbon economy both inside  and outside of the European context. OHL considers itself to be  a stakeholder in these efforts, and takes on this commitment  to  a low-carbon economy in its 2011-2015 Environment and Energy  Master Plan.  The know-how management  project included in the  Environment and Energy  Master Plan aims to reinforce  the internal network of quality  and environment technicians  throughout the Group by means  of a platform which will enable  them to exchange information,  technical solutions, best  practices and environmental  initiatives. Furthermore, it is  sought to favor the formation of  a library of environment-related  documents associated with the  Group projects. In the framework  of this initiative, from Corporate  General Management in 2011  the Quality and Environment  Service structure was improved  and the contact team reinforced  for each one of the divisions,  especially for the geographical  areas in which OHL Construction  has a presence. In this year  various representatives from  countries such as the United  States, Argentina, Mexico, Peru,   Australia, Turkey, Kuwait and  Canada were incorporated into  the network.  This has fostered the  increased use of video calls from  personal computers and video  conferences, as well as visits  to the countries in which the  Group has a presence. In 2011,  in the wake of the definition of  the new organizational structure  giving rise to the Construction  Division, a total of 4 visits were  made to various countries, as  well as video conferences and an  average of 5 contacts per week  via Skype, telephone or email. Also found among the  transversal projects are initiatives  related to the supply chain. The  Quality and Environment service   supports the Organization and  General Services Management in  the Green Purchases project, in  addition to collaborating in other  initiatives such as the revision  of the evaluation criteria applied  to OHL Construction suppliers  in order to bring said criteria  in line with current lines of  action, or initiatives such as the  drafting of the Group Responsible  Purchasing Policy. Further information on these  initiatives can be found in the  chapter OHL and its suppliers,  together in facing the challenge  of sustainability of this report.  Low-carbon economy is the  most important operational  project of the 2011-2015  Environment and Energy Master  Plan. The OHL Group is aware  of the important worldwide  repercussion of climate change,  and since 2007 has considered  the fight against climate change  to be one of its priority lines of  action. In line with one of the  strategic goals of the CSR Master  Plan in Environment matters -  Contribute, in the execution of its  projects, to progress towards a  low-carbon economy -, it commits  itself to the development of a  business strategy allowing for  the creation of value with the  least possible impact on the  atmosphere.  The 2011-2015 Environment  and Energy Master Plan  contains six programs of work  specifically associated with the  fight against climate change,  the most important of these  being the Greenhouse Gas  Emissions Report,  Energy  Management Systems, Carbon  Footprint Verification, the  Emissions Reduction Plan  and Analyst Valuation using  environmental criteria. In this way, during 2011, work  has been carried out from Quality  and Environment Corporate  Service in order to extend the  GHG emissions inventory of the  Group, so as to include suppliers  and subcontractors of strategic  supplies within the scope of these  measures. In order to do so, two  measures were taken: completion  of the documentation to be  handed in to the subcontractor  in order for the latter to provide  information on the GHG Emissions  from the activities which it  carries out for the Group, and  participation in the program  Accin CO2 suppliers. During 2011work has also been  carried out to establish a target  for a reduction of GHG Emissions  for the OHL Group as a whole. In  this regard, the required analyses  were made for the presentation of  a proposal in 2012.

[7] / Moving forward, keeping the environment in mind  117 118 Sustainability Report 2011 The Environmental Management  System Together with the importance  of the Environment and Energy  Master Plan as the OHL Group  roadmap for environmental  management during the 2011- 2015 period, it is also necessary  to highlight the important  role played by the  quality  and environment systems in  the company commitment to  adequately manage its activities  and minimize any negative impact  they may have.    The environmental  management system contributes  to legal and regulatory compliance  and to developing management  habits which are respectful of  the environment.  Among those  aimed at the environment, the  management system based  on ISO 14001,  recognized  internationally, is the one which  is most widely used in OHL, with  the first certification dating back  to 1998. OHL has, in addition to  this, EMAS certifications and LEED  registers.  In 2011 the OHL Group  increased the volume indicator  for business certified in ISO  14001, rising from 38% in 2010  to 40% in 2011. This same  increase can be seen in the  firmly introduced systematic  environmental monitoring  indicator (which corresponds to  ISO 14001 systems introduced  without certification or other  environmental control systems),  which rose from 82% in 2010 to  93% in 2011.  The following are noteworthy,  grouped by division:  OHL Concessions as increased  its certified business volume  percentage (9%) with the  certification in ISO 14001 of  the concessionaire Terminal  Martima del Sureste (TMS)  (Alicante, Spain). Environmental  monitoring has grown notably  owing to an increase in control  in the concessionaires in Chile,  Peru, Argentina and Mexico  (Toluca Airport and Los Poetas  Superhighway).   OHL Construction, has  maintained its percentage of  certified business (53% in  2011) with the incorporation  of OHL Pozemn Stavby.  Environmental monitoring has  increased from 90% to 97% as  a result of increased control in  Chile, Mexico, Canada and the  Middle East.   OHL Industrial has increased its  environment-certified business  volume percentage (from 70% to  86%), and that of environmental  monitoring (from 70% to 91%),  justified by the increase in sales  of the certified companies. One  of these companies, Sthim  Maquinaria, has begun to carry  out environmental monitoring  activities.   OHL Developments has  increased its percentage of  business with environmental  monitoring (from 59% to 98%),  also as a result of increased  business volume. In this  division, the international  awards obtained in 2010 and  2011 are noteworthy (Rainforest  Alliance and the World Wide  Fund for Nature (WWF)) detailed  information on which is offered  in this same chapter.  OHL Environment increased the  scope of  ISO 14001 certification  to the activity of seawater and  brackish water desalination.   In the Corporate General Division  mention should be made of  environmental awareness in the  OHL Group General Services,  certified in ISO 14001, which  ensures the environmental  management of the office  buildings in Spain and of the  centralized services (such as  vehicle fleet, travel or telephony). OHL, thanks to the combined effect of the decrease in the number of  vehicles and replacement of less efficient vehicles by more efficient ones,  CO2 emissions into the atmosphere were reduced by nearly 15% This commitment is also  reflected in the annual  participation of the OHL Group  in the Carbon Disclosure Project  (CDP).  In the latest CDP report,   OHL obtained a High rating  and has been included in the  Carbon  Disclosure Leadership  Index group. Moreover, in the  general classification -which  groups together 125 Spanish and  Portuguese companies-, OHL is  the fourth-ranking construction  company, a highly positive  achievement for it in this ranking.  Along this same line of action  marked by the commitment to a  low-carbon economy, mention  must be made of the fleet renewal  project, which came into being  in the wake of the commitment  signed in 2009 with the Pro- Climate Forum , which aims to  renew  a minimum of 6% of the  vehicles, replacing them with  other less polluting vehicles  before the year 2012, and the  incorporation of the first hybrid  vehicles in 2011. OHL has exceeded the planned  objectives, and during the year  replaced 10.35% of its most  polluting vehicles with respect  to 2008. Owing to the combined  effect of vehicle reduction and  replacement of vehicles with  more efficient ones, which  includes the incorporation of three  hybrid vehicles into the fleet,  we estimate a decline of nearly  15% in average CO2 theoretical  emissions by vehicle fleet.    The initiatives aimed at  reducing consumption and  emissions have also resulted in  a decrease in Group employee  business trips, with a nearly 60%  increase taking place in the total  duration of video conferences,  and in a reduction of electricity  consumption per square meter in  OHL Group offices, through the  investments made to improve  the efficiency of the heating,  air-conditioning and hot water  installations.  Lastly, in 2011  the OHL  Group compensated part of its  previous years emissions by  its participation in the Madrid  Compensates project. OHL was  one of the eight companies  volunteering to participate in  this initiative organized by the   Pro-Climate Forum, which seeks  to fight atmospheric pollution  and climate change. Specifically,  through Madrid Compensates,  the OHL Group has collaborated  in planting a total of 10,573  pine trees and holm oak trees  in  Madrid, Spain, which are  expected to compensate 1,765  tons of carbon dioxide over the  next 25 years.  There is another operational  project which the OHL Group  considers a priority and which  is currently in the early stages  of development. This is the  Ecosystem Conservation project.  Its principal objective is to analyze  the ecosystems affected by  the activities of the OHL Group  divisions in various geographical  areas, to define best practices to  prevent pollution, and to protect,  minimize, and restore the affected  ecosystem and compensate any  damage caused.

Likewise, over 400  internal audits were conducted.  Environmental expenditure Environmental expenditure  decreased by 7.29% with respect  to 2010. 1,404,874 euros  (23%) were allocated to the  prevention of contamination and  environmental management,  and  4,631,189. euros (77%)  to waste and de-contamination  management.  Environmental investment In 2011 OHL Group  environmental investment  amounted to 9,126,859 euros,  distributed among the divisions  of Construction, Concessions and  Environment, with Concessions  being the division having the  greatest investment volume  (7,295,289 ). With respect to the year 2010,  the Construction and Concessions  Divisions have performed  the opposite of one another:  there was a sharp decrease  in environmental investment  in the Construction Division,  owing to the decrease in the  Evolution of the environmental expenditure (Euros) 2,000,000 4,000,000 6,000,000 8,000,000 10,000,000 12,000,000 2009 2010 2011 6,036,063 9,844,783 8,677,988 [7] / Moving forward, keeping the environment in mind  121 122 Sustainability Report 2011 The Team In order to attain these goals,  the participation of a committed,  coordinated human team is  essential, which in the case of an  international group such as OHL  takes on a multinational profile. The Quality and Environment  Committee is the maximum  executive organ of the OHL Group  in environmental matters and is  comprised of the maximum heads  of all of the operating divisions  and corporate managements  involved. General coordination of  OHL environmental management  is carried out by the Group Quality  and Environment Corporate  Service, under the Innovation  and Sustainability Management,  which, in turn, reports to the  OHL Group Corporate General  Management and is independent  of the lines of production. The  Quality and Environment Service  is corporate and provides service  in the various countries and  divisions of the Group. Its organization is structured  into two subject axes: quality on  the one hand, and environment  and energy on the other. The  axis of  environment and energy  reinforces the Group commitment  to collaborate in the transition  to a low-carbon economy and in  the recognition of the services  which the ecosystems provide  to business.   On this axis three  areas stand out: energy and  emissions, biodiversity, and  environmental performance,  this last area being related  to the most common type of  environmental management,  which controls the evolution of  waste, consumption, etc.  To complete the organization,  the subject axes are interrelated  with two transversal axes:  management systems and  communication. From Quality and  Environment Corporate Service  the environmental information  from the various divisions and  countries is consolidated in order  to monitor performance and have  information available for decision- making. This function is important,  given the growing volume of  information to be consolidated  and the increased reporting needs  of the Group in environmental  matters: Sustainable Development  Annual Report, publications and  reports for organizations such as  Carbon Disclosure Project or the  Global Compact, among others.  In addition to the Quality  and Environment Service, OHL  has a Group of Quality and  Environment Coordinators made  up of representatives from the  various divisions, which forms the  operational channel to maintain   fluent interrelations between said  Service and the various divisions.  The principal functions of the  Group of Coordinators are related  to the definition and coordination  of strategies and master plans;  environmental training and  awareness; developments and  support of the introduction of  specific management systems  for quality, environment and  energy efficiency; support of the  introduction of integral systems  (EFQM, EMAS, LEED, BREEAM,  etc.); carrying out of internal  audits; updating of regulations on  environmental legal requirements;  monitoring of objectives and  actions for improvement; active  participation in working groups,  publications and congresses; tool  development (greenhouse gas  protocol, control trial monitoring,   etc.) among others.  Likewise, the divisions have  in their business lines important  collaboration from technicians  specialized in environmental  management. These technicians,  in close relation with the division  representative in the Group of  Coordinators, carry out direct  functions or serve as a support  in matters of quality and  environment.    Among the noteworthy  novelties in 2011 with respect to  this organization is, as has been  mentioned, the full integration of  the responsibilities and functions  of OHL Group management  personnel into a new edition of  the Functions and Responsibilities  Manual in regard to environmental  management and the goals  related to a low-carbon economy  which OHL has set for itself. This  Manual is available through the  company intranet.  Furthermore, it must be  pointed out that OHL Concessions  has a new structure related to  environmental management,   given that during the year the  Communication and CSR Service  has been created, which is in  charge of the environmental  management of the division  in coordination with the  concessionaires, as well as  with the OHL Group Quality and  Environment Service. Environmental Training in OHL  In an aim to guarantee adequate compliance with the  environmental commitments of the Group, OHL considers it  fundamental to promote the training and awareness of its  employees in environmental matters. Therefore, the Group  training policy also includes environmental training among its  goals. For this purpose, in addition to carrying out awareness-raising  campaigns and distributing informative materials in printed form  (for instance, practical guides on environmental management)  and  in online form (for instance, programs on climate change in  collaboration with the Environment Foundation), various training  actions catalogued by the Training Service are carried out.  These   actions include distributing the corresponding manuals. During  2011 and continuing in 2012, the Group has sought to promote  training in regard to sustainable construction, LEED certification  and integrated project management.  In addition, as non-catalogue training actions, the Group  Training Service carried out the following training actions in  2011: 5 Practical Cases of Environmental Management - with  a participation of 129 students in 2011 - and Environmental  Awareness Module –having the same number of participants. 2011 2010 2009 No. of training  hours  11,698  14,451 10,847 No. of participants  11,659  2,111 1,200 More information:  CSR management bodies   in the OHL Group number of works, and investment  in environment increased  considerably in the Concessions  Division, as a result of the start-up  of new concessions and adhesion  to environmental programs.

One of the areas  of work of the Environment and  Energy Plan consists in improving  reporting coverage of the OHL  Group divisions. A) Consumption and waste:   Energy consumption The energy balances have  decreased minimally, given that  the decrease in the number of  Construction Division works is  compensated by the operation of  new concessions for roads and  water treatment and desalination  plants,  infrastructures which  entail high energy consumption. Environmental Goals for 2012 Environment and Energy Master Plan Goals for 2012 STRATEGIC TRANSVERSAL PROJECTS   Continue with the introduction and certification of the environmental management systems of the  various companies and work centers comprising the Group.  Revise the training plan in order to adapt it to the divisions and geographical areas and continue with  internal training in regard to sustainable construction, integrated management and risk management.  External communication plan: approval and distribution of materials for informative environmental  communication of the OHL Group. RELATED TRANSVERSAL PROJECTS  Supply chain management: Continue with and consolidate the activities already begun in 2011.  Know-how management: make headway in improving an internal network for exchanging  environmental experience and information.  Institutional alliances: extend the collaboration of the OHL Group with other international  organizations in environmental protection matters.  Incentives: Revise the bases for the Quality and Environment award in order to adapt it to the current  situation of the Group in regard to diversification and internationalization.

This  allows us to offer products and  services which also stand out  for their sustainability, since  we encourage the development  of R&D&I projects which deal  with aspects such as improved  energy efficiency, clean energy  use, minimized greenhouse  gas emissions or biodiversity  protection. The OHL Group maintains a  significant investment effort in  R&D&I, as has been pointed  out in the chapter of this report  entitled Forward-looking  infrastructures. Our goal in this  regard is to foresee customer  demands and needs so that our  customers are always able to find  the solution they require in our  portfolio of products and services.  Sustainability is an attribute  which needs to be increasingly  present in this evolution. We  want our products to stand out  for their technological efficiency  and their ability to preserve social  well-being and the environmental  balance of the surroundings where  they are implemented.  An exemplary initiative of this  way of understanding work in  R&D&I is the Safe, Intelligent  and Sustainable Highway  Operation (OASIS) project.  The OASIS project, selected  by the Center for Industrial  Technological Development  (CDTI) as one of the projects  of its CENIT program, began in  2008 and will finalize during the  first quarter of 2012. This is the  largest Spanish research project  ever developed in the field of  highways, seeking a paradigm of  quality and sustainability in the  highway transport infrastructures  of the future. It aims to reach levels of  sustainability, safety and service  for the user which are much higher  than the current ones, taking into  consideration all of the phases  in the life cycle of a highway:  planning, design, construction,  operation and, lastly,  deconstruction. Also included in  the research are design and the  justification of the technical and  financial mechanisms to ensure  an optimization of the structural  as well as social costs involved.  Within the broad spectrum of  the project research fields are  aspects focused on decreasing  the energy footprint of these  infrastructures and the resulting  reduction of emissions. In order  to achieve this, for the first time  a methodology is being defined  in order to measure the energy  footprint of highways throughout  their complete life cycle, at the  same time proposing measures  to optimize consumptions and  even new forms of producing  alternative energy in the area  surrounding the roads. Furthermore, more efficient  mobility management using  latest generation smart traffic  management will make it  possible to reduce CO2 emissions  considerably. OASIS is co-headed by  OHL Concessions with the  participation of a total of  16  Spanish companies, of which  9 are large companies and  7 are small and medium- size companies, and also 16  research groups belonging  to several of Spains most  prestigious universities and  technology centers in this  sector.  Total investment in  OASIS has amounted to over  30 million euros, of which more  than 13 million are contributed  by the CDTI. Together with OASIS, many  of the OHL Group R&D&I  projects underway in 2011  make important contributions in  terms of biodiversity protection,  reduced consumption of energy  and materials and reduced  waste generation. The following  table details these initiatives,  highlighting their principal  contributions to environmental  protection in each case.

The positive results from the  start-up of important  projects   for the ecological restoration  of areas affected by transport  infrastructures, as in the case of   OASIS or ROADA, as well as the  research work carried out for their  development, have made OHL  an internationally valued expert  in the matter. This has allowed  the company to participate in  the publication of numerous  articles in international scientific  journals (Ecological Engineering,  Restoration Ecology, Journal of  Vegetation Science and Land  Degradation & Development)  alongside university research  teams. Moreover,  OHL has  participated in the edition of  the book Ecological Restoration  of Areas Affected by Transport  Infrastructures. Scientific Bases  for Technical Solutions, based  on the EXPERTAL  project of the  Biodiversity Foundation (Spanish  Ministry of Environment and  Rural and Marine Affairs) in  collaboration with the Spanish  High Council for Scientific  Research and King Juan Carlos  University, which provides some  of the key matters to take into  account when seeking to design,  execute and maintain these  types of infrastructures in a more  sustainable manner.    Lastly, in 2011, OHL, together  with the rest of the large  European companies forming the  European Network of Construction  Companies for Research and  Development (ENCORD), ratified  the Declaration on Sustainable  Development for the Construction  Sector drafted at the beginning  of the same year. As an active  Network member, OHL was  one of the principal companies  to promote the initiative, and  consequently advance towards  a more sustainable world from  R&D&I approaches with the  participation of the construction  sector. During the act held at the  Krller-Mller Museum in Holland,  the ENCORD members made  an express declaration of their  commitment, in which R&D&I  policies play a fundamental role  as they make a maximum effort to  introduce sustainability into their  business.  More information:  ENCORD Sustainable  Development Charter  Sharing our Efforts and  Progress in Protecting the  Environment Environmental protection is  a collective challenge requiring  the greatest possible joining of  efforts. Consequently,  in OHL  we go beyond environmental  management and actively  collaborate in alliances and  projects allowing us to contribute  to an important change in the  way in which we companies  manage the services which  nature offers us and minimize  the effect our activities have on  the surroundings. We wish to  share our achievements and all  that weve learned so that our  stakeholders can come to know  the challenges we face, at the  same time that we collaborate  with other organizations to  become even better. Among the priorities set out  in the OHL Group Environment  and Energy Master Plan is that of  environmental communication,  both internal and external. The  aim is to increase the knowledge  of our stakeholders  -and  especially of our customers - of  the environmental progress  and challenges of the company,  and of the activities carried out  by the Group in this area. As  was seen earlier in the section  Complying from Management  with Environmental Commitments,  in order to keep the flow of  information up to date, the  Plan has established the  need to develop an external  communication plan, and  likewise to design and implement  environmental communication  tools which will serve this  purpose. The Group is currently  working on this goal.

For  years the Group has had important  connections with organizations  which are a reference in  promoting sustainability and  business management which  acts responsibly in regard to  nature. Among these are the  Carbon Disclosure Project, the  United Nations Global Compact,  the Global  Reporting Initiative  or the Conama Foundation in  Spain. In 2011 it has developed  collaboration especially with the  Environment Foundation–BCSD  Spain, the Madrid Pro-Climate  Forum and the  Low-Carbon  Tourism Initiative in Quintana Roo  (Mexico) where OHL collaborates  with the World Wide Fund for  Nature (WWF).  The OHL Group is a member  of the Environment Foundation– BCSD Spain since 2008,  participating in working groups  on Energy and Climate Change,  Sustainable Construction and  Ecosystems, the first two groups  of which have carried out  important activity during 2011. On the one hand, the working  group on Energy and Climate  Change aims to contribute to the  generation of the knowledge and  training necessary for companies  and their stakeholders to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions. The  activity of the group and of the  Foundation in this area during  2011 has been important;  however, the participation of the  OHL Group in the initiative Action  CO2 merits mention apart.    Since 2009 OHL has formed  part of the initiative Action CO2.  The companies adhered to this  program share experiences and  solutions to improve the energy  behavior of the buildings where  they operate. The joint reduction  figure amounted to 50,000 tons  of CO2 during the 2008–2010  period, which was achieved by  introducing a series of mitigation  measures in areas of their  activity not clearly linked to the  production process.  Another fundamental  aspect of the program is the  communication and training of  employees in order that they  may learn how to improve their  environmental behavior in their  daily life. With this aim in mind,  an informative online program  has been in operation since  2008, within the context of the  Action CO2 initiative which seeks  to promote training, awareness- raising, and contribution to the  fight against climate change  for Group personnel and those  closest to them. In 2010, along  these same lines, the CO2  Calculator initiative came into  being, a tool which makes it  possible to calculate the carbon  footprint of daily activities or to  compensate emissions, among  other options.  Already in 2010,  there were 239 persons related  to OHL who were able to reduce  their emissions thanks to this  initiative, which, according to  the Environment Foundation,  has resulted in the prevention of  231 t of CO2, and in 39,327 in  energy saving.  In 2011 the program Action  CO2 Suppliers was also started up,  an initiative created to seek out,  together with the supply chain,  joint opportunities for reducing  emissions. For this purpose an  informative campaign was started  to help participating companies  learn to calculate and reduce the  carbon footprint of their activities  and products in the supply chain.  OHL has begun its participation  with a selection of strategic  suppliers (concrete, aggregates,  cement, asphalt mixes, ceramic  materials and movement of earth)  with which it will work during the  coming years in a variety of areas:  climate change, mobility, ICT,  lighting, air-conditioning , waste,  water and paper. On its part, the Sustainable  Construction working group  is  focused on promoting energy  efficiency in construction and,  in 2011, worked especially to  favor the design of buildings  having  high energy efficiency,  to obtain a propitious regulatory  framework, and to disseminate  among professionals of the sector  new materials and construction  techniques which collaborate in  the sustainability of the building. These goals were made  manifest primarily in the start-up  of ATECOS (Technical Assistance  for Sustainable Construction).  OHL is one of the organizations  which has sponsored this web  platform aimed at building sector  professionals and considered  to be the first freely accessible  tool offering practical, integral  information on the approach  to take with new construction  and rehabilitation projects  which incorporate the concept  of sustainability throughout the  entire life cycle of the building.   Moreover, in 2011 the Group  also actively participated in  the seminar  Real Solutions for  Sustainable Building Commitments Taken on by OHL  with the Madrid Pro-Climate Forum  in 2011 1. Renew a minimum of 6% of  the vehicles in its company fleet,  replacing them with other less  polluting vehicles before 2012.. 2.

Develop a policy for  contracting wood and other  forestry products to include the  following measures:  Review  proposals for certified  wood products from  suppliers.  Prioritize forestry certification  as a valuation criterion for  purchasing.  Engage in activities which reveal  the sustainable purchasing  policy of the company through  training and awareness- raising of company suppliers,  customers and workers.. 4. Implement measures for  energy saving and efficiency  including informative and  awareness-raising actions.  5. Draft an Energy Saving Plan  for buildings or plants 6. Prioritize, whenever  possible, when purchasing  equipment and products from  third parties, those proposals  which provide for devices having  the greatest energy efficiency. The Madrid Pro-Climate  Forum is an initiative seeking  leadership and combined  efforts to fight atmospheric  contamination, and OHL has  been a member ever since the  Forum was set up in 2009. In  the context of this permanent  work, in 2011 the OHL Group  signed a number of important  commitments, with the OHL  Group Organization and General  Services Management and the  Construction Division Purchases  area,  in collaboration with the  Quality and Environment Service,  these being the teams most  involved in overseeing compliance  with said commitments. These  commitments are in response to  the two lines of action defined by  the Forum for all of its members:  the sustainable contracting  of forestry products and the  implementation of business  strategies to facilitate energy  efficiency.  In 2011 OHL adhered  voluntarily to the Madrid  Compensates project, an initiative  related to the Madrid Pro-Climate  Forum, to compensate greenhouse  gas emissions voluntarily, by  planting trees in several areas of  Spains capital city. The Group compensated 116  tons of CO2 equivalent generated  during 2010 by the activity carried  out in its offices located in Madrid.  Based on the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change (IPPC)   methodology, this compensation  will take place over a 25-year  time horizon by the planting of  holm oak trees, stone pines and  Aleppo pines. The Madrid Town  Hall itself will plant and maintain  these species characteristic of the  Mediterranean region and areas  set aside for this. Also noteworthy is the  participation of OHL in the Low- Carbon Tourism Initiative in  Quintana de Roo (Mexico), which  during 2011 made significant  headway in its initial phase,  holding encounters with experts  in environmental matters and  tourism management.  In September of last year the  results obtained so far were  made public, among which is  noteworthy the Diagnostic  Workshop for analyzing the  actions carried out at the local,  national and international  level in regard to low-carbon  development, consequently  making it possible to progress in  establishing common strategies.  Also especially relevant is the  start-up of the Greenhouse Gas  Inventory which, in coordination  In Favor of Low-Carbon Tourism The Davos Declaration, signed in 2007, states the need for the involvement of the tourism sector  in the fight against climate change, establishing the following commitments to be taken on by the  companies in said sector:  Mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions, especially those resulting from transport and  accommodation activities.  Adapt companies and tourism destinations to the change in climate conditions.  Apply the techniques required to improve efficiency in energy use.  Obtain financial resources to help poor regions and countries. This is the context which gave rise to the Low-Carbon Tourism Initiative in Quintana Roo, Mexico,  having as its priority the organization of greenhouse gas measurement and the fight to counter  greenhouse gas effects through environmental best practices by the participating companies.  Promoted by the World  Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), this initiative is actively participated in by  the OHL Group, through the Mayakoba hotel complex and numerous entities related to tourism in the  Mexican Riviera Maya. with the General Secretariat of  Ecology and Environment of the  Government of Quintana Roo,  and with the support of  WWF,  promotes the creation of a  sufficiently solid technical base  to establish new strategies for  reducing contaminating gases  within the framework of the State  Program for Action against Climate  Change (PEACC) in Mexico.  As a goal for 2012, the OHL  Group, within its Environment and  Energy Plan, intends to strengthen  its alliance with the World Wide  Fund for Nature (WWF) in order to  continue working for low-carbon  tourism and, in this way, take  maximum advantage of its current  role as leader within the project.  OHL has become a company of reference in the  commitment to a low-carbon economy The strong commitment of OHL to a low-carbon economy  has led the Group to hold an outstanding position in this area.   In accordance with the rating of the Carbon Disclosure Project  (CDP), an independent non-profit organization which analyzes  the climate change information of approximately   6,000 of the  worlds leading companies, OHL has obtained a High rating,  coming to form part of the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index  group, and ranks as the fourth leading construction company in  the general classification which groups together 125 Spanish  and Portuguese companies.  Moreover, it must be taken into  account that OHL has improved its Carbon Disclosure rating  by over 10 points, and has gone from level C to level B in the  Carbon Performance category. OHL is in 2nd place in regard to total emissions reduction  (scope 1+2) with respect to the previous years emissions.

Viva Sade focuses on the verification of  the health condition of the members of this  group, together with the detection of factors of  predisposition to disease and the determination  of other elements of risk that could cause  accidents, thereby helping to improve the quality  of life of this sector whose working life transpires  on the roads, and contributing to the reduction of  accident rates.      Implemented in the four concession companies  of the So Paulo toll road network and with a pilot  experience in a federal network company, in 2011  the program included 11 campaigns benefiting  4,719 truck drivers. During 2011, a pilot project was carried out at  Autopista Ferno Dias in the federal network, for  the purpose of evaluating the demand. As a result  of the success obtained, the introduction of the  program in all five of the toll roads of the network  was set as a target for 2012.   [8] Contributing to wealth and  to social wellbeing Support to underprivileged  social groups and/or groups  at risk of exclusion or the  development of depressed  communities are ambitious  challenges in any country and  must be addressed from different  areas, through the involvement  of all of the relevant players  connected with the territory.  Companies can be considered  as one of the players who today  are in a position to make a  more significant impact on the  improvement of the quality of life  of the people living in the areas  where they operate. OHL takes  up this challenge and works to  develop policies of support to  the community from within the  framework provided by its CSR  strategy. Accordingly, during 2011,  the Group earmarked more than  seven million euros to activities  of general interest, maintaining  its commitment to society  through the implementation  of a range of initiatives, whose  primary beneficiaries have been  the communities shaping the  environment in which the Group  carries out its business activities.  In this context, OHL strives to  obtain a thorough knowledge of  the social reality of its immediate  environment and to analyze the  primary needs in the areas of  education, health and economic  and social development, at the  same time as it forges bonds  of cooperation with community  organizations in each territory. Spain was the first country  where activities of this kind were  initiated within the Group, which  later have been progressively  extended to and consolidated in  other countries, hand-in-hand  with the process of the OHL  Groups international expansion.  The initiatives of support to the  community promoted in Spain  are managed by the Community  Involvement Area, under the  Corporate HR Management.  The reality of many of the communities in which OHL operates invites us to set up community involvement  programs that contribute to the generation of wealth and social wellbeing for their inhabitants. For this purpose,  in the framework of our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy, we strive to create scenarios of mutual  understanding, responsibility and respect. The Accessibility Classroom project: pioneering  initiative in Spain in terms of accessibility The Juan-Miguel Villar Mir Foundation, in  collaboration with the Fundacin Laboral de la  Construccin (Construction Workers Foundation)  and the Konecta Foundation, has created the  Accessibility Classroom project, an initiative  promoted adopting the slogan of Building an  environment for everyone, with the mission of  conveying specialized knowledge in the area  of universal accessibility to professionals in  different fields throughout Spain, starting with  the Community of Madrid. The OHL Group has  participated in this unique initiative. The Accessibility Classroom has arisen from  the social commitment assumed by the three  promoter foundations in order to improve the  quality of life of people with physical, sensory  and intellectual disabilities.  It was created with  the mission of raising awareness, training and  providing consultancy to certain groups –persons  in managerial positions in companies, students  and town council technicians- with the capacity to  influence the improvement of built environments,  products and services, from the point of view of  universal accessibility and design for everyone.   Another important focal point  of activity is Latin America, where  the OHL Concessions division  is carrying out community  involvement initiatives in the  framework of its CSR Master Plan  in countries such as Argentina,  Brazil, Chile, Mexico or Peru,  through an interconnected  structure linking the various  companies, enabling them to  take advantage of the synergies  achieved. Also, OHL Construction carries  out its programs in the Czech  Republic and the United States,  primarily. Taken overall, these  individual concentrations of  action shape a global network  that gives meaning to the strategic  guidelines established in the  Community Involvement Master  Plan, designed for the companies  of the Group as a whole.  139 140 Sustainability Report 2011 The OHL Groups Community  Involvement Master Plan was  created in 2008 as the foundation  for supporting the global  architecture of the activities  undertaken in the social sphere  and, in December 2011, was  updated through a revision  approved by the Sustainability  Committee. Moreover, during the last  meeting of the Sustainability  Committee in December 2011,  the report on the conclusion  of the Three-Year Community  Involvement Plan 2008-2011  for Spain was also presented,  showing excellent results.  Following an assessment,  approval was given to the new  document specifying the targets  to be attained between 2012  and 2015. All of the new aspects  introduced in the forthcoming  Three-Year Plan are described  in the section on A community  involvement in close proximity to  the local reality included in this  chapter. The updating of the Groups  Community Involvement Master  Plan has served to establish three  new focal points for the Groups  community involvement policies,  which are set out below:  Promotion and monitoring of  a range of community involvement  plans either by business lines or  by countries where the Group has  a permanent presence. A community involvement in  close proximity to the local  reality The commitment of the Group  is to establish and develop  community involvement plans  in the various business lines  and in the countries where it  has a permanent presence. We  are convinced that, in this way,  through the establishment of  strategies and specific targets in  each location, we are closer to  achieving a real impact with the  activities we undertake. Through its Community  Involvement Master Plan, the  Group offers the guidelines  of action necessary for its  companies to be able to create  their own action plans and  thereby facilitate a response  adapted to the different local  realities.  Accordingly, during 2011, and  under its Three-Year Community  Involvement Plan 2008-2011, the  OHL Group in Spain continued  to further its accessibility plan,  in the framework of which it  cooperated in the development  of the Accessibility Classroom  project for raising social  awareness and providing training  on the subject of universal  accessibility and of design for  everyone. Moreover, during  the past financial year, training  activities on the subject of  accessibility were organized for  the team responsible for OHLs  website applications. With respect to the issue of the  social and workforce integration  of people with disabilities and/ or at risk of social exclusion, and  thanks to its collaboration with  organizations such as the Integra,  Adecco and the Madrid Down  Syndrome Foundations, the Group  was successful in the search for  and selection of candidates with  particular difficulties in order  to integrate them into the OHL  Groups workforce in Spain, in  which process the effort in the  area of Facilities Management  (Ingesan) stands out. As a result,  12 people with a disability of  some kind and/or at risk of social  exclusion were hired during 2011,  whereby, at the present time,  2% of the employees comprising  the total workforce of the  Spanish companies of the Group  employing more than 50 workers  have a disability of some kind. The  proposal for 2012 is to engage 13  more employees with disabilities  or at risk of social exclusion. In  addition, the Group succeeded  in doubling the amount of the  purchases of goods and services  from Special Employment Centers  (CEE) in 2011.  Also in 2011, OHL Concessions  implemented its own CSR  Framework Plan 2011-2013,  which defines, in addition to  targets and strategies, the lines  of action to be followed by the  concession companies in the  countries where it operates. The  division assumes its Corporate  Social Responsibility as part of a  business management model.  The commitment to local  and regional development is  evidenced in specific initiatives  that are planned and carried  out in the framework of the OHL  Groups CSR Master Plan and the  international obligations acquired,  adapting the divisions actions to  the particular characteristics of  the transportation infrastructure  concession business line and its  stakeholders. [8] / Contributing to wealth and to social wellbeing  Active promotion of  corporate volunteering and of the  involvement of the employees in  this field.  Establishment and  development of channels of  communication and dialog with  the communities in which the  Group is present as well as with  local NGOs. These three focal points  coincide to a large extent with  the priorities set in the Groups   CSR Master Plan within the  scope of relations with the  community. More information  on our performance and goals  in corporate volunteering can  be found in the chapter of this  Report entitled A  shared culture  as, to a large extent, at OHL we  understand volunteering as a tool  at the service of the cohesion of  our corporate culture.  Lines of work of the ohl  group  in relation to its  community involvement  A community involvement in  close proximity to the local reality  Getting to know the  communities  7,367,472 euros earmarked for activities of general interest in 2011 	 	26.2%	for	community	involvement	activities 	 	73.8%	patronage	and	sponsorship	activities	 Conclusion of the Three-Year Community Involvement Plan  2009-2011 for Spain Main achievements During this period, the OHL Group in Spain developed an internal  project for improving accessibility to the information provided to the  companys stakeholders and participated in two external physical  and technological accessibility projects. In the context of corporate  volunteering, it designed and launched the OHL Volunteers website,  organized two in-house day-long awareness meetings for HR managers,  initiated 21 corporate volunteering activities (with close to 1,000  participants) and incorporated the employees of OHL Industrial into  the Groups  volunteering activities. In collaboration with the HR area,  the implementation of the Plan led to the hiring of 32 people with  disabilities and/or at risk of social exclusion by Group in Spain. Thanks to this positive outcome, the Group was invited to participate in  a number of external forums on community involvement, volunteering  and the workforce integration of people with disabilities in Spain.  Moreover, in recognition of its efforts, the Group obtained three awards  for its work in the field of community involvement, granted by the  Adecco Foundation, the Integra Foundation and the Foro de Debate  Ciudadano (Citizens Debate Forum).  Sponsor an Indigenous Child  project, Mexico. Our work in community  involvement leads us to carry  out this activity on the basis of  strategic proposals linked to  our business activities, mainly  through the two lines of work  described below.  141 142 Sustainability Report 2011 Consequently, each country  seeks to adapt the targets of the  Framework Plan to its own reality.  Outstanding in this context is  the work carried out by countries  such as Brazil, which has a Three- Year Community involvement  Plan 2011-2013 of its own  and which, in 2011, set as its  targets the strengthening of the  programs in progress, an increase  in its scopes of action and the  positioning of OHL Brasil and  its subsidiaries in a prominent  place within the framework  of sustainable business  management. Significant steps  in order to attain these targets  included the representations  made for the  creation of several  working groups with objectives  such as the membership of the  Brazilian division in the business  network for sustainability,  Ethos, a goal that was finally  achieved in 2011. Moreover,  the design and planning of two  new community involvement  programs commenced during  the year: the program for the  workforce integration of people  with disabilities and the corporate  volunteering program. Furthermore, as an element  of the program-strengthening  strategy included in the three-year  plan in the area of road safety and  environmental education, 45 new  schools were added during 2011,  bringing the total to 241 schools  attended to under the program,  providing training to 32,268  students and 655 teachers. The  process for the enrichment of  the educational content offered  has continued at the pace  established, taking advantage of  the  synergies between the Projeto  Escola for road safety education  and the Viva Meio Ambiente  environmental program, as is  also the case with the process of  consolidation of contents between  the two programs.  Both of these  processes are included in the  targets set for 2012.  In 2011, Projeto Escola  completed a decade of excellence  in providing road safety education  to the schools located in the area  of   influence of the toll roads  managed by the concession  companies of the State of So  Paulos highway network.  Since  its creation in 2001, a total of  449 schools belonging to 48  municipalities have participated  in the project, and 310,528  students and 14,240 teachers  have benefited from the program.  In the framework of this initiative,  a proposal was made in 2011  for acquiring teaching materials  adapted to sign language for  the inclusion in the programs of  children with hearing disabilities. The Viva Meio Ambiente  program carries out a range  of educational projects on a  continuous basis, within the  school environment and as an  extracurricular activity, for the  purpose of promoting a culture  and appropriate habits that  will contribute to the protection  of the environment and the  and coordination with a range of  players and institutions under co- responsibility schemes. In Mexico, during the past  year, OHL Concessions addressed  the expansion of its community  involvement programs and  continued with the development  of the commitments acquired  with the public administration  for minimizing the environmental  impacts of the transportation  infrastructures under construction. Within the framework of its  commitment to road safety  and traffic education, OHL  Mxico organized the Conductor  responsible (Responsible Driver)  campaigns on three toll roads in  operation and has worked on the  structuring of a teaching proposal  for traffic education geared to the  primary school level, Educando  y Caminando (Educating and  Walking), to be offered in 2012 by  the teaching staff of the schools  joining the program. The program  will undertake a pilot project  during the coming school year  2012–2013. improvement of the quality of life  of the population residing in the  area of direct influence of the five  toll roads managed in the federal  network. In 2011, the program  worked with 86 schools, training  2,169 teachers and educating  32,844 children.  In addition, OHL Brasil organizes  the Campaas Viva program,  geared to pedestrians, cyclists,  motorcycle riders and motorists for  the purpose of promoting actions  oriented towards road education  and safety for all of the users of  the toll roads, thereby minimizing  the risk of traffic accidents. During  2011, sixty campaigns were carried  out, directly benefiting 11,148  road users.  Finally, we should mention that  the Viva Sade program continues  to be the main project undertaken  by OHL Concesiones in Brazil with  respect to health. Through this  initiative, medical examinations are  provided together with other actions  intended to improve the quality of  life and to monitor the health of  the truck drivers who use the roads  managed by the company. During  2011, eleven campaigns were  organized to the benefit of close to  5,000 truck drivers. With respect to Chile, whose  community involvement projects  are focused on the areas of road  safety education and health, 2011  has signified the strengthening  of the Proyecto Escuela through a  number of strategies, such as the  enrichment of educational content  Community Involvement Plan for Spain Strategy 2012-2015 The Community Involvement Plan for OHL in Spain was updated in 2011. The guidelines established for this  new three-year period stem from a firm wager on the continuity of the projects concerned with disabilities  (accessibility, social and workforce integration) and cooperation with entities with which OHL has been working  for some time. The alliances with organizations of this kind are one of the key tools of the Groups community  involvement strategy in Spain, considering the extensive experience of these entities in the performance of social  initiatives and their knowledge of the realities of the immediate environment. Moreover, another objective proposed is to make Spain the cohesive force of the actions undertaken in corporate  volunteering with respect to other countries where OHL has a stable presence, by giving impetus from Spain to  the creation of volunteer groups in other countries. The generation of an interconnected network, through the  improvement of the existing internal channels of communication, will facilitate the exchange of experiences  among the volunteers of the organizations forming the network, thereby endowing the organization with  invaluable know-how, with the ambition of becoming a benchmark of corporate volunteering. The Volunteers  website plays an essential role in this framework, as it is the primary platform of connection among the members  of the network of volunteers worldwide. Finally, the Group has also decided to work on the improvement of the channels of communication and  dialog with the company in Spain as a strategic target for this period, with particular emphasis on dialog with  foundations, local entities and NGOs. Road safety education in Brazil: the  success of Projeto Escola   17% fewer accidents with children (aged 1 to 5)  injured or deceased on the toll roads managed by  OHL  60% fewer accidents with adolescents injured  or deceased (aged 11 to 14)  22% fewer young people (aged 15 to 17)  injured or deceased The program Viva meio ambiente,  OHL Brasil, develops initiatives for  preservation of nature, especially in  schools.

Since  the early days of cooperation  with the Foundation in 2002,  these programs have saved the  equivalent of 529 trees.   In Peru, visits to archeological  sites and educational talks  commenced at two landmark  schools in the city of Casma,  which have led to the organization  of three educational projects to  be carried out within the area of  influence of Autopista del Norte:   School Archeology Club for  the promotion of cultural  identity and the performance  of research work and the  dissemination of information  on local archeological sites with  the supervision and guidance  of Autopista del Nortes team of  archeologists.  Environmental Counselors Club  through which the company  intends to promote eco- efficiency practices, waste  management and recycling in  schools, together with clean-up  and environmental education  campaigns with the community.  School Road Safety Counselors  Club through which road  safety practices were carried  out, fostering a culture of  safety in order to promote the  development of values, skills  and responsible and safe  conducts.   These three educational  projects have benefited 300  students between 13 and 16  In Argentina, OHL Concessions  also focused on road safety  education, in view of the fact  that 22 people lose their lives  in automobile accidents daily in  the country, and 10,000 suffer  injuries that leave some degree of  disability as a sequela. In the face  of this reality, Autopista Ezeiza- Cauelas continued to implement  the Teaching our children project  during 2011 in collaboration with  the Argentine Federal Police and a  number of educational centers, by  organizing talks and educational  activities for children in  kindergarten and primary school.  In 2011, a total of 10 schools and  5,000 children benefited from  years of age and have trained  45 teachers in the two schools.  The main target for 2012 is the  extension of the three programs to  5 more schools. In the case of OHL  Construction, the division is  involved in community support  projects in the United States  and in the Czech Republic. In  the United States, during 2011,  the division cooperated with  a number of institutions in the  improvement of the quality of  life of underprivileged social  groups through a range of actions,  among which we can highlight  the charity races organized in  conjunction with the Red Cross,  the organization of Paint Day  for the improvement of the  homes of persons belonging  to groups at risk of exclusion  and the distribution of food  on Thanksgiving Day. In the  this project. Starting in 2012, the  educational talks will become  consolidated as a program called  Conito en la ciudad which,  based on a character named  Conito, created as a symbol of the  campaign, will seek to interrelate  knowledge and values and to  transform them into responsible  driving conducts. Finally, in terms of the  environment, the company  has been cooperating with  the Garrahan Foundation in  programs for recycling paper,  since 2002, and plastic bottle  caps, since 2008, obtaining  financial resources to support  the integrated development of  The subsidiaries of the OHL Group have allocated nearly two million euros  to social action, carrying out initiatives tailored to local realities in which  they operate Outstanding initiative: Proyecto Escuela, Chile  Inspired by its Brazilian counterpart, Chiles Proyecto Escuela is an  educational program with high impact within the scope of road safety  that seeks to promote changes in behavior in the medium and long  term, in order to prevent accidents, by interrelating values linked to care  and respect for life.  During the 2011 financial year, work in the framework of the program  centered on the improvement of course content and on cooperation  with a range of players and institutions. Last year a total of 24,042  school children benefited from the program, and 1,303 teachers from  the 1st to 8th grades of primary education received training. Furthermore, 2011 was the year of the inclusion in the program of  special education schools that attend to children with disabilities.  A cooperation arrangement was also established with the transit  authority, Corporacin Nacional de Seguridad de Trnsito (CONASET),  for the evaluation and measurement of results in the control group,  as well as with the Carabineros of Chile, who participated by offering  educational talks in the schools and by taking the children to puppet  shows with road safety themes.  Finally, in the course of the year, the  company succeeded in obtaining the participation of the education  corporations of the municipalities involved in the program, together  with the monitoring of the progress of the educational program over  the school year by means of ongoing contact with the schools through  the Internet and the incorporation of educational talks for parents and  guardians for the purpose of accompanying and reinforcing the content  learned at school. Czech Republic, the division  has cooperated with childrens  hospitals in the purchase of  medical devices and furnishings,  as well as with organizations that  work with people with disabilities,  by facilitating their transportation.  Finally, OHL Developments also  undertakes actions in support  and for the improvement of the  quality of life of the communities  with which it is related. Significant  examples include the divisions  cooperation with the local  Mayan communities in their  socioeconomic development  and the granting of the use of  premises in shopping centers to  nonprofit organizations, among  others.

[8] / Contributing to wealth and to social wellbeing  145 146 Sustainability Report 2011 Getting to know the  communities  At OHL we strive to get to  know and to keep in mind  the social and environmental  specificities of each community.  This provides us with valuable  information for the performance  of our business activities, as well  as for the development of the  community involvement policies  that we implement, by keeping  us connected with the reality of  our immediate environment. For  this reason, during the year, we  continued to work on the ongoing  improvement of the channels  of communication, dialog and  interaction with society. The OHL Group works  actively to put into place and  maintain a range of active  channels of contact with all of  its stakeholders in the context  of community involvement. All  of the information obtained  through these channels enables  the Group to acquire a global  vision and to adapt the design  of its policies of action in  the community accordingly.  Therefore, the maintaining of the  quality and proper operation of  the channels of communication  and dialog established is of  vital importance from a strategic  point of view, as well as from  the perspective of the effective  implementation of the range  of projects of support to the  community. In Spain, one of the priority  targets of the new Community  Involvement Plan 2012-2015 is  the improvement of the channels  of communication and dialog  with the company, by means of  an increased OHL presence in  the social networks and Internet  forums, interaction on the  Volunteers specific website or  through consultations with local  entities and NGOs. The ongoing contact with  stakeholders from the community  involvement point of view also calls  for basic and continuing processes  integrated into the day-to-day  of those who work in the Group,  as is the case with the meetings  for monitoring the community  involvement projects with the  presence of the Community  Involvement Area and frequent  contact by telephone and e-mail. Other media used by the  Group in Spain for its interaction  with society are the Mosaico  magazine and vehicles such  as the Community Involvement  and Sponsorship section on the  corporate website, OHLFINET, the  community involvement mailbox  (accion.social@ohl.es) or the OHL  Volunteers website (voluntarios. grupoohl.com). The upgrading of  the last medium mentioned has  become one of the primary targets  for 2012, together with OHLs  presence in the social networks  (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) and  the determination to connect with  new audiences, access those places  out of reach of the routine media  and receive direct and immediate  feedback from stakeholders in the  form of suggestions, complaints  and opinions. Corporate Volunteering An OHL priority As mentioned previously, corporate volunteering has become a priority line of action within the Community Involvement  Master Plan renewed in 2011. From the perspective of human resource management, this is an indispensable tool for  the cohesion of OHLs corporate culture, and the Group understands and addresses the volunteering initiatives to a large  extent from this point of view. This strategic vision is described in greater detail in the chapter on A shared culture in this  document. Corporate Volunteering of the Group is focused largely at the service of community involvement and the generation of a  positive social impact on communities and many of the community involvement actions described up to this point also  included participation by the employees of companies of the Group.

The satisfaction surveys  made at the end of each of the  volunteering initiatives carried  out also provide valuable  information and are an important  channel of communication for  the company. The results of  the last survey reveal a level  of satisfaction of 9.25 over 10,  demonstrating the success of the  volunteering actions in Spain. As mentioned earlier in  previous chapters of this Report,  an OHL stakeholder survey  initiative was undertaken at  the end of 2010. Among the  groups of stakeholders, it was  decided to involve the heads  of the foundations and social  benefit organizations with which  the Group collaborates on a  regular basis in the framework  of its community involvement  policies. In this way, OHL was  able to identify the most relevant  concerns of the entities dedicated  to social issues in relation to the  companys CSR policy, as well  as to obtain an evaluation of the  channels of communication that  the Group maintains with this  stakeholder group. In this regard, we should  note that both the effectiveness  as well as the frequency of the  communication maintained  between OHL and these entities  were given, in general, a positive  assessment. Insofar as the  most relevant issues for the  organizations surveyed, these  can be observed on the table set  out below.   Following the completion of this  survey, and in view of the range  of proposals for action compiled  during the process, OHL decided  to set as a target for 2012 the  creation of a committee made up  by nonprofit organizations that  will work with OHL on a regular  basis, contributing opinions and  guidance on the management  of the Groups relations with the  community.  [8] / Contributing to wealth and to social wellbeing  147 148 Sustainability Report 2011 However, the survey was not  carried out solely with respect to  community involvement entities  in Spain, but also encompassed  organizations connected with  OHL Mxico and OHL Brasil.  The relevant concerns raised by  these organizations are shown  on the table included here. In this  way, through the replies of the  representatives of foundations and  social benefit organizations in each  country, the difference between the  priorities of the Spanish context on  the one hand, and the Brazilian and  Mexican contexts on the other, are  evident, thereby demonstrating the  need to establish different strategies  and perspectives for the policies of  support to the community, as is the  practice at OHL.  Beyond the results of the survey,  there are other significant efforts  by the Group in its determination  to become familiar with and  understand the different social and  environmental specificities of the  communities in which it operates.  In this context, we can highlight the  existence of initiatives of dialog that  assess environmental and social  impacts prior to the performance  of construction projects and are  managed by OHLs Environment  and Quality Service.  In the case of OHL Concesiones  in Mexico and Brazil, the contractual  dimension of the project and the  needs for the implementation of  social and environmental projects  are analyzed for the purpose of  taking the measures required.  This effort always includes the  involvement of the divisions  Corporate Social Responsibility  team, which facilitates decision- making in line with the guidelines  established in its Framework Plan.  Moreover, at the headquarters  in Mexico, an analysis has been  made of the context in which the  companys infrastructures operate,  in order to determine the main lines  of action of its future Community  Involvement Plan. In the meantime,  mention should be made of the  resources invested during 2011 in  the building of structures designed  to lessen the social impact of the  expressway, Va Rpida Poetas.  This contract included clauses  requiring the company awarded the  project to invest resources in the  conditioning of public spaces, the  upgrading of community facilities  and the construction of urban  infrastructures. OHL earmarked  10 million euros during 2011 to  compliance with these clauses,  thereby introducing improvements  with a direct impact on the daily life  of the community affected by the  construction project. Also significant was the Map  of Social Players in the districts  of  Huarmey, Culebras, Casma  and Comandante Noel drawn  up by OHL sucursal Per during  the past year for the purpose of  maintaining a relationship of  communication, commitment and  active participation. Likewise in  2011, a mechanism for submitting  queries and complaints was  introduced, both on an internal  level with respect to the workers  on the construction site, as well  as for the neighboring community.  The latter mechanism is managed  through the PACRI Program of  Perus Ministry of Transportation  and Communications.  For more information on the  channels of communication  specific to each country, such  as publications, etc., please  consult the Group channels of  communication and dialog chart. Relevant issues identified by the social benefit organizations  surveyed by the Group Spain Mexico and Brazil Occupational Risk Prevention  Environmental management  Investment in R&D&I Equal opportunities Community involvement Management of environmental  impacts  Climate change: GHG emissions Biodiversity conservation  programs The OHL Groups Good  Neighbor Code  The OHL Groups Good  Neighbor Code contains a set  of standards of behavior and  actions on construction sites,  seeking to achieve a friendlier,  more responsible and more  respectful integration of the  work into the neighborhood and  into the lives of its residents.  This initiative enables direct  communication by the company  with its closest environments  and, during 2011, seven new  construction projects joined  the Code, bringing the total to  64 since the Service Quality  and Environment launched this  initiative in 2004. Thanks to all of the measures  contained in the Good Neighbor  Code, the quality of life of the  residents in the vicinity of  construction work is improved.  Moreover, the Code stimulates  excellence, consisting of  going beyond the offsetting  measures, that is, those that  solely seek to have the work  move along unnoticed. In  this way, the construction  process itself, and not only the  finished product, contributes  to effectively improving the  immediate environment, an  outcome achieved by encouraging  community leaders to exploit the  possibilities in terms of education,  solidarity and generation of  wealth that the construction  work can offer the community  accommodating it. The Code also  serves to raise the awareness of  the various stakeholder groups  in regard to environmental  management aspects.  Patronage and sponsorship The OHL Groups commitment to the communities with which it is associated is expressed through its contribution  towards the promotion of cultural actions connected with the visual and the performing arts, as well as through others  that stimulate economic and social development and, in general, with its participation in educational, technological and  sports initiatives. 20% 29% 51% Sponsorship and Patronage  Breakdown by Area Culture Socioeconomic development Sport 13% 38% 3% 21% 25% OHL Group Sponsorship and  Patronage 2011 by country Spain Brazil Mexico Chzech Rep. USA During 2011, a total of  5,437,672.42 was earmarked  to sponsorship and patronage  actions, 10% less than in the  previous financial year. This  reorientation of the OHL Group  strategy is in response to the  current economic situation, which  gives higher priority to projects  targeting the less privileged  groups in society in comparison  to other kinds of projects. Aware  of the role the company plays in  society, the efforts of the Group  have been redirected towards the  most vulnerable members of the  communities where it operates  on a stable basis. Accordingly,  the resources for community  involvement projects have gone  from representing 19% of the total  resources earmarked to society in  2010, to 26% in 2011.  >> Cultural promotion OHL supports entities concerned with the promotion of culture,  with particular interest in the performing and visual arts, music  and the humanities, making cultural experiences more accessible  to less-privileged persons and approximating cultural values and  knowledge to society in general. In 2011, 2,757,000 euros were  budgeted for support to cultural activities in Spain and abroad.

In 2011, 1,584,000 euros were earmarked to development and social and  economic progress through a range of initiatives, among which the Volvo-OHL Brasil Forum stands out.  A benchmark for the World Health Organization: Volvo-OHL  Forum  The Volvo-OHL Road Safety Forum 2011, organized by OHL Brasil  on June 15, 2011 in Brasilia, took place as one of the benchmark  activities for the WHO in the launching of its initiative Decade of  Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, which commenced in the month  of May with the objective of reducing the number of traffic fatalities.  The Forum, organized around the theme -How can Brazil take  advantage of the decade of action for road safety-, offered a cross- sectoral debate following two kick-off talks given by Eric Howard, road  safety consultant of the World Bank, and by Pere Navarro, Director  General of Traffic of the Government of Spain.

In this new annual CSR  Reporting process, we have  decided to adopt a fresh focus,  by presenting the advances  achieved from the point of view  of our strategy, whereby we have  organized the Report by following  the structure of the OHL Groups  CSR Master Plan 2010-2014. In  this way, by connecting strategy  with communication, we wish  to strengthen the coherence of  OHLs CSR approach and to have  our stakeholders participate to a  greater extent in this approach. The OHL Group Annual Sustainability Report is our main communication link with all of our stakeholders. This  Report contains OHLs most relevant sustainability information and sets forth the companys progress and  achievements pursuant to our commitment to ongoing improvement. For this reason, we strive to state our  commitments, strategies and performance with the highest degree of representativity, quality and clarity possible,  using the latest CSR reporting trends and standards. The OHL Group has been  publishing its CSR and  sustainability Report annually  since the 2003 financial year.  This Report has been prepared  and validated in accordance  with the recommendations  of the Global Reporting  Initiatives Sustainability  Reporting Guidelines, version  G3, obtaining an A+ level of  application.  Moreover, the  Report takes into account  the principles of inclusivity,  materiality and responsiveness,  set out in the latest version  of the AA1000 standard,  inclusive of the AA1000APS  Accountability Principles (2008)  and the AA1000AS Sustainability  Assurance Standard (2008). In  addition, the Report provides  information on compliance with  the principles of the United  Nations Global Compact and  Millennium Development Goals. The preparation of this Report  falls within the province of the  Corporate Social Responsibility  Service, answering to the  Corporate General Management  of the OHL Group through the  Innovation and Sustainability  Department. Coverage The information presented in  this Report on a consolidated  basis has been contributed by all  of the companies, subsidiaries  and production centers of the  Group, specifically: Focuses of activity and strategic goals of the CSR Master Plan Focus of activity Strategic goal CSR management To provide the Group with the management structure and the tools necessary in  order to strengthen its commitment to sustainability Shareholders and investors To generate value through the Groups commitment to sustainability, solvency,  transparency and credibility  Employees To consolidate a corporate culture shared by all employees and based on  respect, integration, trust, loyalty,  transparency and security, in such a way that  OHL will be, in any country in the world, a good place to work  Customers To convey to customers the value of the OHL Groups global commitment to  sustainable development,  integrity and excellence in the performance of the  business  Supply chain To become familiar with, control and establish relationships of cooperation in  terms of sustainability with the Groups supply chain  Community To contribute, on the basis of premises of responsibility and respect, towards  the improvement of the quality of life of the individuals and the communities  with whom the Group interrelates.

These joint  businesses are considered  by the Group from a financial  perspective, for which reason  they are included within the  scope of the Report insofar as  their significant aspects. Those  entities or businesses over which  the company does not exercise  control, on its own or together  with other shareholders, are not  included within the scope. All of the information provided  in this Report is sourced from  the centers within the scope  indicated above. In cases where  the coverage of the Report  differs from the foregoing  dimension, the relevant specific  scope is indicated in a note, to  ensure an accurate and reliable  interpretation thereof. Figures referring to previous  financial years are also included  in the Report to make it possible  to see the trend of the Group  over time. However, it should  be noted that these figures are  not always synonymous with  performance, particularly in the  case of environment, where the  environmental aspects derived  from each business activity vary  completely, depending on the  specific kind of project involved.  System for the capturing,  validation and consolidation  of CSR figures  In order to meet its corporate  CSR reporting and monitoring  needs, the OHL Group has  specific software for the capturing  and consolidation of data. Participation in the CSR  Reporting on 2011 included 164  users, 88 subsidiaries, branches  and centers, and a response was  given to 691 indicators, grouped  into 84 questionnaires referring  to the 14 CSR areas. Training and dialog sessions  are held yearly with those users  who wish to participate through a  multi-conference and connection  to the software. The purpose  of these sessions is to review  the use and the possibilities of  the software, to comment on  the most frequent errors and  shortfalls detected in previous  campaigns and to enable users  to raise any questions they may  have.  In 2011, 33 users participated  in the training session held in the  month of November. Moreover,  the shared forum available in this  tool was opened in 2011, and the  frequently asked questions have  been included together with their  respective answers.

The survey project was carried  out in two stages:  The first stage took place at  the end of 2010 and targeted  the employees of all of the  divisions of the OHL Group, the  customers of OHL Concesiones,  OHL Construccin and OHL  Desarrollos in Spain, Mexico  and Brazil and the social benefit  organizations and scientific  and technological centers  associated with the Groups  environment in these three  operating divisions and in the  three countries mentioned  above.  The results obtained and  the actions taken by OHL in  response to the relevant issues  identified, where the Group  had a greater opportunity for  improvement according to the  players surveyed, are described  in the chapters devoted to these  stakeholder groups:   Chapter 2: Managing  sustainability at OHL  Chapter 4: A shared culture  Chapter 5: Forward-looking  infrastructures  Chapter 8: Contributing  to wealth and to social  wellbeing  The second survey stage  was carried out at the end of  2011 and involved suppliers  and subcontractors of OHL  Construccin and OHL Industrial  in Spain, as well as investors  and analysts in Mexico, Spain  In 2010, the OHL Group  decided to shift the focus of the  surveys of stakeholder groups that  it had been carrying out yearly  since 2006, in order to include in  the surveys the important changes  being introduced by the company  in its management of CSR. OHL  felt that the strategic change in  focus marked by the Corporate  Social Responsibility Master Plan  2010-2014 required appropriate  verification of the information with  these groups, in order to ensure  an alignment with their demands.  Consequently, to the usual aim of  ascertaining the expectations of  our stakeholders through surveys,  on this occasion we added the  dimension of evaluating the  adequacy of the strategic lines of  the Master Plan for meeting such  expectations.  Targets of the OHL Group  stakeholder survey 2010-2011:  Identification of the  expectations of the stakeholder  groups, as well as of the main  reputational risks perceived.  Analysis of expectations and  perceptions and a comparison  of these with those identified  previously by OHL.  Proposal for adjusting the  existing strategic lines, if  appropriate. The OHL Group considers as its  main stakeholder groups:  Employees – Customers  – Infrastructure users –  Shareholders and investors  and analysts – Suppliers -  Community –Scientific and  technological bodies – NGOs. and Brazil. The objectives  set by the company in this  case were the same as in the  previous stage, and the survey  methodology consisted of  ad hoc interviews and  questionnaires with a view  to obtaining a high degree  of representativity. This  second stage succeeded  in involving more than 80  participants, among suppliers  or subcontractors and investors  and analysts of the Group. With respect to the survey of  suppliers and subcontractors,  we should note that some of  the issues they marked as  relevant coincided with those  identified in the survey of  employees, customers and  social benefit organizations,  as well as with the priorities of  OHL. The company is aware that  the management of the supply  chain is a matter of crucial  relevance, particularly those  aspects that are connected  with the dimension of Human  Rights management and  compliance.  In this regard, and  as has been mentioned in this  Report, the company approved  its Responsible Procurement  Policy in December 2011,  thereby aligning itself with the   principal demands of this group  of stakeholders in light of the  results of the survey.   The information on the  outcomes of these surveys and  the actions planned by OHL  for 2012 can be found in the  relevant chapters:  Chapter 2: Managing  sustainability at OHL  Chapter 3: Value creation  through commitment  Chapter 6: OHL and its  suppliers: together in  facing the challenge of  sustainability In 2010, the OHL Group shifted the focus of the stakeholder surveys that  it had been carrying out since 2006, in order to include the significant  changes the Company has introduced into its CSR management The second  stage of the  OHL survey of  its stakeholder  groups  focused on  suppliers and  subcontractors. Employees and customers were the  preferred target of OHLs first survey  of stakeholders, made at the end of  2010. In the photo, toll collector and  user of a Mexican toll road.

These advances provide  a response to the demand  expressed both by customers,  as well as by the social benefit,  environmental and scientific and  technological organizations with  which the Group cooperates,  in the survey made at the end  of 2010, in which these groups  requested OHL to communicate  its annual progress in CSR in a  more concise, clear and agile  manner and in more dynamic and  navegatable formats. All of the documents  comprising the OHL Group Annual  Report are distributed in Spanish  and English. Verification In order to offer the most  complete, transparent and  rigorous communication possible,  the OHL Group submits the  content of its Sustainability  Report and its adaptation to the  GRI G3 Guidelines to a number  of verification and control  processes, both internal as well  as external.

Chapter 8 Dissemination The OHL Group Annual  Sustainability Report is the  companys main communication  link with all of its stakeholder  groups and is also offered as  a source of documentation for  analysis and evaluation by experts  in CSR, both on the domestic as  well as the international level. The  Report contains the bulk of OHLs  sustainability communication  and reflects the transformations  experienced by the company in  this regard. For this reason, in  2011, we decided to include the  process of strategic immersion  which, from the CSR perspective,  is being developed by OHL, more  clearly in the Report content.  This decision brings with it  the focalization of the effort  towards a working methodology  more closely adapted to the  needs of the company, of its  stakeholders and of the social and  environmental context in which it  operates.  The Sustainability Report has  gone on to be structured around  the Groups CSR Master Plan  and has a strong impact on the  progress made in the line of work  contained in the Plan. Likewise, an  effort has been made to reinforce  the accessibility of information  (from the point of view of clarity  and the degree of thoroughness  with which the contents are set  out and to pursue in depth those  matters that may be of greater  relevance to OHLs stakeholders.  Starting this year, the  OHL Sustainability  Report is available  online.
