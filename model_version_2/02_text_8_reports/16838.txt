Contribution to Global Sustainable Development Protect Ecological Environment and Human Health Penshibao product can obviously improve disease resistance of crops and reduce  diseases of crops as well as reduce about 20 ml of pesticides dosage per  mu(1mu=0.0667 hectares). Tests of 9 crops in 19 sites conducted by the National  Agro-tech Extension and Service Center, affiliated to the Ministry of Agriculture of  China showed that after the application of Penshibao products, the disease-resistant  effective rates of rice, soybean, cucumber and maize   were 84.13%; 75.32%,  81.65% and 59.33% respectively; which indicated that Penshibao products can  effectively protect the ecological environment of croplands and human health as  well as promote agricultural sustainable development. 100 80 60 40 20 0 Reduce the Pollution to  Cropland and protect the  Arable Soil W h e n u s i n g a c e t o c h l o r,  people can add Penshibao  product of 20-30ml per mu,  which can decrease 57.6-73.8%  of the acetochlor residual in  soil; therefore Penshibao  product can efficiently reduce  the pollution to croplands and  protect the arable soil. 1.4.2.3.

Disaster-Preventing  Effect Help Rice Resist the Disaster  of Low Temperature and Rotten  Seedling  After the seed soaked with  Penshibao product, the proline  content of rice will be increased  and the rice will have the  resistance to the disaster of low  temperature and rotten seedling  during sowing time. Drought-Resistant Effect of Wheat  After the application of Penshibao product, the wheats all embody obvious  drought resistance in the semiarid condition(18% water content) or arid  condition(10% water content); their root shoot ratio increases 17.6% and 5.3%  respectively; from the point of the physiology, big root shoot ratio helps to  relieve drought stress. This fact proves that Penshibao foliar fertilizers can  effectively enhance the drought resistance of wheats through adjusting the root  shoot ratio after the seeds are soaked with Penshibao foliar fertilizers.

All the  aforementioned facts indicate that if the wheats are processed with Penshibao foliar  fertilizers after suffering from the dry and hot wind disaster, their effective  panicles, ten-thousand-grain weight and production can be increased; therefore  Penshibao foliar fertilizer has the good effect on helping wheat resist the dry and  hot wind disaster.
